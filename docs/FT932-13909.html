			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Volvo faces anger over management style MR PEHR Gyllenhammar, the Volvo chief, will confront more than the ire of small shareholders over executive pay when he stands up at the company's annual meeting in Gothenburg today. He will also face questions which go the heart of his long stewardship of the Swedish vehicle maker. Aktiespararna, the Swedish shareholders' association, has attracted much attention, particularly in the local media, for its campaign to force Volvo to disclose how much Mr Gyllenhammar receives in pay and benefits, as well as how much he agreed to pay Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive, and the size of the 'golden handshake' paid last year to Mr Christer Zetterberg, Mr Gyll's predecessor. However, the shareholders' association, whose 65,000 individual members held some 10 per cent of Volvo according to a survey three years ago, is voicing deeper concerns about the company which amount to a public questioning not just of Mr Gyllenhammar's autocratic style of management, but of his management strategies. Mr Lars-Erik Forsgardh, managing director of Aktiespararna, says the first two questions out of five that his association has demanded of the Volvo board concern the future of Volvo's three-year alliance with Renault, the state-controlled French car and truck maker, and its plans for Procordia, the pharmaceuticals and food group in which Volvo is the largest shareholder. Aktiespararna supported the Renault link but says it is now unclear what the strategy is. Volvo owns 20 per cent of Renault with the right to increase to 25 per cent. Renault owns about 10 per cent of the Volvo parent company, 25 per cent of Volvo cars and 45 per cent of Volvo trucks. There are fears in Sweden that Renault might take over Volvo's loss-making vehicle divisions. Mr Gyllenhammar also led a bid last year to merge Volvo with Procordia but was blocked by the Swedish government, the other main shareholder. A deal with the state left Volvo as the largest shareholder with an option to acquire a majority stake. But Mr Forsgardh says it is unclear what Volvo intends next in what had appeared to be a strategic shift away from its traditional business. Mr Gyllenhammar is expected to try to blunt the shareholders' attack by disclosing some details of his remuneration for the first time. Anger over his perks - which supposedly include mansions, private jets and New York hotel suites - has been fuelled by a background of heavy losses at Volvo last year, and an unprecedented 50 per cent cut in the annual dividend. No doubt there is a serious issue over the secrecy that has surrounded executive remuneration at Volvo. Aktiespararna is campaigning for Swedish companies to be forced to disclose such details, along the lines now required in the UK. 'These situations would not have arisen if there had been a remuneration committee at Volvo - or if the board had taken up the issue,' says Mr Forsgardh. 'The real issue is who should make the decisions at Volvo.'</p>

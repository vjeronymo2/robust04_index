			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Books: The potter who became a legend - JH Plumb enters the world of Josiah Wedgwood; manufacturer, inventor, and letter-writer supreme JOSIAH WEDGWOOD by Robin Reilly Macmillan Pounds 20.00, 412 pages JOSIAH Wedgwood was not only at ease with himself and captivated by his job in life - to make and sell pots - but also confident of his destiny and certain of his success. He relished his wife, delighted in her pregnancies, and viewed his growing brood with immense satisfaction. He knew how to make friends as well as pots: Richard Bentley, Joseph Wright, Joseph Priestley, John Flaxman, Erasmus Darwin, Matthew Boulton, Tom Byerly, and many more. Of course, he did not escape blows of fate: the terrible trouble with his leg, which had to be amputated; the terrifying fear of bankruptcy which, from time to time, haunted the early years of capital-intensive expansion; the perplexing dilemmas of the revolt of the American colonies and the French Revolution; and, in old age, the growing certainty that his children were unlikely to live up to his expectations. They became ladies and gentlemen, not potters. Yet, even at the worst of times Wedgwood glowed with optimism; his eupeptic charactor reasserted itself with ease and hope was his second nature. Combined with his exuberant character were exceptional skills - he was an administrator of originality, a dedicated and persistent inventor, an advertiser of genius, and an incomparable letter-writer. He enjoyed so seductive a personality that he burst through the constraints of class as easily as Dr Johnson. Surely there can be few better subjects for a biographer? He found no Boswell during his life, no GO Trevelyan as did Macaulay - only Eliza Meteyard. Her two volumes in 1865-6 were lengthy and just short of verbosity, adulatory almost to the point of absurdity, and partially blind to the world in which Wedgwood succeeded. Nevertheless, her work remains Wedgwood's major biography. Oddly enough, Wedgwood created a difficult biographical problem. His letters to Richard Bentley, his invaluable partner and his key to the world of fashion and sophistication, are as splendid in their way as Boswell's or Horace Walpole's. They are as good as those of any 18th century writer, glowing with a rare intensity because Wedgwood was keenly aware of his own ignorance and just as keen to abolish it. Bentley gave him a sense of security and of a world beyond his ken. Bentley guided him in religion, politics and the aims of society. At the same time, Bentley was a man of considerable taste, at home in the arts but with a sharp sense of what might sell. Indeed, they fitted each other like a lock and key. Letters such as Wedgwood's to Bentley are very rare - indeed, almost non-existent: articulate manufacturers are far rarer than four-leaf clovers. So, there is always a problem for any would-be biographer: to avoid relying too much on them. To some extent, Reilly avoids this trap, but not entirely: the 11 years of Bentley's friendship dominate his book. Wedgwood's life cannot, of course, be written in strict chronological order if one is to evaluate properly his influence on England's developing economy or to assess how revolutionary or not were his methods and inventions. How far was he a pioneer of consumerism? Did his concern with technology, from canals to thermometers, energise by their example the Industrial Revolution? Reilly's solution of the problem is to interweave themes and chronology sensibly enough, although sometimes it makes the book very uneven. Except when dealing with purely ceramic matters, and the relationship between Wedgwood and other Staffordshire potters or family matters, Reilly is insecure. His better chapters - like that on Competition and the Market, or The Lunatics and Other Enlightened Friends - are depend fundamentally on others. For the first, he draws heavily on Neil McKendrick's work of 25 years ago although, given half a chance, he will rap McKendrick's knuckles for factual errors from which he himself is far from immune. He is more generous to Robert Schofield, whose work on the Lunar Society is the basis of the other. Some chapters are very thin. Unfortunately, too, Reilly does not possess a facile pen; his style is wooden and his prose leaden. Nevertheless, I recommend you to read this book. In it, you will recognise so much of a world you might have thought alien to our own.</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / No script yet for urgent dialogue: Talks between the government and Islamic fundamentalists might staunch Algeria's violence The moment of truth is fast approaching for Algeria's military and civilian leaders. The extension of the mandate of the five-man presidency for a month has provided a breathing space in which to try to curb civil strife, chart a path to democracy and implement economic reform. If it fails, the violence which has engulfed the country for the past two years could escalate and spread. Western governments are urging their nationals to leave the country. Sixteen foreigners have been killed since Islamic extremists set a November 30 deadline for non-nationals to leave the country or face reprisals. Worsening unrest could eventually spill over into neighbouring Morocco and Tunisia, while southern European countries, which buy increasing quantities of natural gas from Algeria, also fear the impact of continued political disorder on the estimated 2m Algerians who live in their midst. Violence has claimed more than 3,000 lives in Algeria since January 1992, when the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was outlawed after elections - which it seemed certain to win - were suspended. The capital Algiers and surrounding provinces remain under a curfew imposed by the ruling five-man High State Council. In an increasingly violent campaign against the government, radical Islamic groups not directly affiliated to the FIS have killed leading intellectuals; the state security forces have responded by a 'systematic' recourse to torture, according to Amnesty International. Western diplomats say it is difficult to distinguish between racketeering and acts of sabotage committed by both sides - public buildings and factories have been set on fire in what they describe as 'a dirty war'. Ultimately, the fate of the country remains in the hands of a small group of army generals, as it has since independence in 1962. The collapse of support for the government has forced the army centre stage. General Khaled Nezzar, a leading member of the HCE has played a role in avoiding an open split among senior officers, such as the chief of staff, General Mohamed Lamari, who would like to 'eradicate' the fundamentalists, and the minister of defence, General Lamine Zeroual, who insists that the army's role is to help forge a national consensus. Other fault-lines exist between older officers and a younger generation which has little respect for what it sees as the corruption endemic among long-serving officers. While none of the five-man presidency accepts the idea of an Islamic republic being set up in the country, there is an increasing awareness that the FIS represents a constituency that can no longer be ignored. Hopes of a dialogue were raised earlier this month when Gen Zeroual's most senior adviser called, on state television, for 'a dialogue with figures who once represented the FIS, on condition they had not broken the law'. Last Friday, the FIS spokesman in Europe, Mr Rabah Khebir, responded by setting out conditions for opening talks. They include the freeing of all political prisoners and the establishment of a 'free and independent committee' to include the main political, judicial and religious figures in Algeria to discuss the country's future. Most of the other lay parties and the moderate Islamic Hamas party agree with Mr Khebir that establishing a dialogue is the only way to avoid further political and economic disintegration. But there is little support for the government. Deep-seated resentment at a quarter of a century of dictatorship by the Front de Liberation National Party, and the economic mismanagement and corruption it left in its wake last year, is rife among the professional classes, skilled workers and millions of ordinary Algerians who have no wish to live under the rule of Islamic shari'a law. The generation to which Prime Minister Redha Malek, another crucial member of the HCE, belongs has refused to hand over any political power to a younger generation of Algerians, many of whom were educated abroad. Tens of thousands have gone into de facto exile, while few of those who remained have had a chance to argue their views or help plan economic liberalisation. The bold economic changes launched in 1989-91, which abolished the state's monopoly on foreign trade and opened Algeria to foreign investment, went into reverse when the elections were suspended. The state's trade monopoly was reimposed under a former economic overlord of the 1970s, Mr Belaid Abdessalam, who became prime minister in June 1992, and relations with the International Monetary Fund were broken off. The resurrection of the man who had earlier boasted he would turn Algeria into the 'Japan of Africa' by 2000 convinced many that the government had no real wish to push through reforms which would spell an end to the considerable material advantages enjoyed by a few in a closed economy. The factors which fuelled the large FIS vote two years ago have not changed. Eighty-four per cent of those seeking a job are between 15 and 30; one quarter of the population is out of work; living standards are declining as inflation rises by 30 per cent yearly and shortages get worse; schools and houses are overcrowded. Many Algerians refer to their rulers routinely as 'houkkoumat Micky' (Mickey Mouse government). Unlike Mr Abdessalam, Mr Malek, who took over as prime minister in August, is committed to a market-oriented economy. Preliminary negotiations have begun with the IMF to loosen the noose of repayments of Algeria's Dollars 26bn foreign debt, which will absorb 83 per cent of total export earnings for 1993, 97 per cent of which derive from oil. Yet Algeria's western creditors remain sceptical of the present leaders' ability to enact reform. They are seeking trade liberalisation and a big devaluation of the dinar, which fetches three times its official rate on the black market. But any hopes of an economic renaissance hinge on civil strife being brought to an end. The temporary withdrawal of representatives of foreign companies in Algeria is a serious blow to the government's credibility and to the economy because so many of them are involved in the oil and gas sector. However, a dialogue between the FIS and the presidency might not in itself put an end to violence because several radicals groups on both sides of the political spectrum, in particular the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) which has claimed responsibility for the 26 foreigners killed since September, might seek to sabotage talks. The past three years have also divided the FIS, whose leaders are in jail or in hiding or in exile. Some of Algeria's key western economic partners, such as the US, have accepted that an FIS election victory would not have led to the establishment of democracy because many of the front's leaders made no secret of their contempt for the ballot box. They claimed that a victory at the poll would be a mandate from God. In the words of one western diplomat, Algeria today is 'a test tube baby'. However difficult it may be to begin a dialogue, such a course appears to many Algerians and foreign observers to offer the only glimmer of hope. Harsher repression of the fundamentalists could bring the risk of civil war nearer.</p>

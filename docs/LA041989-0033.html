"I gained about 10 pounds. We had steaks, prime rib and  lobster just about every day."  </P> <P> Wilhite was the first county high school basketball player to sign with a  National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division I school since the beginning of the  spring signing period Wednesday.  </P> <P> Add recruiting: Granite Hills point guard Mark Phillips, who was recruited  locally by Christian Heritage College, has signed a national letter of intent  to play at Cedarville (Ohio) College, an NAIA school.  </P> <P> Phillips, 5-feet-11, averaged 16.8 points a game last season.  </P> <P> Last add recruiting: Beau Pack, an All-City Eastern League basketball player  for Point Loma, has signed a letter of intent to play for Chapman College in  Orange, his father said .  </P> <P> Jim Pack said his son, a 6-5 forward, selected Division II Chapman because of  its sports medicine program and the fact that Bob Boyd, former USC coach, has  just taken over the basketball program.  </P> <P> Weber State, Irvine and Pacific were among other schools that expressed  interest in Pack, Jim Pack said.  </P> <P> High School Notes  </P> <P> Jerome Price of University City leads the state with a long jump of 24-4 3/4. .  . . Joe Temple of Lincoln high jumped 6-5 Thursday in his first effort of the  season, missing his personal best by one inch.  </P></p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / As They say in Europe: A Titanic sinking on the rugby field There is reason to believe that today could be marked by extraordinary, even catastrophic, events. If France lose their final match in the five nations' rugby championship against Scotland this afternoon, there is fair chance the team will be wiped out by a public driven beyond all reasonable levels of tolerance. Even more amazing will be the sight of the French sports writers disappearing en masse in a flash of spontaneous combustion, or flinging themselves from the highest point of the Murrayfield stadium in Edinburgh. There will be different motives. The commentators on the France-Inter radio station will be enraged by the unfairness of it all. Their reporting of the (losing) game against England in Paris a fortnight ago was enlivened, for me, by the succession of invisible fouls committed by English players, and by a total ignorance of rule 13 which the referee (rightly) used to stop Thierry Lacroix having a second go at a conversion attempt when the ball had fallen over. 'We are all Europeans and therefore impartial, but really . . . ' said Eric somebody or other into his microphone. The game also 'appeared' entirely different because, in the mouths of the commentary team, the distinctly unandrogynous England hooker, Brian Moore, emerged as Brie-Anne Morre, surely an American hooker. In the newspapers, however, there was no feeling that France were victims. The French writers decided, unanimously, that there was just one problem: their team was no good. This was not just a matter of losing against moderate opposition, nor of failing to play up to expected standards. It was a failure of cosmic proportions - a sinking of the Titanic on the rugby field. It was the kind of failure of which the former - and much-maligned - England soccer manager, Graham Taylor, could only dream. There were hints of catastrophe in earlier matches. The wide but insubstantial victory over Ireland at Paris's Parc des Princes in the first match raised doubts. Defeat by Wales in Cardiff rang alarm bells. 'Le feu rouge,' shouted L'Equipe on its front page. This play on words meant either Welsh fire or a red traffic light. After that match, coach Pierre Berbizier commented: 'I preferred today's defeat to the victory of two years ago. I know how we were beaten, but not how we won last time here.' That was a hostage to fortune. For, by the time England arrived in Paris, the press wanted no more understandable defeats but a victory. Especially against a side that always beat them, especially at home. Disaster struck: France were beaten 18-14. On page one, L'Equipe shouted: 'Change all this for us.' Page two was headlined 'The great fiasco', while the newspaper declared the French XV to be brain-dead on page three under a headline that read: 'The encephelogram is flat.' Midi-Olympique was relatively phlegmatic: 'France is passing through its worst crisis since the second world war,' it said, before asking: 'How has France fallen so low?' It then opened what it called 'The burning dossiers of tricolour rugby.' In the nation's rugby capital, Toulouse, La Depeche du dimanche began its report: 'This new defeat by England undoubtedly marks the end of a team which, decidedly, has nothing more to give, not the savoir-faire, nor the indispensable success at this level.' It concluded: 'At the end of such a mediocre, yet poignant, match, it is not appropriate to put forward ideas; a delirium of destruction cannot be avoided.' The 'poignancy' of the match came in the way England played. It consisted of everything that arouses Gallic scorn, admiration and resentment. England were boring, disciplined, resolute, unimaginative. A former national fullback, Pierre Villepreux, wrote in Liberation: 'The English had no doubts, even when France were dominant. They played on a tactical base which they fully mastered . . . a game which brought together their culture and education.' In a typically Marxist interpretation of rugby, Villepreux concluded that what counted was a unity of practice and tactics - something the French lacked entirely. There is a new team for today which excludes Olivier Roumat, the captain against England, Wales and Ireland. L'Equipe proclaimed: 'It is not yet the Regency, nor is it the end of the Empire.' There has been no 'delirium of destruction,' though. Thierry Lacroix, whose missed kicks probably cost France victory two weeks ago, said he was prepared for anything. 'We've been slaughtered by the press and television all week,' he said. But the critics are keeping their powder dry. After all, if Wales beat England, as they will, and France beat a Scottish XV missing its best player, scrum-half Gary Armstrong, as they will, France will finish second this afternoon. Not bad for a side 'without aggression, will or imagination'. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / The New Economic Order: Many teachers, not much teaching Education, most economists agree, has played a critical role in east Asia in achieving economic growth and reducing wealth inequalities. Not so in Latin America where in the last decade - partly because of budget stringency following the debt crisis - school systems have deteriorated. Latin America on average scores reasonably well in the resources it devotes to education. In 1990, South Korea channeled 3.6 per cent of gross national product to education, Singapore 3.4 per cent and Malaysia 6.9 per cent, according to the United Nations Development Programme. That compares with 4.1 per cent in Venezuela and Mexico, 5.5 per cent in Panama and 4.6 per cent in Brazil. But the problem is not so much the amount of money spent, but the way it is spent. All over Latin America, teachers are political appointees, many not even meeting minimum standards of literacy. In Argentina, says Mr Juan Llach, economic planning secretary, 'the number of people teaching is very small compared with the number of teachers'. Furthermore, while most economists argue that primary level education yields the greatest economic and social benefit, the returns to politicians of devoting large-scale resources to further education are often higher. 'The average quality of Latin America's primary education is very poor,' said Mr Sebastian Edwards, the World Bank's chief Latin America economist, in a report last year. One international comparative study of the reading abilities of nine-year-olds found that Venezuelan students ranked last. 'This unhappy combination' of neglected primary education and heavily subsidised higher education 'has had serious regressive distributive effects, reducing the resources available to the poor, leaving illiteracy rampant,' he said. Venezuela's ministry of education is by far the country's largest employer. Mr Gustavo Marquez, a professor at IESA, a private university in Caracas, says that the share of the education budget spent on administration and planning rose from just under 30 per cent in 1980 to 43 per cent in 1991. Rising enrolment has usually not been matched by an increase in resources. Spending per child in Latin America fell by an average 28 per cent in the 1980s, according to the World Bank. With spending on books, equipment and teacher training also falling, many children drop out or retake classes - giving Latin America the highest repetition rates in the world.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS--Alexey Kazannik, the former  Russian prosecutor general, confirmed his resignation at a  meeting of the Federation Council on Friday. Speaker of the  upper chamber Vladimir Shumeyko said that this ends the dispute  over the prosecutor general.    The Federation Council snubbed the Russian president on  Thursday by reinstating Kazannik as the prosecutor general which  it could not do as Kazannik was not nominated by Boris Yeltsin.  According to the Constitution, it is the Federation Council  which appoints the prosecutor, but the candidate is to be  nominated by the president.    Kazannik resigned after freeing anti-Yeltsin rebels  according  to the Duma-proclaimed amnesty and Yeltsin accepted his  resignation. The president then appointed Alexey Ilyushenko as  acting prosecutor general. After the Federation Council refused  to sack Kazannik, Georgiy Satarov, a Yeltsin's aide, said the  decision did not mean that he would be reinstated. Ilyushenko  would remain acting prosecutor general, according to him. Most  observers said the decision of the upper chamber was based on  political grounds, not on juridical ones.</p>

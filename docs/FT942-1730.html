			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UN backs French troop deployment in Rwanda: Security Council reluctantly approves deployment France will begin sending troops into Rwanda today after the United Nations Security Council last night agreed on their deployment to protect civilians until an adequate UN force can be mobilised for the task. The council acted with some reluctance on the plan for independent deployment of French-led troops. The resolution did not mention France by name, speaking only of a temporary multinational operation 'under national command and control'. Ten of the 15 members voted for the plan. Brazil, China, New Zealand, Nigeria and Pakistan abstained. Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, said in Paris that France would deploy 2,000 to 2,500 troops, 1,500 of them flown from bases in Africa. He said Senegal had agreed to send troops along with France, and Italy was considering sending up to 500 soldiers. The mission, according to the UN resolution, will be strictly humanitarian and 'conducted in an impartial and neutral fashion'. The troops will 'not constitute an inter-position force' between the warring parties. But Mr Claude Dusaidi, UN representative of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, was unconvinced. Shortly before the vote, he accused France of trying to block an insurgent victory in the civil war: 'We shall resist French intervention with all the means at our disposal.' The rebels' opposition was a factor cited by members who abstained on the French proposal. French officials said their troops would seek to protect pockets of Tutsis in the western part of Rwanda held by the mainly Hutu government forces. Mr Leotard said he had given his troops 'very precise instructions to avoid any confrontation with the (rebel) forces'. Mr Eduard Balladur, the prime minister, told the National Assembly France could count on the military participation of Senegal and hoped for at least logistic help from several European countries. He said he had been in contact with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, who has made Italian military participation conditional on the agreement of both sides in the Rwanda conflict. France also had the 'active political and logistic support' of the US, Mr Balladur said. The operation is mandated for two months. It could be less if Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, manages to bring the small UN force in Rwanda up to strength sooner than that. His strong backing for the French initiative was critical to its success in the council. Members were also influenced by his warning that it could take up to three months for the projected 5,500-man all-African UN force to be fully deployed. Lack of equipment and logistic support, as well as training needs, are largely responsible for the delay. The Russian delegate said before the vote that a multinational humanitarian mission now was imperative and the representative of Djibouti said: 'Anything would be better that what exists.'</p>

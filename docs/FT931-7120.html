			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Kantor asks EC for talks on Airbus MR Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday said he has asked for consultations with the EC over Airbus subsidies and intends to seek assurances that loans made to the consortiums are being repaid on schedule. Although the Clinton administration has reassured the EC that it will hold to the bilateral Airbus agreement, reached last July, a series of public statements by both President Bill Clinton and Mr Kantor have demonstrated the administration's continuing preoccupation with Airbus, as conditions in the US aerospace industry have worsened. In the last month the US industry has announced thousands of job losses at McDonnell Douglas, Boeing and Pratt &amp; Whitney. The president raised his concerns about Airbus at a lunch on Wednesday with Mr John Major, the British prime minister. He also told Boeing workers last Monday that he hoped it was not 'too late' to counter the alleged Dollars 26bn (Pounds 18.3bn) in subsidies paid by the Airbus governments. Mr Kantor made the consultation request in a radio interview yesterday. Under the Airbus pact, the two sides are supposed to meet bi-annually, but they have yet to do so. The agreement also prohibits future production supports and limits funding for aircraft development to 33 per cent of total development costs. The agreement also established strict terms and conditions for the repayment of development funds advanced by governments. According to the US trade representative's office, interest rates on the funds must be set at close to market levels, which are 'significantly higher than those charged in the past by Airbus governments'. The pact had strict 'transparency' requirements. It said the EC would have to make available a complete list of funds disbursed or committed, information on repayment, and any changes in commitments which make conditions 'more favourable to Airbus'. In yesterday's interview, Mr Kantor continued the provocative tone which the administration - like the Congress - has been taking towards the EC since coming to power. 'The Europeans,' he said, 'have screamed like pigs stuck under a gate' in response to 'fairly mild' US actions taken to open markets. He also said he would meet again with Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner in charge of trade, next month. Mr Kantor said he is studying legislation announced on Wednesday by Senators Max Baucus and John Danforth, which would bring dumping and countervailing duty complaints against Airbus. It would also take a leaf from the book of the Airbus partners by helping to finance a consortium to develop the next generation of US aircraft. Senator Baucus said the US government would not stand by while the largest US export industry 'falls victim to a European aerospace industry that would not even exist if it were not for the treasuries of France, Spain, Germany and the UK.' Nothing in the bilateral Airbus pact restricts the rights of US producers' to file unfair trade cases. If they do, however, the EC can - after consultations - terminate the Airbus agreement. Furthermore, any cases brought by the US industry would risk alienating European customers Such a course of action would still not affect the sale of subsidised Airbus aircraft to the rest of the world.</p>

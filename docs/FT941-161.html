			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / House prices up 2.8% on year House prices on average rose 0.6 per cent last month compared with February, said Nationwide, Britain's second-largest building society, Andrew Taylor writes. It said yesterday that the average price of a UK house had risen by 2.8 per cent to Pounds 53,751 since March 1993. Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations director, said: 'There is little sign that tax increases due to take effect in April are having an influence on the housing-market recovery. 'Market turnover in the early part of the year is up substantially on the same period of 1993 while current indications are that the stronger trend in mortgage lending apparent over recent months is being maintained,' he said.</p>

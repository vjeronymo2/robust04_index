			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> SEN. TORRES SAYS HE IS ALCOHOLIC, HAS FINISHED TREATMENT PROGRAM  </P> <P> State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), an influential political leader in the  California Latino community, said last month that he is an alcoholic and has  completed a 25-day treatment program.  </P> <P> Torres, 43, widely considered one of the brightest and most energetic members  of the Legislature, said he realized after his second arrest on a drunk-driving  charge that he is suffering from alcoholism.  </P> <P> "I am a recovering alcoholic," Torres said in an interview with the Los Angeles  Times. "I thought I could control it by myself, but this is a disease that you  can't control by yourself. I wasn't willing to admit that I had a problem."  </P> <P> The East Los Angeles Democrat said that three days after the Legislature  adjourned Sept. 15 he enrolled as a day patient in Starting Point in  Sacramento. He said he attended therapy sessions for 25 days and returned home  at night and on weekends.  </P> <P> Torres said he attends meetings of a self-help group as part of his recovery.  He said drinking did not impair his performance as a legislator.  </P> <P> "I know that it didn't affect my performance," Torres said.  </P> <P> Torres, elected to the Assembly in 1974 and to the Senate in 1982, has been  considered a rising political star in California and has been mentioned as a  potential candidate for governor.  </P> <P> In the Oct. 25 interview in his Capitol office, Torres said he has not yet  assessed the political impact of his second drunk-driving arrest.  </P> <P> "I am not a quitter," he said. "I believe that anything can be overcome if you  are honest and forthright with people, but at this point I am not really  considering a statewide run. I can perceive only one day at a time. Time will  tell whether I am a viable candidate down the road anyway."  </P> <P> The lawmaker was arrested for drunk driving in July, 1987, when his car nearly  crashed into a Sacramento police vehicle parked with its emergency lights  flashing.  </P> <P> He pleaded no contest, paid an $827 fine and was placed on probation for three  years. One condition of probation was that he not refuse to take any future  chemical tests to determine a blood-alcohol level.  </P> <P> On Sept. 6, Torres was again arrested on a drunk-driving charge. The arresting  officer said Torres refused to take a field sobriety examination, "could not  perform" a breath test and refused to take any other test.  </P> <P> Torres became the second state legislator in recent months to acknowledge  seeking treatment for alcoholism. The first was Sen. Bill Greene (D-Los  Angeles), who sought treatment at the end of the summer.  </P></p>

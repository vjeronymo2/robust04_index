This was confirmed by Air Force  Chief of Staff Gen. Adelchi Pillinini at a meeting with  journalists from UGAI (Italian Aerospace Journalists  Association), who also stressed that "all three branches of the  armed forces will be involved in the development of space  programs" and that the above mentioned committee has assigned  the Air Force in particular with "the management of the SICRAL  (Italian Satellite for Confidential and Warning Communications)  and Helios programs." SICRAL is a national satellite for  government communications and Helios, which is currently under  development as part of a cooperation accord among France, Italy,  and Spain, will be used for strategic observation.    As for SICRAL, it has been made known that COSTARMAEREO  (Ministry of Defense Headquarters for Aeronautical and Space  Construction) should issue the RFP (Request for Proposal) for  the satellite's development in early 1994 and that this should  be followed by the signing of a contract with Alenia Spazio.  The overall cost of the program is estimated at 500-550 billion  lire and includes the construction of a single satellite, its  launching into orbit (probably using the European Ariane-4  launcher) and the TT&amp;C (Remote Control, Telemetry, and  Control)  ground station. The SICRAL launch is expected to take place by  1997.    A Space Activities Office divided into two sections, Space  Policy and Space Programs, was recently established within the  4th Division of the Air Force Chief of Staff and will be  directed by Col. Giuliano Giannone to better carry out the  mandate on the management of defense space programs.</p>

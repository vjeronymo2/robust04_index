			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Reactor plan is attacked PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's environmental adviser yesterday attacked the government for approving a plan to resume building atomic power stations. The Russian cabinet adopted at the end of last month the plan to build two new VVR-1000 reactors and one Chernobyl-style RMBK reactor by 1995. Prof Alexei Yablokov, Mr Yeltsin's adviser and a leading environmental campaigner, said he fought against the decision. 'I spoke desperately at the meeting but my remarks were ignored and it is tragic that even the ecology minister did not support me.' Prof Yablokov also accused the west of hypocrisy in offering to help with Russia's nuclear problems. The west was offering technical assistance and cash for Russia to build new plants and overhaul existing ones. But it would be safer and cheaper to help idle Russian defence plants convert to the production of gas turbines, Prof Yablokov said. An atomic energy ministry spokesman said Russia could not afford the gas turbines option for now. The government decision had ended official indecision over nuclear power since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, he added. Prof Yablokov's remarks coincided with a fire yesterday at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine. Plant officials said there was no danger to public health in the latest of a series of incidents at power plants around the former Soviet Union. Officials said the fire was quickly extinguished and no radiation was released.</p>

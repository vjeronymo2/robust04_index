			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Peace in Ireland finds itself at mercy of peace in Dail: The government imbroglio and possible effects on progress of the framework document Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was questioned yesterday by reporters about the prospect of a collapse of the Irish government as he arrived in Dublin for talks with Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. 'Mayhew stays out of coalition crisis,' Mr Mayhew said, quoting an Irish newspaper headline. 'I wish we all had the same options,' Mr Spring replied. Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, today addresses the Dail, the Irish parliament, where his Fianna Fail party is under attack from Mr Spring over the appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan, the Irish attorney-general, as president of the High Court. Mr Whelehan's mishandling of a child abuse case had already put pressure on the governing coalition of Fianna Fail and Mr Spring's Labour party. Mr Reynolds' decision last week to appoint Mr Whelehan as president of the High Court pushed the coalition to the brink of collapse. The common view yesterday was that whatever Mr Reynolds may say in the Dail, a deepening crisis can be averted only by the resignation of Mr Whelehan, which few observers think likely. If he stays, Ireland seems likely to have a new government - either through an election or a new alliance of parties in the Dail. For Northern protestants, there will be a certain irony if the Dublin government is to fall on this particular question - it concerns a warrant to have a Roman Catholic priest extradited by the Royal Ulster Constabulary from the republic. Few officials doubt that a period of political uncertainty will disrupt the peace process. All Ireland's political parties are committed to the search for peace but Fianna Fail, more than other parties, is rooted in the republican tradition - although it is said of Mr Reynolds that he carries the ideological baggage more lightly than earlier party leaders. Mr Reynolds has been pivotal in the peace effort - in particular his understanding with Mr John Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, has provided a bridge to Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. Under his leadership, the Irish government has been concerned to sustain the momentum of the peace process - sometimes provoking criticism that it was moving too quickly. There is as yet no pressure on Mr Reynolds's leadership within his party. Irish civil servants no doubt find it galling to be lectured about parliamentary democracy by the likes of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, which has voiced concern about possible disruption of the peace process by the coalition crisis. But if the callers to one Irish radio programme are any measure, many ordinary people are perplexed that the coalition should break down at this critical stage of the peace process - which comes at a time when progress is also being made on the economy and the legislative agenda. In seeking an explanation for the crisis, observers point to the personality of Mr Reynolds - an abrasive, instinctive politician, unusual in Ireland in being a successful self-made businessman, a petfood magnate and showband impresario. And as Ms Mary Harney, head of the Progressive Democrats, pointed out, Mr Reynolds has been here before. His attacks on Mr Des O'Malley, former PD leader, led to the break up of the Fianna Fail-PD government and triggered the general election in November 1992. Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein vice-president, said over the weekend that a change of government would be 'very, very unhelpful' and voiced misgivings about working with some of the other political parties which he accused of being 'less than helpful' in support of the peace effort. In particular, Sinn Fein has made clear its misgivings about working with Mr John Bruton, who since 1990 has been leader of Fine Gael, the main opposition party. A farmer, economist and barrister, Mr Bruton's spell as finance minister was marked by the pursuit of market-oriented economic policies. Mr Reynolds mistakenly referred to Mr Bruton as 'John Unionist' in an interview during the last election campaign. Fine Gael is a conservative party with largely middle-class support. Since the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition government was formed in January last year, it has had some internal difficulties, culminating in a leadership challenge to Mr Bruton in February. Sinn Fein must feel almost as uncomfortable about the prospect that one party which might have a role in forming a new government is the Democratic Left, a breakaway from the Workers party which itself was formed when the Official IRA broke ranks with the Provisionals in the 1970s. On current calculations, Labour could join forces with centre-right Fine Gael and the Democratic Left - with a total of 85 seats, such a coalition would have a narrow majority in the 166-seat house. If that fails to materialise, Fianna Fail could look for new partners, though after its unhappy alliances with PD and now Labour, the most likely candidates would be the Democratic Left or independents.</p>

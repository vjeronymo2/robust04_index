			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (2) HUD Responsibilities_Disclosures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (Form HUD&hyph;2880) submitted in connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form HUD&hyph;2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure reports, but in no case for a period less than three years. All reports, both applicant disclosures and updates, will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR part 12, subpart C, and the notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (e) Prohibition Against Advance Information on Funding Decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the HUD Reform Act, codified as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement of the selection of successful applicants. Also refer to a final rule amending part 4 published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 19, 1993 (58 FR 61016), regarding the regulation of certain conduct by HUD employees and by applicants for HUD assistance during the selection process for the award of financial assistance by HUD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are limited by part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR Part 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics at (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice), (202) 708&hyph;1112 (TDD). These are not toll-free numbers. The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed with persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Field Office Counsel or Headquarters Counsel for the program to which the question pertains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (f) Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 112 of the HUD Reform Act added a new section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) . Section 13 contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD regulations implementing section 13 are at 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they are urged to read the regulation, particularly the examples contained in appendix A of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A final rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 7, 1993, amended the definition of ``person'' to exclude from coverage a State or local government, or the officer or employee of a State or local government or housing finance agency thereof who is engaged in the official business of the State or local government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any questions regarding the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;3000.

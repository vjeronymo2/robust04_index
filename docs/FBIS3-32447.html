As everyone knows, the initiation  of the peace dialogue between Mr. Manuel Camacho Solis and the  EZLN is imminent. The fact that the dialogue is being held in a  conflict area implies provocation risks that could hinder or bog  the talks down.    With the purpose of minimizing unwanted rifts between the  parties in conflict, it is necessary to form around the talk  site a security or peace cordon, which can prevent the pressure  or intimidation of one of the parties in conflict. We know the  so-called nongovernment organizations have remained neutral in  the present conflict, and they have always been concerned about  the need to alleviate the serious conditions of the civilian  population as well as to promote the peace efforts with dignity  as sought by our forces and all honest Mexicans.    For the reasons mentioned above, we would like to  respectfully ask you to form a peace cordon that can prevent  both federal troops as well as those from the EZLN from meddling  in the region surrounding the negotiation table. Let it be  understood that this does not represent any commitment or  support for our struggle's cause, and that we will continue to  respect and greet your neutrality and humanitarian duty.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Fiscal year 1994 pension fund management plans of  eight trust banks (including Daiwa Bank) have been released.  Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking will lead all eight banks in  increasing  it percentage of investments in domestic stock in relative to  total assets by 5 percentage points over holdings as of the end  of fiscal year 1993. The reason is that banks feel the economy  will improve during the fiscal year and that stock prices will  rise moderately. No consistent pattern has been established in  investments in domestic bonds and foreign currency-denominated  assets. Operating profits of company pension funds are expected  to remain sluggish in this fiscal year and the asset balances of  the funds at the eight trust banks are expected to rise by 2  trillion yen, to a level of about 30 trillion yen.    Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking, among trust banks, assumes  the  spreading viewpoint that "stock prices will enter a rising trend  in the second half of the fiscal year." The majority of the  trust banks expect a return of 10 percent on stock investments  and will aggressively allocate any additional funds available  during the fiscal year to investments in domestic stocks. Toyo  Trust &amp; Banking will allocate funds primarily to issues with  high growth potential and those that are relatively cheaply  priced in its effort to increase the rate of return.    However, the prevailing view is that the rise in stock  prices  will be minimal. Many trust banks predict that the Nikkei stock  average will rise to about 22,000-23,000 yen in the second half  of the fiscal year, but that there will be a time when it breaks  through the 20,000 yen level and return to the point where it  was at the beginning of the year. As stated by Sumitomo Trust  &amp;  Banking, it appears that "we will have to watch our timing in  purchasing additional stock as we monitor price movements."    In the area of investments in domestic bonds, trust banks  are  divided into two camps; i.e., those that take a cautious stance  in expectation of rising interest rates and those that plan to  purchase additional bonds as a source for long-term income.  Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking plans to reduce its allocation of  funds  for investment in domestic bonds by 5 percent during the current  fiscal year, based on the assessment that "interest rates will  rise when the economic recovery becomes visible."    Since Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking's proportion of funds  allocated  for bond investments is low compared to other banks, it plans to  add to its holdings in the current fiscal year. Nippon Trust  Bank disposed of bond holdings between the end of 1993 and the  beginning of this year on the premise that bond prices were  hovering at a high level, leading to a lower proportion of  domestic bond holdings, and now plans to raise investments in  bonds during the fiscal year.    With respect to foreign currency-denominated assets, Yasuda  Trust &amp; Banking says, "We will expand the number of nations  in  which we invest and aggressively pursue investments in foreign  stocks." On the other hand, some banks, such as Sumitomo Trust  &amp;  Banking say, "We will maintain our current proportion of foreign  assets, because it is difficult to predict the future of foreign  exchange rates."    Company annuity funds represent the total of welfare annuity  funds and tax qualifying annuity funds held in trust. Company  annuity fund asset balances based on book value held by the  eight trust banks as of the end of March 1994 were about 27.6  trillion yen. The banks predict that asset balances will  increase by 5-10 percent or by a total of 2 trillion yen during  the year.</p>

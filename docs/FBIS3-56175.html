But They Are Already Intending To Revise It"]    [Text] The president's edict "on the state program for the  privatization of state and municipal enterprises in the Russian  Federation" has been adopted. It would seem the end of the  odyssey of a long-suffering document, which took 18 months to  squeeze through the departmental turnpikes and parliamentary  antagonism. Dmitriy Vasilyev, deputy chairman of the State  Committee for the Administration of State Property  [Goskomimushchestvo], told IZVESTIYA how it differs from the  1992 program and what fundamental changes have been made to it  by the government, time, and the economic situation in the  country.    The present program, like the previous one, sets as its main  aim the formation of a broad stratum of private owners as the  economic basis of market relations. All the main means of  privatization have been preserved as have the previous three  types of benefit (incentives for the third type have been  drastically enhanced), and the principles for voucher  privatization that does not involve money [besplatnaya], the  existing mechanism for voucher auctions, and so forth have been  enshrined.    If you compare the "democratism" of the two programs then in  D. Vasilyev's opinion one can sense in the new one a "certain  deterioration -- there are more departmental bans and additional  tough bureaucratic measures have been introduced."    At the same time all procedures of importance for voucher  privatization have been successfully defended in the government  and enshrined in documents and the list of property open to  privatization has been expanded. D. Vasilyev believes that the  sections on the privatization of nonresidential premises and the  sale of land plots attached to enterprises are particularly  important. Land and real estate are the foundation of small  business, the basis of the next wave of market reforms. It is  important that in the privatization process permission has been  given to "divide up" and sell uncompleted construction projects.    A new section on foreign investments, in fact, lifts all  restrictions for the participation of foreign businessmen in  auctions and when buying shares for money and for vouchers.  Actually one -- substantial -- restriction is envisaged for  foreign businessmen: The federal counterintelligence service  can submit to the government within a month a substantiated  conclusion to the effect that shares should not be sold to a  particular investor. Counterintelligence intends thus to prevent  the "laundering" of money by the narco-mafia, the criminal  world, and so forth.    The program substantially strengthens the role of investment  funds. They have finally been allowed to increase the  proportion of shares of a single enterprise in their portfolio  to 25 percent instead of 10 percent, which will enable funds to  take a real part in the management of joint-stock companies.  Some funds have collected only 1,000 vouchers and, realizing  that they simply cannot function, have been obliged to surrender  their shares to larger and more powerful colleagues. This  practice of some funds being "swallowed up" by others has now  been legalized by the program. On the other hand, commercial  banks' opportunities for purchasing the shares of privatized  enterprises have been palpably limited.    The new program in general devotes substantial space to the  defense of shareholders' rights. Henceforth all fundamental  decisions -- on liquidating the company, on changing the  incorporation capital, on joining a holding company or financial  and industrial group, on selling a large proportion of its  property -- will be made only at a meeting and with the  agreement of three fourths of shareholders. The actual  procedure for holding and preparing meetings has been  "prescribed," ruling out the possibility of disregarding the  opinion of ordinary shareholders, and so forth.    Dmitriy Vasilyevich believes that the biggest flaw in the  new  program is what he called "fantastically large section on the  sectorial features of privatization, which includes goodness  knows what -- from timber procurement establishments to medicine  and cultural institutions." There were endless disputes in the  government over the "specific features" of privatization in  literally every sector, which in actual fact do not and should  not exist. Vasilyev is convinced that this is only the first  "pass" by the ministries and that this trend will strengthen and  develop. And as proof he cited a striking fact: On 24 December  the edict was signed, on 30 December it left the president's  office, and today several ministries have already prepared the  draft of one more edict...on repealing the privatization program  in connection with the new political situation. The thrust of  the changes is to approve departmental monopoly in a different  incarnation -- through holding companies and giant financial and  industrial groups.    To my question as to whether the new political situation is  linked with the possible response of the State Duma Dmitriy  Vasilyev replied that privatization will hardly be subjected to  serious attacks from parliament in the near future -- it has  enough concerns of its own. The "situation" in the government  is more complex.    According to some reports the government intends to use  Anatoliy Chubays' deputy's duties and status as faction deputy  chairman as a pretext for removing him from the post of  Goskomimushchestvo chairman. In that case even without  "attacks" from the Duma, the implementation of the privatization  program will simply be left hanging.    God grant, as they say, that it all turns out to be rumor. I  am well acquainted with the situation and the relations that  have taken shape in the Goskomimushchestvo and I am sure that  following Chubays, his team -- the brain center of the committee  with which all present privatization ideas are linked -- will  unfailingly go too. Privatization is still a long way from  completion and in contrast to Chubays I am, alas, far from  convinced that "this process is irreversible." Although it is a  case of the foundation of market relations and all reforms in  the Russian economy.</p>

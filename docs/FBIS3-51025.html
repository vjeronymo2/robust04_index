In statements published today by the Mexican newspapers  REFORMA and EL NORTE, Cantu indicated that the rebels seek to  internationally discredit President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's.  He said the rebels want to prevent free trade, the creation of  jobs, the increase of foreign investments, economic growth, and  wage increases in Mexico, objectives that NAFTA seeks.    "It is obvious that it is not an Indian insurgent movement,  because if it were, they would be using machetes. This armed  group would not have been repudiated as it has," he added.</p>

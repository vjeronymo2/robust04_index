			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by editorial staff members Keiji Kobayashi and </F> Shunji Taoka: "Does North Korea Really Intend Going to War?"]    [Text] The situation is becoming unstable due to  suspicions about the nuclear development policy of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea).    At a news conference on 23 March at the North Korean Embassy  in Beijing concerning the resumption of the U.S.-South Korea  "Team Spirit" joint military exercise and the deployment of  Patriot missiles in South Korea, Ambassador Chu Chang-chun said  that "unless they are halted, there will be no recourse but to  go to war. The entire responsibility rests with the two  countries (the United States and South Korea)." In the embassy,  photographs from the Korean crisis period were displayed.    Prior to this, at a 19 March working level meeting in  Panmunjom held to discuss the exchange of special envoys between  the North and the South, North Korean representative Pak Yong-su  suggested the possibility of war by declaring that "Seoul is not  far from here (Panmunjom). In case of war, Seoul will be  engulfed in fire." He even added that "in that event, it will  also be difficult for you, Mr. Son (the South Korean  representative), to survive."    It had to be without doubt a comment which he was instructed  to make by the highest authorities, since an official at a mere  outpost could not use an expression such as "war" at his own  discretion. It is said that representative Pak made that  comment while looking at a memo which he had prepared  beforehand, and that a North Korean propaganda broadcast at the  DMZ [demilitarized zone] kept repeating "[we will] start the  offensive in early April."    The United States and South Korea, on the other hand, have  decided to "resume Team Spirit," and to deploy Patriot missiles  in South Korea. The South Korean Defense Ministry on 24 March  made public that they had already completed a plan for a  five-stage "absorbing and unifying operation 5027," which  includes immediate retaliation, occupation of Pyongyang, and so  on, to be implemented in the event North Korea invades the South.    This is the first time the tension between the North and  South has become so high since the 1983 terrorist bombing  incident in Rangoon.  <H5>  Building a Sense of Crisis in Hopes of Gaining Advantage in </H5> Negotiations    Why has North Korea used such excessively provocative  expressions?    Specialists on North Korea in Seoul believe that their  intentions include the following: 1) It is the final raising of  the ante prior to playing the "nuclear card;" 2) By generating  fear of war, they will heighten the sense of crisis for doves in  South Korea and the United States, and gain an advantage in  future negotiations; and 3) It is intended to strengthen the  unity of the nation.    For North Korea, the "nuclear card," with which they make  others suspect that they have developed or are developing  nuclear arms, is their last trump card for solving their present  international isolation and economic difficulties. In fact, by  using this card, they have succeeded in bringing the United  States, which wants extension of the nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty (NPT), to the negotiating table, and they have gained  concessions such as halting military exercises and the start of  U.S.-North Korea diplomatic normalization negotiations. The  specialists suspect that this [use of threatening expressions]  may be their way of testing the water to determine if they can  make one more push.    Setting aside the national unity policy, so far their  strategy to gain concessions through a hardened posture has not  met with success. In Seoul, it has hardly affected the price of  stocks and there is no move toward hoarding: the people have  accepted this development calmly. It is said that in South  Korea public opinion in support of the flexible line followed by  the Kim Yong-sam Government toward the North has been strong,  but because of the recent comments the hawks' voices have  rapidly become stronger, and it is getting harder for the  government to compromise.    The United States plans to bring this issue to the United  Nations Security Council. It plans first to pass a resolution  criticizing North Korea, and if no result is obtained, it wants  to move on to economic sanctions. The responses of Japan, South  Korea, and the United States, which until now were subtly  different in approach, has become a unified response. And the  emergence of such an international situation makes it difficult  for even China, which North Korea relies on, to use the veto.    Far Eastern Issues Research Institution Director Kang In-tok  [as published] observes that "the North has made an incorrect  reading of the international situation because of their cold war  mind set and dogma. I wonder if it [North Korea] has given the  impression to the world that it is not a party with which one  can negotiate in a normal manner."    Of course this is not to say that there is absolutely no  risk that the heightened tension might trigger an accidental  explosion and lead to war. But most observers believe that in  the near future North Korea has no choice but to resume  negotiations with the United States. North Korea has in the  past suddenly changed important policies, such as the resumption  of Japan-North Korea diplomatic normalization negotiations, and  joining the United Nations. In such a case, how China behaves  will be the key factor.  <H5>  Bullish Comment is Reverse Side of Fear -- The "Inferno" </H5> Will Be Pyongyang    For the offensive side the value of a surprise attack is  extremely great.    It was Sunday morning, 25 June 1950, when North Korean  forces  broke through the 38th parallel. It was also Sunday when the  Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor at dawn of 7 December 1941  (local time).    The fact that the North Korean side says "we will make Seoul  an inferno" and "there is no recourse but to go to war," is to  abandon the effect of a surprise attack if it really intends to  attack.    It is a common practice to keep a low rhetorical posture  when  one starts a war, because it is convenient to declare internally  and externally, after the war starts, "we had no choice but to  retaliate because the other side launched an attack." In this  sense, it would be appropriate to interpret the offensive  utterances by North Korea as a bluff derived from its fear of  war.    There are reasons that North Korea fears war. Although it is  said they possess 730 fighter aircraft, most of them are old  Chinese-made MiG-17's and 19's. The only modern planes are some  10 to 20 MiG-29's and 30's, some Sukhoy-25 ground assault  planes, and 40 or so MiG-23's, totaling a little under 100  aircraft. Even if 120 MiG-21's can be utilized, this comes to  only 200 odd aircraft.    On the other hand, South Korea's F-16's, F-4's, and F-5's,  which total about 340 planes, can all be used at the front.  Moreover, 72 U.S. Air Force F-16's are stationed in Korea, 160  U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps Air Wing aircraft are stationed  in Japan, and 60 fighter and assault planes from U.S. aircraft  carriers bring the total to some 630 aircraft. The performance  capabilities of the aircraft are different. In particular, the  gaps are great in electronic technology such as radar,  computers, and electronic countermeasures, and in information  gathering ability by airborne early warning aircraft and  reconnaissance satellites.    Also, North Korea has a fuel shortage, and per pilot flight  training per year is said to be four to six hours. This is the  same as a "paper driver" [that is, someone who is qualified on  paper, but has no practical experience]. When all these  elements are taken together, the United States-South Korean side  has absolute aerial superiority.  <H5>  Lightweight "Nuclear Weapon" Not Completed? </H5>   Even if the North Korean forces make an offensive move,  because they will be hit from the air and their supply trucks  will be destroyed it is likely that they will be driven back  without passing through the South's defensive positions.    The only strategies left for the North would be to have its  60,000 special forces invade alongside the mountains, to fire  Scud missiles, of which it is said to possess over 300, or for  fighter airplanes, prepared to make only a one way attack, to  invade with bombs at low altitudes.    The reason the U.S. forces are positioning "Patriot" antiair  missiles in South Korea is not to defend Seoul from the Scuds.  The Patriot is almost useless against ballistic missiles. It  is to protect the U.S. bases from aerial attacks.    There is a suspicion that North Korea has made a "nuclear  detonation device," but it is fairly certain that it has not  made any lightweight "nuclear weapon" deliverable by missile.    But chemical weapons are of World War I technology, so  information that the North is making them is most likely true.  If chemical warhead-armed Scuds were to be shot into Seoul,  since South Korea has not made preparations with gas masks,  protective clothing, and antidotes for the civilian population  as Israel has, it would trigger great chaos.    If the population of 20 million from Seoul and its  surrounding areas attempted an exodus, the U.S.-South Korean  counteroffensive operation could be stalled in the waves of  refuges. As for Japanese, there are about 3,000 who live in  Seoul, and about 10,000 tourists are expected to be in the city.  Their rescue would be difficult.    On the other hand, the U.S.-South Korean naval and air  forces  would gain command of the air, would severely bomb Pyongyang and  Wonsan on the east coast, and would also attack with "Tomahawk"  cruise missiles from surface vessels and submarines. Against  the American electronics interference technology and the stealth  fighter airplanes which would not show up on radar, there is  nothing the North's antiair missiles can do. North Korea must  know that it is Pyongyang which would become an inferno.    But as long as the combined 600,000-700,000 troops are  facing  each other along the 240-km front line, the South Korean side  has entered into alert status, and has come to feel nervous  about the North Korean comments on war, there is a slim chance  that small clashes at the border could expand into full-scale  battles.    Along the demilitarized zone, there also have been frequent  incidents in the past of shootings between patrols from both  sides.    Thus, when tension becomes heightened, an unexpected  situation could easily occur.</p>

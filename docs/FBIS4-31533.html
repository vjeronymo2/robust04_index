			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article compiled by E.W.: "Association Like Republican </F> Party; Zbigniew Religa Wants To Transform BBWR"]    [Text] According to Zbigniew Religa, chairman of the  Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR], the association has  failed to fulfill its task of uniting the entire right wing.  That was not possible, Religa explained in an interview for  PAP. A meeting of BBWR's founding members to debate the formula  and structure of a future organization will take place before  the end of the month. Religa does not rule out that the new  organization will include people who have left other right-wing  parties and who are acting on their own now or who have  abandoned political activity completely.    It cannot be an organization that would be exclusively for  Lech Walesa and that would be associated with him because, in  that case, it would lose its significance both if the president  wins the election and if he loses it, Religa explained. He also  stressed that the bloc being organized now cannot be an  organization that would be linked to himself or to Andrzej  Olechowski, either; instead, it must be a group with a clear  program and goals.    There is no doubt whatsoever that, if my concept and  direction are supported by the majority, then, beginning at that  point, work will begin on transforming the BBWR into a new  party, Religa said. He added that both BBWR members and poeple  from outside it who could take part in the future organization  will debate the group's new formula. When explaining the  reasons for the decision, the BBWR chairman said that, in its  current form, the BBWR could not be an organization that could  make its mark in Poland's political landscape permanently--that  is to say, over the next 10-50 years. Religa admitted that he  still has an incomplete idea of what the future group should  look like. But he did stress that he would not like it to  resemble a party in the classic sense of the word--meaning,  identification cards or various types of party commissions. I  like the concept of, for instance, the Republican Party in the  United States the most.</p>

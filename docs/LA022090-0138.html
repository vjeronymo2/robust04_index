The group saw from  a distance the launch pad where the shuttle Atlantis is being readied for  liftoff Thursday.  </P> <P> During the three days preceding his visit to the cape, the heir to the British  throne was in Vero Beach, where he participated in two polo matches to benefit  a wildlife protection organization.  </P> <P> Charles is scheduled to attend a conference on international business beginning  today in Charleston, S.C., and to travel to Washington later this week to meet  with President Bush and British Embassy officials.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have received a statement from the press center  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army saying that combat planes  belonging to the Serb aggressor attacked the free territory of  Maglaj at 0500 this morning. In the bestial bombing, the  chetniks destroyed the old bridge in Maglaj.    The headquarters of the supreme command of the Army of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina immediately informed the UN  command for Bosnia-Herzegovina about the situation in Maglaj.  At 1015, the Serb aggressor's combat planes again attacked Old  Maglaj, and at the same time chetnik units launched a fierce  combined tank and infantry attack. Soldiers of the 201st Knight  Brigade of the Bosnia-Herzegovina army successfully repelled the  attack. In preparation for a fresh tank and infantry attack,  with air force support, the chetniks are regrouping their forces  while still attacking the town of Maglaj.    Army General Rasim Delic, commander of the headquarters of  the supreme command of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, informed  General Michael Rose [UN Protection Forces commander for Bosnia]  personally about the attacks by the Serb air force on Maglaj and  demanded that NATO planes take more effective action to stop the  bombing of Maglaj, which is primarily aimed at civilian targets  and infrastructure. General Rose promised urgent intervention  by NATO forces to protect the air space above Maglaj. This is  what was said in a statement of the press center of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army.</p>

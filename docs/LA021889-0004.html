			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FILE  </P> <P> After considering rock singer Prince and a Fundamentalists Anonymous leader,  editors of the satirical humor magazine, The Wittenburg Door, have chosen  Jessica Hahn as their "theologian of the year."  </P> <P> Editors at the evangelical-oriented magazine, based in El Cajon, said with  tongue in cheek that "candidates" included Prince, whose "LoveSexy" album they  termed "a hedonistic collection of theological gibberish," and Richard Yao, a  founder of Fundamentalists Anonymous whom they regarded as an  evangelist-in-reverse during a published interview in the same issue of the  bimonthly.  </P> <P> But Hahn, who lived last year at the Playboy Mansion and made a topless and a  later nude appearance in Playboy magazine following the 1987 revelations of her  sexual encounter with then-PTL evangelist Jim Bakker, won the hearts of Senior  Editor Mike Yaconelli and his colleagues at The Door.  </P> <P> "In the September, 1988, issue of Playboy, Jessica was able to crystallize  theologically the relationship between faith and nudity, sex and heaven,  Pleasing God and Pleasing Myself, and much, much more," they wrote.  </P> <P> The editors quoted Hahn's advice published in Playboy to those who have hurt:  "I spoke with God and asked for a miracle. The next day Playboy called. That  was my miracle. Don't give up hope."  </P> <P> PEOPLE  </P> <P> Elie Wiesel, the 1986 Nobel Peace laureate, will lecture 8 p.m. Thursday at  Stephen S. Wise Temple in Los Angeles on the general topic of U.S.-Israeli  relationships. Wiesel's talk, the first of a series sponsored by the temple and  the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League, has a general admission price of $40.  Wiesel was among international Jewish leaders who were in Moscow Sunday  attending the opening of the first Jewish center there in more than 50 years.  </P> <P> The Rev. Fred Fenton, rector of St. Augustine-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in  Santa Monica, is one of six candidates for bishop coadjutor of the Diocese of  Western Louisiana. The election will be held in Alexandria, La., March 13.  Fenton noted that no priest of the Los Angeles Episcopal Diocese has been  elected a bishop in another diocese since the Rev. John Burt of Pasadena was  elected bishop of Ohio in 1967. Pasadena's George Regas was nominated last year  for a New York City post but was not elected.  </P> <P> MEDIA  </P> <P> KCBS-TV, Channel 2, will retell the story this afternoon (5:30 p.m.-6 p.m.) of  a Los Angeles black spiritual choir, "Wings Over Jordan," that was given a  Sunday morning program by the CBS radio network in 1937. It was the first  network program featuring and hosted by black musicians. Despite demands for  cancellation of the program, which provided a forum also for commentary on  civil rights, "Wings Over Jordan" remained on the air for 13 years. JOHN DART  </P></p>

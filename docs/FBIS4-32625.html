			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirjana Protic] </F>   [Text] Speaking at a news conference today, Federal Prime  Minister Radoje Kontic conveyed to the journalists the  government's view that the economic policy and the economic  recovery program for this year are being successfully  implemented. Foreign currency reserves have been increased, the  gold reserves are not being used. The Federal Government has  adopted a decision to mint a gold coin. It has also issued a  statement regarding the latest events in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which warns, among other things, the United  Nations and the Security Council that the Muslim-Croatian forces  are stepping up their attacks. Mirjana Protic reports:    [Protic] Immediately after the session of the Federal  Government, Prime Minister Radivoje Kontic held a news  conference in the Palace of the Federation at which he expressed  the most important details regarding the work of the government  in the past week. At a joint session of the Federal Government,  the heads of the republican governments, and the governor of the  National Bank of Yugoslavia [Dragoslav Avramovic], the  participants discussed the realization of the program of  economic and monetary stabilization and the economic recovery of  the country.    Within its constitutional powers, the Federal Government  also  discussed the realization of the economic policy for this year.  Prime Minister Kontic conveyed the Federal Government's  assessment of how the program is being realized.    [Begin Kontic recording] In the realization of the economic  policy this year, positive trends have been noted in all  sectors, in almost all sectors of production. In brief, what is  this reflected in? First of all the stability the dinar has  been preserved. This is best reflected through the retained  parity of one to one [not further specified], even though we had  in the meantime several attacks, several attempts to destabilize  the dinar. However, we responded successfully to all these  attacks.    I would say that the stability of prices has been  maintained,  with some occasional fluctuations. So, for instance, when I was  here last time, I think I expressed dissatisfaction with the way  prices were increasing in the agricultural sectors. In the  third week of June, prices went up by as much as 2 percent.  Explaining this increase, I said at the same time that next  week, considering the causes of the price increase, prices of  agricultural products would fall. I can say with great pleasure  that last week, in comparison with the previous week, there was  a general fall in prices amounting to 1.9 percent. [end  recording]    [Protic] Prime Minister Kontic then stressed that the  foreign reserves of the National Bank of Yugoslavia have been  increased, and that gold reserves are intact. Positive trends  have been recorded in the rate of increase of production.    Prime Minister Kontic also spoke to the journalists about  the  situation in the Nonaligned Movement. The direct motive for  that was the behavior by certain countries and the failure to  invite the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to take part in the  recent conference in Cairo. The Federal Government has  concluded that the Non-Aligned Movement has not managed to adapt  itself to the new conditions in the world. Room has been left  for some Islamic countries to exert their influence. Prime  Minister Kontic said that there are some exceptions. However,  the status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as an equal  members has been denied. The official document on  Bosnia-Herzegovina reflects the aggressive policy of the Muslim  countries, as well as (?incorrect) picture of the events in this  region.    The Federal Government has concluded that Yugoslavia should  retain its membership in the movement as the withdrawal from the  Nonaligned Movement would be a concession to some Islamic  countries that are demanding it.    The Federal Government has also adopted a special statement  on the latest events in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The international  community, the United Nations, and the European Union have been  warned about the general deterioration of the situation,  primarily because of the attacks by the Muslim forces. The FRY  [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Government expects the Security  Council to take all the necessary measures so that the peace  chance is not missed. Otherwise, there could be unforeseeable  consequences and the war could escalate.    Journalists were informed that the Federal Government has  adopted a decision on minting a gold coin to mark the 110th  anniversary of the National Bank of Yugoslavia. These gold  coins will be used to purchase agricultural products, above all,  wheat. The National Bank of Yugoslavia will set the price of  the gold coins. On one side, the coin portrays a dove of peace  and an olive branch, while the other has the coat of arms of the  FRY and the old building of the National Bank of Yugoslavia.    Replying to journalists' questions, Prime Minister Kontic  said that a sufficient amount of money would be secured to  purchase wheat. The Federal Government also adopted a decision  to adjust the salaries in state organs, the public sector, and  all noneconomic activities to the salaries in the industry that  are linked to the rise in production.</p>

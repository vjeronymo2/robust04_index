			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / This Week: Grade's week - Television Vitali Vitaliev, Russia's answer to Clive James, returns to the Ukraine five years after he defected in Travels With My Camera (Monday, 9.00-10.00, C4), a series that aims to do away with the paraphernalia of programme-making by arming the presenter with a Hi-8 camera to get an immediacy absent from other programmes. But Vitaliev's technological illiteracy made this difficult - he jokes that the documentary should be renamed 'Troubles With My Camera'. In the five years he has been away the economy has been turned upside down. Hyperinflation means an apple costs a pensioner a quarter of her monthly income, a shortage of small change means that phone boxes are free and the most powerful people are gangster-like 'businessmen'. At the other end of the Asian land mass there are daily rumours that Deng Xiao Ping, China's nonagenerian leader is dead. To mark his birthday on Monday the BBC has produced a profile The People's Dictator (Tuesday, 9.30-10.20, BBC2). In the last few months, Deng has disappeared from public view but his presence still looms large. Reporter Julian O'Halloran, who covered the Tianamen Square demonstrations, gives an absorbing account of how Deng has kept a grip on the greasy pole since 1916 by being a supremely pragmatic politician who even managed to reinstate himself after being denounced during the Cultural Revolution. But he is no diplomat - his remarks to Mrs Thatcher are said to have been so rude that the interpreter thought it best not to translate them. And he's certainly not a democrat - China is still waiting for the political reforms that were promised alongside economic liberalisation. The vital question is what will happen after Deng dies - one that the documentary, unfortunately, ducks. The early years of TV were dominated by showman entrepreneurs - literally so in the case of Lew (now Lord) Grade whose first claim to fame was as a champion Charleston dancer. The BBC is paying tribute to the last of the old-style media moghuls with a season of programmes starting with ATV Night (Saturday, 7.55-12.05am) which will be introduced from the foyer of the Crossroads Motel, famous as the setting for Lord Grade's most successful early evening soap opera. Alas Meg Richardson (Noele Gordon) who played the all-controlling matriarch-cum-motel owner has checked into the celestial chalet now. But her screen daughter, Jill Richardson (Jane Rossington), will step into the breach. The line-up includes compilation programmes and episodes from Edward VII, Danger Man and The Muppet Show. But the centrepiece of the evening is The Persuader (9.00-9.50) in which Lord Grade is interviewed by his nephew Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel Four. Although Lord Grade doesn't quite give us the gen on the reasons for his departure from ITV, following a boardroom battle with Robert Holmes a Court, he is generous with the anecdotes which include some gems. If you only watch one programme this week, watch this.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yoshinori Fukushima] </F>   [Text] Tunis, 9 April -- In a meeting with the United  Nations' news gathering team for Middle Eastern affairs, PLO  Chairman 'Arafat criticized the Rabin administration by saying  that Israel is causing the delay in negotiations on the Israeli  military withdrawal from the occupied territories (Gaza district  and Jericho in the West Bank of the Jordan River). However, it  seems he is trying to attract the attention of international  society, including the United States, by complaining that  postponement of the military withdrawal is linked to worsening  of the situation in the occupied territories. The remark is  also a sign of Chairman 'Arafat's irritation, as he wants to  regain the occupied territories and establish his authority in a  hurry through election of a tentative government because the  Palestinians in the territories are increasingly becoming  dissatisfied.    Following the invalidation of a deadline for starting the  withdrawal, which was 13 December last year, it is becoming  difficult for Israel to complete the military withdrawal even by  13 April.    In the meeting, Chairman 'Arafat stressed: "The Palestinians  in the occupied territories have not seen any concrete outcome  (of the peace accord). Slaughters and violence are increasing.  Not only that but also the people in Gaza district, where the  living environment is very bad, are on the verge of starvation."  However, the Palestinians in Jericho, where the support rate  for the peace accord was high, are also feeling powerless and  are beginning to doubt the possibility of realizing peace.  Because of this, it seems the chairman made his remark while  keeping in mind the Palestinians' dissatisfaction.    Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories are calling  on the PLO leadership for administration of a democratic  organization. 'Arafat, who was forced to make concessions to  Israel during the previous negotiations on the military  withdrawal, knows he is a target of the Palestinians'  dissatisfaction. Therefore, he is pressed by the need to show a  firm stance to Israel and the United States. The United States  is critical of the fact that the PLO's statement failed to  criticize the suicide bombing by "Hamas," the Islamic extremist  organization, in Afula. 'Arafat clearly stated: "I gave  instructions on how to write the statement." In this way, he  showed his intention not to act the way the United States wants  him to.    Noting the relationship between worsening public security  and  the delay in negotiations after the random shooting in Hebron,  'Arafat said "a failure to realize peace will create confusion  in the most important strategic area in the world." He then  stressed the "responsibility of international society."  However, it seems the chairman's intention is to break the  deadlock by calling for intervention by the United States.</p>

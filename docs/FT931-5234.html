			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: Power moves to Town and Country - Off the Wall THE Town and Country is everyone's favourite London rock venue. Upstairs there are half hearted delusions towards grandeur; downstairs is a snake pit but with enough space at the back for voyeurs to watch the crazies pogo into delirium while carefully avoiding a slippage on the slurped lager. Best of all are the acts, a random mix of the up-and-coming playing their first big concert and the 'whatever happened to's re-emerging from obscurity. So when news came that the T &amp; C was to close on March 24 there was an popular outcry. Now that the Kentish Town venue has been saved there is muffled bemusement. The T &amp; C is a listed building, but the landlords, the Murphy roadbuilding family and the heart of London's so-called Murphia, seemed determined to get rid of the successful tenant of seven years, and fellow Irishman, Mick Whelan. The new tenant is Vince Power, also Irish and now boss of a chain of London music venues, embracing the Mean Fiddler, Jazz Cafe, Subterrania, and the Grand. He will re-open the T &amp; C as the Forum in late April with much the same programme policy. So what has all the fuss been about? Power expresses amazement. 'There was a problem between tenant and landlord and the landlord wanted a new tenant. Music fans should be rejoicing. We give cooler beer and hotter music in a better atmosphere.' Certainly Power has a successful track record. The Jazz Cafe, also rescued from threatened closure, is now packed; the Grand in Clapham has overcome licensing problems and opens on March 24; and in July he enters the tricky area of outdoor festivals, at Long Marsden airfield near Stratford on Avon. * One of Christie's best sniffer-outs of considerable trifles, Simon Dickinson, has left to work as a dealer in Old Masters. It was Dickinson who identified Titian's 'Venus and Adonis', which the Getty bought for Pounds 7.5m, and his unerring nose for a masterpiece hidden behind grime and over-painting will be much missed in the auction house. A rich overseas backer obviously thinks that Old Masters will be the Impressionists of the 1990s and is providing the millions to back Dickinson, with partner David Ker. The firm will operate from premises in 58 Jermyn Street but will be low profile and mainly deal with private clients, both as buyers and sellers.</p>

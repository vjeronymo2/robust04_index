			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWN DELIVERS HEALTH KICK TO CIGARETTE VENDING MACHINES  </P> <P> Cigarette vending machines will be snuffed out in this St. Paul suburb in 90  days by an ordinance passed by the City Council, a move that one health expert  calls the first of its kind in the country.  </P> <P> The measure, passed 4 to 1 Tuesday, calls for the removal of the 19 cigarette  vending machines in bars, gas stations, convenience stores and apartment and  office buildings in this town of 24,000.  </P> <P> The law was backed by the city Fire Department, several University of Minnesota  researchers, the White Bear Lake School Board and a coalition of business  leaders.  </P> <P> "We believe White Bear Lake is the first city in the country to ban cigarette  vending machines," Jean Forster, assistant professor of public health at the  University of Minnesota, said after the vote.  </P> <P> Council member Bill Bennis, in casting his dissent, said: "Machines are not  attacking the real problem. If merchants are sincere about this, they'd take  cigarettes out of their place of business."  </P> <P> A local group called the Tobacco Free Youth Project, whose members have  interviewed juvenile smokers, maintains that 93% get their cigarettes from  machines.  </P> <P> Eighteen months ago, White Bear Lake police started arresting juveniles caught  smoking in public. So far, 155 teen-agers have been arrested and ordered to  attend a two-night lecture and discussion session at the White Bear Lake  Community Counseling Center.  </P></p>

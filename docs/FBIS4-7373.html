			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- The International  Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea (Cilreco)  brought out a special issue of its bulletin on the occasion of  the birthday of the great leader President Kim Il-song.    Under the title "Highest Homage to President Kim Il-song on  His 82nd Birthday" the bulletin gives sub-titles "We Wish  President Kim Il-song good health and a long life", "Role and  Feats of President Kim Il-song for the Accomplishment of the  Cause of Korea's Independent and Peaceful Reunification" and  "President Kim Il-song's Just and Feasible Proposal for Founding  the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo".    It pays highest homage to President Kim Il-song who is  making  contributions to the cause for human progress and building a  peaceful world.    His proposals for Korean reunification opened up realistic  prospects for ending the tragedy of division, notes the bulletin.    It stresses that more widespread international solidarity  movements would be conducted in support of the Korean people's  just struggle to carry into effect the 10-point programme, a  grand programme of peaceful reunification through the great  unity of the whole Korean nation.    On the same occasion, bulletins were issued by the  Guyana-Korea Friendship Association and the Zimbabwe-Korea  solidarity and Friendship Association.</p>

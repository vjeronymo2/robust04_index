			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Thirteen days before the opening of the national  dialogue conference, initiatives and statements calling for  optimism are being made to ease the situation and raise people's  hopes.    Following the encouraging measures, particularly in the  security sphere, that the spokesman of the National Dialogue  Commission revealed yesterday, four parties submitted a document  to the Higher State Council [HCE] and the National Dialogue  Commission [NDC]. This document includes measures to ensure the  success of the national dialogue. Mahfoud Mannan has the  details:    [Mannan] Today, the national radio received a copy of a  document signed by four political parties: the National  Liberation Front [FLN], the Movement for Democracy in Algeria,  HAMAS, and al-Nahdah.    The document contains supporting measures to ensure the  success of the national dialogue. The aforementioned parties  addressed it to the HCE and the NDC.    The document includes 14 measures, among which are: adopting  measures for the benefit of the leading members of the Islamic  Salvation Front [FIS] to allow them to participate in making the  national dialogue successful; closing the security centers and  releasing people under administrative detention who have no  charges against them or have been sentenced for their opinions;  easing the security measures ensuing from the state of emergency  to pave the way for lifting them; abolishing the restrictions  imposed on political activity; suspending the work of the  special courts to pave the way for the abolition of emergency  courts and laws; ceasing raids and different types of  infringement; investigating torture crimes; respecting the  freedom of the press; return of the suspended newspapers; and  putting an end to the harassment against journalists on account  of their opinion.    A short while ago, colleague Chaabane Ouleki talked on the  phone with al-Nahdah Movement leader Shaykh Djaballah and asked  him about the content of this document.    [Begin recording] [Djaballah] We submitted the document with  a sincere desire to provide a suitable atmosphere and the  necessary conditions for the success of the national dialogue.  We therefore believe that solutions to the crises the country  is experiencing must be found only through national dialogue.  But we see that the dialogue is still at an impasse. Thus, we  have been pressing since the start of the national dialogue, not  only from today, from the first meeting with the HCE and in the  different meetings, for the need to adopt measures to help the  national dialogue succeed and to restore the people's peace of  mind. What the NDC announced yesterday represents the first  useful and encouraging steps, but these are insufficient.    [Ouleki] Mr. Djaballah, you said the dialogue was still at  an  impasse, but we have noticed that the sides that took part in  putting forward this issue, also participated in the meetings  with the NDC and put forward these demands. Have you discussed  among yourselves the issue of participating or not participating  in the national dialogue conference, because we are a few days  away from it?    [Djaballah] We were extremely frank in our last meeting with  the NDC. In principle, we rejected the pilot study proposed by  the NDC and rejected it for objective and extremely precise  reasons. We have presented our point of view verbally and also  presented it in writing.    [Ouleki] You say that the dialogue has reached a dead end,  but if we read some of the demands mentioned in the platform,  they are nearly either about to be implemented or included in  the preliminary text of the study; for instance, the  cancellation of restrictions on political activity, easing the  security measures, respecting the citizen's basic rights and  general freedom, and respecting the nation's feelings in the  mass media. These ideas, or the spirit of these points, are  almost available in the pilot study and could have been  addressed in more detail either before or after the conference.    [Djaballah] Yes. In truth, there are positive issues, but  they are insufficient in our opinion; for instance, of the  negative issues present in the pilot study presented by the NDC,  I can mention that an agreement was reached with the NDC to  exclude the discussion of the program for society [political  program on the nature of the regime to be established], but it  was noticed today that the document they presented has dealt  with the most important constituents of the program for society  through what has been mentioned in the preamble, aims, and  guarantees. We could mention numerous examples to support this  but it would take too long. For instance, it was noticed that  the study did not aim at dealing with the situation in the  country as much as solving the problems faced by the current  authorities. This is in complete contradiction with what has  been agreed on regarding the need to direct all efforts to solve  Algeria's crises. For example, the study dealt with numerous  issues in general and abstract terms, a matter that caused great  confusion on the implicit meanings. This is bound to open the  door wide for different interpretations and bad explanations now  and in the future.    [Ouleki] But Mr. Djaballah, even in political activity, if  each side puts forward its own conditions on the basis of which  it decides whether to participate or not, is it easy and simple  to satisfy all the conditions, even though they might be  contradictory, divergent, or (?incoherent), if there were no  reciprocal concessions by the sides to the dialogue?    [Djaballah] This is a valid question. This is why we have  made a distinction between the administrative and technical  issues and those connected with the nature of the important  political choices. We said that issues of an administrative and  technical nature could be settled by voting. As for the issues  dealing with important political choices, they should be  avoided. We called for avoiding these type of issues because it  would be difficult to reach a firm decision for two main  reasons, the first of which is the difficulty of the subject,  and the second is the brevity of the period and the difficulty  of the circumstances. Thus, I think that if the study  restricted itself to the issues of an administrative and  technical nature, the chances of its success would be greater.  This is what we wish.    [Ouleki] Mr. Djaballah, will the parties that signed the  platform document participate collectively or be absent  collectively in the conference, or is the issue of participating  or abstaining from the conference a matter that concerns each  party? Have you discussed this issue or this possibility?    [Djaballah] We have not discussed this issue until now. I  think that the issue concerns each party. I think that.    [Ouleki] In other words, irrespective of the response to the  demands present in the platform?    [Djaballah] I think that the issue concerns each party. [end  recording]</p>

However, beggars are starting to appear on the streets of  Havana, and the food shortage is a common subject of discussion.  According to reporter Jukka Rislakki from HELSINGIN SANOMAT, a  month's worth of food coupons last for two weeks, and for the  remainder of the month, the Cubans must scrounge for food  anywhere they can or buy it on the black market.    In the morning, residents of central Havana and hotel guests  are awakened by the crowing of roosters. The culprits can be  found on the flat roofs of apartment buildings, where the Cubans  keep their living, cackling food stores. Pigs and goats can be  found in the backyard mazes.    Every day, teacher Alejandro Valdes works with his  "livestock" on the roof, from where he has a view of the sea. He  has a dozen hens, a few chicks, and a few rabbits are huddled in  a cage. The door leading to the roof from the attic is locked  with a bicycle chain.    "I listen for thieves at night and stay awake with my  machete," said Alejandro.    The teacher brings feed for his animals from his job, as  well  as from the park and the port. "When grain ships discharge their  cargo, I am there collecting corn that has fallen to the ground.  And I am not alone there," he said.  <H5>  Food Shortage Topic of Discussion </H5>   Valdes started keeping animals last May. Now the family and  its closest relatives get three to four eggs a day--equaling the  official monthly ration for a Cuban--and often they also get  meat. "Meat and eggs are rationed in the stores and otherwise  they are too expensive, and we have no dollars," he added.    "The hens are of good native stock. In this neighborhood,  many people also keep goats and pigs," said Valdes.    In Cuba and abroad there is a debate on whether Cubans are  starving and whether the food shortage is affecting their health.    "People starve to death," complained an expatriate woman,  who  had been visiting her native country. "It seems to me that they  eat very little and look very skinny," she continued.    "Have you seen any dying people on our streets?" asked  Governor Jose Hernandez, on his part, and answered: "Of course  not! We are not a people dying of starvation, but a people  defending its accomplishments."    But beggars are starting to appear on the streets, and the  food shortage is a common subject of discussion. The shortage of  vitamins is acknowledged, and last spring the government  exhorted people to eat the seeds, flowers, and leaves of certain  plants.    "No hay, haven't got it," is the familiar response in a  Cuban  store. As the skimpy card ration is not sufficient, even for  half a month, the remainder of the food must be acquired on the  black market or -- if one has dollars -- from a hard currency  store.  <H5>  The Brave Become Restaurateurs </H5>   Food can also be acquired through barter, or one can grow it  oneself. At certain times, using a special permit, city dwellers  may visit a canteen in the area, if there is one.    Last fall, dozens of "dollar restaurants" cropped up in  cramped apartments and backyards in Havana, after the government  started to allow strictly regulated private businesses. The  restaurants have become enormously popular.    A licensed entrepreneur may now make his living in about 100  professions; from shoe polisher and artisan to hairdresser, taxi  driver, and repairman. The hiring of outside labor is  prohibited, and taxes must be paid. A Cuban with a university  degree may not become a private entrepreneur.    Consequently, some brave souls started to sell meals.  Addresses are provided by helpful Havanans, but finding a dark  restaurant on an ordinary weeknight proved surprisingly  difficult.    Finally we found the neat kitchen of Reinaldo and Sofia at  the end of a dark alley. There our host and hostess were setting  the table.    Preparing food for surprise guests took an hour, and  Reinaldo  poured us some wine made of sugarcane. The meal proved to be  worth waiting for: delicious ham, rice, and beans for two  dollars per person. Somewhere else the meal would have cost  about 10 dollars.    Reinaldo, who is a cook by profession, told us that he buys  supplies in the countryside and only caters to "reliable"  customers.  <H5>  Threat of Fines or Imprisonment </H5>   Restaurateurs are risking the punishment of fines or  imprisonment. The police are supposedly difficult to deal with;  others can be taken care of with a small bribe: "If the CDR (The  Revolutionary Defense Committee) happens to come and inspect the  place, I'll offer them a free meal."    The government has clarified the rules for private  entrepreneurs and has stipulated that they are not allowed to  sell perishable foodstuffs, meals, and alcoholic beverages. Only  kiosks that sell, for example, bread products, beverages in  containers, and candy are permitted. We were told that, during  the last term of the parliament, the police effected stronger  enforcement and raided numerous restaurants.  <H5>  Cuban One-Month Ration </H5>   For 35 years Cubans have lived in a controlled economy with  rationing coupons. Below is a list of items included in a  person's ration for a month, which can be purchased at  reasonable cost, in pesos, from a state store. In part, the  rations are theoretical, as everything is not always available.  The availability of staples--rice, cooking oil, eggs, and  chicken--has been poor lately.    Six pounds of rice, 8 ounces of white beans, 3 lbs white  sugar, 3 lbs brown sugar, 1/2 lb cooking oil, 1/2 lb chicken,  4-5 eggs, 1 lb picadillo, made of soy, blood, and meat, 3/4 lb  goose liver, and once a day, a piece of bread the size of a  fist. A coffee package is included once every 15 days.    A small bar of soap, a tube of toothpaste per family, a  matchbox, two bottles of household alcohol.    A pound is less than half a kilogram and an ounce is 28  grams.    In reality, it has been a long time since the following  products have been available: butter, milk, cheese, meat,  potatoes, black beans, vegetables, fruit, spices, beer, rum,  chocolate, soap, laundry soap, and toilet paper. Shoes are  rarely available.    Milk is available for children under age seven. Pregnant  women and sick people are guaranteed special diets.</p>

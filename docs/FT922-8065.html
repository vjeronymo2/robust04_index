			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Genoa (3) - Families dominate the scene / Business, For many, Genoa still means steel and shipbuilding, though both have shrunk beyond recognition THE traditional split in Genoa's business community between a public sector concentrated in engineering and a private sector specialising in shipping and trade has been eroded as a result of the crisis in heavy industry and the part-privatisation of the local steel industry. But the broad distinction is still valid. In spite of repeated shrinkage, the giant IRI state holding company remains Genoa's biggest employer. Its Finmeccanica engineering arm controls Ansaldo, the city's leading heavy engineering group, whose roots under the Perrone family go back to the early days of Italy's industrialisation. Ansaldo has taken some heavy knocks in recent years, notably after the 1987 referendum ban on nuclear power, making the company's nuclear power division redundant virtually overnight. In spite of that and competition from bigger international rivals such as Siemens and ABB, Ansaldo has bounced back. Its Genoese operations are in energy, transportation - especially rail equipment and signalling - and heavy engineering. Finmeccanica's other big Genoese offshoot is the Elsag Bailey precision engineering group. Often presented as one of Italy's high-tech jewels, the reality is slightly less extravagant. However, the company, which makes a range of specialised equipment for factory automation, mechanised letter sorting and various other purposes, has grown rapidly through acquisitions. After buying the US Bailey group, more than half of sales now come from abroad, a point stressed heavily in the group's stock market flotation last year. For many, Genoa still means steel and shipbuilding, though both have shrunk beyond recognition. The lavishly renovated headquarters of Ilva, the state steel group, in an Art-Deco palace in the posh Carignano district, must count as one of Italy's most impressive corporate headquarters with its starkly contrasting white interiors, black leather furniture and halogen lighting. Ilva's remaining industrial activities, based in the Cornigliano industrial zone west of the port, are another matter. Most basic steelmaking has long been moved to southern Italy, while part of the Cornigliano plant has been privatised. Plans are now in hand to convert much of the remaining industrial wasteland into a business park for smaller industrial and service companies as part of Ilva's ambitious but controversial 'Utopia' project. Most closely identified of all the public-sector companies with the Columbus Exhibition is IRI's Italimpianti subsidiary, which masterminded the L500bn building and general contracting project for the Expo site. Based in a distinctive pencil-shaped tower (the Mattitone) near the western docks, Italimpianti was merged this year with Italstat, another IRI subsidiary, into a new group called Iritecna. The aim was to create a large Italian group combining engineering, contracting and construction skills and able to compete with foreign rivals such as Germany's Mannesmann and Philipp Holzmann on big overseas infrastructure projects. However, Iritecna has so far failed to emerge from the political controversy and management in-fighting that mar many of its public-sector counterparts. Many of its problems, like theirs, stem from having too many bosses and criss-crossing responsibilities. So while the dream behind Iritecna remains laudable, it will only be realised if IRI's chairman Mr Franco Nobili, who has a building background, manages to knock heads together and unblock the difficulties which have so far paralysed what should be Italy's champion in the international building and general contracting field. Genoa is no longer the Italian base for the international oil majors, though the port remains the country's leading terminal for importing refined products, which are then distributed nationally or sent on via a direct pipeline to Switzerland and Germany. The only big private-sector oil operator left is the Garrone family's ERG group. Mr Riccardo Garrone, the chairman, is a pugnacious 56-year-old who assumed control as a youngster after his father died in 1963. Under him, ERG has grown into Italy's biggest private-sector oil group, with more than 2,000 petrol stations and about 6 per cent of the market. But even its Genoese activities have slimmed down in recent years. Though based in the towering World Trade Centre by the docks, most of its industrial operations are now elsewhere, with a big refinery in Sicily and other offices in Rome. Genoa remains the nerve centre for top management, concentrated in the family holding company. Mr Garrone himself, a keen hunter, is an entrenched critic of the city's left-wing politicians, whom he accuses of having caused its decline. At last month's general election, he failed to win a seat in the Senate as a candidate for the small Republican party. However, his local prestige - and lavish spending, according to his critics - was enough to lift the party's share of the vote to 15 per cent from around 4 per cent normally, in spite of competition from Mr Guido Carli, Italy's treasury minister, and other candidates. Genoa's foremost representative in shipping and trade is the privately-owned Camelli group. Somewhat confusing in its structure after a spate of recent takeovers of small stock market quoted companies, it now comprises five main branches. Camelli concentrates on oil trading, as well as having some refining and distribution capacity. Gerolimich, a quoted subsidiary, controls various industrial stakes, both directly and through Unione Manifatture, which is also quoted and is best known for owning the company making Sweda cash registers. Other recent acquisitions include Navigazione Alta Italia (NAI) in shipping and Rodriquez, a shipbuilder famous for its fast catamarans. Jointly owned by the Camelli family and by Mr Luigi Regis Milano, who masterminds its affairs, critics say the group now needs to simplify its structure after the string of takeovers. Meanwhile, trading in the shares of a number of the quoted subsidiaries is still suspended. Among Genoa's other top private companies are the Costa group, now most familiar for its cruise ships which ply the Caribbean and Mediterranean. Costa Crociere, quoted on the bourse, is all that is left of what was once one of Italy's foremost private companies, which rivalled and even surpassed giants such as Fiat and Pirelli. Mr Angelo Costa, a former boss, ranks as one of the most famous former chairmen of Italy's Confindustria employers' federation in the early 1950s. The group's decline is closely associated with that of the port in the 1970s. But the cruise business has led a partial comeback in recent years and resulted in a string of orders for huge new vessels - albeit at the cost of a substantial rise in debt. Completing the list of the city's big shipping and trading families are the Clericis, whose link with former British partners, the Coes, is enshrined in the name of their Coeclerici group. Their Bulkitalia subsidiary owns a fleet of bulk carriers, which used to be jointly owned with the big Ferruzzi group. However, Mr Giacomo Clerici, universally known as Jack, bought out Ferruzzi's then boss, Mr Raul Gardini, to take sole control. Now in his 80s, Jack Clerici, whose mother was British, ranks as one of Genoa's grand old men. His international links, particularly with the former Soviet Union, have won him a reputation akin to that of the legendary Mr Armand Hammer in the US. Mr Giovanni Battista (Gaimba) Parodi is probably Genoa's least known businessman to outsiders. But for many Italians from the city and beyond, he counts as one of the richest men in the country. His operations include the quoted Acquedotto de Ferrari Galliera group, which distributes half the city's drinking water, and a number of activities in the construction business, as well as a range of financial holdings, including stakes in big quoted companies such as Pirelli. The Parodi family's Genoese roots go far back. The former Banca Parodi was one of the regional institutions swept up in the founding of the Bank of Italy, and Mr Parodi is today on the board of the central bank. Another of the grand old men of Genoa, Mr Parodi is every inch the retiring millionaire. Famous for his modest lifestyle, his quirks reportedly include being chauffeured in a tiny Fiat mini-car and occupying the former servants quarters in a family-owned Palazzo in the majestic via Garibaldi. The Romanengo family has come to prominence outside Genoa only relatively recently. Last year, its Sci property group was floated on the bourse. Having already made a mark on the city's skyline with developments such as the World Trade Centre and other buildings in the big Centro San Benigno project, Sci, in which Mr Garrone's ERG group now has a 12.75 per cent stake, is now extending its property development activities abroad.</p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> QUIRKY SI NEWHOUSE BECOMES A MEDIA POWER;  </P> <P> PUBLISHING: THE OWNER OF THE NEW YORKER, VOGUE AND RANDOM HOUSE BUILDS HIS  EMPIRE THROUGH EXPERIMENTATION. IN THE PROCESS SOME HEADS ROLL.  </P> <P> It was early 1984, and a new magazine called Vanity Fair was suffering a birth  agony of dwindling advertising, anemic circulation and regular editorial  makeovers.  </P> <P> On the fifth floor of his office in midtown Manhattan, ad director Douglas  Johnston had finally admitted to himself that he didn't have a strategy for  saving the magazine. And he was hoping -- fervently -- that nine floors above  him, company Chairman Samuel I. (Si) Newhouse Jr. did.  </P> <P> Johnston put the question to Jonathan Newhouse, the cousin of Si Newhouse, who  was then Vanity Fair's business manager.  </P> <P> "Is there a plan?" Johnston asked.  </P> <P> "There is no plan," Newhouse said flatly.  </P> <P> There has been no grand plan at Advance Publications, the nation's largest  private media company, since Si Newhouse and his brother Donald took control  after the death of their father 10 years ago. Rather, there has been constant  experimentation, change and growth. Over the decade, this formula has made Si  Newhouse, the most reluctant of public men, one of the most powerful and feared  figures in the publishing world.  </P> <P> With a famously quirky style, the shy Newhouse has expanded the five Conde Nast  women's magazines into a 15-publication chain that includes Parade, the New  Yorker, Vogue, Glamour and Vanity Fair, which has grown to prosperity after its  early travail. Random House, bought for $65 million in 1980, has increased  sales 20-fold and is considered by some to be the nation's most important book  publisher.  </P> <P> The privately owned Advance realm also includes the 31 newspapers, broadcast  and cable-TV operations overseen by Donald Newhouse. In all, the Newhouse  properties are worth an estimated $8 billion to $10 billion, making Si and  Donald the fifth-richest men in the nation, according to Forbes magazine.  </P> <P> The magazines and book operations have given the chain its visibility, through  the glamour that surrounds some of them and through the publicity they receive  when Newhouse orders a change of command or direction. And while turnover is  notoriously high in the publishing world, Newhouse has sent heads rolling with  a regularity that has made him the Alice's Queen of Hearts of the trade.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Newhouse surprised the book world by announcing the  departure of Robert Bernstein, the literary mandarin who had run Random House  for 25 years. In the past three years, Newhouse has installed three editors at  HG magazine and three at Self, and he ousted Grace Mirabella, who had presided  over Vogue for 17 years. In 1986, provoking a very public protest from the  staff, he fired William Shawn, editor and guiding intelligence of the New  Yorker for a generation.  </P> <P> "Change is change," said Newhouse, unapologetic. "It doesn't happen slowly."  </P> <P> Newhouse's habits suggest more a man trying to build his own fortune than one  who inherited wealth from his father, as he did. He arrives at his spare office  at Conde Nast's headquarters about 4:30 a.m. and meets with top managers as  early as 5:30. He may hold the record for the shortest New York business  lunches, often finishing a meeting with a subordinate at the Four Seasons  restaurant within 45 minutes.  </P> <P> Newhouse, who finished three years of college at Syracuse University, rarely  wears a tie to work, and for a recent interview wore a purple sweat shirt over  a cotton polo shirt with the New Yorker insignia. "I saw him in Paris wearing  this sweater with a hole in the sleeve that made him look like an out-of-work  messenger," said Peter Diamandis, a former Newhouse employee and head of the  Diamandis Communications magazine chain. "He's not awed by wealth."  </P> <P> In the interview, Newhouse spoke softly, sometimes nearly inaudibly, and paused  at length.  </P> <P> When he has a question for his lieutenants at Conde Nast, Newhouse, who is 62,  writes it out on a scrap of legal paper and dispatches it to have an answer  written below and returned. Sometimes the notes swirl down in a storm, an event  insiders call "the yellow rain."  </P> <P> Newhouse's publishing operations are highly decentralized. Because it's  privately held, Advance doesn't have to disclose financial details and can  absorb losses on new magazines or overhauls for years without having to worry  about restive shareholders.  </P> <P> The company doesn't hedge its bets with lengthy market research. Typically, Si  Newhouse will consult a small number of senior executives such as Alexander  Liberman, Conde Nast's editorial director and longtime confidant, and then act.  </P> <P> In a tax case that the Internal Revenue Service has brought against the family  over the tax bill on the estate of Samuel I. Newhouse Sr., Si Newhouse was  cross-examined on just how the family makes key decisions. It was difficult to  explain, he said, frustrated: "It's a little bit like love."  </P> <P> How effective has this management style been? Admirers contend that Si Newhouse  has shown that he has few peers in revitalizing old publishing properties.  "He's an expert at polishing and restoring old jewels," said John Mack Carter,  director of magazine development at Hearst Corp.  </P> <P> Others claim that his frequent and messy dismissals show a lack of skill with  people, contending that Advance's management apparatus has begun to creak under  the strain of its size.  </P> <P> Some of the critics believe Random House is now facing problems that  demonstrate the risks in moving too fast. The difficulty, they assert, was the  company's acquisition of two British publishing houses and Crown Publishing  Group, a huge marketer and publisher.  </P> <P> The British companies weren't complementary and, unbeknownst to the buyers,  Crown was losing surprising sums, said an executive close to Random House.  "They didn't do their 'due diligence' diligently," he said, speculating that  Crown's ills have helped dropped earnings of the overall book group to a meager  2% to 3% of revenue, from a typical 8% to 10%.  </P> <P> When Bernstein couldn't correct the problems, the executive said, "Si figured  it was time for a change." Bernstein's replacement, Alberto Vitale, earned a  reputation as a skilled financial manager and cost cutter during his last job  as chief executive of Bantam Doubleday Dell.  </P> <P> Newhouse wouldn't comment when asked whether earnings problems led to  Bernstein's departure. "We don't have to talk about earnings and I'm not very  interested in other peoples' speculation," Newhouse said.  </P> <P> Another jolt came last year when Newhouse overhauled Vogue, which is by far the  most valuable fashion magazine, with ad revenue of a whopping $88 million last  year. Apparently shocked by the success of Elle magazine and other competitors,  Newhouse decided Vogue needed a fresher, younger look.  </P> <P> He installed Anna Wintour, the British-born editor who had led a faltering  attempt to revitalize HG, Conde Nast's home decor magazine once known as House  &amp; Garden.  </P> <P> Some predicted disaster when ousted editor Grace Mirabella started her own  magazine, with her own name, and aimed at the over-40 woman Vogue seemed to be  neglecting. On Seventh Avenue, the fashion advertisers who depend on Vogue  seemed unsettled by the changes.  </P> <P> But evidently they have adjusted, for Vogue's ad revenue is up 17% for the  first nine months of the year, after a 10% year-to-year rise in 1988. Vogue "is  back on track," acknowledged competitor Diamandis, whose company owns Elle.  </P> <P> Newhouse is unquestionably on track with Vanity Fair, the namesake of the  celebrated society magazine of the 1930s.  </P> <P> Announced in 1980, the magazine had gone through two editors, two publishers  and a series of face lifts by early 1984. The thoughts and life styles of  intellectuals were featured in one incarnation; another dwelt on the jet set's  Manhattan party-going. ("It was the daily journal of Eurotrash," said New  Yorker writer Calvin Trillin.)  </P> <P> The magazine's fortunes began to change in April, 1984, when the current  editor, British-born Tina Brown, began to give Vanity Fair a clear focus,  emphasizing show business personalities along with articles on weightier  subjects. Ad revenue has increased an average of 60% a year since 1984.  </P> <P> If the company doesn't have an elaborately plotted strategy, said Vanity Fair  Publisher Johnston, "there is a vision. It's Si's vision."  </P> <P> The most publicized upheaval in Newhouse's empire came at the New Yorker, the  admired literary weekly he purchased in 1985 for $200 million.  </P> <P> When Newhouse fired Editor William Shawn, 154 staff members signed a letter of  protest that asked Newhouse's chosen successor, Robert Gottlieb, not to take  the job.  </P> <P> Both Newhouse and his father had coveted the magazine for years, but it may  have proved a more difficult investment than he expected.  </P> <P> While circulation is up 25% from 1985 and advertising revenue has advanced  about 7% in the first nine months of this year, many in the industry believe it  is not making money and that more change is inevitable.  </P> <P> Many expect Newhouse will be forced to order major editorial changes to attract  enough younger readers to guarantee the magazine's future.  </P> <P> Some believe that, at the very least, Newhouse will have to add more pictures  and more stories tailored to the impatient readers of the video age; others  predict that only by "softening" the magazine -- perhaps with Vanity Fair-style  glitz -- will Newhouse be able to give the New Yorker the needed boost.  </P> <P> New Yorker President Steven Florio insisted that the magazine is already on the  right track, but he acknowledged the difficulty of running an institution that  is so closely watched.  </P> <P> "It's sort of an uncomfortable fishbowl existence," he said. "If Bob (Gottlieb)  makes changes, some people scream, 'They're changing it!' If he doesn't do  anything, some people scream, 'They're not changing it enough!' "  </P> <P> Is Newhouse now satisfied with the New Yorker's progress? "The concept of  complete satisfaction is like the concept of truth," Newhouse said. "You can  move toward it, but you never entirely get there."  </P> <P> But if rapid change is the norm, some of his lieutenants say they understand  the ground rules.  </P> <P> "If my figures were down for a year, I understand he'd be lunching other  editors," said Vanity Fair's Brown. "That's the way the game is played."  </P> <P> The lieutenants who do have Newhouse's confidence are well rewarded. Top  editors at Conde Nast are sometimes given automobiles and clothing allowances  in addition to salaries that are among the best in the industry.  </P> <P> "If there's a morale problem here, it hasn't made it hard for me to find  people," Newhouse said.  </P> <P> In addition to his role at the book and magazine businesses, Newhouse has other  company duties, including attending to the IRS suit that may pose the the  biggest single threat to the family fortune.  </P> <P> The case revolves around the value of the 1,000 shares of common stock that S.  I. Sr. bequeathed to his sons when he died.  </P> <P> The family has contended that the shares didn't represent the full worth of the  company, since other family members, who held preferred shares, got an equal  say in the running of the company.  </P> <P> The IRS has maintained that since the bequest included the sole voting shares,  they represented control, and the full estate should be taxed.  </P> <P> The agency has scaled back its original demand but still wants $609 million  plus interest from the family.  </P> <P> A tax court judge may rule on the case early next year, though some observers  still expect a settlement in the interim.  </P> <P> There are now about 20 Newhouses in some role at the company, including 10 in  management positions.  </P> <P> Among them is Steven Newhouse, who is publisher of the Jersey Journal daily  newspaper and was rumored to be in the running for the Random House job.  </P> <P> Si Newhouse said the family hasn't decided who will succeed him when he retires  and denied that there's any competition between members of the next generation.  </P> <P> "The transition will be smooth," he predicted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE NEWHOUSE MEDIA EMPIRE  </P> <P> Newspapers: 28 dailies, primarily in the Midwest and East, with total  circulation of 3.4 million. Largest ones include the Cleveland Plain Dealer,  the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and Newark (N.J.) Star Ledger.  </P> <P> Cable TV: Operations in Syracuse, N.Y.; Paramus, N.J., and Atlanta. Subscribers  total 1.15 million.  </P> <P> Magazines: 15 publications with total circulation of more than 43 million,  including Parade, with weekly circulation of 32 million. Other magazines  include the New Yorker, Vogue, House &amp; Garden, Vanity Fair, Conde Nast  Traveler.  </P> <P> Books: 15 publishing houses, including Alfred A. Knopf, Random House and  Fodor's Travel Guides.  </P> <P> Source: Audit Bureau of Circulations, Paul Kagan Associates, Gale Directory of  Publications, Barron's  </P> <P> </P> <P> ADVANCE PUBLICATIONS AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> MAGAZINES  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.32IN:3.10IN:2.88IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Publication  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Frequency  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Paid Circulation  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> New Yorker  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Weekly  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 564,892  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Parade  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Weekly  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 32,818,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Vogue  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Monthly  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,281,597  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mademoiselle  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Monthly  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,297,938  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Glamour  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Monthly  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,310,970  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Vanity Fair  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Monthly  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 417,904  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> House &amp; Garden  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Monthly  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 572,544  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bride's  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bimonthly  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 371,019  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> GQ  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Monthly  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 662,801  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Gourmet  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Monthly  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 817,782  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Self  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Monthly  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,124,129  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Woman  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Seven times a year  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 486,726  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Conde Nast Traveler  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Monthly  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 853,490  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: Gale Directory of Publications, 1989  </P> <P> </P> <P> BOOK PUBLISHING  </P> <P> Random House  </P> <P> Alfred A.

This was the aim which its  leadership, together with the Russian Federation, had hoped for  during previous weeks.    Kazakhstani Prime Minister Tershchenko, in an exclusive  interview to correspondents of ITAR-TASS and KAZTAG said: "This  demarche is explained by a necessity for a much more thorough  preparation for the Moscow summit. It certainly demands  additional time and effort.    The decisions made last year at the Ashgabat summit  instilled  hope for development of integrational processes in the CIS, but  in reality implementation of the agreements reached on creation  of an economic union is extremely slow. The economic situation  in practically all CIS countries continues to deteriorate. In  order to prevent the negative processes from acquiring a scale  of catastrophe, a dynamic breakthrough is currently needed more  than ever before toward a qualitatively new state of affairs in  all main guidelines of our cooperation."    "That is why, Tereshchenko goes on to say, we in Kazakhstan  think it is extremely important to discuss a number of top  priority issues at the forthcoming summit. First, issues  concerning acceleration of the creation of a common customs  space and zones of free trade. It is also necessary to take  urgent measures to commission the interstate bank, which was set  up over a year ago but is still inoperative. For this end, in  our opinion, it is necessary to set up a payment center for  settling payments through this bank and later to reorganize it  into a currency union on the basis of introduction of a  supranational currency. This way will once and forever overcome  the crisis of payments and normalize payment and credit  relations between the CIS states."    "It is also time to set up a coordination organ of the CIS  in  Moscow. Without it, and this has been already proven in  practice, neither agreements nor any other enforceable  enactments will work as they are, and the economic union will  remain, as before, on paper. This organ can be called a  committee, a council or any other name, but it should by all  means accumulate in it the highest intellectual potential and  relevant research centers, including the CIS statistical board."    The Prime minister said in conclusion: "I submitted these  and other suggestions in mid-February to the head of the Russian  Federation Government, Chernomyrdin, who is chairman of the  Council of the CIS Heads of State. As far as I know, the  Russian Federation and a number of other countries are currently  actively elaborating and developing them. Thus, it is quite  possible to expect that the forthcoming April summit will be a  real milestone on our difficult, dramatic, tense and yet hopeful  way to a real and prosperous economic union."</p>

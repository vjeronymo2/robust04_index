			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Baturin, Russian presidential aide on </F> national security, by announcer Sergey Medvedev; from the  "Novosti" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Medvedev] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, this week the State  Duma did not after all agree to allocate 55 billion [currency  not specified] to defense needs and military theoreticians and  military leaders are saying that the lack of nearly 15 billion  does not allow them to either buy in new equipment or even  repair ships. If that is the case, will this hit the our  country's national security interests?    [Baturin] Here, the level of the budget that is now set is  the minimum and maybe even less than the minimum, and the main  danger for the defense capacity lies in the question: Are we  able to maintain our high technology, our high technology  production? In other words, those things in which we are for  the moment ahead of other countries. If we lose these, then the  damage to the defense capacity will be irreparable.    [Medvedev] The Security Council was due to meet this week.  What happened, Yuriy Mikhaylovich? Why did the meeting not take  place?    [Baturin] Nothing out of the ordinary took place. It is just  that three members of the Security Council were out of Moscow  and were unable to attend this meeting. Boris Nikolayevich  Yeltsin, as leader of the Security Council, postponed the  meeting to another day.    [Medvedev] What was the theme for the cancelled meeting?    [Baturin] The issue of Russia's borders and, in particular,  state border policy, the tasks of which were laid down by the  president at the meeting at the high command of the border  troops on 27 May.    [Medvedev] About the borders, more and more often we have  seen them being violated. I do not mean just in those parts of  the border where things are hot. Take for instance the recent  incident with the American Lockheed. We still do not know what  it was carrying on board.    [Baturin] I should tell you that the incident with the  Lockheed 130 ended without any particular losses materially or  in terms of status on both sides. But here, of course, we can  see a symptom of the lowering of the general level of security,  which is linked to the lowering of Russia's authority, something  our country can hardly be pleased about. In point of fact, for  a long time now the Russian air force has not flown to the  shores of the United States and has respected state borders.  The opposite, as you see, is taking place. This sort of  inequality does not help to reinforce the trust between our  countries of which we have so much need.</p>

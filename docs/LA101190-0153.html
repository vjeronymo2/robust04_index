			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: BELL GARDENS;  </P> <P> DEDICATION AND OPEN HOUSE TODAY FOR NEW FIRE STATION  </P> <P> A dedication ceremony and open house will be held at 10:30 a.m. today at the  new Bell Gardens fire station at 7100 Garfield Ave.  </P> <P> The station, which cost more than $1 million, replaces the Fry Street station  that was built in 1954 and was considered too small and too old by  firefighters.  </P> <P> "The old one was so bad, it's unbelievable," said Los Angeles County  firefighter paramedic Mark Delgado. "Things were falling apart. We could barely  walk around the rigs because there was not enough room. This one has so much  more room. It's a lot more comfortable. It's just real nice."  </P> <P> The new station, with 6,200 square feet, is twice the size of the old building  and is adjacent to the police station and City Hall in the Civic Center  complex. It can accommodate 10 firefighters and has a recreation room, showers,  lockers and a patio with a barbecue. The project was financed with city  redevelopment agency funds.  </P></p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Home Counties News at Pounds 94,000 Home Counties Newspapers Holdings achieved a turnround in its core publishing business where trading losses of Pounds 203,000 became profits of Pounds 331,000 in the first half of this year. However, rationalisation costs and exceptional profits resulted in the pre-tax figure falling from Pounds 546,000 to Pounds 94,000. Turnover was Pounds 12.1m, compared with Pounds 11.3m. The figure was after rationalisation costs of Pounds 296,000 relating to redundancy costs. Last time there was a Pounds 512,000 gain from the sale of Reuters shares. At the end of the period, cash balances at Pounds 1.91m were up on six months earlier. However interest received fell to Pounds 59,000 (Pounds 237,000). From earnings per share of 0.63p (3.66p) the interim dividend is being cut from 2.75p to 2p.</p>

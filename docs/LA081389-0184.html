			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AS OLD INDUSTRIES EBB, SAN PEDRO HOPES TOURISTS TURN THE TIDE  </P> <P> When Karl Sanger attended a travel industry trade show in Las Vegas in June, he  set up shop in the booth maintained by the Long Beach Visitors and Convention  Bureau, the people who try to attract tourists to Long Beach.  </P> <P> But Sanger wasn't promoting Long Beach.  </P> <P> He was promoting San Pedro.  </P> <P> As director of sales for the newly built Compri Hotel at the Cabrillo Marina,  Sanger aimed to persuade tour operators that San Pedro would make a fine base  for visitors who want to explore Southern California. And he had some success;  a British travel agent contracted for 3,600 room nights at the 226-room Compri.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Day Trips From Hotel  </P> <P> The British travelers will spend seven nights at the Compri. From there, they  will take day trips to Disneyland, Universal Studios and other tourist hot  spots. Said Sanger: "(The tour operator) has been putting his people in Anaheim  or he's been putting his people in downtown Los Angeles, and now he's going to  put them here."  </P> <P> Sanger's experience in Las Vegas illustrates two truths about San Pedro's  fledgling tourism trade. First is that the business is in its infancy -- so new  that Sanger was compelled to ally himself with nearby Long Beach, which boasts  such nationally known attractions as the Spruce Goose and Queen Mary.  </P> <P> But second -- and, San Pedro business leaders say, more important -- is the  potential for San Pedro to become a tourist destination, rather than a quick  stopping point.  </P> <P> </P> <P> European Ethnic Flavor  </P> <P> With a string of its own waterfront attractions -- Ports O' Call Village, the  World Cruise Center at the Port of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Maritime Museum  and Cabrillo Marine Museum, among others -- plus a European ethnic flavor that  is rare in other Southern California communities, San Pedro already attracts  hundreds of thousands of day-trippers each year. Many know San Pedro as the  point of embarkation for Catalina Island, Mexico and Alaska, among other  destinations.  </P> <P> And with the new Compri, as well as a 232-room Sheraton Hotel under  construction downtown and plans for a cruise center hotel under consideration  by port officials, San Pedro will have plenty of room to house those visitors.  </P> <P> "Tourism is a very viable (economic) alternative which has not been tapped in  San Pedro," said Leron Gubler, executive director of the San Pedro Peninsula  Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> "The potential is here," Gubler said. "We have easy freeway access, we're on  the water, we're the port, we have excellent restaurants. . . . In the past,  we've had people coming down for a day to go to Catalina or Ports O' Call  Village, but we've got to get them to stay."  </P> <P> Said John Clayton, who specializes in public relations for the tourism industry  and serves on the newly established San Pedro Tourism Council:  </P> <P> "I think coming to San Pedro offers a whole different experience. . . . How  wonderful to come down here instead of the smoggy interiors of Anaheim and some  of these other places. How wonderful to be in all this history and atmosphere  and still be freeway-close, and to be right on the water. . . . I think if it's  properly publicized it has enormous potential."  </P> <P> There are no comprehensive statistics that document how many people visit San  Pedro each year, how many stay overnight or how many might elect to stay in San  Pedro instead of elsewhere. The Los Angeles Visitors and Convention Bureau  lumps San Pedro in with the rest of the greater Los Angeles area, which hosted  an estimated 48.3 million overnight visitors in 1988.  </P> <P> However:  </P> <P> * Ports O' Call Village attracts more than 1.1 million visitors each year,  according to its merchants association, and the parking lot there is so jammed  on weekends that the merchants recently voted to recommend that the village cut  back on advertising in order to avoid frustrating visitors who can't find a  place to park.  </P> <P> * More than 250,000 cruise ship passengers travel through the port's World  Cruise Center annually. A port official estimated that 40% of those passengers  live 50 or more miles from Los Angeles and would provide a primary target for  San Pedro's hotel industry. An additional 300,000 passengers, most from the Los  Angeles area, travel between San Pedro and Catalina Island each year.  </P> <P> * The Los Angeles Maritime Museum received 103,000 visitors last year, at least  half of whom live beyond Los Angeles and its surrounding areas, according to  museum Director William Lee. "Certainly during the summertime we get an awful  lot of out-of-town visitors," Lee said. "We get a lot of people who come down  to board the ships or who are stopping over."  </P> <P> San Pedro business people would like to capitalize on these numbers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Key to Economic Future  </P> <P> The Chamber of Commerce sees tourism as the key to the economic future of San  Pedro, not only because it will be good for existing businesses but, Gubler  says, because it will create jobs.  </P> <P> With San Pedro's traditional industries -- shipbuilding and canning -- on the  decline, the community has lost more than 5,000 jobs in the 1980s. Gubler says  tourism is a good way to replace them, although not everyone in San Pedro  agrees.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of new hotels going up and everybody is trumpeting growth and  tourism," said Greg Smith, a community leader. "I'm not convinced that the  economic future of San Pedro should be as tied to tourism as to other things,  like high-tech. . . . Tourism tends to be low-paying jobs; it's not a good  economic base. It's OK for a few people to operate cruise ships and run  restaurants, but in terms of the grunt work, it's not a good job."  </P> <P> Gubler concedes that the jobs created by tourism -- for hotel workers and  waiters, for example -- do not pay nearly as well as the shipbuilding and  canning positions that were lost.  </P> <P> Still, he insists, tourism "is essential if San Pedro is to remain alive and  vital. If we do not do this, San Pedro will become little more than a bedroom  community."  </P> <P> In an effort to spur the tourism trade, and to prepare for the coming hotel  boom, the chamber brought together about two dozen San Pedro business people  and created the tourism council in January.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can't Rely on L.A. Bureau  </P> <P> Gubler says San Pedro can no longer afford to rely on the Los Angeles Visitors  and Convention Bureau, which he said has not adequately promoted San Pedro. The  bureau's president, Bill Miller, acknowledged that with such a vast area to  cover, it is impossible for his organization to tailor its promotional  campaigns to any particular community.  </P> <P> "While we're promoting Los Angeles and its regions," Miller said, "San Pedro  will have to look for the specific identity and hook, if you will, that will  tie the name San Pedro to something in the consumer's mind."  </P> <P> The visitors and convention bureau considers San Pedro a coastal community, and  markets it as such, lumping it in with beach cities such as Manhattan, Hermosa  and Redondo.  </P> <P> But San Pedro, although it does have a beach, is far from a beach city. Jayme  Wilson, San Pedro Tourism Council president, says the main challenge of his  group is to create name recognition for San Pedro by drawing attention to the  features that make it different.  </P> <P> To that end, the council's first major project was printing a slick, four-color  tourist brochure, far more elaborate than previous pamphlets put out by the  chamber.  </P> <P> The "Official 1989-90 Chamber of Commerce Visitor's Guide," which came off the  presses two weeks ago, lists restaurants, hotels and San Pedro points of  interest, both on the waterfront and elsewhere in town. The Angels Gate  Cultural Center, the Point Fermin Lighthouse and the Korean Friendship Bell are  all on the list, in addition to such port-related activities as dinner cruises.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shuttle Service Planned  </P> <P> The tourism council printed 56,000 of the brochures, which were financed mostly  by advertising, and has contracted with a company that will place the pamphlets  in racks at hotels, the cruise center and other places frequented by travelers.  </P> <P> The second project planned by the group is a shuttle service that will link San  Pedro's various attractions. The San Pedro Revitalization Corp., which oversees  an effort to upgrade the community's downtown business district, is drawing up  a plan for the shuttle, which the tourism council hopes will be partially  funded by the Port of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Although port officials have made no commitment to finance the shuttle, Mark  Richter, assistant director of property management, said the Harbor Department  is "quite willing to cooperate in that effort."  </P> <P> Richter also said the Harbor Department expects to decide by the end of the  month whether it will build San Pedro's third new hotel, this one at the port's  World Cruise Center. He said the department is reviewing two proposals, one for  a 240-room hotel and the other for a 180-room hotel.  </P> <P> In addition to the Compri and the Sheraton, San Pedro already has two other  hotels, the 60-room San Pedro Grand on Gaffey Street and the 112-room Best  Western Sunrise on Harbor Boulevard.  </P> <P> Some in San Pedro, particularly Gubler and Manny Aftergut, director of  development for the lead partner in the Sheraton Hotel project, have expressed  concerns that the market might not be able to bear another major hotel.  </P> <P> Richter said that the concern is "a very serious consideration" and that the  port has conducted a marketing study to examine what effect another hotel would  have on the local economy.  </P> <P> Although he declined to release the study, Richter noted that activity along  the San Pedro waterfront, including two new dinner cruise vessels and sport  fishing operations, are doing well. Ports O' Call Village, which grossed $23.9  million in sales during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1988, has grossed about  $25 million this fiscal year, Richter said.  </P> <P> "Certainly," he said, "San Pedro is not comparable with a Disneyland or an  attraction of that kind, but as a waterfront setting with some interesting  sights and attractions, I think there is excellent potential."  </P></p>

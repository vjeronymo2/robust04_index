			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Castle Mill tumbles into Pounds 6.51m loss Castle Mill International, the clothing and gifts group, reported a significant loss for 1991. As warned at the end of March, the second half was hit by a difficult trading climate. This, coupled with disposals in 1990, contributed to a fall in sales from Pounds 23.1m to Pounds 9.82m. Last year's pre-tax profit of Pounds 313,861 swung into losses of Pounds 6.51m. At the interim stage losses were Pounds 913,000. During the year the loss-making businesses of Faril Children's Character Clothing and Force Sportive Women's Leisurewear were sold. In addition a substantial provision was made in Hayjax and Giftmate with a view to reshaping them. To strengthen the balance sheet the company's bankers have agreed to place Pounds 3.1m of borrowings on to term loans of two and three years at lower interest rates. Losses per share were 50.4p (0.8p earnings) and again there is no dividend.</p>

			<p>of   F-16s to Pakistan Criticized   <F P=102> 94AS0247A Varanasi AJ in Hindi 30 Mar 94 p 6 </F> <F P=103> 94AS0247A </F> <F P=104>  Varanasi AJ </F> <F P=105>  Hindi </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Nuclear Non-Proliferation and F-16s"] </F>   [Except] The United States has proposed to Pakistan that it  should sign the NPT in exchange for receiving 38 F-16 fighter  planes. However, the Pakistani rulers have rejected this  proposal and have asked for some clarification which perhaps  will be given during the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strob  Talbot's visit to Islamabad. Pakistan's foreign minister, Sardar  Asif Ali, maintains that his country will not sign that  agreement unilaterally, and that the United States is aware that  Pakistan will accept the NPT only when India is willing to sign  it along with Pakistan. The truth is that both India and  Pakistan have very different reasons for not signing the NPT.  India has made it clear that its nuclear program is for peaceful  purposes and it has no desire to make nuclear weapons. As for  the NPT, it mostly protects the interests of nations that  already have huge arsenals of nuclear weapons. Therefore, it is  impossible for India to sign such a biased document. Meanwhile,  Pakistan has avoided signing the NPT considering India a major  danger to itself. In the context of the new U.S. proposal tied  to the supply of F-16 planes, Pakistan has repeated the same old  rhetoric that it cannot jeopardize its security just to get 38  F-16 planes.    The fact is that the Pakistani rulers have tied their  nuclear  program to the resolution of the Jammu-Kashmir issue. They say  that this issue has endangered the peace and stability of this  region, and they do not want to tie their hands by signing the  NPT while this issue is not resolved. This attitude of Pakistani  rulers has unmasked their unholy designs to the whole world. It  is avoiding signing the NPT by joining it to the Kashmir issue,  and is secretly attaining nuclear capability with Chinese help.  It has also been learned that Pakistan has the capability to  make 12 bombs as powerful as were dropped on Hiroshima. It is  not possible that the Clinton administration is not aware of it.  Islamabad has joined its nuclear program with terrorist  activities and all these activities are aimed against India. The  U.S. government had at one time proposed including Pakistan in  the list of terrorist nations based on this report. However, he  United States changed its plan saying that Pakistan's attitude  has changed and it was expected that Pakistan will improve.  However, instead of improving its attitude, Pakistan has  increased anti-India activities and is fully involved in making  nuclear weapons. We feel pity for the U.S. government which,  instead of putting pressure on Pakistan to stop this program,  has announced through one of its senior officials in Washington  that if Pakistan suspends its nuclear program the United States  will provide it with 38 F-16 planes costing $658 million. This  is a paradox and shows the sly tricks of the nation that calls  itself the greatest power in the world. It tells Pakistan to  stop its nuclear program and at the same time offers to provide  it with the dangerous F-16 war planes.    Does not the Clinton administration know that if it provides  F-16 planes in its efforts to stop nuclear proliferation in  South Asia to end the danger of a nuclear war, then no one can  stop the tension and weapon race in this region? India has  insisted this to be the case repeatedly. Recently Home Minister  Chavan informed the U.S. senators visiting New Delhi about  India's fear that supplying Pakistan with F-16 planes despite  the Pressler amendment will only increase tension in this region  while we need to reduce it. If this still does not make sense to  the American mind then its policy about South Asia becomes  suspect. One reason for this belief and why this fear was  strengthened is the advice given by the U.S. print media to  India that it should support Clinton government's proposal under  which it is giving F-16 planes to Pakistan in order to make it  suspend its nuclear program. India's refusal to agree with this  proposal and remaining adamant on its stand will be interpreted  as hegemonic instead of desiring stability in the sub-continent.  [passage omitted]</p>

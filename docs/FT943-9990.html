			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Leading Article: The nuclear waste problem The government's consultation paper on the disposal of radioactive waste, published last Friday, is central to the UK's review of nuclear policy for two reasons. It addresses the issue of safety, which is uppermost in the public's mind; and it has a direct bearing on cost, which must ultimately determine whether nuclear power is commercially viable. The most pressing issue is the disposal of intermediate and low-level radioactive waste, such as bulky parts from first generation reactors and nuclear submarines which are now coming to the end of their lives. By contrast, high-level waste, such as spent fuel rods, needs 50 years to cool before it can be stored, making it a problem for the next century. Until last year, it appeared that the UK planned to dump at least some waste at sea. But it has now signed an international treaty which includes a 10-year ban on sea dumping of radioactive waste. This leaves it with the choice of burying the waste deep underground, or storing it in some form on the surface. The UK's provisional plans are to bury intermediate and low-level waste permanently in sealed chambers carved out of the rocks half a mile underground. UK Nirex, the industry's waste disposal company, has been given the task of finding a site, and is now running geological studies underneath Sellafield, British Nuclear Fuels' plants in Cumbria. Deep disposal has the backing of the nuclear industry, the Department of Trade and Industry, and a large section of the public. It is cheaper than surface storage because it needs minimal surveillance, and is relatively secure from risks such as terrorist attack. There is also a moral argument for opting now for deep disposal, in that many feel it would be wrong to leave the problem of waste disposal for future generations to answer. Practical questions As things stand, however, deep burial raises a number of practical and other questions. The risk is mainly geological: radioactivity could leak into the water table. If that happened, it would be extremely difficult to rectify. These concerns apply particularly to the Sellafield site where Nirex has discovered rock fissures and complex water flows which might cause radioactivity to migrate. Surface storage, by contrast, is more expensive and possibly riskier, but it does keep the waste where it can be closely monitored. So long as uncertainty exists about the science of nuclear waste disposal, it also keeps options open. Many environmentalists argue that the permanent solution of deep burial would deprive future generations of using whatever superior disposal methods science eventually comes up with. Deep burial The trouble is that this is an argument without end: the same dilemma would presumably prevent each succeeding generation from settling the waste problem. Decisions about the desirability of nuclear power, in which assumptions about the costs of waste disposal are an important part, cannot be thus indefinitely postponed. The government has made clear its preference for deep burial on economic, safety and moral grounds. There will always be the suspicion, however, that its position is shaped by short-term objectives, particularly the desire to reduce the nuclear industry's costs and improve its chances of privatisation. That would be patently wrong: if there was ever an issue where safety should be paramount, it is this. Scientific evaluation rather than political pressure must determine the choice of disposal method. If minimising the impact on the environment and the risk to human health is the criterion, the best technique might well be sea disposal: environmental pessimists often understate the enormous capacity of the deep oceans to dilute pollution. But with that option now closed, the onus is on the government to build the safest and most palatable alternative method of disposal into its nuclear review calculations. There is no harm in persisting with investigations into deep disposal, provided it is recognised that it might take years to find a safe site, if one can be found at all. But for now, there may be no alternative to keeping nuclear waste above ground until more of the uncertainty is removed.</p>

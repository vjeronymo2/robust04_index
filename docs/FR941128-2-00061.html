			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Electronic Connections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Federal Reserve charges fees for electronic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connections to depository institutions for accessing priced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services. The costs and revenues associated with electronic access  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are allocated to the various priced services based on the relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of endpoints that access each service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electronic connection fees have not increased since 1989,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the exception of the 1991 $100 increase in the monthly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dedicated leased-line fee. In light of the increasing costs due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the implementation of Fednet# <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Board has approved increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fees for three types of electronic connections in 1995. The fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for four other types of connections would remain unchanged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, the Board raised the following fees: 1) receive and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> send dial connections from $65 to $75; 2) multi-drop leased-line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connections from $300 to $450; and 3) dedicated leased-line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connections from $700 to $750. Monthly electronic connection fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for receive-only dial, high-speed dial, high-speed 19.2 kbps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leased-line, and high-speed 56 kbps leased-line will remain at $30,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $350, $850, and $1,000, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1994, the Federal Reserve Board established standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fees for dedicated high-speed 56 kbps and 19.2 kbps connections and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high-speed dial 56 kbps connections. In response to requests from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several depository institutions that Reserve Banks support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connections at speeds higher than 56 kbps for transmission of large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data files, the Board has approved standard connection fees for two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new categories of high-speed connections: $1,800 and $2,000 per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> month for high-speed leased connections of 128 kbps and 256 kbps,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively. These new high-speed connection categories require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more expensive signalling, encryption, and circuit components than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 56 kbps and 19.2 kbps connections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Board has approved two new standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connection options to support contingency testing by depository  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions that use dedicated leased-line connections for their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production traffic. A dedicated dial test connection will provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional dial connection equipment to address the needs of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions that conduct their contingency testing simultaneously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with their production work. A shared dial test connection will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address the needs of institutions that test only during off-hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and will provide a necessary subset of dial connection components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These new contingency connection options will be lower cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives to depository institutions than a second dedicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leased-line connection. For these test options, a usage guideline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 120 hours per year will be established. Institutions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceed this guideline will be asked to establish a dedicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leased-line connection for testing purposes and pay the standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connection fee. The monthly fees for the dedicated and shared  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingency testing options are $250 and $150, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Noncash Collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Table 7 summarizes actual 1993, estimated 1994, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected 1995 cost recovery performance for the noncash collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

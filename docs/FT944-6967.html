			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / How to Spend It: Home in on the basics - Conran When the House Book by the then Terence Conran came out in 1974 I was in the midst of doing up a terraced house in London. I, and most of my friends, seized upon it with relish, for here at last was a book that seemed to speak to us. Here was a book that addressed the everyday problems of making a house work without the irritating assumptions so prevalent in the glossy interior magazines of the day that we either aspired to images of ancestral grandeur or suburban cosiness. It offered a vision of a contemporary way of living that related to our lives and incomes. But above all it showed us the virtues of simplicity, of investing in basics such as the structure of the house, of getting the lighting right, the heating, the flooring first. Style, or the addition of the more movable elements such as furniture, curtains, pictures, lamps and all the rest, ran the subtext, could almost take care of itself provided the basics were right. In some ways there seems scarcely any need to update it, so classic, so fundamentally sensible is the advice. But Sir Terence has just produced a bigger, equally well-illustrated 1994 version which he calls The Essential House Book*. The fundamental philosophy has not changed. Here, for instance, are a couple of paragraphs from the introduction: 'A home is greater than the sum of its parts and getting the practicalities right is only half of the story. For most people, the special significance of 'home' lies at a deeper level. Home is where we feel at ease, where we belong, where we can create surroundings which reflect our tastes and pleasures. Creating a home has a lot to do with discovering those elements that convey a sense of place. 'Investigating these basic ideas relegates 'style' to something of a side issue. Fashions in decorating fluctuate like hemlines, whereas notions of comfort and intimacy date back hundreds of years. This is not to say that style isn't fun or even useful. But it is ultimately more important to find out what you really like, the unique combination of space, light, colour and materials which will continue to refresh your spirits long after the latest 'look' has had its day.' This book is a manual which would be invaluable to anybody setting out on the adventure of creating a home. It is illustrated quite beautifully with pictures that are imbued with a relaxed and undidactic approach to matters of taste and style. If they have a common thread it is of light and air and an unstuffy approach to the business of turning a house into a home. The pictures show, better than almost any words, that there are no 'right' and no 'wrong' ways to furnish. Instead what we have in the late 20th century is as vast a choice as it is almost possible to imagine. But quite apart from the inspiring pictures, practical issues are tackled - from how to make a kitchen work for you (and the kitchens featured ranged from small and minimalist to a large family living-room-cum-kitchen) to how to deal with the vexed matter of significant spatial change. Even for those who already have houses they are satisfied with, this book has much to offer. Its directory covering the practical subjects such as lighting, flooring, plumbing, paints and plaster is filled with useful information, and the list of useful addresses for everything from brass door furniture to architects and security alarms makes the book worth its cover price alone. * The Essential House Book by Terence Conran, published by Conran Octopus, 272 pages, Pounds 25.</p>

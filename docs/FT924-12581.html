			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Letter: Mines - private sector alternative, figures 'misleading', efficient but too costly Sir, The fast-moving events in the current political controversy concerning coal mine closures were well explained in your article answering typical questions about the issue. ('The costs of closure', October 17). However, the article failed to highlight one interesting aspect: that some private mining companies have shown an interest in taking on several of the collieries listed for closure by British Coal. British Coal claims that the pits scheduled for closure cannot be mined profitably, but several independent mining companies, such as Wales-based Ryan, clearly disagree. British Coal should have its monopoly power to grant licences to private operators removed from it immediately. This would allow private companies to take on collieries such as Markham, Wearmouth and Hatfield, which have healthy balance sheets and viable coal stocks. In particular, the Department of Trade and Industry should provide seed-corn capital to encourage management and employee buy-outs. The UK coal industry is clearly in a secular decline but British Coal's current plans are the industrial equivalent of cutting off one's own nose to spite one's face. If BC cannot run the mines then it should allow others to take over that role. John Major's government has a chance to show its support for enterprise and initiative by giving miners and managers a chance to run their own pits instead of spending Pounds 1bn plus on throwing whole neighbourhoods on to the dole.

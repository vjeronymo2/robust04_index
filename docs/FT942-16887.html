			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (8): Rescuer holds key to future - Ownership of Baltica remains to be decided For more than a year the ownership structure of Baltica Forsikring, Denmark's biggest insurance group, has been shrouded in uncertainty. Because of this, Mr Hans Ejvind Hansen, chief executive, has been forced to design short to medium-term strategies for the company and to restrict his focus to basic insurance operations so as to sharpen Baltica's domestic competitive edge. The insurer was saved from collapse last year by a complex rescue package in which Den Danske Bank, Denmark's largest bank, emerged as Baltica's biggest shareholder with a stake of 32 per cent. However, DDB's stake in the company is more than 50 per cent when taking into account a 24 per cent shareholding held by Gefion, Baltica's former holding company, whose main creditor is DDB. 'We all know that Den Danske Bank holds the key to our future but we have to try to maximise our attractiveness to potential investors so that all possible solutions to our ownership can be kept open,' Mr Hansen said recently. Baltica owns 27 per cent of its own shares, having been given limited dispensation from Danish rules which do not allow insurance companies to own more than 10 per cent of their own shares. Both of these shareholdings will have to be sold within the next two years because of the Danish rules, but it would be hardly surprising if DDB was given a political green light to take over Baltica, although concern over DDB's dominance of the domestic financial market makes this solution problematic. The bank has said that it intends to clarify its intentions for Baltica during the first half of this year, but Mr Hansen, who is also a former DDB deputy chief executive, is less than optimistic that the company's ownership structure will be decided within this time frame. Given the recent turmoil within the company and, within the Scandinavian insurance industry, Baltica's employees have learned to shrug off rumours about their future. 'Their morale has been surprisingly high, considering they have been through so much. I tell them it is business as usual and not to stop making decisions,' Mr Hansen said. Possible future ownership plans have ranged from the company becoming independent, to DDB acquiring Baltica, to Codan - the Danish subsidiary of the UK's Sun Alliance - acquiring part of the business, to Skandia, Sweden's biggest insurer, becoming the new owner. The Scandinavian insurance industry is still recovering from a series of dramas which took place nearly two years ago and which saw several big participants in Storebrand and Denmark's Baltica and Hafnia driven to near collapse. Acquisition by Codan seems rather ambitious given that the former is in the throes of absorbing Hafnia, which it took over last year. A move by Skandia to acquire a big Baltica stake appears less far-fetched but the company has indicated its intention to retrench back to domestic business and expressed some reservations over expansion. Danish politicians have also indicated a preference for a domestic company to own the country's biggest insurer. A senior DDB executive said recently that given the bank's ambitions within the insurance industry, it would not be unnatural for DDB to acquire Baltica. Mr Hansen says: 'We could see a solution whereby Baltica's shares were redistributed among a number of institutional investors, domestic and foreign, or one in which Den Danske Bank took us over. Because there are so many possibilities it makes it difficult to establish a strategy for the company which could cope with them all.' His patience over Baltica's future ownership structure is wearing thin. 'I have told DDB that it would be beneficial if a rapid solution was found, and I will not repeat it,' he said. Baltica's chief executive hopes also to benefit from the merger between Codan and Hafnia, its biggest competitors. 'The results of Hafnia's primary business have not been among the most flourishing in the country. Now that it has taken the company over, Codan has to find a common policy and premium strategy for the old Hafnia and Codan and to increase premiums by as much as we have. 'Codan is an important competitor - though Baltica is bigger - and we hope to be able to profit from the difficulties that relate to all mergers. Our problem is that we do not earn enough from our direct insurance, but compared with our competitors we are the best in the country.' Meanwhile, Mr Hansen, who earlier took charge of reducing DDB's employees by 15 per cent before coming to Baltica last April continues to forge ahead with tightening the operations. Baltica's 1993 results are due to be published on April 7, but may be delayed until later in the month, according to Mr Hansen, owing to a couple of issues which have yet to be resolved. However, he said the company's performance in direct insurance was weaker last year than in 1992 when the group suffered a net loss of DKr445m, primarily due to an extraordinary charge of NKr655m against accounts. Baltica, nevertheless, has reduced costs by 10 per cent in the past year partly through staff reductions of the same magnitude, and steps are being taken to achieve a further 10 per cent cost reduction by 1995. 'We hope to present significantly improved results for the first half of 1994 and I am confident that the results for the whole year will be a substantial improvement over 1993. We should also be able to achieve a reasonble profit in 1995 barring unforeseen circumstances,' he said. Last year Baltica increased its premiums by 10 per cent from 1994 - it was the first such increase in more than eight years. 'We are trying to define a new business idea which means concentrating on direct Danish insurance, cutting out associated business, and forming strategic alliances. The three main pillars of our strategy include premium increases, cost reductions and retrenchment of our business scope. 'We have retrenched our activities - both geographically and professionally but we will maintain operations in New York and London while winding down the business in Australia. Balta, our business in Lithuania, has been sold.' Mr Hansen said that if Baltica had had a huge portfolio of securities and bonds it would have been somewhat cushioned from its earlier financial troubles. 'As part of our restructuring we took more than 27 per cent of our own shares in the form of treasury stocks as payment for taking over a corresponding level of debt from our holding company which was DKr2.2bn. When we had to pay back this debt we were forced to dispose of our securities and bonds and we have not rebuilt the portfolio,' Mr Hansen explained. 'Although we have the handicap of not having a big securities and bond portfolio ..we have a reasonably sound insurance business - whereas Codan has a big bond portfolio and the challenge of building a reasonable non-life insurance business from the ruins of Hafnia,' Mr Hansen said. Baltica has to live from its basic insurance business which is not easy in the very competitive Danish insurance market, according to Mr. Hansen. The company has a surplus policy, according to which it takes out as reserves allocations a surplus every year which is based on a percentage equivalent to what the policyholders are paid, plus a margin of 2.2 per cent. This means when shares and bonds increase Baltica under-performs, but when they decline in value the company over performs. 'This provides a stable and important income from our 1991 investment in Statsanstalten (the state's pensions and life insurance group), which is of great importance for our position in the market,' Mr Hansen said. Nevertheless, Mr Hansen admits he has to operate within a very constrained environment, given the outstanding questions over Baltica's ownership structure. 'We have no choice but to sharpen the edge of our basic business.'</p>

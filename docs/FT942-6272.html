			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of the Computer Industry - Battle for the Desktop (7): Stronger in niche markets / The competitive performance of European-owned electronics companies is relatively poor. There are, however, oases of excellence in an arid landscape - European suppliers The European information technology industry is big, worth over Ecu120bn - equal to Dollars 135.6bn or Pounds 94.4bn - in the EU countries alone, but it is mostly foreign-owned. There are, however, some market niches where European-owned companies seem able to hold their own with the rest of the information technology world. Supercomputing, remarkably enough, is one. Meiko, UK-owned with headquarters in Bristol, England, and Waltham, Massachusetts, last year sold a Dollars 17.5m (Pounds 11.90m) machine to Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, a top US research establishment more used to spending its money on American supercomputers from Cray Research, the world leader. Stern Computing Systems, based in Lyons, France, is meanwhile developing a line of smaller, less powerful machines aimed at the technical computing market rather than 'Grand Challenge' problems like modelling atmospheric behaviour. These, however, are oases of excellence in an arid landscape. European computer hardware is dominated by US and Asian companies. The competitive performance of European-owned electronics companies is poor, and shows little sign of improvement. All the three indigenously-owned large manufacturers - Siemens Nixdorf, Olivetti and Groupe Bull - are losing money heavily. The state-owned Bull is seeking private equity investment to strengthen its balance sheet and persuade Brussels that further injections of capital from the French government is essential for restructuring and not simply a concealed subsidy. The performance of indigenously owned PC companies including Vobis in Germany, Tulip in Holland and Elonex in the UK is more hopeful, helped by the fact that the professional microcomputer market grew at a healthy 8.8 per cent in units in 1993. The fact remains that overall European electronics companies hold less than 30 per cent of their domestic markets for computers. By comparison, US and Japanese companies control at least three-quarters of their computer business in their home markets. According to Hubert Joly, Jurgen Kluge and Lothar Stein, writing in the current issue of the McKinsey Quarterly, there are three principles reasons for Europe's weakness in information technology: First, a concentration on high-end products supported by protected markets and high prices. Second, a lack of market-driven technological innovation and growth through new products. Third, a failure to adapt operations to changing competitive conditions. They say 'the bad news here is that Europe cannot blame its poor showing on the sluggish economy, industry cycles or higher factor costs. The problem stems from missed opportunities to cope early on with the superior approaches and faster pace of world-class competitors.' Mr Franz Hetzenhauer, president and co-founder of Tulip Computers, believes that the European Commission could and should do more to stimulate the development of indigenously owned companies: 'It's very difficult to say we have an industry,' he says. 'We are a small number of companies in a very big market.' He believes the EU should endorse a strategy for the industry recognising that information technology will be one of the three largest global industries by 2000 and should form one of the bases of Europe's prosperity. He argues, for example, that European computer manufacturers should be encouraged to collaborate with each other and with universities to eliminate duplication of effort - 'everybody is building the same personal computer. We are using our development funds the wrong way. It would be more efficient to build everything but the final 20 per cent in common.' The Esprit research programme, funded by the EU under its Framework research initiative, was, he believes, too concerned with fundamental, pre-competitive research. A big issue is that the cost of manufacturing in Europe is high compared with the US or Asia. Mr Hetzenhauer says that costs have to be stabilised, tax rates cut and holidays curtailed. He also worries that illness levels seem higher among European workers than their contemporaries in other economies. These social and macroeconomic issues apart, many manufacturers argue for specific actions from the EU to cut the cost of manufacturing in Europe. Mr Michael Spiro, finance director of Elonex, the fast-growing UK-based microcomputer manufacturer, points to the import duties and anti-dumping duties added to the cost of certain types of memory chip which, he reckons, can add up to Dollars 50 to the price of a European-made machine. The fact remains that indigenously-owned and foreign companies - with a few exceptions including Compaq, the personal computer manufacturer - have found the European market heavy going over the past few years. IBM and Digital Equipment are among the companies which have blamed slow going in Europe for poor results. ICL, in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority stake and which is the most successful of the European-based large computer companies, has seen its profitability fall steadily over the past three years. This year pretax profits were a mere Pounds 23.4m and the company has strengthened its balance sheet, raising a total of Pounds 100m from its parent through a rights issue. It is in a enviable position, however, compared with its European-owned rivals. Groupe Bull's predicament is probably the most serious but Siemens Nixdorf is still losing money and sales. Both sales and orders were down six per cent at the half-way stage this year. In the past two years cumulative losses have amounted to almost DM1bn. Later this year, Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig, head of Siemen's computer business for the past 10 years, will hand over to Mr Gerhard Schulmeyer, formerly of Motorola and Asea Brown Boveri, whose principal challenge will be to bring the ailing company to break-even point by 1996. Olivetti of Italy cut its losses in 1993 to L465bn (Dollars 283.53m) compared with L650bn (Dollars 396.34m) the year before and increased its sales for the first time since 1990. On the other hand, it failed to break even at the operational level. The group has been boosted, however, by the award of a licence to run Italy's second mobile phone network. Olivetti led a consortium including Bell Atlantic, Pactel and Mannesman. It intends to use the licence as the basis of a new network to serve mobile phone and computer users. Europe's chief hopes of a resurgence in information technology lie in new technologies and combinations of technologies where leadership has yet to be established. Mobile communications and multimedia are two such areas. But European companies will have to move faster than in the past if they are not to repeats their past failures.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EX-BANNING PLAYER FINDS A HOME AT MONTCLAIR PREP  </P> <P> Derek Sparks gazes proudly at a basket overflowing with letters from some of  the nation's most recognizable universities -- USC, Notre Dame, UCLA, Michigan.  All promise the Montclair Prep running back the good life as a college football  star.  </P> <P> But the correspondence represents more to Sparks than just the prospect of a  college scholarship. It proves that his California dream has been fulfilled and  symbolizes the reason he left his small-town home in Texas two years ago.  </P> <P> "There's a lot more opportunity for everything in California than there was in  Texas," he said during a recent interview. "As a little kid growing up on the  poor side of town in Texas, coming to California was like a little kid going to  Disneyland."  </P> <P> Sparks has enjoyed two brilliant seasons since moving from tiny Wharton in  southeast Texas to Southern California.  </P> <P> In 1988, he rushed for 1,394 yards at Banning High in Wilmington and was named  the sophomore state player of the year by Cal-Hi Sports. Citing a fear of gang  activity in Wilmington and a more rigorous academic environment at Montclair  Prep, Sparks transferred to the private Van Nuys school before his junior year.  </P> <P> He responded with a stellar season in 1989, earning The Times' San Fernando  Valley Back of the Year award after rushing for 1,944 yards and scoring 35  touchdowns for the Mounties.  </P> <P> The 6-foot, 212-pound athlete enters his senior season as one of the nation's  top college prospects. "He's not only one of the premier backs in Southern  California, but he's among the top 10 across the country," according to Dick  Lascola, who runs a recruiting service in Fallbrook.  </P> <P> No high school record in the state is safe this year, Sparks said, not even  Russell White's career rushing mark of 5,998 yards.  </P> <P> To set the record Sparks needs 2,661, a seemingly impossible total in a 10-game  season. But the Mounties expect to win the Southern Section Division X title,  which would entail a 14-game schedule. And considering some of Montclair Prep's  opponents in the Alpha League, Sparks just might dethrone White.  </P> <P> "We're not going to build yards just for Derek, but we think the record is very  possible," Montclair Prep Coach George Giannini said. "He's a dominant threat  and the way we run the ball, we think breaking the record is a realistic goal.  We'd be very pleased with that."  </P> <P> A slew of potential records notwithstanding, Sparks is troubled as he heads  into his final season at Montclair Prep. Leland Sparks, who also moved from  Wharton to Southern California and is a wide receiver for the Mounties, has  seen his cousin's mood turn sour in recent months.  </P> <P> "There's been stress on me too, but it's  </P> <P> not as bad as it has been for Derek. He's been in the middle," he said.  </P> <P> Derek Sparks might have little trouble sidestepping a linebacker or slipping  past a defensive back, but, at 17, he has yet to master the moves necessary to  thwart this current blitz. Caught in a battle with Jerome Sparks, his uncle and  former legal guardian, Derek sought refuge last spring in L. A. County juvenile  court claiming he had been abandoned. The court assumed legal custody and  Sparks is now a foster child of Steve and Susie Goldbaum, whose son John is a  teammate of Sparks' at Montclair Prep.  </P> <P> Jerome Sparks and Derek's mother, June Sparks, who lives in Texas, object to  the arrangement and want Derek to leave the Goldbaum's Granada Hills home and  move into an apartment with Leland, a proposal neither Derek nor Leland favors.  Leland lives in Chatsworth with the Cole family, whose son Greg played  defensive back for the Mounties last season.  </P> <P> Jerome Sparks strenuously denies that he abandoned Derek and claims that  Montclair Prep and its supporters have plotted to gain control of his nephew.  His suspicions began in January and climaxed when he learned in May that he had  lost legal guardianship of Derek to the court.  </P> <P> "I was like a grizzly bear that someone had come and taken his cub," Jerome  said. "I couldn't believe they were saying I abandoned him. No way. I still say  they cooked the whole thing up to get me out of the picture."  </P> <P> Giannini, the Goldbaums and Derek Sparks all deny that. Derek said he is happy  living with the Goldbaums and wants to stay there, but that he is pained  because his uncle and mother wish otherwise.  </P> <P> "I don't know why your own people would put pressure on you when you're trying  to perform your best," he said. "This is all killing me and hurting me. I'm  busting my butt every day to do things right so I won't have criticism coming  from me in all these directions. It's getting to the point where the football  field is the only place I can have some peace."  </P> <P> The discord started for the Sparks family after the holiday vacation last  winter. Derek and Leland helped lead Montclair Prep to a 12-1 record last fall,  during which time they lived in an apartment on the school's campus with Eric  Sparks, Jerome's brother and a former assistant coach.  </P> <P> Also living in the apartment that semester were teammates John Goldbaum and  Donovan Roy. Because Montclair Prep is a licensed boarding school, the living  arrangement violated no Southern Section rules. Those rules also permit Derek  and Leland to retain their athletic eligibility while living with the families  of their teammates.  </P> <P> When Derek, Leland and Eric Sparks returned from vacation in Texas, they needed  new housing because Montclair Prep had torn down the apartment to make room for  building expansion. Eric and Leland moved into an apartment together, but Derek  asked John Goldbaum if he could stay with his family, a request the Goldbaums  gladly agreed to.  </P> <P> "Our sole reason for letting him stay is that he's a great kid and he's a great  influence on my son," said Steve Goldbaum, who owns a plumbing company in  Granada Hills. "We told him he was more than welcome to stay."  </P> <P> Jerome Sparks begrudgingly accepted the arrangement, as long as it was  temporary. But his discomfort grew when he felt that Derek had distanced  himself from his mother when she made a surprise visit to Los Angeles in  January.  </P> <P> Derek visited her too infrequently during her two-month visit, Jerome said.  When Derek rejected his mother's offer to live with Eric, Leland and herself in  their two-bedroom apartment, the mother and Jerome grew edgy.  </P> <P> "My decision to live with the Goldbaums and not in the apartment with them was  only because of the lack of space," Derek said. "I lived in a tiny apartment  all my life. Besides, the Goldbaums are good people and were treating me well.  Everything was taken care of."  </P> <P> Too much so, as far as Jerome was concerned. When he gained little satisfaction  after voicing his concerns to Giannini, the football coach, and PrincipaE.  Simpson, he threatened to withdraw Derek from school.  </P> <P> "After I told them we were looking for a new school, they started to hate me,"  he said. "That's when they cooked up this whole thing. They got him conditioned  to talk to me a certain way. Derek was being used and he didn't know it."  </P> <P> Jerome claims that his fears were confirmed when the Goldbaums became Derek's  foster parents in April.  </P> <P> Derek and the Goldbaums offer a totally different version of events. They claim  Jerome lost touch with Derek for more than a month last winter, prompting Derek  to suggest the idea of foster care.  </P> <P> "That's when everyone blew their top and started tripping out," Derek said  about his family. "I like to went crazy over that. I felt like I was about to  explode."  </P> <P> Said Steve Goldbaum: "After everything was done, then I found out that his  family was upset. I should have gone to his uncle first. I'm not trying to take  anyone's family away."  </P> <P> Under the terms of foster care, the Goldbaums receive $460 a month from the  county's Department of Children's Services, which also provides health  insurance. The Goldbaums are charged with Derek's care until he is 18, when he  no longer is a ward of the court. He also retains the option of appealing to  the court to seek new living conditions, including a return to Jerome's  custody.  </P> <P> The Goldbaums have three children and own a sprawling home in a well-to-do  neighborhood. Money seems unlikely as a motive for housing Derek.  </P> <P> "I think we probably lose money on the deal," Steve Goldbaum said.  </P> <P> The bottom line, as far as Montclair Prep is concerned, is respect for Derek's  wishes. Giannini claims that the school has played no role in Derek's decision  to live with the Goldbaums and would not prevent him from leaving the school.  </P> <P> "This is very, very sad for Derek," he said. "All we want is what is best for  him. If he wanted to go back with Jerome, we would not stand in his way. But  he's very happy living at the Goldbaums. He says he wants to stay at Montclair  Prep and we're happy to have him."  </P> <P> Despite the objections of his family, Derek remains at the Goldbaums and  returned to Granada Hills after a monthlong vacation in Texas this summer. He  talks regularly with his uncle, who keeps a cordial if not close relationship  with the Goldbaums. Jerome offered his best wishes to Susie Goldbaum on  Mother's Day last spring, and when Derek and Leland returned from their summer  vacation in Texas, Jerome met them at the airport.  </P> <P> Jerome is a 38-year-old former semipro baseball player who moved to California  in 1976, runs a carpet cleaning business and lives in Inglewood. He rues the  loss of control he had over Derek and seems torn on how to handle the  situation. One minute, he talks of Montclair Prep conspiracies and what he  calls the brainwashing of his nephew. The next, he professes his loyalty and  concern for Derek. He threatens to seek legal help, but so far has not done so.  </P> <P> Despite his changing sentiments, Jerome remains steadfast on one issue. He  wants to reunite Derek and Leland under one roof.  </P> <P> "I just want Leland and Derek back together like we started," he said.  </P> <P> Derek's mother agrees, even though many of her fears for her only son's  well-being were allayed during Derek's visit last month.  </P> <P> "We had a nice time and got along just fine," she said. "I still don't want him  to stay at the Goldbaums. I want him around some of my people."  </P> <P> Leland also laments Derek's plight, although he remains on the periphery of the  situation.  </P> <P> "We've been so close for so long that if he feels bad, I feel bad for the same  reason," he said. "I'd rather not comment on what Jerome is saying. But if  there's a problem, it'll be worked out by the family."  </P> <P> Derek is not so sure. To outsiders, his future might seem assured on the  football field, but Derek has doubts about making it through his senior season.  Still, he has impressed members of the Montclair Prep community with his  maturity and strength of character.  </P> <P> "He's a high-spirited young man and a fine human being," said Lois Cole, who  houses Leland at her Chatsworth home. "He's very dedicated and takes great  pride in what he supports. There's no stopping Derek Sparks."  </P> <P> On the football field, few would dispute that claim. But living in California  has proved troublesome for Derek, who expresses no regret about leaving Texas.  </P> <P> "You would think I would have regrets, but I don't," he said. "I knew it would  be a challenge coming to California, but the hard part has come off the field.  Everybody is always calling me to give me advice. I don't trust anyone anymore.  I don't trust a soul. I just have to look out for myself.  </P> <P> "But I'm happy at Montclair Prep and living with the Goldbaums. I don't want to  let all these things distract me. I just want to get on the field and score  some touchdowns."  </P> <P> Regrettably, perhaps, that has been the easy part for Derek Sparks.  </P></p>

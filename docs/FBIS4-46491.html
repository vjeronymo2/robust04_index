			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Manki Ponomarev article: "The Russian Side Firmly Upheld </F> Its Interests. The Western Press Acknowledges This, Commenting  on the Results of the Visit to Brussels of General of the Army  Pavel Grachev, Russian Federation Minister of Defense"]    [Text] The visit of General of the Army Pavel Grachev,  Russian minister of defense, to Brussels at the end of May, his  meetings with the NATO leadership, and his speech to the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council had been planned long ago. The  closer the date of the visit came, the more attention it  attracted and the more frequently the Western countries' mass  media carried forecasts of its course and results. Very  contradictory opinions were expressed -- some people even  predicted the visit's total failure.    Such a pessimistic approach was evidently connected with the  delay over Russia's joining the "Partnership for Peace" program,  which came as a surprise to many people, and with the  contradictory statements on this which came out of Moscow.  "Initially Russia's position was not clear enough," Paris LE  MONDE stated. Assessments of this kind only served to boost  interest in the upcoming Brussels meeting.    But the most important thing was that, despite everything,  Russia's authority and influence and its role in ensuring  stability in Europe and throughout the world are so great that  far-reaching expectations were associated with this meeting.  People were expecting the talks with the Russian minister to  elucidate, above all, the prospects for developing relations  between the Russian Federation and NATO and, consequently, to  draft a scheme of a future European security system. Naturally,  they were also expecting an exposition of the fundamentals of  Russian military doctrine.    Thus, Pavel Grachev was faced with a difficult task. He had  to convince his former opponents and potential partners of  Russia's fundamentally new approach to problems of ensuring  security, to secure their approval for the principles of the  Russian Federation's joining the "Partnership for Peace"  program, to eliminate accusations of Moscow's neo-imperialist  ambitions, and, at the same time, to uphold its right to special  relations with the West, mindful of Russia's status as a great  power with tremendous nuclear might and its permanent membership  of the UN Security Council. This under conditions of NATO's  obvious reluctance to assume additional commitments to Russia  out of fear that this might bring about a weakening of the  alliance's influence in the world.    There is no need to describe in detail the entire course of  the Russian Federation defense minister's visit to Brussels. It  received quite wide coverage in the Russian press. But I must  emphasize at once that his mission succeeded. LE MONDE wrote at  the end of the visit that it "made it possible to draw the  sides' positions closer together and showed the goodwill for  cooperation between Russia and NATO."    In the opinion of the Western press, Pavel Grachev's  personal  qualities played a considerable part in achieving that result.  People had been expecting to see in Brussels "the jaded leader  of a demoralized army," as THE NEW YORK TIMES wrote. But they  saw a self-confident and firm military leader. "A good man, but  dangerous," one German general commented respectfully on him in  the press on returning from Brussels. London's THE TIMES wrote  of the Russian minister that he "played a virtuoso game with the  alliance" at the meeting in Brussels.    But it is not, of course, just a matter of Grachev himself.  In the meetings with the NATO leadership he advanced a well  thought-out position which had been worked out carefully  together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and which had been  examined and approved by the Russian Federation Security Council  and president. This lent special weight to his words.    So, in Brussels the Russian side unequivocally declared that  it was prepared to join NATO's partnership program in the very  near future and presented its interlocutors with a document  containing the main parameters of Russia's involvement in  implementing it. At the same time it was proposed to prepare a  large-scale program of bilateral political and military  cooperation between NATO and Russia consonant with the latter's  place in Europe and the world. At the same time the report on  the main provisions of Russian military doctrine, which Pavel  Grachev delivered at the conference of defense ministers of the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council countries, emphasized that  the political bases of this doctrine reflect two interconnected  tasks -- prevention of war and readiness to rebuff an aggressor.    According to Western press data, NATO rated highly the  Russian document, which contains the main parameters of  participation in the partnership program and of its realization,  particularly in the military sphere. "NATO cannot treat Russia  the same way as Tajikistan or Albania," FRG Defense Minister  Volker Ruehe declared. "Russia must become a strategic partner  of NATO and feel that people reckon with it as such."    I could also cite other statements and assessments of this  kind concerning the results of the Brussels meeting. Many other  articles, however, have also appeared in the Western press. The  reaction to these results expounded in them was restrained, to  put it mildly, and sometimes even sharply negative. A statement  by Sergio Balanzino, deputy secretary general of the alliance,  that it is no good Russia reckoning on special status, since all  are equal in the partnership program, was cited, for example.  "The North Atlantic Alliance has no intention of adopting any  documents that would endow Russia with special rights," he  declared. Germany's FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE regarded Russia's  desire to legitimate consultations with NATO on questions of  European security as an attempt to erode the entire North  Atlantic Alliance. Britain's DAILY TELEGRAPH pointed out that  NATO must make the development of cooperation with Russia  dependent on "Moscow's conduct in the near abroad." At the same  time it is frequently emphasized that such guardedness is  perfectly justified, since "NATO must be ready for a worsening  of the situation in Russia."    Particular skepticism was shown in the West in respect of  the  substance of the Russian military doctrine. It is said, in  particular, that its provisions make intervention in the near  abroad possible. In an interview in the newspaper LE FIGARO  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd did, indeed, admit that  Russia has special interests here, but he emphasized that  concern for them "must not transcend international law." Other  doctrinal provisions were also criticized.    What can be said about all these attacks? To some extent  they reflect the essence of the debate in Brussels. This is on  the one hand. On the other, they attest that Pavel Grachev  firmly upheld Russia's interests and did not forgo them, despite  all the pressure that was put on him. Russia is joining the  partnership program with a sense of its own dignity and is sure  that it will be able to arrange fully equal and constructive  cooperation with the North Atlantic Alliance.</p>

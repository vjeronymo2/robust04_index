			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pervasive model for modern managers Sir, Tim Dickson's piece on Frederick Winslow Taylor (Management: Pioneers and Prophets, October 3) is interesting and valuable. Since so much of today's management theory is currently being questioned, going back to its roots is an important contribution to the debate - unlike The Economist, which has started its series on management theorists with Tom Peters. What Tim Dickson omits is that arguably Taylor 'invented' functional management. This was an integral part of his scientific management approach which broke all activities down into separate, divisible (and therefore measurable) parts. Taylor's approach was no doubt valid for its time, particularly among the largely unskilled migrant workforce in the US of the late 19th century, as was Henri Fayol's similarly dated exposition of the 'practice of management' at a time when France faced considerable international competition ('Les Miserables'). In the intervening years, these two founding theories of management have been added to, amended and adjusted. Although they have also been increasingly challenged, it is undeniable that they remain pervasive models in most managers' mindsets. They lie at the core of what many believe to be the theory and science of management. As such they have taken on the semblance of certainties - so deeply embedded that they are not even questioned. Although their viability, as apparently unalterable truths, may have been gently eroded over time, they have not been fundamentally challenged in such a way that requires complete re-evaluation. Instead, later work - and there has been much of it - has formed as an accretion around these original ideas, rather than supplanting them. They therefore continue to lie buried under layers of newer, sometimes fresher thinking - relatively undisturbed. Much of the 'buzz' in management today - re-engineering, empowerment, self-organising teams, de-layered and flatter management and even the 'fall' of strategic planning - is at risk of failure (for good or ill) if the prevalent mindsets inherited from the 19th century are not put up for questioning. They brought us the concepts of 'staff' and 'line' and the need for discrete functions, notions about forecasting and planning, the need for command and control and the desirability of the stopwatch. There is a sense of discordance with our world, 100 years later. The sooner this is debated the better.

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India opts for organic cotton - World demand has dictated the eco-friendly move Growing international demand for fabrics produced from organic cotton, rather than environmental purism, has prompted India to grow cotton without using chemicals. The federal government with the support of agencies at state level has identified 1,000 hectares of land in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh for producing organic cotton on a pilot scale. Mr S. Sathyam, secretary for textiles, says: 'We hope to be able to prevail upon a large number of farmers to take to the organic way of growing cotton. This, however, is not going to be a simple exercise since cotton productivity, which already is low in India, will fall in the first year of organic cultivation.' Apart from the lower initial yield, the labour costs of organic farming are higher. The growers will also not be getting any premium for their efforts until the chemical residues in the land fully disappear. But farmers will not have to spend money on fertilisers and pesticides. India has nearly 8m hectares, or 5 per cent of the total cropped area, under cotton. But the cotton crop, which varies annually from 11.5m bales of 170kg each to 13.5m, accounts for more than 50 per cent of the country's pesticides consumption. Cotton is, therefore, seen as India's most polluting crop. However, in spite of intensive spraying of cotton fields with pesticides, the standing crop remains vulnerable to attacks by boll worm and white fly which have developed resistance to chemicals. In many Indian cotton growing centres, the pesticide use has led to the elimination of insects which used to keep the pests in check. The success of the campaign to promote the cultivation of organic cotton will largely depend on the ability of the agricultural extension officers to convince the farmers that the non-use of chemicals will not affect the fertility of land, and on the government offering a package of incentives for the changeover to the new methods of cultivation. Cotton growers, who mainly have small holdings, will need financial assistance to construct compost pits and buy bio-pesticides and sprayers. Officials say that India, which exported nearly 180m kg of cotton yarn in the year to March 1994, has been regularly receiving enquiries about yarn made from organic cotton. As a result, quite a few Indian textile companies have decided to tell the farmers to produce organic cotton for them. A start has already been made. Maikaal Fibres has been able to motivate nearly 570 farmers in Madhya Pradesh to commit about 550 hectares to organic cotton cultivation. Mr Mrigendra Jalan, the managing-director, says: 'We have given assurance to the growers that we will be buying the entire production of organic cotton at a 20 per cent premium over cotton grown by using chemicals. 'Since organic cotton will give a better return and it is possible to grow crops like groundnut, soya bean, sorghum and maize alongside organic cotton, the new experiment should succeed in India. We have been inspired by the success of the US, Paraguay and Egypt in growing organic cotton.' Officials believe that it is imperative to have an agency to certify the 'genuineness of organic cotton'. It is also important, they emphasise, that the mills planning to use organic cotton should arrange to make spot checks throughout the season to ensure that no chemicals are used. Organic cotton will be used exclusively to produce yarn for the export market. Quality, therefore, will be a basic preoccupation. Mr Sathyam explains that India, encouraged by the success of the US, had also decided to grow naturally-coloured cotton which fetches a very high premium in the overseas market. There has, however, been a setback in the programme since India failed to get the hybrid seeds and technology from the US to produce cotton in six distinct shades. The government, therefore, has decided to fund a biotechnology project so that seeds for naturally-coloured cotton are locally produced. The coloured cotton makes the dyeing of yarn and fabric redundant. And that, too, is considered eco-friendly.</p>

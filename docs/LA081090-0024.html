			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> MARCHING TO PROTECT A SWEET DEAL  </P> <P> What Saddam Hussein has done and, perhaps more important, what as a result will  not be done in Washington, jeopardize the controlling concern in this crisis:  the economy.  </P> <P> President Bush said "standing up for our principles is an American tradition."  </P> <P> That is principle, spelled p-e-t-r-o-l-e-u-m.  </P> <P> Far over the horizon is the principle of defending democracy, which here means  Israel. Hovering in the ether and selectively invoked is the principle of  acting against aggression. But the principle that drives our purpose here is:  We will defend, with force if necessary, our economy.  </P> <P> This is not a contemptible principle. But already Saddam Hussein, execrated as  an aggressor and dictator, is being exploited as an alibi and an excuse. He is  to be the alibi for any recession. And he is the excuse for evading, again,  disagreeable political decisions in domestic policy that would serve the goal  for which we have sent the fleet: prosperity.  </P></p>

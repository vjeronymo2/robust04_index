			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / US economy and job market flat: Bad news in official figures comes at difficult time for Bush THE US economy is stagnating and could be on the brink of a fresh contraction, according to figures released yesterday. Official figures show the labour market is virtually flat and factory orders are falling sharply. The US Federal Reserve yesterday held off any interest rate cut to lift the sagging economy, although many analysts believe it may act next week. The latest bad news on the economy comes at a difficult time for Mr George Bush who is trailing badly in the presidential polls and putting a brave face on the return to the race of Texas billionaire Mr Ross Perot. The Bush camp is saying Democratic contender Mr Bill Clinton has more to lose from Mr Perot's re-entry than the president. Mr Bush and Mr Clinton agreed this week to face each other in three televised debates in the run-up to the November 3 poll. Mr Perot is also expected to take part and is likely to try to focus on the economy. The Labour Department yesterday reported a 57,000 decline in non-farm employment last month and sharply revised up its estimate of job losses in August from 83,000 to 128,000. In a normal recovery, monthly employment gains of about 200,000 would be expected. Separate figures showed an unexpectedly sharp 1.9 per cent plunge in new orders for manufactured goods in August. This was the third decline in four months and followed a 0.9 per cent fall in July. The unemployment rate edged down to 7.5 per cent against 7.6 per cent in August, allowing the Bush administration to claim the economy was improving slightly. However, the fall in unemployment reflected a shrinkage of the labour force as discouraged workers abandoned the search for jobs, rather than increased hiring. Analysts said the figures - the latest in a series of depressing reports - indicated the economy was weakening again. Employment fell substantially in manufacturing and construction. The average working week also declined, indicating a likely contraction in incomes last month. Many analysts continue to predict another cut in US interest rates, in spite of the dollar's weakness. This could occur after a meeting of Fed policy-makers next week and might involve a half point cut in the discount rate to 2.5 per cent and a quarter point cut in overnight inter-bank rates to 2.75 per cent. 'The continued weakness of the economy makes another easing move by the Fed almost inevitable,' said Mr Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at the Wall Street bank, J P Morgan. Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities in New York, forecast a half point cut in the discount rate and warned there was a risk of contraction in this quarter after barely positive growth in the third quarter. Recent jobs figures have been distorted by a federal summer jobs programme. Excluding the effects of this, non-farm employment has declined on average by about 19,000 each month since June. This marks a sharp change from the second quarter, when employment rose modestly. Democrats hold their breath as Perot returns, Page 3 All eyes on Texas, Page 9 US Stocks, Page 21</p>

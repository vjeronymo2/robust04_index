			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Arts: Feinberg &amp; Richter - Piano recitals Under its new regime the Institute of Contemporary Arts has restored contemporary music to its programming. The ICA has already this year sheltered a number of short concert series. On Sunday evenings throughout the spring it has been presenting New MusICA, a series of piano recitals devised by Adrian Jack, whose original MusICA programmes were one of the most valuable and distinctive strands in London's new music in the early 1980s. The reborn series promises to concentrate on those same areas of the repertory that tend to fall outside the regard of the new-music mainstream, and often features performers whose work remains undervalued in this country. Last Sunday's recital was given by Alan Feinberg, who made his British debut in MusICA in 1985; he has gone to establish himself as one of America's leading proponents of present-day music. In what was easily the most conventional programme of the series Feinberg included two works written for him - Shulamit Ram's 1982 Verticals, and Charles Wuorinen's Third Piano Sonata from 1986. Both belong to the brash, noisy school of American piano writing. For all its technical adroitness Ram's piece was a disappointment, especially from a composer whose works are getting increasing acclaim (including a Pulitzer Prize) in the US; it is heavy on rhetoric and short of distinctive ideas. Wuorinen's sonata too buries most of its substance under a welter of notes. Yet Feinberg plays such music dazzlingly, with fine control and pinpoint articulation; he makes a very persistent advocate. It was surprising, though, that the Ravel and Faure pieces with which he'd begun were made so unprepossessing, monochrome and unidiomatic in music that demands much more care, style and fine judgment. In Birmingham's Symphony Hall on Tuesday Sviatoslav Richter gave the programme he had cancelled in London nine days earlier: a sequence of Brahms piano pieces was prefaced by some of the most arcane and rarely performed of Bach's early keyboard works. The recital only intermittently reached the heights of Richter's appearance in the Festival Hall last week; at its finest it was magnificent, but in other places textures were smudged and passage work garbled, to the extent that the poise and shape of the music was sometimes under threat. The Bach toccatas that made up the bulk of the first half are problematic pieces; one of them in D, masquerading as a 'Sonata', is very inferior, four-square stuff indeed. But Richter treated them all with deep seriousness, explosively attacking their bravura elements, colouring the slow sections with grace and charm, if never quite managing to disguise their rougher corners. The approach was far more robust and straightforward than his famous treatment of the Preludes and Fugues; that kind of minutely detailed, rapt intensity might in any case have seemed out of place in a space as large as Symphony Hall. The proportions of the Brahms performances were never in doubt. The pieces emerged almost in a single sweep, with only the C major Capriccio from Op. 78 appearing slightly misjudged. The first two Ballades of Op. 10 had vividly dramatic central episodes, the D minor in particular generating a terrifying climax out of virtually nothing; the G minor Rhapsody Op 79 no. 1 was tautly controlled, every element slotted into its place in the scheme. The final collection of pieces from Op 118 and Op 119 appeared to have been planned as a self-contained grouping in itself, alternating extroversion with intensely wrought tragedy. The E flat minor Intermezzo was its highpoint, wandering through its dark harmonic world with the merest glimmerings of light and shade, and a central theme made to heave itself up by its bootstraps.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: Pepkor gains 25% in first six months PEPKOR, South Africa's largest retail group, reported a 25 per cent rise in net profits for the six months to the end of August in spite of difficult trading conditions and having to digest a large acquisition. Following the purchase of Tradegro, whose main asset was the Checkers supermarket chain, in October 1991, turnover rose by 172 per cent to R3.72bn (Dollars 1.3bn) compared with R1.37bn a year earlier. Operating profits rose by only 12 per cent, to R96.6m from R86.5m. Mr Christo Wiese, chairman, said this was because the group had bought, with Checkers, a large amount of turnover which was not profitable. Profits before extraordinary items rose by 25 per cent to R45m from R35.9m. A R262m rights issue in February put more equity instruments into circulation, with the result that earnings per share rose by only 16 per cent to 27.7 cents from 23.9 cents. The directors are increasing the dividend by 13 per cent to 8 cents per share from 7.1 cents. Comparisons with the earlier period are complicated by the Tradegro acquisition and other restructuring in the group. Mr Wiese described trading conditions as the toughest he had seen in 27 years of business, reflected in the fact that profits at Pep, the group's main clothing, footwear and household goods arm were virtually flat.</p>

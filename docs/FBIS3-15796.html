Simes made this statement at a news  conference in Moscow Wednesday [9 March].    "We did not know that permission is needed to hold meetings  in a democratic country, taking into account the fact-finding  character of the visit," Simes said.    As has already been reported, Russian President Boris  Yeltsin  said this afternoon that neither he, nor his chief of staff,  Sergey Filatov, would meet with Nixon. A scheduled meeting  between the ex-President and Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin was also not held.    "This was even more strange as we have received confirmation  for the meeting more than once," Simes was quoted as saying.    Simes believes that Yeltsin's reaction was provoked by  distorted information he had been given about Nixon's meetings  with some prominent figures of the Russian opposition such as  the leader of the Communist faction in the State Duma, Gennadiy  Zyuganov, and ex-Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy.    Simes said the meeting with Rutskoy could not be planned  beforehand as Rutskoy was kept in custody until recently.    According to Simes, the goal of the ex-President's visit was  to familiarize himself with "political forces which have weight  in Russia and report his findings to the Congress,  administration and the American public."    Simes put a special emphasis on the "private and  fact-finding  character" of Nixon's visit to Moscow. At the same time, he  said that Nixon had a telephone conversation with U.S. President  Bill Clinton on March 3. He said that Clinton supported the  idea of the visit and hoped that Nixon would make an  unprejudiced report on the state of affairs in Russia to his  administration.    According to Simes, Nixon will have to amend his schedule of  meetings in Moscow. "Under the current circumstances," a number  of meetings with "many high-ranking members of the Russian  leadership" who had said they were ready to meet with the  ex-President would be impossible.    At the same time, Simes did not rule out that Nixon could  meet with the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia,  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy.    Simes said many Russian government officials took part in  the  organization of Nixon's visit. The official invitation for  Nixon to visit Russia was signed by Security Council Secretary  Oleg Lobov.</p>

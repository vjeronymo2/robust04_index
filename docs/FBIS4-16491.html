			<p>BFN     [Text] Boris Yeltsin is the sole and last stronghold of  legality in Russia but he might be removed from power soon,  Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev is reported saying at the  state government's meeting Thursday. Dudayev thought that what  he described as "certain elite circles in the Russian  leadership" might make next May the decisive time for Russia.    Dudayev said that the Russian leadership consisted of  factions, each playing its own game, and that his government  felt this as it tried to have talks on a Russian-Chechen treaty.  He added that some Russian politicos went as far as negotiating  with the Chechen opposition. "It would be logical if we  responded by making contacts with those who oppose the Russian  leaders but we do not do so for ethical reasons," Dudayev said.    Meanwhile, an informed source in the Chechen leadership told  Interfax that Dudayev was under pressure to discontinue the  Russo-Chechen talks until an authority emerged in Russia which  would have the situation under its full control.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Lantsman under the rubric "Wholesalers": </F> "Exchanges Attempt To Eliminate Departmental Diktat: Commission  on Commodity Exchanges Intends To Lobby for Lower Taxes"]    [Text] On Thursday 28 April the first meeting of the  Commission on Commodity Exchanges (KTB) was held at the Russian  State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and Support for New  Economic Structures. The commission considered the procuracy's  submissions on instances of violation of commodity exchange  legislation and discussed the question of exchanges'  participation in forming the charter capital of commercial  banks. However, the significance of the event lies not in the  agenda of its first meeting but in the very fact of the  commencement of functioning of a body that will to a great  extent set the rules of the game at the commodity and financial  markets of Russia.    The KTB was created in keeping with the Law "On Exchanges  and  Exchange Activities" adopted by the former Supreme Soviet in  1992. The two-year delay is quite explainable, considering the  structure of the KTB and its powers. The list of powers with  respect to organization and control of exchange activities  delegated to the KTB by Russian Federation Government Decree No.  152 includes issuance and annulment of licenses for organizing  exchange trading; appointment of state commissioners to  commodity exchanges; control over accounting documentation; and  referral of materials to law enforcement organs. In composition  the KTB is a mixed state-public body. In keeping with approved  quotas, it includes 10 ministerial functionaries from the  Ministry of the Economy, MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations], Ministry of Fuel and Energy, Ministry of  Agriculture, and State Committee on Metallurgy; five delegates  each from exchange and brokerage unions; and 10 independent  experts. According to KTB Deputy Chairman Andrey Kashevarov,  this form creates a real opportunity for a conflict-free  transition from departmental administration of markets. In his  opinion, the state-public composition of control bodies will  make the practice of licensing more democratic and legalize the  decisionmaking mechanism. At this point, however, by Mr.  Kashevarov's admission, the departmental power of agencies  operating on the commodity exchanges still considerably exceeds  the KTB's real abilities.    According to the Russian Federation State Committee on  Statistics, 177 exchanges and 35,468 brokerage offices were  operating in Russia at the end of 1993. After the boom in  exchange trading in 1991 and a sharp decline in 1992-1993, the  situation has now stabilized. The remaining exchanges have  shifted toward trading in classic exchange commodities--oil and  petroleum products, metal, and agricultural commodities. Against  the background of a considerable decline in total exchange  turnover, specialists note a sharp rise in foreign currency  futures deals. In the total turnover of 2 trillion rubles [R] in  exchange trades registered in 1993, futures accounted for R13  billion. This year the ratio of deals on commodity and financial  markets approached 1:4, which corresponds to world standards. In  the opinion of Andrey Kovalev, head of science at the Institute  for Organized Market Research, 1994 will produce a peak in  activities related to foreign currency futures deals at  exchanges. With the relative stabilization of the ruble exchange  rate and the high risk involved in operations with securities,  foreign currency futures, in Mr. Kovalev's opinion, are becoming  the most attractive segment of exchange trading.    Nevertheless, the KTB is ready to increase its activities in  organizing futures trading in agricultural products, first and  foremost grain. In June 1994 an international conference on  problems of the development of grain futures trading in Russia  will open in St. Petersburg under the aegis of the KTB.    In order to stimulate exchange activities, the KTB,  according  to its chairman Yuriy Danilov, will lobby for a reduction in tax  rates for enterprises selling their output through commodity  exchanges.</p>

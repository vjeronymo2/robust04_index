			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by observer Aleksandr Golts under the "Topic of the </F> Week" rubric: "Russia Rocked By Criminal Terror. The  President's Edict Alone Is Insufficient To Combat It"]    [Text] "And outside the window yesterday they shot...."  When a well-known humorist utters this phrase from the stage,  the audience remains completely unmoved. Because nowadays there  is no satirical exaggeration in this text. Street shootings are  an everyday feature of all large Russian cities. People get  shot outside your window and mine. And on your way to the store  for a carton of milk you have to be prepared to find yourself in  the line of fire or to be hit by shrapnel from yet another  exploding Mercedes. Criminal terror has literally rocked the  country. The only people who can be envied in such a situation  are our future homegrown Hammets and Coppolas. If the mafia  rampage in America in the 1930's gave writers and directors  material for half a century of "gangster sagas," our mafiosi,  who have long surpassed their Chicago counterparts, have set up  writers and cinematographers for several hundred years to come.    Russian gangsters can feel justified pride. They have become  a source of increased concern not only in Europe but across the  Atlantic too. Special hearings on organized crime in Russia  addressed by CIA and FBI leaders have been held in the U.S.  Congress. So it is meaningless simply to say that the federal  program for combating crime, supplemented the other day by a  corresponding presidential edict, meets the country's vital  needs. Let us be frank: Organized crime today threatens not  only each and every one of us as individual citizens. It  threatens the very fabric of the Russian state. Society  therefore requires decisive action from the authorities.    Yet, as soon as it was made public, the president's edict  was  subjected to fierce and -- at least partly -- justified  criticism from legislators, the press, and experts. It is  perfectly clear why. The edict effectively invests the  law-enforcent organs with extraordinary powers which cut right  across existing legislation. Like many documents in the past, it  is written with a view to ideal executors, people with "clean  hands and warm hearts."    However, just as any piece of equipment should incorporate a  fail-safe mechanism against idiots, so in composing edicts we  need, alas, to proceed on the basis of human frailty. I  certainly have no wish to cast sweeping aspersions on all those  confronting the gangsters in unbelievably difficult conditions.  But among law-enforcement officers, as among representatives of  any other speciality, there are self-seeking and dishonorable  people inclined to break the law. Recent major scandals  demonstrate this. And the fact is that that the edict opens up  an opportunity for such people to do what they like. Even as  ordinary citizens without offices or bank accounts, we can  hardly expect to remain unaffected by this. After all, just  through a chance conjunction of circumstances you could find  yourself in the way of some big shot or minor chief who has the  right to hold you in detention for 30 days without filing  charges....    Moreover, you cannot help remembering the sad results of the  numerous programs and edicts on combating crime which have  "surfaced" in the past few years. Everything has somehow or  other culminated either in nothing at all, or in the notorious  "suitcases" that some politicians at the helm of the battle with  the mafia have used to collect compromising material on others.    But, for all the justice of the complaints that have been  made, there is another side to the coin. An extraordinary  situation (and that is precisely what it is) requires  extraordinary measures. Moreover, it is patently obvious that  the people attacking the president's edict are precisely those  who are in one way or another are responsible for the existing  state of affairs. I mean the legislators, the majority of whom  actually got into the Duma on platforms of ruthlessly combating  crime. But where are the new codes to meet the prevailing  situation? Our legislative snail, it seems, is not even  crawling along. The president's edict, on the other hand,  whether it is good or bad, is effectively the authorities' only  real action in this sphere. It is not enough to criticize this  edict and the executive: If you do not like the government's  program, you should propose your own program of measures, and  quickly. It is actually a good thing that the president's edict  has provoked a reaction, albeit negative; at least it has pushed  the appropriate Duma committees to draw up such a program.    Finally, perhaps the most important thing is what the  critics  of this document have overlooked. They are not examining it in  the context of the president's package of economic edicts. Yet  it is perfectly obvious that our crime wave -- just like any  other crime wave, moreover -- was nurtured on the nourishing  broth of economic chaos. On the other hand, as one U.S. expert  noted, a "historically unprecedented clearance sale" is under  way. The property of a vast country is changing owners. This  is happening simultaneously with the extremely confused process  of privatization itself. At the same time, there is an almost  total absence of legislation in the sphere of business, which  allows the hopeless debtor to thrive. All this drives our  businessmen, who in another situation would be extremely  law-abiding, into the arms of the mobsters. If there are no  laws, or they do not operate, gangsters altruistically (oh, how  altruistically) take upon themselves the role of arbiters in  business disputes, and indeed the role of judicial executioners  as well.    On the other hand, crime rises like yeast in conditions  whereby the population is impoverished and the gap between rich  and poor is growing. As far as I understand it, the president's  latest edicts, in addition to their main goal of giving impetus  to reforms, objectively create an obstacle in the way of the  criminalization of the economy. After all, it was not the  all-powerful FBI Director Hoover who defeated the mafia in the  United States. That was achieved by Roosevelt's reforms, which  rescued the U.S. economy from crisis.    If we now managed to create a system of social protection  that was in any way effective, it would deprive the mafia of a  stream of new recruits. The introduction of elementary order in  the finance and taxation spheres, in relations between the state  and the enterprises that supposedly belong to it, and in the  sphere of export licensing and banking activity should sharply  narrow the field of activity for organized crime. It is here,  in purging economic relationships of crime, that the highroad in  the struggle against crime lies. Certainly not in stepping up  repressive measures. What is needed at the moment is some major  impetus, some kind of tough shake-up. So as to transform the  situation regarding crime in action and not just in words. We  would very much like to see the president's edict provide just  such an impetus. Meanwhile it is not only journalists and  parliamentarians who have reacted to it. Those whom it directly  affects -- the gangsters -- have also responded. A series of  explosions has once again rocked the capital. These people  still feel themselves masters of the situation. The authorities  must make haste to prevent that feeling from becoming a  reality....</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRESS CODE FOR CAB DRIVERS  </P> <P> Clean clothes? Great! Buttoned-up shirts? Fine. No open-toed sandals? OK.  Optional uniforms with company logos and ties? Why not. Better manners?  Wonderful.  </P> <P> But what possible public health, public safety or public interest need is  served by the city of Los Angeles telling commercial taxicab drivers they can't  wear plaid pants or leisure suits (Metro, March 30)? Are clashing colors and  polyester illegal? Maybe a driver likes to wear striped pants in 13 day-glo  colors. That's not illegal -- yet!  </P> <P> I rarely have a need to ride in a cab, but if, I did my sole concern would be  getting to my destination safely, quickly and without being overcharged. The  color or pattern of the driver's pants might not be what I would choose to  wear, but it's not my business (nor should it be the city's) to play the role  of a fashion expert.  </P> <P> What's next -- regulations on what color shirt my hair stylist can wear? What  if the city had outlawed narrow ties for its employees 10 years ago, when wide  ties were in? (Now, of course, it's just the opposite.) Will we need a corps of  fashion police to enforce these silly laws? With all the city's problems, let's  leave fashion alone.  </P> <P> SHEL ERLICH  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

[passage omitted]    Matters took a more serious turn later in the evening when  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was informed by the Interior  Minister Nasirullah Babar that three rockets had been fired from  Afghanistan into Pakistan at the Towr Kham border.    Afghans without visas attempted to enter Pakistan illegally  during the dusk hours. There were also some skirmishes on  Thursday evening when such attempts to cross over into Pakistan  were made by Afghans. Of late, a shift in Pakistan policy  resulted in the closure of its borders with Afghanistan,  allowing only trucks loaded with goods allowed to go to  Afghanistan and Afghans with visas to enter the country.    Three rockets were fixed at different targets: the Tourist  Inn, an empty checkpost and a third at an unidentified target.  However, there were no causalities.    Babar said, "The Afghan Government has been sent a clear  message from us. We will have to take strict measures."  [passage omitted]</p>

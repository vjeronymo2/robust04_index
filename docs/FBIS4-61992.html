			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze has said that  the republic's legislation is outdated. In a message to  parliament, the Georgian leader asked deputies to take urgent  measures to form new economic relations. This is an obligatory  condition for the formation and development of the Georgian  statehood, he believes.    Shevardnadze says in his message that the government is to  submit shortly to parliament three different types of bills  which should be given particular attention.    The first package refers to economic relations, the second  one to the bills on legal guarantees for the protection of the  rights of the economic subjects which take part in material  relations. The third package has laws which, in line with the  democratic course chosen by Georgia, should regulate  relationships among branches of power.    The message says that parliament should adopt also codes of  civil laws, criminal and labor laws as well as laws on  administrative violations of laws.    As the speaker of parliament I am prepared, to speed up the  process of law-making, to cooperate with all commissions,  factions and individual deputies, says the message.</p>

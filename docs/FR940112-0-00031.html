			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Amend &sect;&sect;404.988(c)(1) and 416.1488(c) to indicate that in determining whether a determination or decision was obtained by fraud or similar fault for the purposes of reopening, we will take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) the individual has.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Good Cause for Refusal To Accept Rehabilitation Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under sections 222(b) and 1615(c) of the Act and the implementing regulations at &sect;&sect;404.422 and 416.1328, deductions may be imposed against title II benefits, or title XVI benefits may be suspended, if a disabled or blind beneficiary refuses without good cause to accept certain rehabilitation services. If good cause can be established for the refusal, benefits will not be affected. The final regulations amend the pertinent regulations relating to good cause for refusal of rehabilitation services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The change we are making in part 416 of the regulations is based on the amendment to section 1631(c)(1) of the Act. We are making a comparable change in part 404 in the interest of consistency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 404.422 and 416.1715 of our regulations discuss how we determine whether an individual has good cause for refusing rehabilitation services. We are amending &sect;&sect;404.422(e) and 416.1715(a) to provide that in making good cause determinations concerning the refusal of rehabilitation services, we will take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) the individual has. We are also making a technical correction in a cross-reference contained in &sect;416.2203 to indicate that ``good cause'' for refusal of vocational rehabilitation services is defined in &sect;416.1715.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Good Reason for Not Applying for Other Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1611(e)(2) of the Act requires that SSI applicants and beneficiaries apply for other benefits for which they may be eligible within 30 days from the date the individual receives our notice about any other benefits for which the individual is likely to be eligible. Our existing regulations &sect;&sect;416.210(e) and 416.1330(a) provide that individuals are not eligible for SSI benefits if they do not apply for the other benefits when told to do so. However, both &sect;&sect;416.210(e) and 416.1330(a) provide that the individual will not be found ineligible for SSI benefits if the individual had good reason (&sect;416.210(e)) or good cause (&sect;416.1330(a)) for not applying for the other benefits within the 30-day period or taking other necessary steps to obtain them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are amending &sect;416.210(e)(2) to provide that we will take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the English language) the individual has in determining good reason or good cause for not filing for other benefits. Since &sect;416.1330(a) refers to &sect;416.210(e), we are not amending &sect;416.1330(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

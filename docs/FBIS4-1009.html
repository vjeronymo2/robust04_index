			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Paul Stober and Chris Louw] </F>   [Text] The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has  submitted a R700-million [rand] budget to the government --  R375-million of which will go towards the running of the actual  election. Election- related spending could reach R1.5-billion  by the end of May. In a document, "Estimated Expenditure  December 20 1993- May 31 1994", the IEC outlined the expected  cost of the election.    Appropriations for IEC directorates and departments include  R154-million for monitoring, R26-million for voter education,  R29- million for communication and R29-million for election  adjudication. Salaries take up a chunk of the bill, and at the  top of the scale are the 16 commissioners who earn up to R25,000  a month and receive. R2,000 a month entertainment allowance and  a R50 a day subsistence allowance.    During international and local trips, they receive an  additional allowance of R500 a day. The budget for the  commissioners' office is R5.5-million. Chief directors of IEC  departments receive R17,000 a month, while heads of departments  are earmarked to receive R14,000 a month. Lower grade officials  are receiving around R58,000 for three-month contracts.    The IEC salaries are supposed to be on the same scales as  those of civil servants, but in practice they are much higher.  Assistant directors in the civil service receive up to R70,000  a year, while scales of assistant directors in the IEC start at  R70,000.    South African civil servants working for the IEC complain  that their salaries are fixed, while those appointed by the IEC  are linked to what they would have lost had they carried on with  their normal jobs. A bonus plan for civil servants is being  worked on to even the pay structure.    The IEC has also equipped its headquarters and regional  offices with modern technology and the commission has purchased  450 computers. Provision is made for 2,500 cellular telephones,  which are expected to cost R4.5-million. There is also  R10.5-million for satellite back-up equipment. Vehicles are  also on the IEC's shopping list and it is looking for 10 4x4  vehicles, 100 micro buses and wants to hire 3,000 vehicles at a  cost of R3,000 a month.    Although the budget has yet to be approved, the IEC has had  to go ahead with many of the purchases. Until the budget is  approved, the IEC is living off R140-million appropriated by the  Transitional Executive Council (TEC) at the end of last year,  grants from foreign donors and credit. The government of  national unity will be committed to picking up the bill for the  election.    The TEC -- which has a budget of R18.9-million -- does not  have the responsibility of approving the budget, and the final  appropriation will have to be approved by parliament. In terms  of the Act setting up the commission, money matters are the  responsibility of the commission's chief executive -- who has a  budget of R1.7 million -- although his records will be audited  by the auditor-general.    However, IEC staff point out that until last week, there  were  no set guidelines for the requisition of personnel and equipment  and rules were made as issues cropped up. Although the TEC is  not responsible for the IEC's budget, it has appropriated money  for other election related expenses. The council has ordered  that policemen receive the same pay as members of the National  Peacekeeping Force for the duration of the election. This will  add R120-million to the R150-million the police planned to spend  on election operations.    The council also decided to grant the SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation] R31.5-million to cover debts incurred  to the corporation by the Democracy Broadcast Education Unit  (Debi) and to subsidies election coverage. If it is any  consolation to South Africans, foreign taxpayers are also  chipping in a fair bit to ensure free and fair elections    The European Union Election Unit in South Africa has a  budget  of R27-million. This is in addition to the R20-million it  granted to the Independent Forum for Electoral Education, in  July 1993, and a further R10-million towards the State Election  Fund for South African political parties.    --The United Nations mission will be spending R129-million  to  cover the costs of its observers but will not be funding any  projects.    --The Commonwealth, which will also only be observing, has  budgeted R2.65-million for its mission.    --The Organisation of African Unity, which already has a  presence in the country, is finalising the size of its mission  and its budget this week.</p>

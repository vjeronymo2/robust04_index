			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report under the "Defense Ministry Meeting" </F> rubric: "It is Bad Enough To Be Poor, But To Be Weak Is Even  Worse"]    [Text] Nearly all Defense Ministry chiefs conferred behind  closed doors yesterday for as long as two hours. The meeting  chaired by both first deputy defense ministers -- Andrey  Kokoshin and Mikhail Kolesnikov, who is also chief of the  General Staff -- was prompted by a reason just as serious as any  threat to the country's national security. Namely, money. Or,  rather, by a lack of it. The Armed Forces have virtually no  money even to pay salaries to officers and to maintain  elementary combat readiness.    Participants in the meeting of the Defense Ministry's  commission on financial support to the Armed Forces and the  implementation of the state defense order faced a very complex  task: to choose on what the ministry's rather meager funds  should be spent. The military can hardly be reproached for  insatiable appetites. For reasons of economy they have already  reduced even mobilization targets and given up plans to procure  many types of weapons. But this has improved the situation only  marginally because the state debts to the Armed Forces and  enterprises carrying out defense orders have exceeded 3 billion  rubles.    At the same time, there is no longer any hope that the army  will be rich enough to pull through on its own. A high-ranking  official on the commission pointed out that "internal financial  reserves of the Armed Forces have effectively been exhausted."    In the end, the meeting decided that money should be spent  first of all on the payment of money allowances, supplying of  military units with food and electric power, and also the  maintenance of nuclear security. Even these areas, however,  will not have guaranteed funding: the withdrawal of troops from  foreign countries and their accommodation in Russia will require  extra spending. As for weapons procurements, combat command,  control, and communications equipment, high-precision weapons,  and electronic warfare equipment will still be a priority.    The commission meeting results were summed up by Andrey  Kokoshin. After the meeting he told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY  correspondent that "it is becoming harder and harder to ensure  the combat efficiency of the Armed Forces given the current  conditions of financing." Lower-ranking officials of the  Defense Ministry, however, described the situation in the army  in different, stronger expressions.</p>

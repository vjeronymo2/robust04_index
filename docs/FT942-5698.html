			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Walker 'driving force' in fraud: Court hears of alleged thefts totalling Pounds 17m Mr George Walker, former chairman and chief executive of Brent Walker, the property and leisure group, fraudulently inflated the company's profits in the mid-1980s to mislead investors and creditors about the success and financial health of his business empire, it was alleged at the Old Bailey yesterday. Mr Peter Rook QC, prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office, told the jury yesterday that Mr Walker was the 'driving force' behind a fraud which also involved the theft of Pounds 17m from the company and complex misrepresentations of the company's accounts to conceal the dishonesty from the outside world, Mr Rook was opening the prosecution case on the first day of the trial of Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker group finance director. Mr Walker faces four charges of theft involving a total of Pounds 17m, two charges of false accounting and one of conspiring to falsify the Brent Walker accounts to overstate the company's profits and assets. Mr Aquilina faces one charge of the theft of Pounds 4.5m, three charges of false accounting and one of conspiring to falsify the company's accounts. Both men deny all the charges. Mr Rook said the fraud centred on the activities of Brent Walker's film, television and video subsidiary. Between 1984 and 1987 the profits of this division were artificially boosted by Pounds 19.3m - profits which also appeared in the accounts of the overall group which reported healthy results to shareholders throughout the period. He said: 'In reality, this income was not true income. The profits were bogus. They did not reflect proper commercial transactions. Brent Walker was funding its own profits' He said the profit-boosting, financed from Brent Walker funds, proved expensive and cost the company Pounds 30m. The fraud made a substantial difference to the apparent health of Brent Walker, he said. In 1987 the media division made a Pounds 1.7m loss when in reality it was claimed the subsidiary was responsible for almost half of group profits. Had this been known by the markets the subsequent history of Brent Walker might have been very different. To keep the illegal profit-boosting concealed, the company accounts had to be massaged, he said. Mr Walker and Mr Aquilina were aided in this by two former directors of the media division, Mr Donald Anderson and Mr John Quested. Mr Rook said this was done by falsely stating that film rights had been sold to three purchasers. In all cases, however, the purchasers were refunded their money by Brent Walker through a series of complex circular transactions. To keep the fraud concealed, it became necessary for Mr Walker and Mr Aquilina to extract even more money from the company and to continue manipulating the company accounts. He said: 'Each time the defendants tried to paper over the cracks, cracks appeared elsewhere so other measures would have to be taken to cover up the situation.' The Brent Walker auditors, Leigh Carr, must have been 'less than vigilant', Mr Rook said. However, when some of the bogus transactions were first questioned in the press, Mr Walker misled KPMG Peat Marwick, joint auditors from 1988, and lied to the Stock Exchange. The trial, expected to last up to five months, continues today.</p>

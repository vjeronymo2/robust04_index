			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PAIR CHARGED IN PLOT TO BLOW UP RIVAL NIGHTCLUB  </P> <P> The owner of an Anaheim nightclub and his head bouncer were arrested Wednesday  in connection with a plot to blow up a competitor's cabaret across town,  federal authorities said.  </P> <P> Tsu E. Peng, 28, who owns the Palace nightclub, and Harold M. Blaich Jr., 47,  the establishment's security director, were arrested on felony conspiracy  charges alleging that they planned to destroy the Ritz nightclub at 507 S.  Brookhurst St.  </P> <P> "It's our belief that they were trying to eliminate their competition," said  FBI Special Agent Wylie B. Cox, who is based in Santa Ana. "They thought by  eliminating the Ritz they would pick up its clientele."  </P> <P> According to an affidavit filed in federal court Wednesday, Peng and Blaich  allegedly devised the scheme to help Peng's financially troubled club at 3150  W. Lincoln Blvd. The Ritz and Palace cater to Vietnamese.  </P> <P> FBI agents said they were tipped to the alleged plot on Sept. 28 when a  confidential informant was contacted by Blaich, who asked whether the informant  knew anything about explosives.  </P> <P> "Blaich then told the source that the Ritz nightclub was 'killing' his business  at the Palace nightclub and that he needed someone to 'take it out,' i.e. 'blow  it up,' " the affidavit states.  </P> <P> The informant allegedly told Blaich that he knew somebody who might do the job.  According to the affidavit, Blaich then told the informant that Peng "would pay  the bomber $500 as a down payment and $1,000 after the job was completed."  </P> <P> Cox said the informant notified the FBI after a meeting with Blaich.  </P> <P> Court documents state that several days later the informant, wearing a tape  recorder, met with Peng at a doughnut shop near the Palace and confirmed the  arrangement with the owner.  </P> <P> "During the meeting, Peng (said) the owner of the Ritz had been causing trouble  for (his) nightclub for a long time and was stealing his clientele," the  affidavit states.  </P> <P> In a subsequent phone conversation with the informant, Blaich was heard saying  that he didn't care "if the Ritz was bombed, burned or both so long as it was  disabled from opening for two or three years," the court papers stated.  </P> <P> In addition, Blaich allegedly told the informant that the Palace's employees  would get raises if the club gained the Ritz's business.  </P> <P> The affidavit states that Peng subsequently gave the informant $500 on Oct. 7  during a meeting at the Palace. Cox said the money was the down payment to  destroy the Ritz.  </P> <P> Wednesday, FBI agents, Anaheim police, sheriff's deputies and agents from the  federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms arrested Peng at the club and  Blaich at his home in Midway City.  </P> <P> The proprietors of the Ritz could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Peng is being held on $100,000 bail and Blaich on $50,000 bail at the federal  Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

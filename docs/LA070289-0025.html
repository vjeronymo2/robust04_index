			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BOOKS: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> BIEDERMEIER  </P> <P> BY ANGUS WILKIE  </P> <P> (Abbeville Press; 1987)  </P> <P> IT IS ONE of the ironies of design history that the Biedermeier style, so  popular today for its simple line and understated elegance, should have  flourished -- if only during a brief time, from 1815 to 1848 -- against the  pompous and over-decorated background of the Austrian Empire and the German  states of the period. The style is notable for clarity of design and superb  craftsmanship. It was conceived of as a kind of pseudo-elegant decor for the  bourgeoisie, a much simplified version of the sort of thing that appealed to  minor German princelings. Thank heaven the middle class could not afford the  extravagance of the nobility, for we now have a legacy of furniture that is  particularly appropriate to contemporary interior design. There are many  charming watercolors of the period in the book, along with numerous color  photographs illustrating this tasteful 19th-Century furniture. ($55) Sam  Burchell  </P></p>

In addition, TAALS will be permitted to compile and distribute accurate aggregate historical market information concerning past fees that were actually charged no earlier than three years after this order becomes final, if presented in an unbiased and nondeceptive manner that maintains the anonymity of the parties to the transactions underlying such reports.

With any publication of fees permitted by the order, TAALS must include a statement that it is prohibited from recommending fees applicable in the United States and that interpreters must independently determine their own fees. In addition, the order states that it does not prohibit TAALS from providing information or its nonbinding and noncoercive views concerning interpretation equipment, the hours of work or preparation, or the number of language specialists used for a type of job. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For some specific information, members should refer to the order itself, which is enclosed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Counsel, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> American Association of Language Specialists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PINIELLA NOT UNDER INQUIRY, VINCENT SAYS  </P> <P> Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent said today that his office is not  investigating Cincinnati Reds Manager Lou Piniella, whose name surfaced in a  published transcript of George Steinbrenner's two-day hearing on the Yankee  owner's paying of $40,000 to gambler Howard Spira.  </P> <P> The transcript, published by The National sports daily, quoted Steinbrenner as  saying one of the reasons he gave the money to Spira was that he feared he  would reveal information on the gambling habits of Piniella, a former Yankee  player, manager and general manager.  </P> <P> "We looked into it and there's nothing to it," Vincent said.  </P> <P> The commissioner later issued a statement clearing the Cincinnati Reds manager.  </P> <P> "Regrettably, the release of Mr. Steinbrenner's testimony without my approval  or prior knowledge has caused the disclosure of the names of people who are not  involved in my investigation," Vincent said. "Lou Piniella's name was raised by  Mr. Steinbrenner. John Dowd subsequently interviewed Mr. Piniella, who  cooperated fully."  </P> <P> Dowd was hired by Vincent to submit a report to him on Steinbrenner's dealings  with Spira.  </P> <P> "I am satisfied that Lou Piniella did not engage in any activity warranting  further attention from my office. I regret that the public disclosure of this  testimony had unfairly insinuated Mr. Piniella into this affair. Mr. Piniella  is in good standing with me and my office."  </P> <P> The newspaper said Steinbrenner wrote a letter to the commissioner after the  hearings, acknowledging that, "in hindsight, I used poor judgment in giving  Spira the $40,000."  </P></p>

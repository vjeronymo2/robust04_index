			<p>BFN     [Text] University of Lagos reopened today after about six  weeks closure as a result of a violence which followed  allegations of cult activities. The Akoka campus was busy today  with students preparing for their 1992/93 [as heard] second  semester examinations scheduled to start on Wednesday. Though  the nonacademic staff are on strike, the university authorities  say the semester examinations will still hold as scheduled.</p>

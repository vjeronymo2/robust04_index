			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Destination France - French attempts at direct marketing in the UK Jill Lucas was wondering where to go with her top 50 sales people when she received a leaflet in the mail suggesting she take them to the south of France. Lucas, marketing executive of Rentokil Healthcare, had once taken a sales group to Paris, but she thought the south of France option was probably too expensive. The leaflet persuaded her otherwise, and in October she took the sales people, who had exceeded their targets in selling washroom soaps and related products, to Nice. Lucas was one of the successes of a marketing campaign launched three years ago by the UK branch of the French Government Tourist Office. Bernard Crouset, deputy director of the London office, says that, like most tourist boards, the French organisation had traditionally been reactive. It saw its job as responding to queries from people planning to visit France and to show the country's wares at trade fairs. It did not approach potential visitors directly. Instead, it advertised France in the newspapers and on television. But the French tourist board decided to see whether direct marketing - which has long been used to sell products and services - could be used to promote a country. In particular, the tourist board wanted to know how to approach directly the managers in companies who organise conferences and 'incentive trips', given as rewards to successful staff members. The French organisation decided to try its direct marketing in the UK first because France was already a well-established destination for British travellers. Conference and incentive trip visitors are valuable customers because they spend so much more than leisure tourists. Their flight and hotel expenses have usually been paid for by their employers, leaving them with more spending money than tourists. Those going on conference trips also tend to be achievers with higher levels of disposable income than many tourists. The French tourist office asked the Marketing Organisation, a UK company, to compile a database of managers in British organisations responsible for conference venues. The Marketing Organisation compiled a list of 3,000 UK decision-makers and wrote to them directly. If they expressed an interest in visiting a particular region of France, tourist and conference officials from that area would be brought to the UK to press their case. Emmet Hart, the Marketing Organisation's sales and marketing director, says keeping the database up to date is an onerous task. In constantly revising the database, the Marketing Organisation has found that about 25 per cent of its information becomes out of date each year as conference decision-makers move to other positions or to other companies. Crouset insists, however, that the effort is worth it. First, the direct marketing of France in the UK has turned out to be remarkably cheap. The budget for the whole programme is only Pounds 240,000 a year, of which the tourist office pays only a quarter. The remainder has been met by the various French regional governments and by Air France. Second, Crouset says that over the past four years France has doubled its share of the overseas-bound UK conference and incentive trip market to 25 per cent. Not everything has gone France's way, however. The strength of the French franc against sterling has made France a less attractive destination for UK travellers than it has been in previous years. Crouset says France also faces strong competition from destinations such as Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Cyprus. Several other tourist boards, he says, are thinking about following the French and marketing themselves directly to UK conference organisers.</p>

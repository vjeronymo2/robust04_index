			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. REGISTRAR ACTS TO SETTLE POLL GUARD CASE  </P> <P> County Registrar of Voters Donald Tanney has agreed to pay a $20,000 settlement  and retrain poll workers nearly a year after six Latino voters filed federal  suit, contending that they were intimidated during the 1988 general election by  uniformed guards posted at polling places by the Orange County Republican  Party.  </P> <P> Documents filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana showed that Tanney, while  admitting no wrongdoing, will train poll workers to be more sensitive to ethnic  and racial issues and to bar harassment of voters.  </P> <P> The proposed settlement must be approved by U.S. District Judge J. Spencer  Letts. A hearing is set for Nov. 27. And because Tanney was functioning in his  official capacity, the money will come from taxpayer funds upon approval by the  Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> The revised training instructions outlined in the settlement are already being  given to the approximately 1,900 people who are preparing to work in the  county's 957 polling places Tuesday, Assistant Registrar of Voters Rosalyn  Lever said.  </P> <P> According to a text of the new instructions filed in court records, voter  officials will now tell trainees, "As precinct officers, you must be sensitive  to the racial, ethnic and cultural makeup of your precinct voters and the  vulnerability of some voters to intimidation."  </P> <P> The six individual plaintiffs, joined by several Latino civil rights groups,  contend that the county and state GOP organizations conspired with Garden Grove  Republican Curt Pringle to scare away voters by placing 20 guards at 20  predominantly Latino polling places in Santa Ana during the Nov. 8, 1988,  election. Pringle narrowly defeated Democrat Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach for  the 72nd Assembly District seat.  </P> <P> The resulting controversy sparked state legislation forbidding armed or  uniformed guards at polling places. The measure was signed into law by Gov.  George Deukmejian on Sept. 8.  </P> <P> The guards carried signs in Spanish and English, warning that non-citizens  cannot legally vote. Saddleback Security Services Corp., which provided the  guards, settled its portion of the lawsuit for $60,000 in July. Among the  remaining defendants are Pringle, his campaign, the county Republican Party's  Central Committee and the state Republican Party.  </P> <P> Tanney could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, David J. Brobeck Jr., said  that Tanney was not responsible for the actions of the guards, but he agreed to  settle the case as "a matter of economics," to save the time and expense of a  trial.  </P> <P> "If we'd done something to intimidate someone or favor the guards or help them  intimidate people, we wouldn't be settling for so little money," Brobeck said.  </P> <P> Tanney believed, Brobeck continued, that precinct workers were getting adequate  training, but he agreed to revise the instructions because he wants the poll  workers "well-trained and prepared for whatever happens out there."  </P> <P> Lowell Finley, one of the attorneys for the six Latino voters and the civil  rights organizations, said evidence uncovered in the case showed that the  county registrar of voters had information that there might be "trouble" on  Election Day and did nothing to alert precinct workers that there might be  attempts to challenge or intimidate voters. Some workers also aided the guards  by permitting them to enter voting places with their signs, Finley added.  </P> <P> The new training instructions tell precinct workers that if they see someone  challenging a voter at the polling place, they should "ask them to leave," and  if they refuse, the workers should call the registrar of voters office  immediately. They are also told that no signs except those of the registrar may  be posted within 100 feet of the polling place.  </P> <P> "Poll watchers have a right to be in your polling place, however they should  not, in any way, be involved with polling-place operations and they may not  interfere with your operation of the polling place," the new training material  says. "They also may not remain if they interfere with or intimidate voters. If  you believe that the presence or activity of a poll watcher may be intimidating  voters, please call our office immediately."  </P> <P> Finley said he hopes the new instructions will "sensitize the precinct workers  to the potential problems" of voters who belong to minority groups.  </P> <P> Of special concern, he said, are recently naturalized citizens who are  "sensitive to insults" and who have been "subjected to the fears of encounters  with immigration authorities." Such people are especially vulnerable to a  tactic such as the posting of uniformed guards at a polling place, Finley said.  </P> <P> Thomas A. Fuentes, chairman of the county Republican Party and also a defendant  in the lawsuit, said the guards were hired because GOP workers had heard a  rumor that the Democrats might try to bus immigrants in from Mexico to bolster  Thierbach's position.  </P> <P> Fuentes said the guards were not hired to intimidate or harass anyone, merely  to "observe and detect" any illegal voting and report it to the proper  authorities.  </P> <P> Finley said the $20,000 will go to the six voters, but they have not yet  decided how it will be divided or spent.  </P></p>

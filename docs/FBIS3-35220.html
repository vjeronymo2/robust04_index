On my own behalf, and in my capacity as the leader of  the third party in the government coalition, I am pleased to  thank His Majesty King Husayn for hosting this blessed gathering  and this agreement. God willing, this will end the dispute and  the crisis. It will enable all officials to return to their  posts, so we can start working to implement this document and  our government and parties' programs, so we can serve our  country and free it from the economic and political crisis it  is experiencing.    We hope this gathering of ours will end the crisis and allow  us to enter into a new age, the age of building, work, and  cooperation, and loyalty to our dear homeland.    Finally, I once again thank his majesty for hosting this  agreement and for his efforts. God's blessings be upon you.</p>

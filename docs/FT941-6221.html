			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone firm Vodafone, the UK's biggest cellular telephones group, was one of only a handful of FT-SE 100 constituents to gain ground yesterday, responding to renewed US buying and news of further big increases in the group's subscriber base. The group said net new connections to its network during February were 36,551 and that it now served more than 1.12m subscribers. Vodafone's arch-rival in the cellular telephones business in the UK, Cellnet, owned 60-40 by BT and the Securicor group, also revealed highly encouraging new subscriber figures. Cellnet attracted 39,000 new customers to its service during February. Vodafone shares moved up 7 1/2 more to 609p in heavy turnover of 2.9m. BT shares, on the other hand, suffered from the general weakness across the market, with the 'old' stock 3 1/2 off at 431 1/2 p and the 'new' 4 down at 312 1/2 p. An early upsurge in Abbey National, after the bank revealed better than expected profits and a top of the range increase in the dividend, failed to hold and the bank's shares retreated to close sharply lower on the session. But marketmakers were keen to point out that there had been very little selling pressure in the stock. 'The numbers were excellent and the dividend was as good as we could have expected, but you cannot ignore a falling market; when the market pounces, so will Abbey,' was the comment from one trader. The shares ended a volatile session 16 cheaper at 489p, having been as high as 516p immediately after the figures were announced. Turnover reached 9.7m shares. Dealers reported hefty selling of the merchant banks late in the session amid continuing worries about their exposure to big losses in bond markets incurred by some of the big hedge funds. SG Warburg relinquished 7 to 888p, Hambros 19 to 385p and Schroders 30 to 1188p. General Accident was one of the FT-SE 100's star performers, the shares managing to close in positive territory and 4 higher at 651p, after 661p, following the excellent preliminary figures. Lloyds Abbey Life strengthened 23 to 420p, buoyed by a James Capel recommendation. An upbeat trading statement from Grand Metropolitan provided a temporary relief to the downward pressure in the drinks sector, but the shares soon succumbed to the market trend and fell further during the afternoon. The stock finished 15 down at 468p after a hefty 8.8m traded. Among other big fallers, Bass tumbled 19 to 518p, Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley 13 to 506p and Whitbread 11 to 554p. Dealers said sentiment had been hit by reports that UK consumers will be allowed to telephone drinks orders to France for direct delivery. Betting and hotel group Ladbroke gained 2 1/2 at 211 1/2 p on 11m traded on expectations of good results tomorrow. Joint broker Smith New Court was also said to be making positive noises. Although a cut in the dividend is forecast by some analysts, more visibility is also being anticipated in the first set of results since the group's founder Mr Cyril Stein retired. Granada was hit by further selling in the wake of its takeover of LWT and the shares fell 15 to 540p on turnover of 7.3m. LWT slid 17 to 708p. Market fears on the outlook for interest rates led to weakness in international conglomerate Hanson, leaving the shares trailing 4 at 273 1/2 p. Leading pharmaceutical stocks were generally firm on dollar considerations. Glaxo, with Panmure Gordon positive, rose 4 1/2 to 683p, Wellcome put on 2 at 656p and Zeneca appreciated 7 to 776p. A profits rise of 60 per cent from Inveresk saw shares in the speciality paper group advance 7 to 230p. Dawson International slipped 5 to 153p after the company stated that it was pulling out of the loss-making US woollen business and would take a one-off exceptional provision of Pounds 50m for this year. Furniture group Silentnight dropped 38 after announcing that profits for the year ended in January would be below market expectations. The shares later recovered some ground to close at 355p, a fall of 18 on the day. The company blamed margin pressures for the warning. Boots was said to have been undone by a big US seller and the shares fell 14 to 532p. Yield buying lifted Dalgety by 3 to 473p. British Steel declined 5 to 138 1/2 p, with 13m shares traded, after steel group ASW reported full-year figures below market expectations and warned of continuing overcapacity in the industry. ASW was unchanged at 190p. International mining group RTZ was among a handful of stocks that resisted the market slide, closing 14 up at 867p on volume of 5.2m, making it the best performing stock in the FT-SE 100. The shares were boosted by a firm gold price and the prospect of increased demand for copper.</p>

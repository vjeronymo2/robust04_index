			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Arts: Sea-shore beasts and graffiti - The recent work of artists David Hepher, John Bellany and Ian Tyson While it might be argued that we have seen, and heard, more than enough of one of the painters currently filling the vasty halls of Flowers East, we have certainly seen far too little of the other two. What is no less certain is that all three of them, on this evidence, are working through into their later maturity at the top of their form. Of the two figurative painters, David Hepher is the more sombre in his visual material, the more self-effacing and unshowy in his actual working of paint and surface, and the more obviously thoughtful in his engagement with subject and ideas. His work is none the less interesting or beautiful for that. His subject is the tower block of the council estate, dread image of the social engineering of the 1960s, high-minded, insensitive and misconceived. He has been painting these things over many years, taking them as they are and moving in close to their densely regular fronts of balconies and window-frames, uninflected but by the vagaries of human use and habitation, marked by plants and curtains and the washing hung out to dry. This interest continues here in some small studies, freely and freshly stated. But for the most part, and in all the larger canvases on show, he has moved into something that is both visually and conceptually more complicated. He now lays upon the canvas a ground the colour and texture of concrete, complete with the marks and ridges of the defining shuttering by which the tower-blocks themselves were built. Upon this prepared surface he paints the image of the tower, but not so as to fill the canvas entirely. This image, conventionally pictorial in its own terms, is but a formal element against which others are brought into play - child-like structures, images of cities taken from the painting of the early renaissance, and, overlaying everything, the familiar, meaningless calligraphy of sprayed graffiti. Here, then, are paintings that start as the same blank walls, luring the painter to them as they lure the graffitist. But oh, how elegant the painter's own graffiti are, and how ironically light and sensitive his touch. Would that all graffiti were so beautiful. This is painting of a high order, full of subtlety and ambiguity. John Bellany is the other figurative painter and, by contrast, nothing less than his old ebullient expressionist self. The wonder of it is, given his publicly-acknowledged medical history, that he can still paint at all, let alone on such a scale and with such energy and passion. But he was ever an obsessive in the actual act of painting, as furiously prolific even in the depths of his most desperate alcoholism. In his case, both illness and recovery affected the work clearly and directly and, in a sense, perversely. For through the late 1970s and into the 80s, as his condition grew ever more dire, so his painting took on a quality of tragic grandeur, with the paint growing ever richer and more physical in the working, the imagery seeming to sink into the surface as into a quicksand, abstracted and ambiguous, not waving but drowning. It was profound and powerful stuff. If with recovery the mood lightened and the imagery cleared, so also for a while did the surface become thin and the statement overstretched and enfeebled - for Bellany never gave up in his determination to go on working on the grandest scale. Now the work has again come to itself. Gone is the self-regarding and sentimental imagery of the period of the immediate convalescence, and we are back with the full complement of crabs and fish, birds and beasts, the bearded fisher-artists in their boats and bare-breasted priest-women in their stocking-tops that people Bellany's own symbolic sea-shore world. There they all are, these monumental figures, with their hints at Beckmann, Picasso and Modigliani. And there too, as it were to set off their all-pervading air of classical calm, are passages of the old expressionist fury in the working of the surface, judicious and controlled yet full of painting, proper painting. The smallest of the galleries is occupied by Ian Tyson, that most fastidious of minimalists, who is showing paintings and relief constructions based upon a simple rectangular, frame-like motif. That I have no space to say more about them is not to say I do not recommend them. Indeed, they come as the perfect sorbet after the richer dishes downstairs. David Hepher: new paintings. John Bellany: recent paintings. Ian Tyson: recent painting and sculpture. All at Flowers East, 199 &amp; 282 Richmond Road, Hackney, London E8, until December 4.</p>

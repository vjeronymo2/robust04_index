Informed Palestinian sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT:  The meetings were called by Fatah Central Committee Members  'Abbas Zaki and Muhammad Jihad after a statement was issued  attacking them vehemently and crudely criticizing their conduct  and personal lives. That statement was issued several days ago  in Tunis and faxed to PLO offices and departments. It contained  expressions contrary to the general ethics and the spirit of  amity which had governed past differences.    The sources said that the statement was not signed and  concluded with the phrase "this is the first in a series of  scandals to be published later on." They added that one of  'Arafat's advisers deported from the occupied territory might be  behind it. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that during these  meetings, held in extreme secrecy, 'Abbas Zaki and Muhammad  Jihad threatened to take measures unprecedented since the famous  secession of Abu-Musa [Sa'id Musa] and his group in 1983 which  resulted in armed clashes at the time.    Zaki and Jihad blame 'Arafat for what happened, claiming  that  had he not protected some individuals, they would not have dared  commit such folly.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has also learned that these meetings  coincide with internal Fatah problems, especially in the  occupied territory, between the conflicting wings of the  movement, some of which have for some time now been rejecting  President 'Arafat's appointment of certain individuals in the  occupied territory. That prompted a delegation of Fatah members  in the occupied territory to go to Tunis to discuss with the  leadership these issues and excesses threatening an eruption of  armed confrontations.    According to the same information, a large number of Central  Committee members have expressed profound resentment of that  statement and expressed solidarity with 'Abbas Zaki, Muhammad  Jihad, and others including Abu-Ziyad al-Qurbi who were also  included in these accusations. They demanded that those who  were behind that statement should be exposed and so should their  interest in doing such a thing in these critical circumstances  when the Central Committee meetings should be concentrating on  discussion of the "secret" file pertaining to the resumption of  the negotiations on which talks are now being held in Tunis and  Cairo without the knowledge of many members, and on the press  reports about agreement being discussed in Cairo, which would  mean resumption of the negotiations. But there has been no  official statement to that effect.</p>

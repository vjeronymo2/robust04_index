			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Accounts body in disclosure campaign The Accounting Standards Board is considering lobbying the government and the Stock Exchange to try to force greater disclosure of directors' share options. The action follows a legal opinion that has scuppered attempts by the board  -which sets accounting standards - to introduce compulsory additional information on directors' remuneration. The board's urgent-issues taskforce yesterday unveiled a diluted set of voluntary guidelines for companies to highlight the number and value of share options granted to directors. It began considering the topic last year at the suggestion of a number of auditing firms following recommendations for greater disclosure in the Cadbury report on the financial aspects of corporate governance. It was planning to introduce a standard with which all companies would have to comply. This comes as similar tough measures are being debated by the US Financial Accounting Standards Board. However, a recent legal opinion obtained by the board said that the wording of existing legislation does not require additional disclosure unless there is certainty over the value of the options. Members of the taskforce are now debating whether to put pressure on the Department of Trade and Industry to modify the law. It may also suggest to the Stock Exchange modification of listing requirements to boost disclosure. The taskforce suggests disclosure of the prices that apply to directors' options overall and to individual directors, together with market price information at the year-end and at the date of exercise of the options. A separate abstract published yesterday clarifies the treatment of benefits used as incentives to encourage companies to sign leases - known as reverse premiums.</p>

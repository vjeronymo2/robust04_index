			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Survey of Argentina (1): Politics stands in the way of progress - The president's aim to change the constitution has meant legislative developments have been halted, something many fear puts recent impressive economic growth at risk The pace of economic reform in Argentina has slowed. President Carlos Menem, apparently recovered from an operation to clear a serious arterial blockage he suffered last October, is pursuing his ambition to win re-election. For this he needs to change the country's constitution, and while he has set about doing that, the government's legislative agenda has been put largely on hold. Most observers of the political scene agree there is a single motive behind Mr Menem's wish to change the 1853 constitution. Rosendo Fraga, a political commentator, argues: 'The only reason for the reform is Menem's re-election.' Mr Menem was elected in 1989 as the Peronist party candidate for a six-year term but the constitution forbids him standing for a consecutive second term. With the president pursuing apparently personal objectives, events outside Argentina have made the country's economic position more delicate. The rise in US interest rates which started in February has slowed inflows of capital on which the country, because of a low savings rate, is dependent for growth. The current account deficit has continued to widen, raising further doubts about the economy's ability to export at an exchange rate fixed against the dollar in 1991 as part of a successful bid to bring down inflation. Foreign investors are also worried about disturbances in outlying provinces, many of which seem to have missed out on the rapid economic growth of the past three years, in particular last December's riots in Santiago del Estero. They see some risks in the constitutional reform process and in a more combative trade union movement which led to last week's march on Buenos Aires. Despite this, Mr Menem's economic record and that of his economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, remain impressive. Taking power for a six-year term in 1989 amid hyperinflation, the president supported a radical economic reform programme which gathered pace after Mr Cavallo took office in 1991. A huge, corrupt and loss-making state sector was privatised, tariff barriers fell and the economy deregulated. Inflation dropped rapidly: 15 private economists polled by Consensus Economics expect, on average, 1994 inflation of 3.5 per cent. Growth has been rapid too, helped by capital inflows in part spurred by a privatisation programme now drawing to an end. In the three years to 1993, the economy expanded by 25.5 per cent. The average forecast for this year is 4.6 per cent. Although much has been done, some economists think there are risks in delays to legislation. Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini, an economist from the opposition Radical Party, complains that important laws, including those to improve labour market flexibility and reform the social security system, are 'dead or slipping' because of Mr Menem's struggle for re-election. 'Our institutions are not strong enough to enjoy this leisure time in the middle of a very tough adjustment programme . . . It will be society that pays,' he says. Miguel Angel Broda, who heads an eponymous economic consultancy in Buenos Aires, agrees to some extent. 'I don't think that in the next year they can advance the reform.' However, he believes the government should not be criticised, having achieved 85 per cent of what it set out to do: slowing the reforms has increased the risks to Mr Menem's economic programme, but the odds still favour its survival. Employers argue that the absence of labour reform makes them reluctant to take on workers, because it is so costly to fire them. Current social security laws also increase wage costs but - because most trade-union run social welfare funds are bankrupted - provide little in benefits to workers. Mr Zsolt Agardy, president of Fiduc, a group of financial, manufacturing and service companies, says: 'If they passed a labour reform, we would hire more people and be producing more efficiently.' The cost of labour and its lack of flexibility are perceived as two factors inhibiting the country's ability to compete internationally. Others include a dilapidated infrastructure and high interest rates. The reason for high interest rates is in part huge inefficiency in the financial system. According to a report from the management consultancy, McKinsey, Argentine bank workers cost an average annual Dollars 31,000, compared with Dollars 36,000 in the US - but are only 19 per cent as productive as their US counterparts. With companies restructuring - often in preparation for Mercosur, the southern cone common market expected to introduce a common external tariff at the start of next year - productivity is increasing. Mr Cavallo says he is confident: 'In the next three years, I've no doubt that Argentina is going to see a big increase in exports because of an increase in productivity.' Furthermore, the benefits of the federal government's large-scale deregulation - which he admits is yet to spread sufficiently to provincial governments - are only now beginning to be felt. In the meantime, however, social pressures in Argentina are growing. Unemployment is rising - the government argues largely because of substantial growth in the workforce. Growth has bypassed many industries and a large number of provinces. 'There are provinces in which GDP has fallen 25 per cent in three years,' says Mr Broda. These broader concerns are reflected in changes in voter opinions, says pollster Manuel Mora y Araujo. Inflation, once the single dominant concern, has been replaced by a variety of issues, in which unemployment looms large. People are also worried about the quality of public services, such as health and education, and increasingly about their local environment. Another preoccupation is government corruption, which Mr Menem is widely viewed as tolerating among those close to him. At the same time, there has been a loss in confidence in the two main political parties - which was reinforced when Mr Menem and Raul Alfonsin, the former president and leader of the Radical Party, cooked up an agreement in December over the constitutional revision. These, says Mr Mora y Araujo, are the reasons why both Peronist and Radical parties fared relatively badly in the April elections for the assembly now debating the constitutional changes. By contrast, the Frente Grande, a loose coalition of left-wing parties, dissident Peronists and environmental groups led by a charismatic congressman Carlos Alvarez, did unexpectedly well, particularly in Buenos Aires. While the April elections undoubtedly weakened Mr Menem's position, some observers reckon voters were merely registering a protest at aspects of the Menem government, but would support Mr Menem in a presidential election. The fact is there appear to be few serious challengers to Mr Menem on the horizon. His popularity, while it has declined from its peak, still exceeds by several times that of any other rival, though if opposition did coalesce around one candidate the gap would be substantially narrowed. In the presidential elections which he says will be held between April and June next year, Mr Menem is still odds-on for a second presidential term. On the face of it, this offers continuity. Mr Menem's critics charge, however, that the costs of his pursuit of re-election show his readiness to put personal objectives before national interest. Either way, his country faces many fundamental challenges before the end of the century. It must further improve its international competitiveness; restructure a bureaucracy that is still mostly inefficient and corrupt; improve the capacity of the state to deliver public goods - in particular education and justice - and address the growing marginalisation of a majority of provinces. It is not clear that a vision on how to resolve these issues exists in Mr Menem's mind or within the government - with the exception of a few people mainly in the economy ministry. Argentina's continued economic recovery remains, therefore, unhealthily dependent on a few individuals.</p>

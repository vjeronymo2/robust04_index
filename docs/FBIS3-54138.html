According defense sources assessments, the opponents of the  peace agreement, especially members of Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement], will continue to attempt to obstruct the political  process. The security sources noted that there had been an  improvement in Israel's strategic situation and that the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] enjoyed clear superiority over its main  foe, Syria. Damascus, nevertheless, had not abandoned the  military option, and even if the peace process continued to  progress at the present rate this could not guarantee that the  Arab armies would either cut back in size or halt their military  buildup.    As for Israel's relations with the United States, the  sources  explained that in future, domestic economic problems may have a  detrimental effect on Washington's readiness to rapidly meet  Israel's needs.</p>

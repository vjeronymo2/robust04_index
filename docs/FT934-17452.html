			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Output down in Japan for 23rd month JAPAN'S industrial production fell an annualised 2 per cent in August, declining for the 23rd month in a row, the longest on record. The decline was the smallest year-on-year drop in industrial output in any month since March, but not as severe as the market had expected, Yet the recovery outlook is clouded by a 0.7 per cent month-on-month rise in inventories in August, the fourth consecutive monthly increase, said the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. This indicates that production is still ahead of weak demand, despite a series of workforce reductions and curbs on output from Japan's largest companies recently. Stocks of unsold air conditioners, due to an unusually cool summer, were a factor in the inventory rise, said Miti. 'The economy is still crawling along the bottom and it is too early to say whether it will dip again or not,' said a Miti official. Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, added: 'There can be no autonomous recovery while inventory levels remain so bloated.' Month-on-month, industrial production fell 0.7 per cent in August and is set to creep back by 0.7 per cent in September, only to subside again by 3.5 per cent in the following month, said Miti. The previous record for a fall in industrial output was a 20-month run of declines in the wake of the 1973-74 oil shock. Not every sector is in hibernation, as shown by a 10.9 per cent year-on-year rise in housing starts for August, reported by the Construction Ministry yesterday. That is the 15th monthly rise running, a reflection of the fall in interest rates and the impact of an increase in low-cost government housing loans. Applications for state-funded mortgages doubled from April to early August. The number of houses for sale rose 25 per cent in August after a 23.1 per cent rise in July. However, the growth in housebuilding was not enough to lift the construction industry from its recession in August. Japan's top 50 contractors reported a 25 per cent decline in August orders, the seventh month running in which they have seen order books shrink. A spate of scandals, resulting in the arrest of executives from five leading construction companies over the past two weeks, has dampened activity.</p>

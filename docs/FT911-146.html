			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: Oslo joins small band of outperformers A DECLINE in the US, which was at the mercy of the bond market during the quarterly refunding, left the world's stock markets 0.6 per cent lower in local currency terms last week, according to the FT-Actuaries World Indices. Most markets, however, were little changed. The main exceptions were the now familiar outperformers of Mexico and New Zealand, joined last week by Norway. The Norwegian market, which has lagged behind most European bourses this year, jumped 8.5 per cent in local currency terms. Daily turnover grew from a level of NKr302m at the start of the week to NKr820m on Friday. Mr Per Jacobsen of Baring Securities says the triggers for this renewed interest included rising optimism about the economy and company results, falling interest rates, the market's relative cheapness, and decreasing pessimism over the tax reforms. Good first-quarter figures in early May, particularly from Saga Petroleum and Hafslund Nycomed, the pharmaceutical group, have banished investors' earlier doubts. Baring now expects weighted earnings growth of 11 per cent this year, after a fall of 28 per cent in 1990. The proposed tax reforms have also become less of a concern. 'People have had time to consider the reforms and are less alarmed by them, and there are indications that they are being watered down,' says Mr Jacobsen. He even believes the proposed tax changes could have some positive effects. From 1992, capital gains on shares held for more than three years will no longer be tax free. However, the cost price of these shares will be set by taking the average share price between November 1 and December 31 this year, which means that shareholders will want to see high prices during that period, and so reduce their capital gains and the tax payable. 'If the rules come through in their present form, a year-end rally seems likely,' he predicts.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     % change  % change           % change in local currency **           sterling **   in US                                                              Dollars **             1 Week   4 Weeks     1 Year   Start of   Start of  Start of                                               1991       1991      1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria     -2.28      -1.06     -18.74     +16.90     +13.31     +0.93 Belgium      0.00      -1.35      -5.76     +18.08     +15.26     +2.66 Denmark     +0.68      -0.24      +0.40     +16.65     +14.39     +1.89 Finland     +1.84      -4.94     -11.17     +23.81     +24.64    +11.01 France      +0.94      +1.33     -13.01     +21.00     +18.35     +5.41 Germany     -0.93      +1.91     -14.59     +13.98     +10.89     -1.24 Ireland     -1.76      -1.16      -7.49     +21.85     +19.40     +6.36 Italy       -1.69      -3.64     -21.09     +11.25     +10.29     -1.76 Netherlands +0.28      +3.02      +7.48     +21.96     +18.72     +5.75 Norway      +8.51      +8.37      -9.27     +15.50     +13.26     +0.88 Spain       +2.62      +1.80      +2.65     +27.17     +27.56    +13.61 Sweden      -0.14      -4.11      -8.98     +21.86     +24.48    +10.87 Switzerland -0.19      -1.44      -3.02     +19.60     +17.43     +4.60 Sweden      -0.14      -4.11      -8.98     +21.86     +24.48    +10.87 Switzerland -0.19      -1.44      -3.02     +19.60     +17.43     +4.60 UK          +0.01      -0.32     +15.90     +17.98     +17.98     +5.09 EUROPE      +0.02      +0.18      -0.15     +18.05     +16.76     +3.99 Australia   +2.14      +7.65      +8.48     +22.67     +39.83    +24.55 Hong Kong   +0.45      +0.70     +24.22     +26.25     +41.87    +26.36 Japan       -0.50      -0.47     -13.58     +14.41     +25.59    +11.85 Malaysia    -0.48      -0.48      +8.26     +10.97     +21.97     +8.63 New Zealand +4.72     +13.71     -13.91     +25.02     +40.85    +25.41 Singapore   -0.35      +4.03      -1.37     +28.93     +42.18    +26.64 Canada      -0.14      -0.06      +0.47      +5.42     +19.23     +6.20 USA         -1.34      -1.32      +9.50     +14.15     +28.15    +14.15 Mexico      +7.60     +13.89    +134.96     +68.36     +86.56    +66.16 South Africa      -1.30      +0.13     -11.26      +8.57     +27.08    +13.19 WORLD INDEX             -0.60      -0.44      -1.42     +15.37     +24.52    +10.91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on May 10th 1991.

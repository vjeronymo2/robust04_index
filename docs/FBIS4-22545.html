			<p>Government   <F P=102>   944K0960A Lvov ZA VILNU UKRAYINU in Ukrainian 18 Mar 94 p 2 </F> <F P=103> 944K0960A </F> <F P=104>  Lvov ZA VILNU UKRAYINU </F> <F P=105>  Ukrainian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Interview by Vasyl Tarchynets with Viktor Pynzenyk; date </F> and place not given: "Myths and Reality"]    [Text]    [Tarchynets] Mr. Pynzenyk, everyone knows that you are  concerned for the economy, but some of the many people with whom  I have spoken, including military financial officials, are  nonetheless completely convinced that you are more a theoretical  economist than a practical one...    [Pynzenyk] Speaking frankly, these sorts of attacks have  always been made against me in Parliament. But no matter how  strange it is, the directors who once did not understand and did  not have any concept, support me today, for example in the  question of free conversion. At first, some leaders decided in  this way to remove hard currency. Life showed that it did not.  Then it began to be removed, when their director-colleagues in  the government introduced a fixed rate, against which I, a  "theoretical economist," spoke.    Perhaps it will again seem to some that I theorize too much.  Today when it is said to me that the army is on hunger rations,  I can easily show that it is not a problem of the army but a  problem of the budget policy in general. If, let us say, the  budget is made up of income from production, then first of all  it has to turn to where there is no production. There is also no  formation of income. Thus, it has to go to science, education,  culture, art, public health, and defense, and to support the  poor. But if we give this money from the budget back to  production, and then what is left to the army, we will always be  in a pitiable situation. So it turns out that it is not only a  problem of the army but of the state's budget policy in general.  There is significantly less deducted for the army in the budget  for this year, than some budget loans to certain commercial and  government structures, which do not have to take part in the  distribution of the budget.    [Tarchynets] It would be desirable to know why this is  happening.    [Pynzenyk] I think this is a misunderstanding. The basic  incompetence of people, who "grew up" in the old system, when  the government took care of everything. Production above all.  When it took everything and did everything. And it wishes to  continue doing this for the future. I do not say that it is  necessary to give the army as much as it wants. But there must  not be a situation in which officers and soldiers are not paid  their wages for December and January, and in which our army, in  a fundamental way, cannot realize its military preparedness. We  are not so poor that these structures, this system, cannot be  financed. It is enough, let us say, to remove from the budget  just one section which is not needed there--and we will have  funds for the army and for other budget areas.    [Tarchynets] It is understood that the army does not live  only on wages. Its vital activity and combat readiness is a  complex matter. So plans for military preparedness should also  be well supported. Our Armed Forces have to have modern arms.    [Pynzenyk] Today, we will not reach the level at which we  once had a military-industrial complex. But 40 percent of the  economy of Ukraine was connected with the military-industrial  complex! Now certain defense enterprises are being converted.  But it is not entirely a good thing, when, for example, a plant  which made powerful rockets begins to produce saucepans...    [Tarchynets] Recently, an effective phrase by Shaposhnikov,  the former Minister of Defense of the former Soviet Union,  spread in the Russian press, that soon Ukraine's aviation will  become a great winged museum on the ground...    [Pynzenyk] In fact, we proposed some ways to resolve this  problem. For example, today we have many aircraft that are  "grounded." We do not even need them. There were buyers for  them. It was necessary to sell them and buy some other arms,  which we lack for the military preparedness of our army.  Everyone trades in arms. Ordinarily, the trade is made following  international norms.    There are several structures where it is necessary not to  begrudge pennies. It is necessary not to begrudge paying customs  officials, energy structures, and tax inspectorates, because  they are the support for normal economic restructuring. If we  begrudge paying a customs official, he will look for illegal  earnings or, more precisely, bribes. Whoever begrudges paying  his own army is nourishing a foreign army.    [Tarchynets] I agree with you. And now I am expressing,  perhaps, the wishes of the wide circle of future voters. All are  interested in learning about the basic directions of your  economic program. What do you, as an experienced professional  and parliamentarian, wish to do, and are able to do, to improve  the life of the people?    [Pynzenyk] Our state can become unique. I believe that  Ukraine could begin its rebirth from the point that people could  begin to live better. This would be different from the other  states which came out of the crisis. For example, Poland began  reforms right away, and things got worse. For us, things got  worse without reforms. Thus, the first serious steps could  provide the first improvements. These steps require a month or  two. I will explain how this can be achieved.    Today in Ukraine, a very major shadow redistribution of  incomes is taking place. The incomes of the majority remain in  the hands of a very small group of people. All this is not the  result of reforms, but the reverse--of blocking them, basically  thanks to the insane putting of huge additional sums of money  into circulation.    Let us look at this real life example. Let us say that I  wish  to earn something today. This is very easy and, unfortunately,  legal. I buy televisions for one billion, using a loan. Over a  year, prices rise 60 times. In a year, I sell them for 60  billion. People buy them for 60 billion. And I return to the  loaning agency one billion plus six billion in interest. The  difference, 53 billion, goes into the pockets of individuals.    It is very easy to stop this. One decision is made: the bank  of Ukraine stops issuing money. Cash becomes cheaper only as a  result of inflation. And when speculative processes in the  intermediary area disappear, people will stop saying that it is,  in general, necessary. There will not be insane profits. The  problem of the depreciation of people's savings will also  disappear. So that when I put cash in the bank, I will have to  pay for this no less than what results from inflation. And I  will not think about where to hide money since it will be more  expensive tomorrow. I know that if I deposit it, in a month I  will be able to buy more, not less. And the main thing is that  the terrible shadow redistributions of incomes will stop.    Another direction: if today the commercial sector is quickly  transferred to private property, our people will only win. Why?  I will explain. An item is bought, it stays in stock. And prices  grow constantly. A question arises: who gets the differences in  the prices (between what it was acquired for, and the current  ones)? If this were my store, I would sell for the normal price.  But the store is not mine, and I bought some liquor a year ago  somewhere for 200 coupons, and today it costs 60,000, then who  gets the difference? I get it! How? Someone comes in and offers  me a bribe: sell it, he says, for the price at which you bought  it. And on paper it really cost me 200 coupons... The one who  gave me the bribe gets the second difference. Here the remedies  are the same: speedy privatization.    What would I do for privatization? I would put vouchers into  people's hands. Today, a voucher is valued at approximately 25  million karbovantsy. Average families, which are made up of four  to five people, could get 100 to 150 million karbovantsy. One  will want to buy a share in a store, a second, a share in a  plant, a third, to open his own business, a fourth to obtain  land or an apartment. Whoever needs the money can sell the  vouchers. This is not small change, and now it is necessary to  begin a mass scale, almost a powerful privatization.    I would also change in a major way the sphere of  export-import policy. When someone says that it is necessary to  save the state from being looted, then as a rule, it concerns  the defense of official, even personal interests, but not state  ones. The state is wealthy when it sells something. No one gives  us oil, or gas, or wood. The problem is not one of where to buy:  in Russia or in America... It is necessary to earn. But for this  it is necessary to "produce" something to export. And of course,  at the present rate for the karbovanets, which is artificially  set by the national bank, export becomes unprofitable. A fixed  rate could be introduced, but a so called over devaluated one.  For example, 50,000 karbovantsy to the dollar. I would stop the  printing of new money. We would have a new situation, which we  still have never had. First, export would become very  profitable. Second, we would have a stable rate, with which we  could exchange, sell, or buy dollars or Russian rubles. There is  one more point: then people would begin to flee from dollars.  Why flee? If I save 100 dollars today, I will earn 10 percent  annually. In a year, I will have 110 dollars. But if I sell 100  dollars and save the coupons, then I will earn 10 percent per  month for the coupons. In a year I will buy more dollars than  under the first variant. We have over 10 billion "greenbacks" in  hand. They can become an internal source for investment in the  Ukrainian economy.    [Tarchynets] We have, it seems, come to an interesting  problem. Please tell us whether the programs or proposals which  you have made in the government and Parliament have found  support, and whether you yourself agree with what was proposed  to you and us? And finally, what led to your own decision to  quit?    [Pynzenyk] The paradox lies in the fact that we often have  made good decisions, but forgotten them the next day. The  classic example is our budget. It has to be by law. And no one  dares to go against it. But on the next day, someone somehow  refines it, in fact, not Parliament. Who takes a delicate morsel  for himself, first of all? The "bison" who have access to  decision making on the budget. And you, and the army, are left  out. For example, something is not indexed for you. So if we  confirm the budget, then a sum (and no more) can go into the  economy. Since otherwise the budget areas are left without funds.    The problem of reforms is not that we do not know what to  do.  The real problem is that we do not have a harsh political will.  Democracy is good when there is knowledge. And just the reverse,  when there is no knowledge, there cannot be talk about  democracy. Democracy also is suitable only for making decisions.  After this, there comes the dictatorship of performance and  harsh control over the performances. I think that a person who  does not perform a task has not justified society's faith, has  played a trick on it, and must be immediately forced from his  position.    Why did I leave the government? Of course, I could have done  this much earlier. I knew that working in it would not give me  authority. But I thought: as long as I can force through even  one good decision, or hinder even one bad one, I do not have the  right to leave the governmnet. It was painful to be stopped on  the street by people upset by prices. Today, true, the situation  is a little different. A great many people in Kiev that I do not  know greet me...    This is one of the decisions, concerning prices for  agricultural production, taken behind my back. My signature is  not on this document. And it, the decision, very much got  inflation going, and harmed people, especially the poorest ones.  But the main thing is that it did not help the countryside. Just  the opposite; it pushed it again to its knees. The people who  made this decision did not understand anything. This was one of  the reasons I quit.    A second one. Let us say that few people know, that for  three  months I fought in the government against the currency rate  established at that time. I thought that while I was a member of  the "team," I did not have the right to take this outside the  cabinet; I have to fight for changes. And when I did not manage  to stop or change the decision, I thought that from then on, I  did not have the right to remain in the government. And in fact,  if you now ask any director of an enterprise--a state one, a  private one, or ask a banker: what did the most harm to the  Ukrainian economy? They will tell you this very decision--the  introduction of the fixed rate. When the previous decision was  in effect, which we had agreed on in the government, from April  to September of last year, the flow of dollars, marks, and  Russian rubles into Ukraine increased ten times. The collapse  came after the September decision, after the introduction of the  fixed rate for Ukrainain currency.    [Tarchynets] And what happened with the Ukrainian voucher,  about which so much was said, but we still do not have it?    [Pynzenyk] I just spoke about this. We do not have a voucher  as such, we have an open account. But this is very awkward,  since people do not know about this account. Only 600,000 people  have used it to this point. It is necessary to put vouchers into  people's hands.    I want to talk about one more thing. We are now working on  the privatization of an auto plant in Zaporizhzhya. Some of the  stock will be sold for these Ukrainian vouchers, and it will be  possible to acquire them. It is only necessary to watch for the  announcements in the press. A Canadian firm has agreed to  prepare the vouchers themselves, for 800,000 dollars. I think  that this is not such a large sum when we are needlessly wasting  millions of dollars. It is necessary to do this more quickly,  and let people decide the fate of their own certificates.    [Tarchynets] We were promised long ago that the hryvnya  would  be introduced. The rumor was spread that therefore money will  not be given...    [Pynzenyk] This is not a method of struggle but a method of  making people bitter. Steps cannot be taken which cause the  people's distrust. So it goes! Wages are figured for people, but  they are in general not paid. I think that such things are  impermissible; this is not connected with putting extra money  into circulation; you just decrease the quantity of non-cash  money and issue coupons.    I would not reform money today, since we have a national  currency. And when I look at the programs of certain deputies,  this is the impression: either I do not understand anything, or  they, perhaps, do not understand a thing. We have our own  national unit of money. And if I had at some point to work with  the "team," I would want to show the many "economists,"  especially in Kiev, that the coupon will be "firm" and will  "stand..." And then we will simply seize it. Since it is awkward  to use a whole heap of paper. Then, let us say, instead of  10,000 coupons we will give people one hryvnya. But we will give  them to everyone. And I would continue the open currency reform,  and would not hide it. We have no reasons to confiscate money.  Some have the illusion that it will be confiscated from rich  people. This is more than an illusion, because none of the rich  have money in coupons. They have it in property or in dollars.  But if one wishes to rob invalids, and poor people, the question  comes up: what are we robbing them for?! We have 13 trillion  karbovantsy in the hands of the population. If this is divided  among 52 million people, this would just be 240,000 karbovantsy  each.    The problem is not in the name of the money. The policy  concerning it must be different. I have one very unusual coupon.  On it is written "dollar..." But it did not become stronger  because of this. It will become stronger when money is in a very  large deficit. And this will happen when, first of all, the  printers are stopped...    [Tarchynets] I do not know what the truth is in this, but I  have somehow been told, that in the time of huge inflation for  our neighbors (in Poland) wages were paid either daily, or  weekly... And they somehow knew what to do, and were saved.    [Pynzenyk] It is not thanks to this that they knew what to  do. Our people also are adapting themselves. I know some who are  getting rather small wages, but at the beginning of every month  buy five dollars for themselves, for example. So in dollars the  money does not depreciate. But this is dangerous, abnormal,  since when there are inflationary expectations, people flee from  money. It is necessary for people not to adapt themselves to  conditions of inflation; it is necessary to fight with  inflation. Our inflation is unique. I will try to explain. Some  think, that in our case it is linked with a lack of goods...  Nothing of the kind! Our production (outside of consumer  goods)has fallen by 25 percent over two years. This means that  for this reason prices could increase by 40 percent, but they  have reason over a year by six thousand times. What is the  reason for this? The printers have not stopped. An insane amount  of money is in circulation. More precisely, this basically  concerns not ready money, but non-cash emission. But if there  are no more goods, this additional money will only overflow into  prices. The question could come up: "You say it is good... Why  did you not do this?"    And remember how many decisions have been made in session  about the emission of trillions? In fact, the national bank,  without a decision by the government, in March made an emission  of almost a trillion, which then undermined the stabilization of  prices which had begun. We already had a stable rate, and in  relation to the ruble that rate of the coupon even increased.  Inflation itself is one of the reasons for the flight of  currency out of the country.    Imagine a situation: I am exporting, and dollars remain in  the West. But I cannot begin production. I can "pressure,"  especially, let us say, if I am still a deputy: let us have an  emission. Needs for raw supplies and resources cover the  reckoning of credit for me... This must not be. If there are no  emissions, then either I will return the dollars here, or a  plant goes bankrupt, and then an investigation begins. Documents  are checked, and it appears that production was sabotaged, and  the dollars are not returned. Articles of the Criminal Codex  might be applied. In fact, criminal responsibility has been  introduced for concealing currency outside the country (two to  five years in prison).</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEEP HEALTH INSURANCE INCREASES FOR INDIVIDUAL POLICYHOLDERS  </P> <P> Blue Cross premiums "raised 25%." That's a joke. My premium increased to $531  per quarter from $294, which is an increase of 80%. Any my benefits decreased.  I can either pay it and complain or drop it and be uninsured. Not much of a  choice. In the 4 1/2 years since I have had this insurance, my premium has  increased almost 300% from $186.03 to $531 per quarter. And get this -- I have  never used it nor turned in a claim.  </P> <P> Needless to say I am looking into other sources of medical insurance, as this  is ridiculous. How many others "suffered" an 80% increase in their premium?  Where does Blue Cross get this 25% increase? Is there any type of a regulatory  agency that oversees its operations and could look into this?  </P> <P> LOIS M. THOMPSON  </P> <P> Oxnard  </P></p>

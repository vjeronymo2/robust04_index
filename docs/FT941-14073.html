			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Comex board gives approval for merger with Nymex The Board of Governors of New York's metals exchange, the Comex, gave the nod to a merger with its neighbour the New York Mercantile Exchange at a meeting Wednesday night. Comex board approval is expected to set off an active lobbying effort to persuade members of both exchanges to vote for the merger. Nymex and Comex members will receive a proxy statement detailing the merger proposal within four or five weeks, with a vote to be scheduled shortly afterward. A two-thirds majority of the Comex members voting and a majority of Nymex members voting is required to approve the merger.</p>

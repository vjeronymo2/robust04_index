			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HAWAIIAN CHALLENGE FOR AMERICA'S CUP PLANNED  </P> <P> A world-class yachtsman plans to challenge for the America's Cup under the  banner of the Waikiki Yacht Club, boosting hopes that Hawaii may one day play  host to the prestigious race.  </P> <P> Peter Isler, who sailed with Dennis Conner in the last two America's Cup  campaigns, and Waikiki Yacht Club Commodore Rick Jaep made the announcement at  a news conference Monday.  </P> <P> If a New York appeals court upholds a lower court decision that gave the cup  away to a New Zealand club, American syndicates will have the right to  challenge in 1992, Isler and Jaep said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> San Diego Would Host  </P> <P> If the ruling is voided, the San Diego Yacht Club will host the defense and  Isler's agreement with Waikiki Yacht Club will be canceled, they said.  </P> <P> Gov. John Waihee, who wants Hawaii to become a sailing mecca, said the  agreement will be a boost for the islands.  </P> <P> Isler, 34, served as navigator aboard Stars &amp; Stripes when Conner won the  America's Cup back from the Australians in 1987. He was also navigator aboard  the high-tech Stars &amp; Stripes catamaran when it defended the cup against a  New Zealand yacht last year.  </P> <P> He is the top-ranked match racing skipper in the United States, a former winner  of the Hawaii Transpac race and coach of the 1984 U.S. Olympic sailing team.  </P> <P> Isler was most recently vice president of Dennis Conner Sports Inc. but broke  ties with Conner to pursue the cup on his own.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'U.S. Falling Behind'  </P> <P> "I saw teams from foreign nations moving forward and the U.S. falling behind  over uncertainty" about the outcome of the court case, Isler said. "Waiting for  a court decision would put us way behind the foreign teams."  </P> <P> Isler, who was born in Honolulu and lives in San Diego, said he decided to sail  for the Waikiki Yacht Club because Hawaii has shown a significant interest in  yacht racing by its 1987 attempt to lure the America's Cup race to island  waters.  </P> <P> State officials have said the races could pump $1 billion into Hawaii's  economy.  </P></p>

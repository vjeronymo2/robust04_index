			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Johnson Group dividend frozen JOHNSON Group Cleaners, one of the world's largest dry cleaning companies, is freezing its dividend for the second consecutive year as it reported an 8 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 16m for the 12 months to December 28. The decline in profits was entirely due to a Pounds 1.6m fall in the property surplus. Stripping out property gains, profits rose slightly from Pounds 15.6m to Pounds 15.8m. Mr Terry Greer, chairman, warned that the outlook for this year was not encouraging. '1992 is most unlikely to show a big movement upwards,' he said. 'Another cautious year is what we are looking for.' The group proposed a final dividend of 18.7p, for a total of 25.7p. Mr Greer said that due to the company's 'extremely cautious attitude to profits in 1992, we would be unlikely to show an increase in the dividend unless something big happened'. The group's two divisions, dry cleaning and textile rental, enjoyed mixed fortunes on both side of the Atlantic. Dry cleaning in the UK, where Johnson commands more than 20 per cent of the market, had maintained sales in a difficult environment, while textile rental had improved both turnover and margins. However, growth in textile rental had slowed significantly by the year end. In the US, losses at the dry cleaning franchise division had been cut from Dollars 1m to Dollars 250,000 through reduced overheads. Mr Greer said he expected the losses to remain at that level for 1992. 'We hope to see real movement after 1992,' he said. Both dry cleaning and textile rental had remained static in the US. Altogether, group turnover rose from Pounds 149.4m to Pounds 154.5m. Fully-diluted earnings per share fell from 55.41p to 49.02p. Stripping out the property surplus, however, earnings increased from 46.98p to 48.7p. During the year, Johnson strengthened the balance sheet through cutting capital expenditure by 50 per cent to Pounds 7m and controlling costs, said Mr Greer. Gearing had been reduced from 54 per cent to 39 per cent. There was a Pounds 1.7m extraordinary charge for the demolition of an old factory at Bootle, Merseyside. Mr Greer said Johnson eventually intended to expand the remaining workwear factory on the site. The acquisition programme, put on hold last year when the recession began to bite, would be further delayed, the chairman said.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Japanese fear credit squeeze The decline in Japanese corporate profits has started to ease but money supply continues to be weak, fuelling fears of a squeeze on credit. The Bank of Japan announced that the country's benchmark money supply - M2 plus certificates of deposit - grew 1.7 per cent in May from the same month last year, a slowdown on the 2.2 per cent rise shown in April. The broad measure of liquidity, including postal savings, state debt and investment trusts, rose 3.2 per cent, against 3.3 per cent in April. This is still well below the 5 per cent annual growth which economic analysts believe is needed to fund a recovery, and is likely to add to central bank concerns over credit creation. Separately, a quarterly survey of nearly 20,000 companies by the Finance Ministry showed a combined 5.8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits in the three months to March, from the same period in the previous year. That was the 15th quarter of profits decline, but better than the falls of 6.2 per cent of the previous three months and 21.6 per cent in the period before that. Corporate sales rose by 0.8 per cent in the first three months  -led by service industries - breaking a decline of seven consecutive quarters. The mood in Japanese boardrooms, however, remains cautious: Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, the new chairman of the Keidanren, warned in his first public speech this week that he did not have much confidence in the economic outlook.</p>

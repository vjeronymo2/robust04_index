			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Accounts transfer Leeds Building Society is to transfer Pounds 450m belonging to 1m savers in 14 obsolete accounts into new accounts paying mostly higher interest, Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes. The move, to begin in February, follows a similar announcement by National &amp; Provincial on Tuesday. The societies, which called off a planned merger in October, said they had agreed in merger discussions to abolish their obsolete accounts. Leeds said 20 per cent of its savers were in obsolete accounts, representing 4 per cent of the society's savings deposits. A campaign launched in 1990 to move the savers into new accounts succeeded in only halving their numbers. Building societies, Page 12</p>

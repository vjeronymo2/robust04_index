			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Unions stand firm in countdown to confrontation: A look at the mood in Nigeria as military leaders face up to a test of strength Nigeria yesterday began the countdown to a threatened confrontation, as the country's military rulers weighed their response to trade union demands to release detained opposition leader Moshood Abiola or face a general strike from tomorrow. While many feared increased violence, rumours spread last night that the military may release Mr Abiola to defuse the strike threat. The leaders of the country's armed forces held a meeting in Abuja, the capital, as the test of strength with strikers loomed. A strike by oil workers has already seen Nigeria's production of oil cut by a fifth, adding to the strains of the struggling economy. The streets of central Lagos, Nigeria's main city, normally jammed with traffic, were almost empty yesterday except for thousands of workers beginning a long walk home. Buses were off the road, banks were closing, traders locked up their stalls early. Motorists gave up the search for scarce petrol and abandoned their cars in the long queues outside filling stations to avoid the clashes between street gangs and armed police which have broken out in Lagos Island in the last week. 'It is difficult to tell who are real strikers and real demonstrators because these protests are often taken over by area boys (the Lagos term for the young thugs who steal and extort from the public),' says a businessman in Lagos. The pro-democracy groups and trade unions are using threats to back up their appeals for the private sector not to break the strike. Commercial banks that employ non-union staff are taking seriously last week's anonymous letters threatening reprisals against strike breakers. Since June when General Sani Abacha's regime arrested Mr Abiola for claiming the presidency a year after his unofficial victory in an election annulled by the military, the government has tried everything except compromise, and their support in the armed forces and among sympathetic trade union leaders is fast declining. There is growing concern in Nigeria and abroad that the power tussle, which has ethnic undertones, could degenerate into civil war like the one over Biafra in the late 1960s. More than 1m Nigerians died in that conflict. The head of Nigeria's Anglican Church, Archbishop Abiodun Adetiloye, urged Nigerians to stand firm. 'Some suffering now will usher in a brighter tomorrow and will help to end tyranny, oligarchy, apartheid, dictatorship and illegality,' a statement from the church quoted the archbishop, a southerner, as saying. 'Nigeria belongs to all Nigerians irrespective of place of birth or religious belief,' he added. The generals in Abuja face a choice between dialogue and getting tough. The doves are represented by the second in command, Lt Gen Oladipo Diya, and the hawks' line has been kept in the ascendant by the most influential civilian, secretary to the government Mr Aminu Saleh. Support for the unions and democracy campaigners is not universal in Nigeria. The four-week oil workers' strike has not been observed by union members in the north, where Kaduna oil refinery is operating normally. The east of Nigeria has seen much less disruption than the south-west. But civil unrest and strikes in the south brought down Gen Ibrahim Babangida, the last military head of state, last August and enabled Gen Abacha to ease out the short-lived civilian interim government in November. The present regime looks vulnerable but the chorus of opposition to military rule in Nigeria and abroad may, some western diplomats argue, have reduced the chances of another military coup, for no would-be successor to Gen Abacha can be in any doubt that only a handover to civilians will satisfy domestic expectations or international demands. Others are less sanguine, for some officers may see Gen Abacha as part of the problem unless he rapidly comes up with a political solution. The views of the US, the dominant international influence on Nigeria, were expressed by Rev Jesse Jackson after his visit there last week: military rule is unacceptable to Nigeria's friends and trading partners abroad and isolation or punitive measures will increase until there is civilian government. Whether this threat can be put into practice is another matter. Nigeria gets little aid, export credit facilities are minimal and it is not self-evident that an oil embargo - even assuming UN approval - would bring the desired result. For the people in the Yoruba dominated south-west, civilian rule means their kinsman, Mr Abiola, as president, possibly heading a coalition to heal the regional divisions widened by the political crisis. The National Democratic Coalition, which pushed Mr Abiola into the forefront earlier this year, wants such a government to call a national conference which would try to re-distribute power and wealth and end the string of military coups since independence in 1960. The more pressure builds up the harder the government seems to find it to compromise. 'They seem inflexible. Everyone knows that releasing Abiola is the answer,' says a military expert in Lagos. 'But nearly 30 years in power have made the military arrogant. They will not bend to the will of civilians.' If the government chooses the hard line, a state of emergency, curfews and troops on the streets could soon be in place and the dark warnings of bloodshed by Mr Jackson could be realised. The deciding factor may be the message from the commanding officers about the loyalty of the army if called upon to fight civilians. Delegates at the constitutional conference, who have shown no sympathy for Mr Abiola's cause, have decided to mediate, urging Gen Abacha to release Mr Abiola. 'A little clemency could defuse the tension,' says one delegate. Yet for millions in Lagos and the south-west there already seems a widening divide between them and the military regime associated with the Hausa-Fulani north. Few in Lagos believe that the soldiers in Abuja can bridge that increasingly dangerous divide.</p>

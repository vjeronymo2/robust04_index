			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Digital plans its recovery around PC market - Success in personal computers is critical to the US group Hopes of recovery at Digital Equipment, the troubled US computer maker, were boosted recently by indications that the company is reversing its previously disastrous performance in the key personal computer (PC) sector. Mr Enrico Pesatori, general manager of Digital Equipment's PC business unit, said that if the improvement were maintained, Digital could become one of the world's leading PC suppliers within two years. It sold some 500,000 units in 1993, up from 200,000 the year before, with revenues of Dollars 1bn. At that level, he said, the unit was not profitable. 'We lost quite a bit of money.' For 1994, however, he expects to sell more than 1m units, generating revenues of Dollars 2bn, and trading profitably. To become one of the world's top seven PC vendors, however, it will have to sell between 2.5m and 3m PCs a year, worth Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn. Success in PCs is critical to Digital, struggling back from two years of losses. It failed to appreciate the importance of the PC revolution in the 1980s, and lost ground to competitors. The PC is a key factor in networked or client-server computing, where Digital is betting its future; Compaq, for example, recorded PC revenues of Dollars 7.2bn last year. Mr Pesatori sees no hope of overtaking the industry leaders - IBM, Compaq and Apple - but plans to be among the best of the second-tier companies, such as Hewlett Packard, Dell and Packard Bell of the US, and NEC and Toshiba of Japan. Mr Pesatori was brought in to head Digital's worldwide PC operations a year ago. An industry veteran, he had 21 years with Olivetti of Italy before moving to Groupe Bull of France to revitalise its ailing Zenith PC arm. At Digital his strategy has three objectives. First, to build from scratch a PC organisation. In this he was helped to some extent by Digital's lack of interest in PCs. He started with 40 people and now has 800 worldwide; new links with distributors and value-added resellers had to be forged, and new managers hired. Mr Pesatori scoured the industry for talent, employing 'slightly over-qualified people'. Mr Bernard Auer, formerly with Compaq, was hired to run the European territory. Other top names included Harry Copperman from JWP Businessland, Carl Gustin from Apple, Winnie Briney from IBM and Ray Wedock from Epson. Second, the product line had to be rationalised. Digital had been selling Olivetti PCs in Europe and Intel machines in the US; now, it is selling its own range of computers and network servers. Only about 20 per cent of machines sold in 1993 were not of Digital's design and manufacture. It intends to move into the SoHo (small office/home office) market. 'How and when we enter this market is something we are discussing now,' Mr Pesatori says. The link with Olivetti will not be abandoned, but converted to a design partnership whereby the two companies will develop computers with Digital's 'look and feel'. The third part of the strategy is to build a company with the cost structure of a PC maker rather than a mainframe manufacturer. Digital as a whole spends more than 25 per cent of revenues on overhead costs, compared with a typical PC company's spend of only 13 per cent; Compaq, for example, spends 12 per cent of revenues on overheads. Bringing down overheads involves pushing up product volumes (theoretically, if volumes double, overhead costs fall by four points). One test of Digital's PC ambitions is the proportion of personal computers it can sell to customers who do not already use Digital equipment. In 1993, 20 per cent of its total PC sales went to new customers, but Mr Pesatori is confident the proportion will show a significant rise this year.</p>

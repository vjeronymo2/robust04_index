			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA has reviewed existing approvals of alternative methods of compliance for AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;02 and finds that these approvals would not necessarily be acceptable for this AD, since the actions required by the existing AD do not adequately address the unsafe condition. However, if an operator believes its existing approval also should be considered acceptable for this AD, that operator should resubmit its request for approval from the FAA in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One ATA member suggests that, in lieu of being superseded, AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 90&hyph;18&hyph;02 should be revised or amended so that operators with approvals of alternative methods of compliance for that AD would not be required to resubmit requests for such approvals for this AD. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has determined that the actions required by AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;02 do not adequately address the specified unsafe condition. Consequently, issuance of this AD is necessary to require additional actions in order to fully address the unsafe condition. The FAA's normal policy in this regard is that when an AD requires additional actions, the existing AD is superseded by being removed from the system and a new AD added.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requests that the FAA include an initial implementation period of 2,500 flight cycles in the final rule to allow operators that are currently performing inspections in accordance with the requirements of AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;02 additional time to ``transition over'' to the use of Revision 3 of Boeing Service Bulletin 727&hyph;57&hyph;0172. The commenter states that, as written, the proposed rule would require that those operators begin accomplishing the inspections in accordance with Revision 3 immediately after the effective date of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. The FAA infers that the commenter's request for an implementation period to ``transition over'' refers to a need for additional time to update records and plan/schedule subsequent inspections. The FAA finds that additional time to begin accomplishing the inspections in accordance with Revision 3 of the service bulletin is not warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs (a) and (b) of the final rule are purposefully redundant with the exception of the inspection thresholds specified. The intent of paragraph (b) is to reduce the inspection threshold from that specified in paragraph (a) and to require that operators accomplish the inspection in accordance with Revision 3 of the service bulletin. Revision 3 of the service bulletin does not contain significant changes from other issues of the service bulletin. Further, operators have been provided ample notice through the proposed AD of the FAA's intent to require that Revision 3 of the service bulletin be used for any inspection accomplished after the effective date of this final rule. Operators will also receive 30 additional days after publication of this final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  before this AD will become effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has revised paragraph (a) of this AD to clarify its intent that operators currently accomplishing the repetitive inspections required by AD 90&hyph;18&hyph;02 continue to perform those inspections in accordance with Revision 3 of the service bulletin until the first inspection required by paragraph (b) of this AD has been accomplished. In addition, paragraph (b) of this AD has been revised to specify that accomplishment of the repetitive inspections in accordance with Revision 3 of the service bulletin terminates the repetitive inspections required by paragraph (a) of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter requests that paragraph (d) of the proposal be revised to indicate that no further action is required if a ``checking tool'' is used to ensure that a functionally acceptable positional plate was installed per Boeing Drawing 65C31395. The commenter indicates that it has developed a tool for checking the dimensions of the positional plate in accordance with the Boeing drawing. The commenter states that, since it has used a functionally acceptable solution to the problem and since this solution is recognized by Boeing as being equivalent to the procedures described in Revision 3 of the service bulletin cited in the proposal, the FAA should also recognize this procedure as an acceptable method of complying with the proposed requirements of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request to revise paragraph (d) of this AD to indicate that no further action is required if a ``checking tool'' is used. Paragraph (d) of this AD requires that the gap between the roller bolt head and the positional plate be measured in accordance with Revision 3 of Boeing Service Bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 727&hyph;57&hyph;0172. However, that service bulletin does not specify the use of any particular tool when performing the measurement. The FAA has no data available to evaluate the validity of the tool referenced by the commenter. In addition, the FAA does not find it necessary to limit the methods available to operators to accomplish the requirements of paragraph (d) of this AD. Since the service bulletin does not specify the use of any particular tool, the FAA considers that any measuring tool that allows operators to determine if the gap between the roller bolt head and the positional plate is within specified limits meets the intent of paragraph (d) of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

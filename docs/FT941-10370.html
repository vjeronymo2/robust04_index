			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Boost for French films The French government yesterday announced plans to boost exports of French films with a FFr100m (Pounds 11.3m) package phased over four years that includes production subsidies and promotional support, writes Alice Rawsthorn from Paris. Mr Jacques Toubon, the arts minister who last autumn led the French lobby to stem the flow of US movies into Europe during the Gatt negotiations, unveiled a number of measures, including a FFr5m grant for the second French film festival in the Japanese city of Yokohama. The minister hopes to double the number of French films shown in the US and to increase exports to central and eastern Europe.</p>

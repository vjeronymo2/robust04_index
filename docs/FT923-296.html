			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (6): A primer for Eastern Europe THE EAST EUROPEAN OPPORTUNITY by Marvin Zonis and Dwight Semle John Wiley Dollars 49.95, 438 pages ANYONE DOING business in Eastern Europe knows that accurate statistics are hard to find. Sources, even good ones, quickly turn obsolete. Here, hot off the press, is a new, thick resource book by Professor Marvin Zonis and Mr Dwight Semler of the University of Chicago, which should help fill the void for this season, at least. The East European Opportunity is a compendium of facts (historical, demographic, economic, cultural, legislative) for each Eastern European country: Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia. The book's main strength is that if provides detailed statistics for countries like Bulgaria and Romania, where very little information exists. For example, in Bulgaria, 30 per cent of households own vacuum cleaners; installed electricity-generating capacity is 11.31m. kilowatts. The main weakness of the book is that, alas, the section on Yugoslavia is a painful reminder of what that country used to be. The authors have written something akin to Fodor's Europe - a general guide to the region with 60 to 70 pages devoted to each country. Anyone who is working in one of the countries would require far more detailed information, of the sort published in weekly newsletters and textline updates. But as a primer, and a factual sourcebook for the region, this must be one of the best new volumes on the market.</p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> UCSD BASEBALL COACH DIDN'T ENJOY THIS HOMER  </P> <P> UC San Diego baseball Coach Lyle Yates was not very happy after an 11-11 tie at  Cal State Hayward last week.  </P> <P> "I've coached nine years here at UCSD, and I've never seen anything like it,"  he said. "That's the most obvious homer (umpiring) I've ever seen."  </P> <P> Here was the scene:  </P> <P> UCSD had just pulled ahead, 12-11, in the top of the 11th inning. In the bottom  of the 11th, Triton ace Rick Rupkey got the first two Hayward batters out on  two pop-ups with just three pitches. He hit the next guy on one pitch and  walked the next on four -- all questionable calls, Yates said.  </P> <P> And then it was over. The ump called the game on darkness. The game reverted  back to the previous inning and was ruled a tie.  </P> <P> Yates was stunned. "I've never seen anything like it," he repeated. "Either you  don't start the 11th, or you let it finish. I guarantee you there was plenty of  light compared to just five minutes prior.  </P> <P> "It was just boom, see you guys later. I couldn't believe it. Of course, the  Cal State Hayward coach wasn't saying boo."  </P> <P> As hot as Yates was then, things were much better later in the week.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Yates got his 200th victory in the first game of a double header  sweep of visiting Wisconsin Whitewater. Yates' record is 201-187-4.  </P> <P> Of those four ties, two have come in the last 14 games as UCSD has posted a  10-2-2 mark during that span after beginning the season 4-6.  </P> <P> Its victories Saturday represented UCSD's fifth consecutive double header sweep  this season, a school record. UCSD is 14-8-2 overall.  </P> <P> In college tennis, players are there own umpires for the most part, and no one  ever accuses Dan Mattera of being a "homer".  </P> <P> Mattera, a senior at the University of San Diego and ranked 39th in the nation,  was presented with the Grover C. Hall Jr. Sportsmanship award Sunday at the  Blue-Gray National Collegiate Championships at Montgomery, Ala.  </P> <P> Along with the trophy and a watch, $1,000 will be presented to USD's tennis  program in Mattera's name.  </P> <P> "It's kind of nice to give something back to the university," Mattera said,  adding the punch line, "Although, I don't think I would have given that much."  </P> <P> Actually, this kind of award is becoming commonplace for Mattera. In December,  he won the Marty Pincus Memorial Sportsmanship Award at the Fiesta Bowl  tournament in Tempe, Ariz., and as a freshman won the Evelyn Housman Award and  a lifetime membership in the U.S. Tennis Assn. during a junior tournament.  </P> <P> What's his secret?  </P> <P> "I take an interest in the people running the tournament," he said. "I don't  just play and leave. I stick around and talk to people. I talk to my opponent  after the match. I talk to him before the match.  </P> <P> "Also, I think I'm fair with my line calls, and I think people appreciate  that."  </P> <P> Tammy Blackburn, a 5-foot-8 guard who signed with San Diego State's women's  basketball team in November, averaged 13.6 points and led Brea-Olinda High in  steals averaging 3.5 per game.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda was ranked fourth in the nation by USA Today and had a 55-game  winning streak before losing in the CIF Division III state championship.  </P> <P> For her efforts, Blackburn was selected to The Times' All-Orange County team.  </P> <P> Now for the bad news. She showed up at the awards breakfast Sunday in Anaheim  with her arm in a sling after undergoing shoulder surgery.  </P> <P> As a freshman, Blackburn had surgery to repair her other shoulder and major  back surgery to correct a curvature in her spine.  </P> <P> Melissa Sortino, who signed early with the University of San Diego, also was  selected to the Orange County team. Sortino, a 5-7 guard from Marina High,  averaged 20.4 points and was the co-most valuable player of the prestigious 5-A  Sunset League.  </P></p>

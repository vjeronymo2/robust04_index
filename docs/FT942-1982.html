			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / EU fails to keep open-government pledge France's National Assembly recently calculated that nearly two thirds of the laws it has considered in recent years originated from decisions taken by the Council of Ministers of the European Union. Given the torrent of nearly 300 laws which has flowed from Brussels since 1988 alone to put in place the single European market, this is only mildly surprising. What is surprising, however, is that the EU Council - the arena of serial voting by elected national ministers on behalf of 340m people - claims not to be able to give even the sketchiest account of how its members lined up on this corpus of Euro-law, now mostly transposed on to national statute books. Yet this is the claim made to the Financial Times by the Council bureaucracy, or general secretariat, while rejecting in writing the paper's request for selected voting records of the 12 member states since 1989 on foreign affairs, the single market, social affairs, and agriculture. The request was made under the Council's new code on public access to information. It was turned down by the secretariat but is now in the hands of the Council itself after an appeal. Voting records do exist. But they are contained in the minutes of the meetings which decided the proposals, and these the Council refuses to release. The much-vaunted new code, passed last December after EU leaders took fright at the public alienation from Europe revealed by the ratification crisis over the Maastricht treaty, is in such confusion as to risk bringing the Union further discredit. The 'openness' policy was at its high tide intended to emulate the Scandinavian tradition of open government, or at least the US Freedom of Information Act. It originally proclaimed full right of public access to all EU information, except where national security, monetary stability, commercial confidentiality, privacy, or relations with non-EU countries could be endangered. But last December, a majority of the 12, acting on civil service advice, slipped in a discretionary clause for refusing access 'to protect the confidentiality of the Council's proceedings'. Of 27 requests for information made by the end of May to the Council, six were fully met, seven were met in part, nine were refused, one was under consideration, and four - probably including the FT's - were subject to further review. But it is too early to judge how the catch-all clause is being employed. 'The system is in shock,' one EU diplomat said. The Council is the only legislature in Europe which meets behind closed doors. Experimental televising of parts of some of its sessions has yielded the uninformative spectacle of ministers talking at each other in stilted set-piece speeches. There has been no televised debate on openness, and one can see why. Many ministers emerging from Council meetings habitually give a heavy national 'spin' to their version of what went on inside. But most stop short of mendacity, if only because they risk being found out; they are in competition with 11 other member states, some of which, like the Netherlands and Denmark, are committed to open government. But many countries, among them Belgium, France, Portugal and the UK, are not so keen. 'Most countries are not prepared to go beyond their national practice in distributing information,' one EU official said yesterday. The Dutch government is challenging the new code in the European Court in Luxembourg, supported by the European Parliament. But the controversy is already stemming the flow of leaked information from EU institutions. Officials now appear less willing to provide documents. 'When you create a channel you dry up most of the tributaries,' as one British official put it. Moreover, ambassadors of the 12 have proposed that the relatively low-level General Affairs Group of the Council (with the multilingual acronym of Gag) should adjudicate by simple majority on information requests, and that the Council - of elected national ministers - 'will undertake in principle to approve (this) without debate'. The Dutch and Danes refuse to accept this, but as one of their adversaries said yesterday, 'the reality is it's 10 against two'. The odds will change if Sweden, Norway and Finland enter the EU next year. They have attached declarations to their accession treaties reaffirming their traditions of freedom of information, to which the EU has attached counter-declarations expecting the newcomers to abide by EU law. The 'openness' battle looks set to run for a good while yet.</p>

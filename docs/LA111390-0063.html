			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO WEIGH BAN ON ALCOHOL  </P> <P> Ojai officials will consider a ban on alcohol consumption in all public parks  and on city sidewalks.  </P> <P> The City Council will discuss the request tonight.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Lt. Larry Weimer said he is seeking the ban on alcohol because  drinking by adults at Little League games has been a problem for years.  </P> <P> Weimer said several fights among rowdy fans and minor accidents involving drunk  drivers prompted his request, along with continuing problems in enforcing a  vague city law. The law prohibits drinking on public roads and in parking lots  but does not mention sidewalks. One bleacher at Sarzotti Park actually occupies  a sidewalk.  </P> <P> Weimer, who serves as the city's police chief, wants the law to be clearer and  to contain a section making it illegal to drink alcohol in any city park  without a special permit. Event sponsors would apply to the city to obtain a  permit.  </P> <P> City Manager Andy Belknap is recommending that the matter be referred to the  city's Parks and Recreation Commission for further review and public hearings.

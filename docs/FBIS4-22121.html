			<p>BFN     [Text) Unidentified persons stole 7,000 detonators from  the 28th Ammunition Warehouse, which is on Kos island.  According to a statement issued by the Army General Staff  [YES], the warehouse guard noticed last Thursday night that the  door had been forced open. Following investigations it was  established that 7,000 detonators were missing. The chief of  YES instructed the ASDEN [Higher Military Command for the  Interior and Islands] commander to visit the island. An  extensive search is already in progress.    [Paris AFP in English at 1142 GMT on 24 April carries a  related Athens-datelined report that adds that "investigators  have not ruled out the possibility of a `terrorist' link, police  said."    The AFP report continues: "Defense Mnister Yerasimos  Arsenis,  confirming local police reports of the theft Frriday night, said  Sunday authorities were examining all hypotheses.    "Up to now he believed the thieves were `people who use  dynamite for fishing,' or who wanted the detonators to make  firecrackers for use during the Greek Orthodox Easter  celebrations on May 1.    "However Greek police said they had not ruled out the  possibility the detonators may have been stolen by people  `planning a terrorist attack,' but added that this theory was  `not favoured for the moment.'"]</p>

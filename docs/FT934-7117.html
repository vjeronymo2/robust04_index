			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Price curb on salmon imports condemned SCOTTISH salmon producers complained yesterday that the European Commission had not gone far enough to limit Norwegian salmon imports to the European Union. The Commission imposed a minimum price on the imports until the end of the year. However, Mr Jim Payne, chairman of the Scottish Salmon Growers Association, said: 'The levels of minimum import prices simply cement the market price at Norwegian dumping levels and do nothing to resolve the crisis in the industry.' The new minimum import price for fresh and frozen whole (ungutted) salmon is Ecu2,860 (Pounds 2,633) per net tonne. The association says that works out at Pounds 1.22 per pound, below the current weighted average price of Pounds 1.32 per pound for salmon at fish markets. Prices have risen slightly since recently touching a low point of about Pounds 1 per pound. The Commission's move was a reaction to pressure from the Irish and British governments. Scottish and Irish salmon producers have been hit by what the Commission described yesterday as 'massive imports of Norwegian salmon at low prices'. The Irish government had formally requested safeguard measures, but the British authorities  - to the irritation of Scottish salmon farmers  - had asked only for 'appropriate measures' to deal with the problem. On Thursday the Norwegians rejected Commission calls to restrict salmon exports. Yesterday, Mr Yannis Paleokrassas, the fisheries commissioner, took action under the safeguard rules of the EU's common fisheries policy. The decision comes at a sensitive time for Norway, which is negotiating membership of the EU. Finding a way to preserve Norwegian fisheries is one of the trickiest aspects of the membership talks. Norwegian sources said last night that the minimum price would represent an increase 'in relation to the price of the last few weeks'. Officials claim that total exports of Norwegian salmon for this year are forecast to rise by only 5 per cent. Norwegian salmon farmers say output is set to grow faster in Scotland and Ireland than in Norway. They recently ended talks with Scottish and Irish farmers on creating a network of producer organisations aimed at controlling production.</p>

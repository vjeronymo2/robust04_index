			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Singer Wayne Newton is the latest entertainer to cancel a scheduled opening in  Las Vegas as the summer-long impasse between major resorts and striking  musicians continues. Newton said he bowed out of Tuesday's opening at the Las  Vegas Hilton to show the people of Las Vegas that "their needs are more  important" than his. Musicians Local 369 is on strike over the issue of taped  music and guaranteed work, and both sides said after a negotiating session this  week that they were at an impasse. No new talks are planned. The latest  proposal by the resorts to guarantee the jobs of four musicians but to leave  the hotels free to use taped music was called "unacceptable" by Mark Tully  Massagli, president of Local 369. "Unless we have some semblance of work  guarantees so our people can make a living in this business, we're going to  have a problem getting this resolved," he said. Several performers have honored  the picket line and refused to perform at Strip resorts, including Dean Martin,  Rodney Dangerfield, Connie Francis, Burt Bacharach, Dionne Warwick, Bill  Medley, Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme. Randy Travis and David Copperfield  performed as scheduled, and Engelbert Humperdinck worked several nights at the  Las Vegas Hilton, then quit the remainder of his engagement.

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Thai media group plans flotation Grammy Entertainment, the Thai television, radio and music production company credited with establishing the Thai popular music industry, has applied for a public flotation. It will be the first entertainment company listed on the fast-growing Stock Exchange of Thailand. Grammy executives expect a quarter of the company's 400m shares to be sold to the public at the initial public offering. Net profit this year is estimated at about Bt250m (Dollars 10m) on turnover of Bt1.7bn. Mr Paiboon Damrongchaitham, the founder and executive chairman who owns 72 per cent of the shares, said Grammy needed capital to expand operations in Asia. 'Globalisation is starting,' he said. 'If I want to join in, we must have some money to join the business.' He said Grammy needed the money to invest in its retail network for the marketing of its Thai music catalogue; to participate in a satellite television channel and other joint ventures; to pay for new studios and equipment; and to convert Thai songs into Chinese for big markets in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Grammy, established in 1983, has become Thailand's leading producer of television soap operas, game shows and music programmes - it makes 25 programmes a week for the main television stations - as well as the production company of choice for Thai pop stars.</p>

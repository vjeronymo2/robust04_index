			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROADWAY'S BEST  </P> <P> Dan Sullivan is correct when he states that the Tony Award for best musical  used to go to new shows like "West Side Story" and the best play award to shows  like "A Streetcar Named Desire" ("The Tonys: An Honor in Decline," June 4).  </P> <P> Lest anyone get the wrong impression, however, let it be known that "The Music  Man" beat "West Side Story" for best musical in 1958 and "Mister Roberts" beat  "Streetcar" for best play in 1948.  </P> <P> STEVEN KURTZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

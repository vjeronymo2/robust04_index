			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Spirit of Kwangju Calls for Resistance"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- Papers here today  dedicate commentaries to the 14th anniversary of the heroic  Kwangju popular uprising in May 1980.    It was a just anti-imperialist, anti-fascist resistance to  thwart the criminal acts of the U.S. imperialists and their  servants the Chon Tu-hwan-No Tae-u fascist group and achieve  independence, democracy and reunification, and a mass armed  uprising in which the people fought a death-defying struggle in  the teeth of repression by huge armed forces.    NODONG SINMUN says the uprising left a precious lesson that  if the South Korean people are to smash the armed crackdown of  the oppressors and win a final victory, they must courageously  wage an all-people anti-U.S. struggle for independence to  terminate the colonial rule of the United States.    The news analyst says:    It was the lesson learned by the Kwangju resistance fighters  and South Korean people at the cost of blood and the sum total  of the struggle that as long as the United States occupies South  Korea and the flunkeyist traitors and bellicose elements remain  in power, independence, democracy and reunification cannot be  expected nor can the scourge of nuclear war be averted.    The South Korean students and people of all walks of life  must firmly unite under the banner of anti-imperialism and  independence and more vigorously wage the anti-U.S., anti-war  and anti-nuclear weapon struggle to overthrow the vicious  colonial rule of the United States, establish the sovereignty of  the nation, check and frustrate the nuclear war provocation  moves of the United States and realise peace and security.    All parties, groupings and people of South Korea and  overseas  compatriots must courageously wage a nationwide struggle to  reunify the country through a confederacy in accordance with the  ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation put  forward by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the lodestar  of national reunification, actively support the patriotic  proposal of the North for the convocation of a national  conference and turn out as one in the efforts to realise it.    An analyst of MINJU CHOSON warns that if the Kim Yong-sam  group fails to lend an ear to the voices of the people and  thoroughly and correctly solve the Kwangju problem, it will  encounter a greater resistance of the people.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Europe 1993: Europe Today - Europe's open market Spreading your professional wings abroad should be easier in Europe's open market where qualifications gained at home are recognised across the Community. In principle, a British teacher like the one above working in Torremolinos, Spain, has been able to do so since 1990 when early single market legislation fell into place. Most professional qualifications are now recognised throughout the EC and additional measures enable free movement for everyone from architects to hairdressers. However, in practice, many professionals still face national and linguistic barriers, and find transporting home-grown skills across borders less than straightforward.</p>

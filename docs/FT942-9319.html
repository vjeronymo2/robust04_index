			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Syria praises 'keen' US peace efforts Syria yesterday welcomed 'intensified' US efforts to broker progress in peace talks with Israel after Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, delayed his departure from Damascus for two unscheduled rounds of talks with the Syrian leadership, before carrying the results of his discussions to Israel. Praise for Mr Christopher's 'keen efforts' to bridge the gap between the two sides, carried on the state-run Syria radio, was virtually the sole official comment on the progress of his two days of talks in Damascus. US officials would say only that Mr Christopher was 'inching' the talks forward. However, the secrecy, combined with Mr Christopher's evident willingness to tailor the present mini-shuttle, his second in two weeks, to the course of discussions, suggests the secretary of state is exchanging detailed and specific proposals between the two sides, and is determined to achieve tangible progress. The two unexpected rounds of talks with Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, Syria's foreign minister, were punctuated by trips by Mr Christopher to the US embassy in Damascus, where he is understood to have called Washington. Yesterday's talks followed a four-hour discussion on Sunday night with Mr Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian president. Mr Christopher is understood to have presented a series of proposals to Mr al-Sharaa and obtained a response before flying to Israel, where he went straight into talks with Israeli leaders. Though no details of the talks have emerged, Tishreen, the state newspaper, yesterday again indicated an apparent Syrian softening on its previous demand for an 'immediate' withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Golan Heights. In a front-page comment it said Israel must offer a 'full withdrawal' from the Heights according to a 'speedy timetable'. Israel is understood to have offered a three-stage withdrawal over eight years - a timetable Syria has rejected - in exchange for Syrian pledges to establish 'full peace'. Al-Hayat, the London-based newspaper, meanwhile quoted anonymous Syrian officials as saying Mr Assad had presented a five-point schedule for progress on the peace talks. This is reported to have begun with Israel annulling its parliamentary resolution annexing the Golan, and offered as a final phase Syrian undertakings to normalise political and economic relations with Israel. The newspaper said Mr Christopher was also aiming during his present tour to win agreement from both sides to establish a joint Israeli-Syrian military committee to agree mutually acceptable security measures on the Golan and post-withdrawal borders.</p>

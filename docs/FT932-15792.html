			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Pragmatism tempers Balladur's grandiose plans: The policy 'reforms' outlined by France's new premier EVEN a relatively self-effacing Frenchman sees his country as a model for Europe, not to say the world, to follow - and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur was not shy in making l'exemple francais the theme of his new government's programme. But in his policy speech to parliament on Thursday he wisely tempered his ambitions with a warning to the conservative majority sitting in front of him that his 'reforms' might take five years to bear fruit, rather than the two years which may, in reality, be all he has. In 1995 France will go through the upheaval of a presidential election, which may prompt new parliamentary polls and - depending on Mr Balladur's record - a new premier. Mr Balladur himself gave more reason for prudence than pretension. He claimed France faces 'its most serious economic and social situation' since it emerged from the second world war. This could be taken as a politically convenient depreciation of the legacy left him by the Socialists, were it not for the premier's deep pessimism about any rapid improvement in unemployment. Putting people back to work is the government's 'absolute priority', he said. But he only allowed himself the hope that the jobless rate, 10.6 per cent in February, 'which will continue to rise inexorably this year, should stabilise at the end of 1993, and start to fall thereafter'. This is despite Mr Balladur's plan to ease the welfare charges which fall on employers' payroll costs. Indeed, in tackling unemployment Mr Balladur suggested the world might be able to teach France something; his new advisory committee on unemployment will include foreign as well as French experts. Yet, on the issue of immigration, France's new government clearly does not want any lecturing from outside. Mr Balladur made clear that the 25,000 expulsions of illegal immigrants ordered every year by French courts would be carried out, and that the 100,000 people born of immigrant parents on French soil who every year acquire French nationality automatically on their 18th birthday would now have to affirm their interest in a French passport. By being tougher on illegal immigrants the government believes it can be kinder to legal ones. But this week's violent racial incidents in Paris and Lille have cast fresh doubt on improvements in racial integration - an issue on which the French have never been slow to moralise to the rest of the world. It is in foreign policy that the new French government's 'exemplary' ambitions are most obvious. In his one surprise initiative Mr Balladur called for a conference to settle the post-cold war conflicts which have broken out in Europe, in the way that the peace conferences of 1815, 1919-20 and 1945 brought other European wars to an end. More seriously, Mr Balladur has now been as categoric as he possibly can be in endorsing the franc's present parity with the D-Mark. As the only way to move Europe forward to monetary union in the long term and France forward to resumed economic growth in the short term, maintenance of the link with the D-Mark was 'a national objective', he said. Such firmness, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the finance minister, claimed yesterday, had already paid off in the 1.5 percentage point drop in money market rates since the conservative election victory. This may in turn lead the Bank of France to reduce its upper, emergency lending rate, currently at 12 per cent, next week. But because his economic policy depends crucially on Bundesbank interest rate cuts for its success, Mr Balladur issued a thinly veiled warning to Bonn that it, too, had to try to pursue a balanced budgetary and fiscal policy if France and Germany were to keep their economies and currencies together. Mr Balladur evidently reckoned he was setting an example in confirming he would raise indirect taxes and cut an immediate FFr20bn (Pounds 2.41bn) off a budget deficit which he estimated would grow to FFr330bn this year, or 3.4 per cent of national output. If allowed five years at the helm, Mr Balladur promised to get this down to 2.5 per cent by 1997. But the current size of the budget's deficit made Mr Balladur's side-swipe at the European Commission's 'budgetary skids' somewhat ironic. In defence, where his Gaullist RPR party has for so long been dogmatic, Mr Balladur raised more questions than answers. At this stage he could only be clear that France would keep up its military guard (nuclear and conventional), that it would give itself the means to dispatch troops 'wherever they are needed in the world,' and that, with revamped armed forces, France would be 'the driving force of a true European defence entity, set up in close co-operation with our American friends and allies'. Clearly, France's rivalry with the US will henceforth be more commercial than military.</p>

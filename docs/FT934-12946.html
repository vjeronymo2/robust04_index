			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Food and Drink: A sparkling challenge - Jancis Robinson's Competition CAN Weekend FT readers succeed where Eurocrats have failed the wine world? Certainly, I would think. What do you call a wine that is fizzy, was made using exactly the same methods used in Champagne - yet is produced somewhere else? You certainly cannot call it champagne, except in those parts of the world - such as the US - yet to be conquered by the litigious Champenois. In the US, you can refer to any old carbonated plonk as champagne, but what I am after is a term for top-quality wine made using top-quality methods. These involve deriving bubbles from a second fermentation in the bottle in which the wine will eventually be sold, and extra flavour from leaving it on the lees of that second fermentation for at least nine months. It used to be easy to distinguish these wines because they were made mainly in France and were labelled methode champenoise, but the European Community has now outlawed this term. Setting aside the issue of just who 'invented' the method - and there are various claimants outside Champagne - at least the term made clear that none of the more industrial gasifying methods were used. The EC is proposing that another term, methode traditionnelle, should be made mandatory from next September. To me, it sounds as utterly meaningless and unconvincing as, say, 'traditional fayre'. Guff, in other words. In any case, a significant and increasing proportion of today's top quality whatever-we-are-to-call-it is made not just outside Champagne but outside France. Why should those producers stick a French term on their labels? The Spaniards make their version in enormous quantity and call it Cava. Some Californians call theirs CMCV (Champagne Methods, Champagne (Grape) Varieties). Italians - well, their labelling is as anarchic as you might expect. What I am seeking is a term we all can use colloquially. 'Bottle-fermented sparkling wine' is just too much of a mouthful. 'Bubbly' and 'fizz' surely are a bit too Wodehouse for the late 20th century, not to mention too general. For the moment, I shall use the term 'guff.' It sounds like a just-opened bottle of the stuff and could be said to stand for Good Usage-Friendly Fizz. Moet &amp; Chandon, the biggest producer of champagne - and a considerable quantity of guff, too - will provide the FT reader who can propose the best alternative name with six bottles of its Australian Green Point 1990 - the best guff I have yet to taste.

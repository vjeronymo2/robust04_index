			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Five TNT directors resign after split TENSIONS at the top of TNT, the Australian transport group, spilled over into a boardroom split yesterday with the abrupt resignation of five directors, including the company's founder and former chief executive, Sir Peter Abeles. TNT chairman, Mr F. W. Millar, indicated yesterday that the resignations reflected disagreement over strategy for the company which has racked up losses, including write-offs, totalling more than ADollars 260m (Pounds 118m) in the latest two reporting years. Further heavy losses are likely when the company reports for the latest year, ended June. Mr Millar said TNT's strategy for the past year had been very clear, following agreement by the then board early last financial year. 'It concentrates on improving operating earnings, selling non-core assets and reducing debt,' he said. 'It focused management's efforts on our very strong core transport businesses. 'The directors who resigned sought a change in that strategy. That change was not adopted by the board. 'I regret the resignations, but I must say that management can now proceed to implement the continuing strategy with confidence.' Analysts said yesterday that Sir Peter and the other resigning directors were believed to be pushing for a more expansionary strategy, possibly involving a renewed increase in the company's debt levels. It was heavy debt and rapid expansion that pushed the company close to failure in 1991. Observers further speculated that Sir Peter's continued presence on the board since stepping aside as chief executive last September may have sat uneasily with the new chief executive, Mr David Mortimer. The other resigning directors are Mr Christopher Sporborg, deputy chairman of Hambros Bank, the UK merchant bank, Mr John Landerer, Mr Evan Cameron and Mr Gilles Kryger. TNT shares added 5 cents to ADollars 1.27 yesterday. Mr Millar said the directors would soon consider board replacements.</p>

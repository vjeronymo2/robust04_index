			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / S Africa talks in chaos as Inkatha walks out: Full withdrawal would risk legitimacy of constitution SOUTH AFRICA'S constitutional negotiations were thrown into crisis last night after the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party and its allies walked out of the talks. The rightwing Conservative party and the governments of several conservative black homelands also walked out, leaving only the South African government and the African National Congress plus their allies participating in the talks. Delegates said they would consult their principals over whether to withdraw permanently from the 26-party constitutional negotiating body. They would return to talks tomorrow to convey their decision. ANC and government officials made clear that talks would proceed without the dissident group, which calls itself the Concerned South Africans Group, but the legitimacy of a constitution written only by the ANC and government would be seriously jeopardised. The move appeared to be an attempt by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader, to test his strength within the negotiations, as well as to determine whether government would back him or the ANC in a dispute. The government made clear it would risk isolating Chief Buthelezi and his allies rather than impede progress in negotiations. Inkatha, which has significant support in Natal province, where one quarter of the population lives, could badly disrupt any elections held under a new constitution. ANC and government officials blamed Inkatha for deliberately stalling progress in the talks, and seeking to prevent confirmation of April 27 1994 as the date for the first multiracial elections. They said efforts would be made to persuade Inkatha to return to the talks but this would depend on the reaction of the irascible and unpredictable Chief Buthelezi. Yesterday's dispute centred on the form of a future South African state, whether federal or unitary, as well as whether its constitution should be written by an elected constituent assembly. Inkatha was enraged when yesterday's talks rejected its resolution calling on the negotiating body to consider making South Africa a federal state. Inkatha delegates said this could provoke Chief Buthelezi to make their withdrawal permanent.</p>

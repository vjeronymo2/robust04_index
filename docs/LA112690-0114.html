			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POLISH PRIME MINISTER, CABINET QUIT  </P> <P> Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the first non-Communist prime minister in the East Bloc,  resigned today along with his government, a day after his crushing presidential  election defeat, state radio reported.  </P> <P> Mazowiecki lost his chance to compete in a runoff election in two weeks when he  finished third in Sunday's balloting.  </P> <P> The first- and second-place finishers were Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and  political neophyte Stanislaw Tyminski, a millionaire businessman who returned  to the country after a 21-year absence. The two will face each other in a  runoff contest on Dec. 9.  </P> <P> With Mazowiecki's resignation, a new prime minister presumably will be  nominated by the new president. Parliament must approve the nomination.  </P> <P> Before announcing his resignation, Mazoweicki vowed to continue "the struggle  for a democracy as we want it." But he added: "I am afraid I expect a period of  chaos."  </P> <P> Earlier today, Tyminski taunted Walesa at a packed news conference, at which he  said he aimed for victory in the runoff.  </P> <P> "I hope to be in first place, obviously," he said.  </P> <P> Walesa, asked if he will carry out his pre-election threat not to run in the  Dec. 9 runoff against Tyminski, said: "I must say that I am hesitating. I would  like not to run, but one has to think over what is good for Poland."  </P> <P> Unofficial results from all 49 provinces except Warsaw, issued by the  government news agency PAP, showed Walesa with 39.96% of the vote, followed by  Tyminski with 23.1%. Mazowiecki managed only 18.08%. The rest went to a handful  of minor contenders.  </P> <P> Tyminski campaigned on a promise to create "a democracy of money."  </P> <P> "I would like to take my jacket off, roll my sleeves up and go to work to make  this country rich," he told reporters today.  </P> <P> Walesa told reporters in Gdansk that the challenger is not a "serious man" but  admitted that Tyminski's success shows that Poles have a lot to learn about  democracy.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL POOL IS GIVEN TOP PRIORITY  </P> <P> The cracked Ventura High School swimming pool, drained last spring after it  began leaking, has become a danger to neighborhood children who try to climb  the fence surrounding the pool and skateboard on the dry concrete, school  officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Ventura Unified School District board on Tuesday designated construction of  a pool an emergency, speeding up the process of tearing out the old pool and  building a new one.  </P> <P> The board also voted to use developer fees to help pay for the new pool,  estimated to cost up to $600,000.  </P> <P> An engineering study found that the ground under the 37-year-old pool is  shifting and the pool is slowly sinking.  </P> <P> The cost of a new pool depends on the amount of work needed to stabilize the  ground and shore up the new pool, Assistant Supt. Richard Welcher said.  </P> <P> Developer fees will be used to pay $500,000 of the pool's cost.  </P> <P> Also, additional costs will be paid from a fund accumulated from certificates  sold to investors on the open market.  </P> <P> District officials hope to have the new pool finished by the 1991-92 school  year.

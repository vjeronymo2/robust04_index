			<p>BFN     [Text] A provincial conference of prefectural and city  party committees secretaries as well as prefectural  commissioners and city mayors concluded today. The conference  called for acquiring a clear understanding of the current  situation; seizing each and every excellent opportunity; and  earnestly strengthening agricultural and rural work. The  provincial conference of prefectural and city party committees  secretaries as well as prefectural commissioners and city mayors  was held in Nanchang 25-26 March.    The conference relayed the spirit of a recently concluded  national rural work conference and a recently concluded national  family planning symposium. It also discussed and arranged for  the province's work at the moment. Provincial party committee  Secretary Mao Zhiyong and provincial Governor Wu Guanzheng  delivered important speeches at the conference. Also attending  the conference were the provincial leaders, including Zhu  Zhihong, Lu Xiuzhen, Ma Shichang, Zhang Fengyu, Su Shengyou, Shu  Huiguo, Huang Zhiquan, Peng Kunsheng, Zhong Qihuang, Feng  Jinmao, Zheng Liangyu, Zhang Yunchuan, and Huang Maoheng,  prefectural and city party committee secretaries, prefectural  commissioners and city mayors, as well as persons in charge of  the provincial departments concerned.    In his speech, Secretary Mao Zhiyong first and foremost made  a comprehensive analysis of the excellent situation in Jiangxi  at the moment and called for sumbitting to and serving such  overall interests as grasping each and every excellent  opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting  development, and maintaining stability. To this end, Mao  Zhiyong noted, it is imperative to correctly handle relations  between reform, development, and stability. Given the actual  conditions of Jiangxi, first, we should make continued efforts  to promote development with an eye on boosting the province's  national economic growth; second, we should cultivate a new  train of thought and adopt new measures to improve labor quality  and push ahead with economic and educational development by dint  of scientific and technological progress and structural  readjustment; third, we should strive for faster growth and  rapidly build a socialist market economic structure and a  socialist market economic operative mechanism in the course of  the on-going in-depth reform; fourth, we should strive for  faster growth while maintaining overall stability. To this end,  we should actively, cautiously, and appropriately implement each  and every reform measure to avoid drastic unheavals or turmoil  and secure sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth.    Secretary Mao Zhiyong stressed: We should make unreserved  efforts to step up agricultural and rural work. Agriculture,  rural areas, and peasants have always been fundamental issues  with an important bearing on the country's overall development.  In order to maintain social stability, we should first maintain  stability in rural areas where over 80 percent of China's  population reside. Without agricultural development, it would be  impossible to successfully further and speed up overall  development, nor will it be possible to deepen reform and  maintain stability. Only when agriculture is developed will we  be able to make a success of other types of work.    Secretary Mao Zhiyong pointed out: Given Guangxi's situation  at the moment, we should strive to make a success of this year's  agricultural and rural work by focusing on the following six  aspects:    1. Maintaining stable grain output. To this end, we should  strive to maintain the total provincial grain output at or above  30 billion jin and the total provincial cotton output at or  above 200 million kilograms.    2. Increasing income on the part of peasants. To this end,  we should strive to raise per capita net income on the part of  peasants by 150 yuan on the basis of last year.    3. Further developing township and town enterprises. To  this end, we should strive to raise the total provincial  township and town enterprises output value to or above 80  billion yuan.    4. Taking firm measures to reduce the natural population  growth rate.    5. Popularizing advanced science and technology;  implementing the joint-stock system on a large scale; and  establishing and perfecting all types of socialized service  systems;    6. Building more infrastructure facilities.    Secretary Mao Zhiyong stated: Now that we have clear-cut  principles to follow and specific policies and measures to go by  in agricultural and rural work, we should implement these  principles, policies, and measures to the letter. The  provincial party committee and government hope that all areas  and departments in the province will display a strong sense of  political responsibility, resolutely implement to the letter the  central rural work principles, and successfully carry out 10  aspects of work while making continued efforts to stabilize and  perfect the basic operating system. Now the province's spring  plowing production has been unfolded on a large scale, all areas  should make overall arrangements for and strive to accelerate  grain, cotton, oil crops, vegetables, aquatic products, fruit,  forest, and other types of production as well as township and  town enterprises development.    Secretary Mao Zhiyong also called for taking overall  interests into account and successfully carrying out reform,  promoting development, and maintaining stability in a  down-to-earth manner. To this end, first, it is imperative to  successfully develop industrial production; second, it is  imperative to maintain social and political stability; third, it  is imperative to persistently and incessantly further the  on-going anti-corruption struggle; and fourth, it is imperative  to conscientiously intensify comprehensive social order  management.    In the end, Secretary Mao Zhiyong called on all areas and  departments across the province to practically strengthen  leadership, conscientiously carry out study, take overall  interests into account, improve work style, and implement to the  letter a series of policies, decisions, and measures formulated  by the CPC Central Committee as well as the Jiangxi Provincial  CPC Committee and People's Government.    At the conference, Governor Wu Guanzheng also delivered a  speech in which he spelled out the following specific  requirements for how to implement the spirit of the above  mentioned national rural work conference and national family  planning symposium:    1. Increasing agricultural input. This year, Wu Guangzheng  noted, all levels in the province have attached more importance  to increasing agricultural input. The province's estimated  financial expenditure on agricultural production has reached 410  million yuan, up by 12.4 percent over last year. Prefectures,  cities, and counties should abide by this estimated financial  expenditure.    2. Making a success of production, importation,  transportation, allocation, and supply of agriculture-oriented  production means. Departments concerned across the province  should make every possible endeavor to guarantee production and  supply of agriculture-oriented means of production with an eye  on ensuring smooth agricultural production. They should also  provide agricultural production with sufficient funds, raw and  processed materials, energy, and transportation, and see to it  that all chemical fertilizer factories operate at full capacity.    3. Deepening grain purchase and marketing system reform and  setting up a grain risk fund aimed at pushing ahead with grain  purchase and marketing system reform. To this end, it is  imperative to strengthen state macroeconomic regulation and  control over grain production, further improve grain purchase  measures, and raise grain purchase prices.    4. Strictly controlling price hikes. To this end, it is  imperative to keep this year's price index at or below 10  percent. Prefectures and cities across the province should  strive to stabilize grain and vegetables prices. Governments at  all levels across the province should assume full responsibility  for vegetable supplies. It is imperative to institute a system  under which city mayors assume full responsibility for vegetable  supplies in cities. At present, it is imperative to strengthen  control of prices of agriculture-oriented means of production  and to formulate strict rules governing competitive prices  listed by different grain enterprises.    5. Banning the practice of indiscriminately paying wages and  bonuses to staff and workers. To this end, all areas and  departments in the province should strictly implement the  current wages system and ban the above mentioned malpractice.    6. Strictly control the total number of new projects under  construction, make continued efforts to screen, suspend, or  cancel a batch of duplicate and non-profitable projects being  built in violation of the state industrial policies, and stop  building capital construction projects or technological  transformation projects short of construction funds.    7. Successfully fulfilling social stability maintenance  tasks and adopting effective measures to tackle each and every  major problem that has given rise to strong resentment among the  masses.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (6): More power to capital markets - Investment institutions / The amount of money sloshing around the world's financial system is so vast governments seem almost powerless to resist it THE ABILITY of international capital markets to embarrass governments was demonstrated in September 1992 and August 1993, when speculative attacks twice caused turmoil in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. The amount of money sloshing around the world's financial system is so vast that governments seem almost powerless to resist it - they might as well attempt to repeal the laws of gravity. To give a few examples: Net daily foreign exchange turnover last year was about Dollars 1,000bn, compared with central bank reserves which were estimated at Dollars 555.6bn in April 1992. Turnover in the Eurobond market reached more than Dollars 7,000bn in 1992, according to the International Securities Market Association. The World Bank has estimated that global institutional investment funds are worth Dollars 14,000bn. In a report on capital flows, the International Monetary Fund stated that cross-border equity holdings in the US, Europe and Japan increased from Dollars 800bn in 1986 to Dollars 1,300bn in 1991. Cross-border investment may have a lot more scope for growth. Restrictions on foreign investment by domestic institutions - pension funds, insurance companies, unit trusts or mutual funds and the like - are being eased round the world. The relaxation of rules covering occupational pension plans in Switzerland means that funds can now invest up to 25 per cent in foreign stocks and up to 30 per cent in all investments denominated in foreign currencies. The US institutions are still well behind Europe in the extent of their portfolio diversification. It is estimated that European institutions now invest about 20 per cent of their assets overseas; in the US, the proportion is only around 7 per cent. A survey by Greenwich Associates found that Dollars 31bn was invested in international stock markets by US pension funds in 1992. But corporate and public pension funds planned to invest a further Dollars 100bn in foreign stocks over the next five years. Pension funds are, of course, only part of the US institutional investment community. According to UBS Global Research, a record Dollars 26.6bn was invested in foreign bonds and equities by US institutions in the first quarter of 1993, compared with Dollars 17.4bn in the last quarter of 1992. These funds are controlled by professional managers who are well aware of the need to produce good performance to retain their management contracts. They will thus be quick to exploit any profitable opportunities - such as an expected currency devaluation - or to desert a stock market if they feel government policy has moved in an uncongenial direction. Conversely, domestic markets can surge if international fund managers decide to increase their country allocation by a couple of percentage points or so. A classic example of a country's economic policy being set with financial markets in mind is that of France in the early 1990s, where interest rates have been kept high to support the franc, in the face of the belief of many economic commentators that substantial interest rate cuts were needed to prevent a drastic recession. Not only is cross-border investment likely to grow, but the funds available for investment are also expected to increase. As the population of the developed world ages, it will need to save more and more to provide for its pensioners. By 2010, for example, around 18 per cent of the Japanese population is expected to be 65 or older, compared with 11 per cent in 1990. Pension fund assets are expected to grow from Y150,000bn in 1990 to Y250,000bn by the year 2000, according to the Japanese Pension Fund Association. A further development is the readiness of many more economies to welcome the influx of foreign capital. Financial liberalisation measures in Latin America and south-east Asia have helped make 'emerging markets' investment the flavour of the moment in the fund management industry. The argument in favour of emerging markets is relatively simple. Their economies are growing that much faster than those in the developed world, and as they embrace capitalism, the prospects for growth in corporate profits are that much greater. Emerging markets still form only a tiny part of institutional portfolios, but that in itself can be cited as a bullish argument. World Bank figures suggest there are around 135 emerging markets - the countries concerned have 80 per cent of the world's population but just 12 per cent of its GDP and 6 per cent of its stock market capitalisation. As institutions increase investments in the area, so the theory goes, the 'weight of money' will boost share prices. Japan was once an emerging market, after all. Certainly, money has started to flow into the emerging markets. In Latin America, equity portfolio inflows increased from Pounds 435m in 1989 to Dollars 5.6bn in 1992. A Micropal survey of emerging market investment managers found that Mexico was the market of main choice, followed by Malaysia, Brazil, Thailand and Hong Kong. Individually, these markets may be volatile but collectively, fund managers believe a diversified portfolio can offer enhanced rewards, since stock market returns do not appear to be correlated - there would seem to be no reason why the Malaysian market should move in the same direction as the Brazilian. Once such countries have become dependent on foreign capital, they may find their economic policies constrained by the need to keep international investors sweet. The power of international investment institutions will have increased once more.</p>

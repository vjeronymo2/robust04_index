The letter said this would be an opportunity to benefit from  the advance courses and meet with and be introduced to  colleagues from Israel and other countries in the region, as  well as an opportunity to visit Tel Aviv. The letter indicated  that the organizing company is ready to arrange hotel  reservations, receive participants at the airport, and have  visas issued to those needing them.    The letter said the organizers will be happy to arrange  meetings with the Israeli food companies and urged participants  not to hesitate to contact the organizers for further details.    The letter is signed by Avi Gordon, general manager of  Global  Information Ltd. It has been learned that these letters reached  Jordan via Norway.    The Jordanian companies that received the letter expressed  their surprise at and denunciation of this invitation, which  they thought was an Israeli psychological maneuver aimed at  breaking the Arab boycott even before concluding peace  agreements.</p>

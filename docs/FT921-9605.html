			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Treasury admits housing market miscalculation THE TREASURY has admitted that its forecasting techniques have failed to take into account the extent to which the depression in the housing market has influenced the recession. The move has raised expectations among some private-sector economists that the Treasury might be considering a boost to the market, possibly as early as in the Budget on March 10. The admission has taken the form of detailed changes to the equations in the Treasury's computer model of how the economy functions. The model acts as a base for the department's twice-yearly economic forecasts. An improved version of the model incorporates new links between consumer spending - which accounts for two thirds of gross domestic product - and the value of the housing stock. It thus enables Treasury officials to make quantitative estimates of the degree to which consumer spending is likely to be restrained by depressed house prices. That may happen through a drop in general confidence caused by falling wealth levels. The new equations also enable the Treasury to estimate how cuts in tax rates may influence the housing market, and - through that market - general consumer spending. It means government economists can simulate the degree to which consumer spending could lift off through, for example, a change in mortgage tax relief. Mr Brian Pearce, chief economist at the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club, a forecasting group which uses the Treasury model, said the new equations might indicate that the Treasury was considering changes on fiscal policy applied to housing in the Budget.</p>

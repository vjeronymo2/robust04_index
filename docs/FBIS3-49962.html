			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gordana Bralic from Baranja] </F>   [Text] Among the people on the front lines, in the  villages, in homes, Milan Martic has been explaining the  difference between him and the other candidates. If Babic wins,  we could face disaster, Martic says, and be set back to  fiefdoms. That would lead to new rifts and clashes. He  stresses that it is not important to vote for this or that man  but for the first or the second option. One will lead us to  Serbia, the other one into uncertainty.    [Martic] If my rival candidate were to say that openly, it  is the option that is committed to a true unification with the  leaders of the republic of Srpska, the Republic of Serbia, then  I most certainly would not be here today presenting myself to  you. [sentence as heard] I would let that man go ahead, and I  would be the first one to support him. Unfortunately, this is  not so, and that is why I am here to explain to you that we  could face disaster with that option, disaster as a Serbian  nation, which absolutely and certainly none of you here want.  We do not want -- but it is possible -- to return to Croatia,  to some kind of districts and counties. If there is no solution  -- and this is logical -- with the republic of Srpska and the  Republic of Serbia, then the only solution is with Tudjman, with  districts and counties.    [Bralic] Milan Martic ends all his addresses with the words  that, if he wins, he wishes his authority to be as brief as  possible, until the aim is attained and all the Serbian  countries are united.</p>

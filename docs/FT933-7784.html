			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: City Centre Restaurants up at Pounds 4.76m CITY CENTRE Restaurants, which owns, among others, the Garfunkels and Deep Pan Pizza chains, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.32m to Pounds 4.76m in the six months to June 30. However, Mr Phillip Kaye, chief executive, described the group's growth in the first half as 'slight'. In particular, London, home of the 35 Garfunkels outlets, had been dreadful until July 1, he said, when tourists seemed to arrive. This was not helped by the fact that most of the Garfunkels restaurants had been refurbished in the period under review, using most of the Pounds 3m of capital expenditure. The group had no borrowings and cash balances of Pounds 12m at the end of June. This should rise to about Pounds 16m by the end of the year, said Mr Kaye. He ascribed the profits rise mostly to the just under 100-strong Deep Pan Pizza chain. As a volume business, he said that the promotions the chain had been running for the past two years had been crucial. He added that margins under the promotions - whereby you could eat as much as you liked from the pizza and pasta buffets for Pounds 2.50, now risen to Pounds 3.25 - were 'not as tight as you'd think. They are only tight when you don't have the volume'. A further benefit of the promotions has been that 'they destroy the competition'. Some 40 Deep Pans are attached to cinemas, and Mr Kaye said that the film Jurassic Park had done wonders for the trade in those outlets. Group turnover grew to Pounds 45.3m (Pounds 42.1m) and operating profits to Pounds 4.45m (Pounds 4.06m). The interim dividend is traditionallynot increased at half-time and is again 0.45p, payable from earnings of 1.68p (1.57p). COMMENT City Centre Restaurants, now valued at about Pounds 160m, has rather sneaked up on the rails, and this sums up the style of the group. It has ridden out the recession by quietly, carefully getting on with its business, which Mr Kaye describes as 'one of the most straightforward and tidy ones you could find. We just run restaurants'. The group resisted the temptations to which many others in the leisure sector succumbed in the late-1980s, and consequently has not fallen at any fences. Mr James Naylor, once of First Leisure and latterly Whitegate Leisure, is set to take the reins from Mr Kaye in October, and one hopes he will not feel it necessary to divert the group from its track. Pencilled in pre-tax profits of about Pounds 12.5m for the year give a multiple of just over 19, a deserved premium.</p>

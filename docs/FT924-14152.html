			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television Zambia is the subject of the last of BBC2's series Out Of Darkness (7.50) which has been looking at efforts to reshape African societies. The programme considers Frederick Chiluba's chances of reversing the effects of Kaunda's 26-year presidency which was marked by widespread corruption. Perhaps we should be relishing current affairs programmes in peak viewing time since many may be pushed to the margins in January when ITV comes under the government's new whelk-stall philosophy of broadcasting. World In Action must be a prime candidate. Today's programme records recent cases in which American children (well, American lawyers on behalf of children) have used the law to oppose their parents' smoking habits. Shades of Huxley's 'Brave New World' (8.30 ITV). The second of C4's documentaries Animal Squad Undercover (9.00) finds the RSPCA's Special Unit investigating organised dog fighting. Panorama looks for once at the EC from the vantage points of France and Germany, asking whether they will create a European 'premier league'.</p>

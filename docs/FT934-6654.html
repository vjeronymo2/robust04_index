			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Business gives rate cut a cautious welcome: City anticipates further reduction - IoD warns on tax increases / Budget aid sought for small companies British business gave a cautious welcome to yesterday's half-point cut in interest rates, while City commentators said they expected a further cut in the next few months. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said: 'This is a welcome move which is fully justified by the recent good news on inflation. It will help to sustain the recovery.' Mr Tony Hales, chief executive of food and drinks group Allied Lyons, said: 'The important thing is that it's another little encouragement to consumers, and another help to industry's cash flow in the form of lower interest payments. But I hope the chancellor's got another half-point up his sleeve.' Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of leading housebuilder Wimpey, said that any impact on the housing market would be more psychological than financial. 'While this cut brings mortgage repayments to their lowest level since the 1960s, affordability has not been an issue for more than a year now,' he said. 'The question remains one of confidence in the economy and in job security.' He added that it would be impossible to assess the impact of the cut until next week's Budget. The engineering industry responded with mixed feelings. The Machine Tool Technologies Association said that any downward movement in rates was welcome, but the recent string of half-point cuts had had no effect on capital investment. The Institute of Directors welcomed the news, but hoped that the modest cut should not be used as a trade-off for further tax increases in the Budget. Any new tax rises, it said, would be 'very bad news' and would endanger the recovery. The Federation of Small Businesses also welcomed the reduction in costs but hoped it would be accompanied by Budget measures to help companies recover from the recession. In the City, there was general agreement that the chancellor had left room for further cuts. Mr Brian Martin, senior economist with Citibank in London, said 'we expect another 50-basis-point cut in December or early January.' He added that sterling should remain well-supported by the fact that many European countries were likely to cut their rates more sharply than the UK in coming months. Many believed last week's sharp drop in headline inflation from 1.8 per cent to 1.4 per cent had provided Mr Clarke with the excuse he needed to cut rates. Mr Peter Warburton, economist at Robert Fleming, said: 'The government took the opportunity of the good inflation figures to make a step ahead of the Budget.' Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, said he still believed base rates should go down to 4 per cent. He said: 'There's a very good chance, but it could take some time to get there.'</p>

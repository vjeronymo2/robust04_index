During a news conference, the foreign minister said the  cooperation will include the sugarcane industry, education,  sports, social areas, and international relations.    During his five-day tour, the foreign minister negotiated  the  terms of a technical assistance agreement, which includes Cuban  specialists constructing a sugar mill in Zambia.    Gilly Mushota announced that during his next trip to Cuba,  Zambian President Frederik Chiluba will sign sugarcane industry  agreements and that his country will finance all the operations.    Concerning education, in the last 10 years approximately 73  Zambian students completed their college education in Cuba, and  six were graduated as midlevel technicians.    Forty-three Zambian youths are enrolled in different schools  in Havana, Santiago de Cuba, the second largest city in the  country, Camaguey, Santa Clara, and the nickel-mining town of  Moa, in the eastern province of Holguin.    The visitor and Julio Teja, Cuban public health minister,  discussed the increase of medical assistance to that country,  where 22 Cuban doctors are already practicing.    The Zambian foreign minister also said the National  Institute  for Sports, Physical Education, and Recreation will contribute  in training Zambian athletes for the African, Commonwealth, and  Olympic Games, with the arrival of trainers for track and field,  boxing, baseball, and other disciplines.

Concerning the upcoming elections in South Africa, the first  multiracial elections there, he said he expects a democratic  process, but he said it will not totally resolve the culture of  violence that was brought to the region by the "abominable  system of apartheid."    "Another peace process will have to take place so that  whites, mestizos, and blacks can achieve a national  reconciliation," he said.    Gilly Mushota, who traveled to Cuba accompanied by his  counterpart, Roberto Robaina, left for Jamaica today as part of  his Caribbean tour.</p>

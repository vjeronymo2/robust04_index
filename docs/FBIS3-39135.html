			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Pietro Veronese report: "Europe Crosses the Rubicon"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday in Brussels an act of political will was  performed. A moral Rubicon was crossed. A responsibility was  accepted, finally.    The Atlantic Council involves not just Europe. The  Alliance's three non-European members played a key role in the  tormented Brussels discussions: the United States and Turkey  for, Canada against. And undoubtedly because the principal  product of the decision was a new European firmness. By France  in particular. But also by Italy, the first to demand a  "concrete reaction" to the [Sarajevo] market massacre. The  others followed. The Russian threats, offered in Moscow, not  only by nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and by a Duma at the  mercy of every whim, but also by Boris Yeltsin in person, were  ignored. The vicious circle of reasoning, which always imagined  that military action would be followed by a worse reaction and  which ended up taking no action at all, has been broken.  Something has shifted: too late, perhaps, but for once, not  too little.    Of course, a 12-hour meeting is not enough to change Europe.  The idiosyncrasies, the tactics, and the hidden agendas remain.  National interests are guiding governments. Greece is no less  against any anti-Serb policy than before. Britain does not hope  less than before that nothing will be done. Nonetheless, the  NATO Council decided unanimously. And yesterday, whether out of  conviction or out of opportunism, everyone voted yes.    What will happen now? The Brussels communique is not the  last word. The final decision, the final go-ahead to order an  attack by the Alliance's fighter bombers, lies with  Butrus-Ghali. The "Bosnian operation" is in fact being carried  out under the UN blue banner, not under the 12-starred one of  the European Union, or under NATO's pink one. Yesterday's will  only be a typed piece of paper placed in full view on the  secretary general's desk on the 38th floor of UN Headquarters,  alongside the reports of the blue helmets' field commanders and  of "special envoy" Yasushi Akashi. After 10 days, they will  report whether the Serbs have effectively withdrawn their heavy  artillery surrounding Sarajevo, and whether the UN contingent  will or will not be overly exposed to any reprisals. The  inscrutable Butrus will get up from his desk, look out of his  window over the East River running at his feet, will weigh up  the pros and cons -- possibly more concerned with his own  political fortune than the fate of peace and war -- and will  pronounce his decision.    For this reason it is possible that yesterday's decision  will  remain a dead letter. Maybe, at the moment of decision in the  Atlantic Council's meeting chamber, more than one representative  calculated this way. To know how things will end up, one can  only wait and see. But whatever happens, yesterday's date marks  a point of no return. It will now be difficult for Sarajevo's  martyrdom to be relegated to the darkness of indifference,  cynicism, and abject inaction. One does not lose one's  credibility twice.    The 16 ambassadors who laboriously concluded the Atlantic  Council's communique, while acting under instructions from their  governments, had good reason to rejoice yesterday evening. Many  hours before the conclusion of the session, Serbian and Bosnian  military chiefs in Sarajevo had granted UN General Michael Rose  and the Bosnian army a cease-fire and intimated their readiness  to withdraw their heavy artillery. It is not the first time  such a pledge has been made, and there is no reason to believe  it will be kept this time any more than other times. But it is  a sign that firmness pays, and that the West's determination is  worrying Sarajevo's besiegers. In the words of French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe: "If the Serbs withdraw, I would like to  twist their arm a little more."</p>

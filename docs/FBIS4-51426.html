			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By P.C. Tang and Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Brussels, May 26 (CNA) -- A Taiwan delegation  composed of ten auto and motorcycle parts and component  manufacturers is in Belgium to promote Taiwan products and seek  cooperative opportunities.    Manager of Sanyes Automotive Industrial Co. Huang Sheng-chih  said during an interview with CNA that Belgium, an important  production center for the European auto industry, has been  targeted by Taiwan manufacturers because it does not produce its  own car brands.    Taiwan manufacturers can supply Belgium car assembly plants  with parts and components and cooperate with Belgium OEM  (original equipment manufacture) makers to tap the European and  Asia-Pacific markets, Huang said.    During the tour arranged by the Far East Trade Service  Center  in Brussels, the Taiwan OEM manufacturers visited car assembly  plants for Opel and Volkswagen and met with their Belgium  counterparts to discuss trade opportunities.    Belgium imported some US$4.63 billion worth of car parts and  components from abroad in 1993 with Taiwan supplying US$83  million, or just under 2 percent of the total imports, Huang  said. There is ample room for development of the Belgium  market, he added.    After Belgium, the Taiwan delegation members will proceed to  Germany and Britain to continue their European tour which also  took them to Paris. Delegation members are scheduled to return  to Taiwan on June 10.</p>

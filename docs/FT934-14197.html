			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (4): Data is in the right bucket / Case study of Ford Electronics in Spain SUCCESS IN manufacturing, as in most walks of life, is based on decision-making. But correct decisions can only be taken if employees are in full possession of information. If those employees can be 'empowered' with the information, the chances of getting the entire production process right, from receiving components from suppliers to sending high-quality finished products to customers on time, is increased. This is the thinking behind an enterprise-wide IT strategy at Ford Electronics Division in Cadiz, Spain, which is part of a worldwide division providing components for Ford Motor, its parent company and other customers. The plant was opened three years ago, but in developing its IT strategy managers took the unusual step of involving potential users in assessing what their present and future needs would be - rather than simply leaving everything to be decided and implemented by a systems department. What has emerged is something that is still very rare in manufacturing - and, until recently, frustratingly hard to achieve, especially for those who believed everything their IT vendors were telling them in the mid-1980s. The plant uses an IT system that integrates every element of the manufacturing, warehouse, finance, business, plant management and personnel. All employees have access to on-line real-time information. Every piece of hardware - whether it be a personal computer, printer of fax machine - and every application is linked via voice or data networks and all information is provided to the user with a 'graphical user interface'. The core of the system is a relational database supplied by Oracle, the California-based company which is among the world's top three software suppliers. Employees share common information which they use in different ways, but most importantly they can access the information in the form they require. The problem with many traditional database systems is that they are 'data-rich but information poor,' according to Mr Chris Stephenson, manufacturing applications manager at Oracle UK. The Oracle system works as if the user is picking up a bucket of data and putting it into his bucket, for example a PC, after which he can do what he likes with it. As the Cadiz plant is part of a worldwide corporation, its system is linked to Ford Electronics Division's database and information is downloaded and uploaded as required. Most of the data, though, is generated on the plant floor and the key is to be able to get hold of it quickly and flexibly. For example, all incoming components from suppliers are barcoded, and the information is downloaded into the database. The system can be programmed to alert operators if a part needs to be checked or if it can proceed to the next stage. The progress of the component through the plant can be traced so that, if the ultimate customer complains about the finished product, all the information on the original suppliers is maintained in the database. The availability of real-time information allows an operator - working, perhaps, on the night-shift when there are no computer engineers around - to assess what to do if a part is in short supply. The database will tell him whether the part is in, and whether it has been allocated to a department that does not need it urgently. High-quality information on production bottlenecks can be made instantaneously available, and data, for example on the top five problems on the plant floor, readily obtained - even down to the performance of individual robots. All this represents 'tangible business savings,' says Mr Madjid Homayounfal, information systems manager at Ford Electronics' Enfield plant in the UK, where planning for the installation of a similar system has been completed. Although the system at Cadiz is in effect one database, it is in reality a series of integrated applications. The data from the shopfloor is supported by the Oracle Manufacturing software, then there is Oracle Financial for the accountants and Oracle Personnel. Consequently, 'soft issues' such as training and employees' skills are captured on computer in much the same way as the 'nitty-gritty' data from the production process. A supervisor wanting to know what skills are available from his work group for a particular project can call them up quickly from the database without having to wait for a personnel department to provide it. This is what is meant by empowerment, although it is clearly an area where companies have to be diplomatic, says Mr Homayounfal. But worries about such databases can be allayed by making employees feel part of the whole process, which could be used to track people's education and training achievements. Ford is not saying how much money it will save from the Cadiz database but is clearly impressed by the business benefits, in terms of both time and money saved. The benefits of such a database could multiply if installed across several plants in a global business. It would be relatively simple to produce, in a matter of minutes, a list of the five most common production or quality problems around the group. Consequently, big customers such as Ford are very important for Oracle, which had sales of Dollars 1.5bn last year and manufacturing customers ranging from Asea Brown Boveri to Beijing No 1 Machine Tool Plant. But the attitude of companies towards making such an investment are pretty hard-nosed. 'The typical payback would be 12-18 months,' says Mr Stephenson, because 'things change so fast.' No company could commit itself to a database that took five years to pay for itself in the current business environment. This underlines why even the biggest companies are going for off-the-shelf packages such as Oracle's, which can be adapted to suit most companies' needs without changing the core software.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Inge Guenther: "`Now We'll Have To Fight Our Way </F> Through Here on Foot'"]    [Text] The men are all doing their best. The driver at the  steering wheel, keeping a look-out to all sides; the bodyguard  near the street map, his eyes fixed onto the center of  Strassfurth. Except that it is not all that easy to get around  in the heart of the old salt town in the Harz thanks to numerous  one-way streets and detours. Given such an inconvenient  situation, protocol is reduced to naught and improvisation is  everything. "Mr. Minister-President, now we will have to fight  our way through here on foot!" The employee's index finger  outlines the linear distance.    At the other end of the market place the Infomobile of the  Saxony-Anhalt government is in readiness with coffee, cake, and  various printed material for information-starved citizens and a  head of government who, in turn, will be agreeable to  discussions. A sea of vending booths is taking up space in  between, surrounded by a throng of people looking for bargains.  First you have to work your way through this crowd. The  minister-president accomplishes this with the ease of a  housewife used to shopping here every week. An elderly gentleman  greets somewhat hesitantly, most do not recognize the man in the  grey-green smock at all. Christoph Bergner, his hair always  slightly out of place, his smile more timid than beaming, does  not fit the general image of a Christian-Democratic head of  government.    And personally that suits him fine. It is "difficult" at  times, he has been known to confide to journalists, "to be  constantly in the public eye" and to be exposed to "people's  expectation to say something extraordinary." A facet of a  politician's life that to him represents the "actual stress of  his office." From a political standpoint this cannot suit him.  On the scale of known eastern German heads of government,  Bergner brings up the rear. His minimal time in office--six  months from his appointment in December of last year until the  new elections on 26 June--is not even enough time to build up a  presentable foundation of popularity. Also, following numerous  affairs and the fall of no less than two party-supplied  minister-presidents in but one legislative period (Gerd Gies  because of MfS [former GDR] Ministry of State Security,  nicknamed Stasi] intrigues and Werner Muench because of salary  augmentation) the CDU (Christian Democratic Union) government  party in Saxony-Anhalt is politically bankrupt. From 39 percent  of votes in 1990 down to a mere 20 percent according to polls,  such figures illustrate the shrinkage process. It is nice to  know that someone like Christoph Bergner still feels a "general  liking" for a condition according to which "political offices  are not forever."    And so he is a modest man, "his feet planted firmly on the  ground," and he seems to have integrity. He takes the train  every day from his hometown Halle to the land capital and feels  it is all right though strenuous that "there is a group of  commuters," all the way to the land DGB (German Trade Union  Federation) boss or the superintendent, who for the brief  discussion of their concerns prefer the train route to official  channels.    Bergner considers privileges rather a nuisance. He never  wanted to be anything special, not even in the GDR which,  according to self-assessment, he "tolerated patiently but  without self-exposure." One of his most significant insights  from that time: "Anyone who wishes to remain blameless in this  system must be prepared to abandon a career." Bergner found his  niche as employee at the Halle institute of biochemistry for  plants. Keeping quiet like that can also generate depressions.  Bergner talks about these in his autobiography, identifying them  as the motive for signing the "New Forum's" call for  organization, still prohibited in 1989. "This was not a  calculated political action but rather a desperate act."  Nevertheless one "that ultimately led me into the landtag."    Once there, Bergner soon became CDU caucus boss and thus the  antagonist of Reinhard Hoeppner who is at the helm of the Social  Democrats in the landtag. Competing with one another has  therefore been familiar to them for quite some time. And when  Bergner comments that a "personified election campaign is  absolutely not to his liking" this is not based on a lack of ego  but on the fact that Hoeppner is almost something like his alter  ego. In other words: Viewed from a certain distance the  political as well as exterior contours of the two opponents do  not provide much of a difference. A difficult choice for the  average person from Saxony-Anhalt who is really only desiring  decent conditions in Magdeburg and secure jobs.    It would have been different with the heavyweight western  import Werner Muench: Hoeppner as "David" against "big boss  Goliath." One who knows the little people against one whom they  did not like that much but who in their opinion knows the  important people in Bonn. The land, which seems somewhat  arbitrarily patched together from the poor Altmark in the north,  part of the Harz, the chemical triangle of Buna, Leuna,  Bitterfeld, the Magdeburger Boerde (a fertile plain), and the  outskirts of Wittenberg, not only lacks money but also identity  and self-worth. Only "a local" can convey this.    At the time, Christian Democrat Bergner was justified in  "recognizing with a certain concern" that Muench represented a  "dream opponent" for Social Democrat Hoeppner. Not surprisingly,  his predecessor toppled over the salary affair "because the  emotional sounding board was present"--within the citizenry and  within the party. What a blessing in disguise: With Christoph  Bergner as the new top man the CDU, coming out of its free fall,  at least reached solid ground. Once there and asked what  distinguishes him from Hoeppner, Bergner can only think of this  response: "We are both very much representatives of our  parties," in so far there are "admittedly some differences where  the programs are concerned." Exaggerating this means: In  Saxony-Anhalt the minister-president copies the image of his  challenger. Therefore one's own political lines are not so much  evident in the respective personality but instead in the tangle  of relationships with party friends. A dilemma for Bergner: His  attempt to embody the moral new beginning has very narrow  bounds. Given that at the same time he advocates the  continuation of the spent conservative-liberal coalition of  Magdeburg. "Continuity" was the political "slogan" he announced  in the government declaration in January. There is not much else  he can do within the short time but to promote the half-finished  bills of the Muench cabinet, pass the budget, and keep the  rather elaborate government operation running.    The 46-year-old family man actually gives the appearance of  being indulgent in this task. For example, only after the  persistent appeal of his finance minister did he agree to  reclaim the excess salaries paid to the fired ministers. Bergner  still feels a certain loyalty toward his predecessor, Muench,  and the need for a "fair portrayal of his performance." This is  also how he justifies that no less than three days before his  fall he was still supporting Muench. "As caucus chairman, I  could not bring myself to demand his resignation."    He preferred to bear the consequences from the salary affair  himself--a distinctly protestant characteristic. His  announcement that he did not want to earn more money as  minister-president than as head of the opposition was meant  sincerely though naive given the situation of the law. It is  said that he now reduces his salary through regular donations.  And in spite of this sensitivity for the emotionally charged  subject Bergner appears convinced "that the salary affair was  not all that far-reaching." During his travels through the  country he found "that it really does not echo at all."    Anyway, the high school students, with whom he has  discussions this morning in Halberstadt, are more interested in  the subject of unemployment, criminality, and the "power" of the  media. "There is no dirty business in this country that has any  chance of remaining undiscovered," Bergner declares as if he  owed a certain recognition to an opponent. This is followed  promptly by his "but." "Politicians must confront elections, yet  in Hamburg's editorial chambers there is no control mechanism."  He is saying what he thinks. He talks about "folk play actors,"  as politicians are being portrayed in television, and about the  "cold sweat" into which he himself still breaks out in front of  a camera. He admits freely that when asked about youth policies  he "waffled a bit." And they like him. An honest soul, as if he  had no other choice--"in the time remaining when at least I  still have responsibility."</p>

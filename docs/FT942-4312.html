			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Arts: Soul-paring style - Nigel Andrews talks to the Polish film director Krzysztof Kieslowski The biggest shock at last month's Cannes festival, apart from the film that won the main prize, Pulp Fiction, was the film that won no prize at all. Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours Red, the critics' favourite, was passed over by the ruthless Clint Eastwood Gang - aka the Cannes jury - thus robbing the Polish-born director of the 'grand slam' that seemed his for the taking after earlier prizes for Blue (Venice) and White (Berlin). It was at Berlin, just before he won his Best Director Silver Bear, that he and I met and talked amid an earlier hail of Kieslowski headlines. Had he really decided to stop making films, I ask, through an interpreter. 'I hope. Yes.' But you are the most acclaimed film-maker in Europe? 'Maybe it's the best moment because of that.' What will you do instead? 'Nothing special.' It is like talking to Leonardo da Vinci as he fondles an early pair of retirement slippers. Kieslowski's films have been the glory - it often seems the sole glory - of European cinema since the mid-1980s. When A Short Film About Killing premiered in Cannes in 1988, this literally tiny feature (70-something minutes) raised scalp hairs across the entire town. The poetry of nightmare - a vicious murder, a more vicious execution, a series of cityscapes shot in bilious-yellow or acid-blue filters - was joined to a forlorn, ironic compassion. Later works - A Short Film About Love, The Double Life Of Veronique - took that soul-paring style and added bits of comedy and fantasy, even mangy lyricism. But a Kieslowski film is still unmistakable. It is moviedom's answer to Munch's The Scream: a silent yell offered over the death-throes - which some in the director's view foolishly mistake for life-throes - of Europe at the end of the millennium. His latest and threatened last work is his French-co-funded trilogy based on tricouleur themes. As in Decalogue, his TV-commissioned series where each short film was based on one of the ten commandments, Kieslowski likes to fool audiences into expecting neatly tailored thesis movies. But Blue was about the 'liberty' of a woman in shock after the death of her husband and child in a car crash; and White (equality) and Red (fraternity) are wry, lateral reflections on the other great abstracts in the French revolutionary triad. Kieslowski insists that the films are about people anyway, not society or politics: even though White, opening in London today, cocks a snook at the new capitalism in eastern Europe, with its tale of a get-rich Pole using black market scams to lure his estranged French wife to Warsaw, and Red is set in bureaucratic, icy-hearted Switzerland. 'I do not believe in society,' he states. 'Society is composed of millions of individuals and those individuals interest me.' Didn't Mrs Thatcher once say the same thing? 'But for her it had a political dimension. That is the difference. In her mouth it does not make sense at all, because looked at politically and socially of course societies exist.' But not, he implies, for the artist. And for film-makers the advantage of a Europe now collapsing into semi-federalism is that they can ignore such divides as do remain between countries and cultures. Co-production heaven has arrived, and much of Kieslowski's recent work, starting with Veronique, has been made with French actors in French settings in the French language. 'It's practically impossible to understand other countries than your own. But if you are talking about people, that doesn't matter. A human being is not a country. Foreign actors bring something truthful about their country into my film; they carry that truth inside them. So I'm not obliged to smell the air in this other land, because the actors know and breathe it . . .' And in any case the country where this director's films are really set is Kieslowskiland. Like Greeneland it has its own moods, rules and landscapes: though in typical style the director disclaims credit for most of the characterising devices you quote back at him, from his use of filters to his way with recurring symbolism. 'The three films using filters (Veronique, Blue, Red) were made by the same director of photography. It was his idea. I just said yes or no.' And the symbolic motifs? Like the old person straining to put a bottle in a street bottle-bank, a vignette that occurs in each of the three trilogy films. Or the almost sinister use of small animals, like the mice in Blue and the fluttering pigeons in White. The bottle bank scene, he says, is about failing powers. 'It's our future. Simply, there will come a day for each of us when we won't be able to push a bottle in]' And the animals? 'We had the idea that in all three films you would see an animal giving birth. We did it with mice in Blue, we wanted to do the same with pigeons in White. But it's difficult to get pigeons to nest their eggs in February. So to get something similar, we had the idea of this 'fluttering' motif. You make certain associations with it.' Kieslowski prefers to let his audience construe the scenes. He does not believe in a single definitive interpretation of a film; he does not even believe in a single definitive version of any film. Having already played with flexiform movies in A Short Film About Killing and A Short Film About Love, each made with two separate running times, one for cinemas, one for TV, what he would next like is for films to be shaped differently for every different screening venue. 'If you're in a big cinema you're sitting in a comfortable chair and the place is full of people. It becomes a totally different film from the same one you'll see in a little village hall with poor screening: the image will be dark, the sound not perfect, you'll be almost alone. Same reels, different film] Because a movie acts in contact with you. Are you in a good mood or bad? Are you crossing the Atlantic? Why not introduce those differences, or respond to the possibility of them, within the film itself?' I am fascinated. Can he elaborate? No. My time is up. Berlin is a busy place, especially for a famous abdicating film-maker.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the 10-percent statistical standard in the revegetation rules does not directly apply to husbandry practices, the proposed limiting of reseeding or spot seeding to 10 percent is reasonable. However, the Director finds that some additional limits must apply. For example, normal husbandry practices do not include large barren blocks of the reclaimed area. On the contrary, large blocks of barren areas (such as a block representing 10 percent of the applicable area) would indicate failed reclamation, not successful revegetation. Additionally, in revegetated areas which pass the established 90-percent standard bare or poorly revegetated areas are likely to be scattered about the applicable area, and not large blocks of barren land. Again, large blocks of barren areas would indicate failed reclamation. Consequently, the reseeding of such large blocks of barren areas representing failed reclamation would be augmentative seeding and would necessitate the restarting of the period of responsibility for reclamation success and bond liability. In addition, the reestablished vegetation must be in place for a sufficient length of time so as not to adversely affect Virginia's ability to make a valid determination at the time of bond release of the success of the reclamation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the special case of the repair of rills and gullies as part of a forestry postmining land use, the administrative record contains a September 27, 1990, letter from the Virginia Department of Forestry. In that letter, the Regional Forester states that rills and gullies need not be repaired ``as a part of typical forest management unless the magnitude of the gully would interfere with the land use (of forestry).'' The letter goes on to say that rills and gullies often occur naturally in the steep slope areas of the Appalachian Region. OSM agrees that the repair of occasional and minor rills and gullies where proper grading and erosion management is practiced could be considered part of normal forestry management practice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Virginia clarified its interpretation of the degree of allowable repair of rills and gullies. Since erosion is a natural phenomenon, the repair of minor rills and gullies is not viewed by the Virginia program as a violation, nor does it require restarting of the bonding clock. However, the State added, the Virginia program considers erosion that repeatedly creates rills and gullies over a large area as a violation of at least one performance standard and potentially a violation of several standards. When the permittee fails to comply with the Virginia performance standards and rills and gullies repeatedly develop over a large area, Virginia will require restarting of the responsibility period. Virginia has demonstrated, and the Director finds through this amendment, and Virginia's clarifications and administrative record information, that in the State of Virginia, certain specified instances of rill and gully repair associated with land used for Forestry, Commercial forestry, Commercial, industrial, residential, or recreational, and Hayland/pasture will be considered a normal husbandry practice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Virginia also clarified that the husbandry practices for areas designed to enhance fish and wildlife will be consistent with the practices set forth for unmanaged forestry. The Director finds this to be reasonable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Virginia stated that since the Virginia coalfields are primarily located on steep slopes, there has been no incident where cropland, other than hay, has been developed on the postmining land use. Consequently, Virginia has not developed nor proposes any husbandry practice for such croplands. Should the Virginia coalfields expand or crop production become a viable option, the State will develop husbandry practices relevant to those crops and submit them to OSM for approval. Such practices will not be permitted by the State until approved by OSM. The Director concurs with the understanding that the State will submit any new husbandry practices to OSM for approval prior to their being permitted in Virginia. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

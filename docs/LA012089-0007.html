			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN NAMES BORK TO PANEL ON JUDICIARY  </P> <P> President Reagan, who failed in an attempt to name Robert H. Bork to the  Supreme Court, appointed him Thursday to a group overseeing a history of the  nation's highest judicial tribunal.  </P> <P> One day before leaving office, Reagan announced the appointment of the former  appeals court judge and solicitor general as a member of the Permanent  Committee for the Oliver Wendell Holmes Devise.  </P> <P> The Devise is a congressionally authorized work on the history of the Supreme  Court, based in part on the papers of Justice Holmes.  </P> <P> In an action that Reagan has described as one of the most bitter  disappointments of his presidency, the Senate on Oct. 23, 1987, rejected his  nomination of Bork to succeed Justice Lewis F. Powell on the Supreme Court.  </P></p>

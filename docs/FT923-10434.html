			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / People: Rank fills a gap The death of Sir Patrick Meaney this month ended one of the best-known partnerships at the top of British business. Hence Rank Organisation is not going to be hurried into finding a long-term replacement for Sir Patrick, who had been chairman since 1983. Rank announced yesterday that Sir Leslie Fletcher (above), who has been a non-executive director since 1984, has been appointed chairman. However, since Rank's non-executive directors normally retire on reaching the age of 70, and Sir Leslie is less than three months away from his 70th birthday, the assumption is that he will only be doing the job temporarily, Sir Leslie, a chartered accountant who went into merchant banking with Helbert Wagg &amp; Co, is a well known industrialist. He was chairman of Glynwed International between 1971 and 1986, and is currently chairman of Westland and deputy chairman of RMC Group. Rank's chief executive Michael Gifford, who along with Sir Patrick, is credited with revitalising a group which had lost its way in the early 1980's, dismissed suggestions yesterday that he might accept the chairmanship. He said that it was not appropriate to combine the jobs of chairman and chief executive and he thought it was very difficult to bring in a new chief executive if the chairman had been doing the job before. Gifford said that Sir Leslie had 'been around and done it all'.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the above findings, the Director approves, with three exceptions, North Dakota's proposed amendment as submitted on April 21, 1993, and revised on December 3, 1993. As discussed in: Finding No. 1, North Dakota's proposed statutory revisions to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;21(5) regarding permit approval or denial standards; Finding No. 2, the proposed statutory revisions to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e) regarding preblasting survey criteria; Finding No. 3(a), the proposed statutory revisions to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2) regarding the probable total annual coal production and testing costs, as it applies to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(b), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(a) regarding probable hydrologic consequences and engineering designs, as they apply to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(c), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(b) regarding the development of cross sections, maps, and plans, as it applies to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(d), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(c) regarding geologic drilling and a statement of the results of test borings and core samplings, as it applies to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(e), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(d) regarding cultural resource information, as it applies to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(f), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(e) regarding the payment of costs for preblasting surveys, as it applies to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(g), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(f) regarding fish and wildlife habitat enhancement plans, as it applies to the North Dakota SOAP program; Finding No. 3(h), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(3) regarding North Dakota's discretionary authority to provide or assume training costs for small operators; Finding No. 3(i), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(4) regarding the requirements for small operator reimbursement to North Dakota for the cost of permit application materials and training; Finding No. 3(j), newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5) regarding the prohibition of assistance to small operations not subject to payment of AML fees; Finding No. 4(a), the proposed definition of ``road'' at newly-created NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6), the clarifying terminology proposed at revised NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;20.3(c)(2), and removal of the required program amendment at 30 CFR 934.16(1); Finding No. 4(b), the proposed statutory revision to NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;04(1)(a) regarding the Commission's authority to require a reasonable bond amount sufficient to ensure the reclamation of roads used in coal exploration; Finding No. 4(c)(1), newly-proposed NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05, to the extent that it specifically addresses the circumstances under which a corporate director, officer or agent may be individually subject to criminal penalties in connection with a violation committee by a corporate permittee; and finally, as discussed in Finding No. 4(c)(2), North Dakota's newly-proposed standards for civil and criminal penalties, which use the proposed definitions of the terms ``knowingly,'' ``willfully,'' and ``negligently,'' as set forth in North Dakota's Criminal Code at 12.1&hyph;02&hyph;02 and incorporated at NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05, as part of North Dakota's coal exploration program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, as discussed in Finding Nos. 4 (c)(1) and (c)(3), the Director is not approving the proposed statutory revisions to NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;08 and is requiring North Dakota to amend its program to (1) specifically address the circumstances under which a corporate director, officer, or agent may be individually subject to either civil or criminal penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate permittee; and (2) require that, in addition to violations, failure or refusal to comply with orders, as listed in section 518(f) of SMCRA and issued by the North Dakota Industrial Commission, serves as an additional basis for imposing individual civil and criminal penalties upon corporate officers, directors, and agents. The required program amendment placed on North Dakota's program at 30 CFR 934.16(y) will be modified to reflect this decision. In addition, as discussed in Finding No. 4(c)(1), the Director is requiring North Dakota to further amend NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;05 to specifically address the circumstances under which a corporate director, officer or agent may be individually subject to civil penalties in connection with a violation committed by a corporate permittee. Except as noted, the Director is approving these proposed rules with the provision that they be fully promulgated in identical form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(f)(1), the Director is also taking this opportunity to clarify in the required amendment section at 30 CFR 934.16 that, within 60 days of the publishing of this notice, North Dakota would have to either submit a proposed written amendment, or a description of an amendment to be proposed that meets the requirements of SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII and a timetable for enactment that is consistent with North Dakota's established administrative or legislative procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 934, which codify decisions concerning the North Dakota program, are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effect of Director's Decision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

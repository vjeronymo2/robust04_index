Already in the years of the  developing New Economic Plan the rights to their inventions were  actually taken away, patents being replaced by Author's  Certificates, which to a full measure only the state could use  at its pleasure.    However, the collapse of socialism, marked by the breakup of  the union, only increased their concerns. The new patent  legislation adopted at that time was inefficacious, and  beginning on 1 December 1991 Gospatent SSSR ceased to exist.    The unified patent space was destroyed and the vacuum  created  in the system for the protection of industrial property, it goes  without saying, could not go on for long. It then seemed most  logical to establish national patent offices in the forming  independent states. However, this logic was dictated primarily  by considerations of a political nature. It was clear from the  very beginning to the professionals working in the field of  patent expertise, however, that neither they nor inventors would  come out well with such a shape of things. First of all, what  naturally happened was that all the specialists and patent  archives were concentrated in Moscow. In the overwhelming  majority of the new states there was no one to establish their  own patent offices and it was known that the protection  documents issued by them could make no pretense at authority.    Second, the disintegration of patenting activity put before  inventors a task that was not easy solved: in each former  republic of the union the application had to be submitted in the  national language and the same applied to correspondence with  the expert. It is easy to imagine that all this entails  considerable costs, to which corresponding fees also must be  added.    Third, foreign applicants found themselves in a completely  improbable situation: for protection of their rights over 1/6  the surface of the planet, instead of one patent, they had to  finalize 15, as already mentioned, not characterized by a solid  reputation.    In this very uncomfortable situation it was Rospatent,  perhaps, which felt itself on the surest ground. It was the  successor of the corresponding union structure, also inheriting  from it both the personnel and archives. This circumstance, as  well as the fact that most of the inventive potential is  concentrated precisely in Russia, enabled the directors of this  office to nourish hopes that it would be able to survive the  crisis with minimum losses. In fact everything proved to be  considerably worse. Whereas earlier the All-Union Institute of  State Patent Expertise had annually received up to 200 thousand  applications for inventions alone and among these more than  65%  were those of Russian inventors, now the number of applications  has fallen to 50 thousand. In Russia patenting activity is now  experiencing an unprecedented decline, specialists and experts  are threatened with cutbacks and unemployment, and all this is  occurring at a time when patent legislation in the country for  the first time has possibly approached the level of the best  world models.    It cannot be said that the organizers of the patent service  have not attempted to get around the stumbling blocks and  restore a unified patent space. Already on 27 December 1991  representatives of Armenia, Belorussia, Moldavia, Russia,  Tajikistan and the Ukraine signed in Minsk an interim agreement  on the protection of industrial property. This act was then  regarded as a step toward the adoption of an Intergovernmental  Patent Convention. In order for it to enter into force it was  necessary that three of the states signing it meet three  conditions: recognize validity in its territory of the  norm-setting basis of the agreement, recognize the validity of  the earlier issued protective documents of the USSR and send a  representative and his deputy to an administrative council. The  only state conforming to all this was the Ukraine. However,  separatist strivings then seemed more attractive to the others,  including Russia.    Fortunately, the idea of intergovernmental cooperation for  the protection of industrial property, whose viability has been  beautifully demonstrated by the European Patent Office, was not  buried even in the territory of the former USSR. In March 1993  in Moscow there was a conference of CIS heads of state at which  an agreement was signed on measures for protecting industrial  property and the organization of an intergovernmental council.  Its first session was held in May and in September the draft of  a patent convention was prepared which was called the Eurasian  Patent Convention. This document was given high marks by the  World Organization of Intellectual Property and it is expected  that in late December-early January its finalized variant will  be presented for signature by the heads of state. In the opinion  of Viktor Blinnikov, chairman of the International Bureau for  the Protection of Industrial Property, there are already real  chances for restoring a unified patent space within a year. The  Eurasian Patent Office will become the second major regional  association and already on the eve of its birth it is attracting  the interest not only of the former members of the union, but  also neighbors, members of the former Council for Mutual  Economic Assistance. The interest of China, where, in contrast  to Russia, there has been no dropoff of inventive activity, also  is of special importance.    In principle any interested country can become a member of  this pool and no membership dues are required from it, but the  activity of the Eurasian Patent Office will be on a  pay-for-itself basis. Although the new structure will become an  exclusively international organization--the specialists will  even have diplomatic status--its organization will bring more  than a little moral and material profit to Russia. The  headquarters will be in Moscow, all documentation will be in the  Russian language, but for conducting a patent search the  services of Rospatent specialists will be drawn upon and its  archives will be used. According to Viktor Blinnikov, all these  services will be suitably paid for, which possibly will assist  Russian patent specialists to survive difficult times, and the  appearance of a universal patent will stimulate both national  and foreign inventors. It goes without saying, if both of these  groups hold out another year and the project is successfully  implemented.</p>

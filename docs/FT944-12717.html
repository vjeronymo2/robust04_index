			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Market waits for US employment data - Currencies Foreign exchanges will be focusing on the US and UK central banks this week, with the possibility that interest rates may rise in both countries. Inflationary pressures are an issue on either side of the Atlantic, though the problem, at least from the point of view of financial markets, is much more pressing in the US. Sterling has recently been stronger, following a rate rise last month, while the market believes that nothing short of a large rise in US rates can rescue the dollar from its current plight. The dollar is likely to trade in a fairly narrow range this week, ahead of Friday's release of the October employment report. The third quarter GDP figure, released last Friday, and showing output up by 3.4 per cent, did not dispel the market's inflation concerns. Traders will thus shift their attention to the labour market for signs of inflation. In recent months, dollar weakness has been closely tied up with investor fears that the US Federal Reserve has been too slow in combating inflation. The market consensus is that a turn-round in the dollar's trend is unlikely until the Fed's monetary tightening process appears complete. In the short term, however, there is some evidence that the dollar may have bottomed. Mr Brian Marber, chartist, said there had been a weekly reversal in the dollar's price movement. Accordingly, though he stood by his prediction of a longer term fall to DM1.3910, he thought the dollar could stabilise at current levels for a number of weeks. Higher UK rates are less likely in the short term, though some economists, such as Morgan Grenfell, believe that a 25 basis point rise in rates will be authorised at Wednesday's monthly monetary meeting. Their argument is based on above trend economic growth, and the CBI's October survey showing strong price and cost pressures. Against this is the fact that Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, has recently gone to some lengths to stress that he feels the market's fears about inflation are exaggerated. Last week he said that there were 'relatively few signs that inflation is about to pick up strongly.' A rise in rates against this backdrop would be surprising. Even without a rate rise, most analysts believe sterling to be well supported at current levels. In Europe, the Nordic currencies are likely to continue trading actively in the run-up to the Swedish referendum, on November 13, on joining the European Union. The Swedish krona and the Finnish markka have both recently been strong.</p>

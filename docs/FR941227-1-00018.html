			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), it is hereby certified that the amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and, as a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The collection of information in these proposed amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 is contained in revised Items 5 and 17 of the form. Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 is required to be submitted by associated persons of financial institutions that are government securities brokers and dealers, in accordance with &sect;&sect;400.4 and 449.3. The collection of information is intended to give the financial institutions and the appropriate regulatory authorities of the financial institutions a more complete and meaningful description of the disciplinary history of the associated person. The rule applies only to associated persons of financial institutions that are not exempt from filing notice as government securities brokers and dealers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Department is proposing to add a new paragraph to an existing question and modify several other questions on Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4, and cannot be certain as to the exact impact on associated persons completing the form, it does believe that the changes will not have more than a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  effect on the amount of time necessary to complete the form. The Department's most recent Paperwork Reduction Act Filing with respect to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 shows an annual estimate of 800 respondents filing once per year, with a burden of two hours per respondent. No modification is projected to the reporting burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) requires that collections of information prescribed in proposed rules be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval. Since these proposed amendments result in no increase in burden hours to complete Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 and more importantly do not represent any program change, the submission described in the Paperwork Reduction Act is inapplicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 17 CFR Part 449  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Banks, Banking, Brokers, Government securities, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set out in the preamble, it is proposed to amend 17 CFR part 449 as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 449_FORMS, SECTION 15C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

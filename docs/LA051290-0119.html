			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VSI, 2 EX-EMPLOYEES PLEAD GUILTY TO FALSIFYING REPORTS  </P> <P> VSI Corp. of Culver City pleaded guilty Friday in U.S. District Court in  Seattle to four counts of falsifying and omitting test results for fasteners  used in commercial and military aircraft, and will pay $18 million in damages,  fines, civil penalties and costs of prosecution.  </P> <P> Two former VSI employees also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to  defraud the government. James E. Ryan, former quality assurance manager at  VSI's Voi-Shan plant in Chatsworth, and Aram Marderian, a former Voi-Shan  metallurgical lab supervisor, face prison sentences of up to five years and  $250,000 in fines.  </P> <P> The case was the biggest ever initiated under the federal whistle-blower  statute.  </P> <P> Ryan and Marderian also agreed to cooperate with federal authorities in an  ongoing investigation of Voi-Shan "that involves other possible employees,"  U.S. Atty. Mike McKay said in a telephone interview Friday.  </P> <P> VSI, a subsidiary of Fairchild Industries Inc. of Chantilly, Va., is the  largest supplier of the nuts and bolts that hold aircraft engines and other  components in place. Its customers include the U.S. military, Boeing, McDonnell  Douglas, Lockheed, General Electric, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Northrop.  </P> <P> In pleading guilty, VSI admitted to one count of conspiracy and three counts of  mail fraud. As part of the resolution of the criminal charges, it will pay the  government $2.5 million in fines and $1 million in investigation costs.  </P> <P> The $14.5-million civil settlement was a record amount for suits filed under  the False Claims Act, which allows individuals to sue on behalf of the  government and to share in any recovery of damages.  </P> <P> The criminal charges, filed by federal prosecutors in Seattle Wednesday, grew  out of a civil suit that three former Voi-Shan employees filed in 1988. McKay  said the government's investigation uncovered a 15-year scheme to skip required  tests and falsify test results. The falsified tests were recorded as having  been approved by a fictitious "Inspector No. 11."  </P> <P> "There is no evidence that any airline tragedy resulted from bad bolts or  fasteners from Voi-Shan," said McKay. "But it sure could have happened."  </P> <P> Donald Parker, Fairchild's general counsel, said the problems at Voi-Shan,  which accounts for as much as $50 million of VSI's $150 million in annual  sales, have been corrected.  </P> <P> "There will be no further shortcuts," Parker said, adding that Voi-Shan would  "cooperate fully" with the government's investigation.  </P> <P> McKay said the whistle-blowers -- former Voi-Shan employees Tom Runion, Gary  Heywood and Paul Hertog -- will receive at least $2.175 million of the $14.5  million civil settlement. The exact amount will be determined by a federal  judge in Los Angeles, where the civil suit was filed and kept under seal until  Friday.  </P> <P> However, Will Ramsey, an attorney representing Runion, Heywood and Hertog, said  he will object to the settlement and seek a higher figure.  </P></p>

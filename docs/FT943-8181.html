			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Recovery in road transport leads Nedlloyd turnround Nedlloyd, the Dutch shipping and road-haulage group, swung into a net profit of Fl 25m (Dollars 14.3m) in the second quarter of 1994 from losses of Fl 30m a year earlier. The improved results take first-half net profit to Fl 35m, a reversal of the Fl 116m loss posted in the first six months of 1993. Nedlloyd said European road haulage, which until now had lagged behind the steady improvement in ocean shipping, had seen a 'substantial recovery' in the first half of 1994. In the second quarter, the sector posted a Fl 11m operating profit in the quarter, compared with a loss of Fl 4m a year earlier. Ocean shipping extended the higher trend that first emerged in mid-1993, with operating results swinging into a profit of Fl 35m from a loss of Fl 5m in the 1993 quarter. Group turnover in the quarter edged ahead to Fl 1.61bn from Fl 1.59bn. The figures were at the lower end of analysts' expectations, however, and Nedlloyd's shares fell by 9 per cent to close down Fl 6.40 at Fl 64.60. The results were partly weighed down by the group's Neddrill operations, which are suffering from a downturn in the offshore sector. The 'miscellaneous sector', of which Neddrill is the main component, broke even in the second quarter after contributing Fl 4m towards group profit in the same period of 1993. For the rest of the year, Nedlloyd is cautiously optimistic about its road haulage business, while for shipping it expects a continued rise in cargo volumes, in line with the growth of the market. Cargo rates are expected to remain stable in the second half. Nedlloyd said that if the dollar remained at current weak levels, second-half results would be 'adversely affected' compared with a year earlier, but they will at least match the figures for the 1994 first half.</p>

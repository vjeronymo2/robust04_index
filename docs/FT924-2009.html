			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Time Warner aims to cut borrowings by Dollars 3bn TIME WARNER, the US media and entertainment group, is hoping to reduce its Dollars 9bn borrowings by a third over the next two or three years by either selling assets or issuing asset-backed bonds. Mr Geoffrey Holmes, the Time Warner vice-president who last week told a New York seminar that the company wanted to 'monitise' about Dollars 3bn of assets, said at the weekend that the aim was 'to improve our balance sheet' by converting certain shareholdings into cash generating assets. Mr Holmes specified a series of equity investments 'that are not presently put through our profit and loss account' as being possible candidates for disposal. While stressing that no decisions had been taken, he said that these investments included: A 15 per cent stake - worth about Dollars 125m - in Black Entertainment Television, a cable network. An 11 per cent stake - worth around Dollars 150m - in QVC, the home-shopping cable television network whose most recent investor is Mr Barry Diller, the former chairman of the Fox film and television studio. A 50 per cent stake - worth 'a few hundred million dollars' - in the Six Flags theme park group. A 21 per cent stake - worth about Dollars 1.2bn - in Turner Broadcasting, the Atlanta-based group controlled by Mr Ted Turner. A 37.5 per cent stake - with a book value in Time Warner's accounts of Dollars 175m - in Whittle Communications. Mr Holmes said that Time Warner may not sell all of these assets. In some cases it may issue bonds backed by the assets, as with its current offer of Dollars 500m of zero-coupon convertible bonds backed by Time Warner's 14 per cent stake in Hasbro, the toymaker. He added that Time Warner had 50 per cent of cable television ventures from New York to Florida and Texas with a total of 1.5m subscribers and which generate about Dollars 135m of annual cash flow. Although the value of these cable subscriptions is about Dollars 1.5bn, less Dollars 400m of related debt, Time Warner might decide to buy out some partners rather than sell its holdings. This would enable the company to place more cash flow in its profit and loss account. The Time Warner executive acknowledged that the company's earlier hopes of lowering its debt level by raising Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn from European and Asian partners had not gone as quickly as had been planned after the 1989 merger of Time and Warner Communications. However, he said more international alliances would be unveiled over the next year.</p>

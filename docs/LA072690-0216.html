			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AST'S RECORD EARNINGS OUTDO WALL STREET FORECAST  </P> <P> Continuing to outperform Wall Street's expectations, AST Research Inc. said  Wednesday that its earnings rose to a record $35.1 million last year on a 17%  increase in revenue.  </P> <P> The Irvine personal computer maker, which celebrated its 10th anniversary in  business Wednesday, said earnings for its fiscal year ended June 30 were $35.1  million. The company lost $7.5 million the previous year.  </P> <P> Revenue rose 17% to $533.8 million, up from $456.5 million a year earlier.  </P> <P> Buoyed by the news, AST's stock jumped $2.25 per share -- a 11% gain -- to  close at $22.625 Wednesday in active over-the-counter trading, with more than  1.9 million shares changing hands.  </P> <P> Securities analysts said the strong performance reflects AST's success in  shifting toward the high end of the personal computer market.  </P> <P> Jay Vleeschhouwer, analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; Co. in New York, said the  company's performance has exceeded Wall Street's expectations for the past four  quarters. He said he expects AST to perform well in the current quarter, which  ends in September.  </P> <P> Benny Lorenzo, an analyst with Volpe, Covington &amp; Welty in San Francisco,  said the company's performance was better than he expected for the fourth  quarter.  </P> <P> "This market has been ruthless for computer companies, but AST stands out  because they just keep rolling along with better earnings," he said.  </P> <P> The company said its sales last year were also driven by strong international  revenue, which accounted for 36% of sales, up from 32% a year earlier.  International sales, which were especially strong in the Far East, accounted  for 39% of total sales in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "The key marketing, product and international expansion strategies adopted  during the year successfully contributed to this record financial performance,"  said Safi U. Qureshey, president and chief executive.  </P> <P> Some other computer makers, such as Advanced Logic Research Inc. in Irvine,  have said their sales have been adversely affected by a shortage of the Intel  Corp. 386SX microchip. But Qureshey said AST has been unaffected by the  shortage because it was able to secure an adequate supply of the chips before  they became scarce.  </P> <P> The company, which also makes expansion board products to boost the performance  of PCs, reported fourth-quarter net income of $15.2 million, a six-fold  increase from $2.5 million in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 23% to a  record $151.8 million.  </P> <P> Analysts noted that the company also took steps to strengthen its balance  sheet.  </P> <P> At year's end, the company had $92.3 million in cash, contrasted with $18.5  million a year ago. Inventories were $73.5 million, compared to $91.6 million a  year ago.  </P> <P> In June, the company redeemed $47.5 million in convertible subordinated debt, a  move that will eliminate more than $4 million in future interest payments.  </P> <P> AST said that during the past year it introduced 12 new computer systems and  three enhancement board products. Qureshey said the company expects to announce  three significant products during the next year.  </P> <P> One of those products will be AST's first portable laptop computer. Another  will be a personal computer that will use multiple processors for faster  calculation of data.  </P> <P> The company also plans to start production in August of a personal computer  specifically designed for the Japanese market.  </P> <P> AST'S PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter ended June 30, AST Research Inc. reported earnings of  $15.2 million as its revenues rose 23% to $151.8 million.  </P> <P> Figures are in thousands, except per share data.  </P> <P> </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:2.00IN:2.00IN:2.11IN:2.11IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 4th Qtr  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 4th Qtr  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 12 Months  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 12 Months  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Revenue  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $151,827  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $123,454  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $533,814  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $456,520  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Net income (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 15,208  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,482  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 35,067  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> (7,469)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Per share  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1.18  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $0.21  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2.86  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $0.64  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: AST Research Inc.  </P></p>

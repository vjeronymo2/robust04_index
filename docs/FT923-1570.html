			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Advance checked as optimism cools A HIGHLY erratic session in UK equities yesterday left share prices drifting lower as investors suspected that their enthusiasm for substantial reductions in domestic interest rates might have been overdone. Lukewarm Maastricht treaty support in France, discouraging comments on interest rate prospects from the Bundesbank president, and the con-tinued slide in sterling all suggested that the two percentage-point cut in UK base rates effectively factored into the UK market last week might have to be postponed. However, it was only the timing of such interest rate cuts which came under scrutiny. Market strategists remained convinced that base rates will come down and that yesterday's fall of 6.9 points to 2,560.1 in the FT-SE Index represented nothing more than mild profit-taking in a stock market which has risen by nearly 10 per cent since the middle of last week and has attracted heavy investment interest from the institutions. The final picture did little justice to a session which saw the Footsie trade through a near 50-point turnround. The day started early, with some marketmakers open for telephone trading at 6.30am, when shares moved up quickly as they reflected an optimistic response to the French Maastricht vote and US buying orders which had been left with brokers overnight, on instructions to 'buy if the French vote yes'. The Footsie is not calculated at that hour but dealers estimated the early gain at around 25 points. Then, at 8.30am, the Seaq electronic system was switched on and the Footsie was immediately pulled back by ex-dividend quotations on 15 per cent of its components, including such big names as Shell Transport, Glaxo and Guinness. UK institutions then took a look at share prices boosted by their US counterparts and decided not to play. Within a few moments, the early gain had been replaced by a fall of 15.1 on the first official cal-culation of the Footsie. Five minutes later, the stock index futures market opened and a strong premium on the December contract on the FT-SE Index, which took over leadership only on Friday, reignited some of the buying frenzy seen in equities last week. Some London analysts believed that comments by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, following the International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington gave some encouragement for the market's base rate hopes. By mid-morning, the Footsie was 44.2 points up. However, suggestions that rates might be cut during the course of yesterday soon faded. The market topped out and traded less aggressively for the rest of the day. Later, refusal by Mr Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, to make any forecast of future interest rate reductions was taken as a signal for profit-taking. Seaq trading volume reached 953.4m shares yesterday, below the 1bn-plus figures recorded last Thursday and Friday. Retail business on Friday was worth Pounds 2.8bn, making a total of Pounds 6.5bn since last Tuesday.</p>

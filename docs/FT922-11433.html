			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Mixed signals This week produced contradictory indicators on the state of the economy and the housing market. Home orders picked up, and a British Chambers of Commerce survey showed substantially increased optimism. But Abbey National's share price endured a turbulent week. The stock had boomed after the election as worries about the housing market eased, but they were revived when Sir Christopher Tugendhat, the company's chairman, told Wednesday's annual general meeting that: 'Arrears and repossessions are at a higher level than expected and this in turn will mean a higher level of provisioning.' However, the 1,400 shareholders present, many of whom were also savers, did hear some good news. Sir Christopher also announced that the company's annual mailing will include 'a special insert giving the rates for all our investment accounts, both current and unavailable. The leaflet directs customer's attention to those which are no longer available'. So, anybody receiving a letter from the Abbey in the next few weeks would be well advised to read it - it might save them from continuing to leave money in a moribund account on a low rate of interest.</p>

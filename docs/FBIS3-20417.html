			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article in two installments by reporter Wang Yuling (3769 </F> 3768 3781): "Output, Sales Forecasts for Machinery Industry in  1994"]  <H5>  [3 Jan p 7] </H5>   [Text] At a recent information-announcement meeting, the  Ministry of Machinery Industry made the following forecast:  After scoring a high growth rate in 1993, the machinery industry  will continue to develop at a fairly quick pace this year with  an estimated 12-15 percent increase in its output value.    Following are the forecasts of the various sectors of this  industry:    Farm machinery sector The general trend in the  farm machinery market this year is that sales will be moderate  or sluggish for most products, while only a few products are  expected to sell briskly. The market for large and medium-sized  tractors will remain approximately the same as last year.  Medium-horsepower wheeled tractors will have only a moderate or  even a sluggish sale due to the restriction on their use as a  transport vehicle plus the fact that part of the market will be  taken over by farm trucks. However, a good market is forecast  for four-wheel-drive tractors. With regard to four-wheeled  tractors and walking tractors, brisk sales are expected for some  models and in some areas, but the general trend in the market  will be downward. As for internal-combustion engines, some  models will enjoy a good sale; others will not. Sales of  single-cylinder diesel engines will fall. Multi-cylinder engines  for motor vehicles, construction machinery, electric generator  sets, and farm trucks will continue to sell well or moderately,  but their sales volumes will not grow as fast as last year. The  market will be stable for powered irrigation and drainage  machinery and for pumps used on farms. Demands for tractor-drawn  farm tools and combines will slide down from last year's level.  The only exception will be small-sized combines drawn by small  four-wheeled tractors, which will enjoy a brisk market because  of their practicality, moderate price, and agility.  Grain-processing and oil-pressing machines will continue to sell  well, and for some models, supply will fall short of demand.  Demands for rice and flour mills and oil presses will increase  by a fairly big margin. Also, there will be a surging  requirement for farm trucks. In particular, four-wheeled farm  trucks with a capacity between 0.75 and 1 ton will be in great  demand. Sales of parts for trucks and internal-combustion  engines, because of their great demand, will maintain a steadily  growing trend. The farm machinery sector will grow by 5 to 6  percent this year.    Construction machinery sector Since the  beginning of last year, the construction machinery sector had  ranked first in production and sales until the third quarter  when a drastic change in the market caused a big drop in the  growth rates of its output and sales. Brand-name products once  in short supply became amply available on the market. Some  non-brand-name products began to be overstocked. In general,  prices have dropped for all kinds of construction machinery.  Nonetheless, as our country's investment policy will focus more  on transportation, energy, and other basic industrial projects,  the construction machinery sector, which serve as a support for  these projects, will still maintain a certain level of growth  this year. In particular, large-sized and brand-name earthmovers  will have a brisk market. The growth rate of the construction  machinery sector this year is estimated at more than 15 percent.    Meter and instrument sector This year a steady  growth is forecast for the production and sales of meters,  instruments, and control equipment required by the energy,  communications, and transportation sectors. Among them,  production and sales of electronic meters and instruments will  show a strong tendency to grow. For those items that can be used  as part of investment in construction projects, such as various  testers and theodolites, the market will change from an active  to a moderate state, and accordingly the growth of their output  will slow down. On the other hand, items in the consumer-goods  and office-equipment categories, such as air conditioners,  copiers, and cameras, are expected to have a good market, and  their production will increase to a relatively big extent. It is  estimated that this sector will grow by more than 15 percent in  1994.    Electric equipment and appliances sector This  sector showed a steady growth in the first half of last year.  Beginning the third quarter, a slight downslide has appeared in  the growth rates of its production and sales. Nonetheless, with  the support given by the state to basic industries and the  implementation of various preferential policies in favor of  these industries, including favorable financial arrangements,  the external environment of basic industrial enterprises will be  gradually improved, and their demand for power generating  equipment is expected to hike. Growing demands are also  foreseeable for power plants' supplementary equipment and for  power transmission and distribution equipment, such as  transformers, switchgear, wires, and cables. This will lead to  an increase in the output of these products. A more than 12  percent growth rate is forecast for the electric equipment and  appliances sector this year.  <H5>  [10 Jan p 7] </H5>   [Text] In addition to the farm machinery, construction  machinery, meters and instruments, and electric equipment and  appliances, the following forecasts for 1994 were revealed at  the information-announcement meeting by the Ministry of  Machinery Industry:    Machine tool sector In the third quarter of last  year, the once-hectic trend in the machine tool market obviously  cooled down, under the influence of the nation's  macro-regulation and control policy. As a result, stockpiles of  unsold products increased sharply, and their prices kept  declining, with the only exception of special-purpose heavy  equipment, which still enjoyed a prosperous market. Production  and sales of general machine tools and numerically-controlled  lathes produced domestically were in a relatively gloomy  situation. Since September, the machine tool market has  improved, however. For example, at Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool  Plant's order-solicitation meeting in early September, the sales  contracts signed for general machine tools were sufficient to  take up the plant's production for the whole year of 1994. It is  expected that the machine tool market for the first half of this  year will be somewhat better than the second half of last year,  and the market trend will be optimistic. The machine tool sector  will have a growth rate of more than 10 percent this year.    Petrochemical and universal-purpose machinery  sector Brand-name refrigerating equipment, air  distributors, and printing machines will continue to enjoy a  good sale this year. Increased demand for static dust removers  will boost the manufacturers' production task. Requirements for  machines, pumps, and valves used in power plants will be  relatively great, and accordingly major manufacturers of these  items will increase their output and sales. Market for  universal-purpose machines, including refrigerators, machines,  pumps, and valves, will remain the same as last year. Production  and sales of oil-refining equipment and chemical plant machinery  will continue to rise steadily, but no improvement is  foreseeable in the market for oil-drilling equipment. This  sector will have a more than 10 percent growth in 1994.    Heavy and mining machinery sector The nation's  investment policy, which puts more emphasis on basic industries,  has boosted the production tasks of manufacturers of  metallurgical and mining machinery, large cast and forged parts,  cranes and other material-handling equipment. Production and  sales of these items will continue to grow this year. According  to a survey by the Heavy Machinery Industry Association, the  orders so far received by major and backbone heavy machinery  enterprises for 1994 have met 60-100 percent of their annual  target. Most other enterprises have received 40-70 percent of  the orders they planned to obtain this year; only a few  enterprises have met 10-20 percent of their order target. In  terms of products, orders for small and medium-sized cranes  account for a very small share, while most orders are for items  required by the basic raw and semifinished materials industry,  the transportation and communications sector, and the electric  power industry. The growth rate of the heavy and mining  machinery sector is estimated at 10-15 percent this year.    Auto sector Since late-June last year, the auto  market has changed from an active to a moderate state because of  the nation's policy to rein in the scale of capital construction  and bank credit and its strict efforts to "control government  office spending." In the third quarter of last year, production  and sales of motor vehicles showed a remarkable decline, while  their stockpiles went up. However, it is believes that the  1.1-million-vehicle target set for last year was fulfilled, and  that the stock was maintained at a level roughly equivalent to  an average month's output.    In making this year's forecast, the following factors  should be taken into consideration: 1) Railway transportation  will remain in a strained condition. The strategy to use  highways as well as railways to share the transportation burden  will keep the demand for heavy- and medium-duty trucks at a  certain level. 2) Development of township enterprises and  tertiary industry will bring about a constant demand for small  and mini-vehicles. 3) There were 8.1-8.2 million vehicles at the  end of last year. About 1 million of them should be junked.  According to this year's plan, an additional 250,000 old  vehicles should be replaced by new ones. 4) Demand for  domestically made sedans will go up in view of the development  of the tourist industry and taxi business plus the needs arising  from Sino-foreign joint ventures and special economic zones and  the nation's determination to strike hard at car smuggling in  coastal areas and to lift the "control on institutional purchase  of vehicles." The production target for this year is 1.3 million  vehicles, of which 350,000 are sedans. A 10 percent growth is  forecasted for the auto sector this year.    Basic accessories and parts sector This sector  serves as a basic support for the machinery industry; however,  for years, it has experienced the following problems: It lacks a  sound foundation and is unable to benefit from specialized and  large-scale production. Its products are not satisfactory in  terms of grade, quality, and reliability. For the above reasons,  this sector has become a "bottleneck" in developing the  machinery industry. For the period from January through October  last year, its gross output value was 14.78 percent higher than  the corresponding period of 1992, but this growth rate was still  below the entire machinery industry's growth rate by nearly 12  percentage points. This year, with the implementation of certain  policies, there will be a decline in the imports of hydraulic  and pneumatic tools, sealing devices, ball bearings, low-voltage  electric equipment, instrument components, and some special  materials. As a result, the basic accessories and parts sector  is expected to grow by about 10 percent this year.</p>

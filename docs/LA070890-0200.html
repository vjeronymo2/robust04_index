			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A VOICE THAT SPANS TWO WORLDS;  </P> <P> CANTOR NATHAN LAM SERVES THE ANCIENT RITUALS OF JUDAISM AND THE DEMANDS OF POP  MUSIC  </P> <P> He has prepared boys for bar mitzvahs, and Beatles for world tours.  </P> <P> He has produced songs for God and the Go-Gos.  </P> <P> He is Nathan Lam, 43, cantor at the Stephen S. Wise Temple in Bel-Air and vocal  instructor for Lionel Ritchie, David Cassidy, David Coverdale, Barry Bostwick  and John Davidson. His life is a nonstop shuttle between two worlds -- the  ancient rituals of Judaism and the modern demands of popular music.  </P> <P> "This is fun," Lam said after a half-hour sesson with actor Dean Jones. "I love  expressing myself in the musical world. And when I'm at the pulpit, that's  spiritual. It's sustenance, like eating."  </P> <P> Lam didn't expect this extra dimension to his cantorial career. How to meet a  Beatle wasn't taught in religion class.  </P> <P> "I'm not usually star-struck," said Lamb, who gave Ringo Starr six weeks of  lessons in 1989 in preparation for his comeback tour, "but I kept thinking,  'He's a Beatle.' And I'm teaching this guy how to sing 'Yellow Submarine'? I  must have heard that album about 90,000 times."  </P> <P> He expected the traditional life of a cantor: bar mitzvahs, weddings, funerals  and Sabbath services, maybe an album or two of Jewish liturgy.  </P> <P> And that's what happened until he officiated at a wedding in 1977. A woman  heard his voice and asked if he taught singing lessons. "I told her to come to  my office, and I'd give it a try," Lam said. "I had never given lessons  before."  </P> <P> Soon, the woman brought her husband, and word of Lam's talent quickly spread.  At the same time, his fascination for voice technique grew. He bought books and  listened to other performers.  </P> <P> His first breakthrough with celebrities came when Barbara Anderson, who played  Eve on the television series "Ironside" in the late 1960s and early 1970s, came  in for a lesson. Anderson had lost her voice, and needed strengthening  exercises to be ready for a speaking role in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"  Anderson's voice gradually improved, and she reported her success to acting  instructor Milton Katselas, who, in turn, passed the tip to his pupils. "I was  soon inundated with calls," Lam said.  </P> <P> His new life began. Soon he was instructing Burt Reynolds, who was about to  star in "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas." Said Lam, "He's a better singer  than people think." Next came Richard Harris, who was appearing in "Camelot."  Harris hired Lam to arrive an hour before each show.  </P> <P> For 13 weeks -- and 99 performances -- Lam came backstage, and made sure Harris  was ready to sing. "I never missed a performance, even when my daughter was  born." he said. He was almost late once when he was stopped by Barbra  Streisand, who required his immediate expert opinion. He told her he would  squeeze her in later that week between visits to Reynolds and Rod Stewart. "She  was working on 'Yentl' then, and wanted to know about the authenticity of  certain Jewish music."  </P> <P> He also gained automatic entry into rock 'n' roll circles usually uncharted by  men of clergy. Lam produced the vocals for the Go-Go's' third album, "Talk  Show," and began teaching Stewart, David Coverdale of Whitesnake, and members  of Poison. Sometimes he'd recognize the absurdity of his double life.  </P> <P> "What am I doing here?" he wondered while on the Poison tour bus between  Oklahoma City and Lexington several years ago. "It was 4 a.m., and I'm playing  Trivial Pursuit with a rock 'n' roll band."  </P> <P> His new life threatened to interfere with the old one. A congregation leader  worried about Lam's commitment; with 2,850 families, Stephen S. Wise is one of  the world's largest synagogues. "I told him that the job will get done."  </P> <P> The congregation's governing board wanted Lam close by, granting him permission  to hold voice lessons in his office. He didn't miss the point.  </P> <P> "The synagogue comes first," Lam said, "and I make sure all my students know  that. If there's any kind of emergency, I'll stop a lesson to do what I have to  do." An emergency might mean final bar mitzvah lessons for a nervous  13-year-old or officiating at a funeral.  </P> <P> The synagogue is where he started. As an 8-year-old boy, he attended Temple  Adat Ari El in North Hollywood every Sabbath service. One day, everything  changed.  </P> <P> "I stood there singing," he said, "and something touched my soul. I was  smitten. Sometimes when I do services now, I'll go back to that sense of awe I  had as an 8-year-old. It helps to inspire me to pray to another level. I have  to find some way to inspire my congregation."  </P> <P> He wasn't a natural. Cantor Allan Michelson, his first instructor, wasn't  overly impressed with the early Lam sound. "The voice wasn't that good,"  Michelson said, "but when he became a teen-ager, I knew he'd become a cantor.  He had passion, and he worked at it. He has a tremendous musical memory."  </P> <P> Throughout adolescence, Lam filled in as cantor at congregations in West Covina  and Highland Park but didn't perceive it as a full-time career. He briefly  gravitated toward law, until realizing his passion -- singing -- could become  his profession. A cantor is responsible for leading his congregation in prayer  before God.  </P> <P> He studied for several years in New York before returning to Los Angeles and  assuming the pulpit at Stephen S. Wise in 1976. Today, he's vice president of  the  </P> <P> Cantor's Assembly, an international organization, and has released five albums  of Jewish music.  </P> <P> "Judaism has given me a sense of empathy for the people I teach," Lam said.  "Everyone who comes to me is a voice that needs to be helped."  </P> <P> Frequently, Lam's students, even the famous ones, have lost confidence in their  singing voices. They don't believe they can reach the notes necessary for the  next concert or musical. Lam must act as therapist, too. "When I know there's  nothing physically wrong with their voices," he said, "I have to find ways of  tricking them into doing things they didn't think they could do. And I'm a  master at that."  </P> <P> His students testify to his healing powers. Marq Torien, lead singer for the  hard-rock group Bulletboys had strained his voice after two years of touring,  screaming on stage and constant drinking. His livelihood was in jeopardy.  </P> <P> "He got my voice back," Torien said. "He showed me how I had wasted so much  energy with my voice, and how to stop doing that. He cares about me."  </P> <P> About 20% of Lam's students come from physicians' referrals. Coverdale was sent  to Lam by a doctor after undergoing surgery in April, 1986, for a deviated  septum. "A vocal coach was completely alien to me," Coverdale said. "I went  more out of desperation."  </P> <P> Like most of Lam's pupils, Coverdale learned exercises designed to strengthen  his chest and lung capacity. Lam teaches his students to position their  diaphragm to move in conjunction with the vocal chords.  </P> <P> "Singing should be an extension of one's speaking voice," Lam said. "If the  vocal chords aren't in their right position, the person sounds hoarse or  breathy."  </P> <P> Until a few years ago, Lam believed everyone held the potential to develop an  excellent singing voice. "But at that time, I hadn't seen some of the clients  I've had since then. Not everyone can sing."  </P> <P> Lam regularly trains more than 100 students, charging $60 for half an hour and  $120 for an hour of instruction. His rate goes up for house calls. "I have no  star rates," he said. "The rate is based on the hours, not the stars."  </P> <P> Each day, Lam is reminded of his travels between the worlds of Jewish  observance and contemporary popular music; from Friday afternoon lessons with  Ritchie, he moves smoothly to Sabbath services with hundreds of congregants.  The trip represents his personal statement.  </P> <P> "I want my kids to see that there was a cantor who they see on Friday, who can  be a religious Jew and be in the synagogue, and they also can see has a foot in  the real world," Lam said."  </P></p>

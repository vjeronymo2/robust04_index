			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Efforts to curb C0 emissions 'lagging' Efforts by the industrialised countries to stabilise their carbon dioxide emissions at present levels will have only a minor effect on the build-up of C0 concentrations in the earth's atmosphere and so on global warming, a leading climate change scientist warned yesterday. Prof Bert Bolin, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said that even to stabilise CO concentrations at twice present levels would require all countries, developed and developing, to cut emissions below 1990 levels. Stabilisation at 1990 levels by the industrialised nations alone, in line with commitments under the United Nations climate change convention, would reduce accumulated emissions over the next century by less than 10 per cent. 'This indicates that current commitments are not sufficient to stabilise atmospheric concentrations,' Prof Bolin said. He was addressing representatives of about 150 governments at the start of a meeting intended to prepare for the first ministerial conference on the climate change treaty in Berlin next spring. One of the main issues the meeting must consider is whether to strengthen the treaty by proposing a new protocol restraining emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Berlin conference proposals for treaty amendments would have to be put forward by the end of September.</p>

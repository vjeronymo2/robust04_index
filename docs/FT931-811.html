			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Take care of that pension - How to make the best use of benefits and avoid the vultures / Redundancy PENSION choices for the redundant are similar to those facing job changers, but with one major difference - the newly-redundant usually have not lined up the next career move. Experts recommend strongly that you leave your benefits where they are and avoid the pension transfer vultures. Stephen Walmesley-Cotham, a senior financial consultant with actuary William M. Mercer, says: 'If you talk to an adviser about investing redundancy money, you may be persuaded to look at transferring your pension benefits at the same time. Don't do so unless you are clear about the future or there is some other over-riding reason for taking an immediate decision.' Nigel Taylor, a partner with actuary Clay &amp; Partners, reports disturbing news about those just made redundant. 'We have had first--hand experience of situations where insurance company salesmen were waiting outside the office door within two hours of a redundancy announcement,' he says. 'We have also seen insurance companies attempt to recruit newly-redundant individuals to sell policies to their colleagues.' Options When you have sorted out your future employment, there are three main options: to leave your pension where it is; to transfer it to a new employer's scheme; or to transfer to an insurance-based product. A fourth option - taking a cash refund of contributions - is available only to employees with less than two years' pensionable service. The refund, which might be compulsory, does not include the employer's contributions. Refunds are subject to two deductions: first, to account for the tax relief that applied to contributions and, second, to cover back payments into the state earnings-related pension scheme if the pension plan was contracted-out. Deferred pension For those with more than two years' service, the simplest (and often the most sensible) option is to leave your benefits with the former company scheme. This is known as a deferred pension because the scheme retains your benefits until you retire. But employees with under five years' service can be forced to transfer out. Deferred pensions can offer several advantages, but much depends on the generosity of the scheme in making payments above the legal minimum. For employees leaving service after 1985, the law requires all deferred pensions to be increased annually in line with retail price inflation (RPI) up to a maximum of 5 per cent. This is known as limited price indexation (LPI). Some schemes make more generous increases, while full RPI is standard in the public sector. Clearly, this is an important point in favour of the deferred option. Other plus points are generous benefits for spouses and dependants. At present, there is no legal requirement to increase pensions apart from the guaranteed minimum pension (gmp) element, which replaces the State Earnings-related Pension Scheme benefit in a company scheme that is contracted-out. Pending legislation will require schemes to increase pensions in payment by LPI from when the regulations are introduced. Transfer to new scheme If your new employer runs a pension scheme, you can take an inter-company transfer. But transfers between company pension schemes are notoriously complex. In a typical 'final salary' scheme, pension benefits build up at one-sixtieth of your final salary for each year of service up to a maximum of 40/60ths, or two-thirds, final salary. (The pensions of some high earners may be restricted further). In an inter-company transfer, the ceding scheme actuary takes the number of 'years' you have built up and calculates the cash equivalent. The receiving scheme actuary then calculates how many 'years' that sum will buy in the new scheme. Often, there is a discrepancy between the number of years in the old and new schemes. This is partly because of the relatively low assumptions used to calculate the cash equivalent, but also because you might be buying better benefits in the new scheme or your pension could be based on a higher salary. If you are concerned about the apparent discrepancy, you could ask an independent actuary to check the figures. Bear in mind that if your transfer leaves you with a gap in provision, it is possible to top-up a company pension with additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) available through the employer's scheme, or with free-standing AVCs available mainly from the life offices. Transfers to insurance products Only when you have assessed the merits of a deferred pension or inter-company transfer should you consider a switch to a buy-out bond or personal pension, both of which are available from the life offices (and, in the case of personal pensions, from a handful of unit trust groups and friendly societies as well). These products operate on a money purchase basis, which means that the contributions or lump sum transfers are invested to build up a fund at maturity. This fund is used to buy an annuity to provide the retirement income. In switching from a final salary to a money purchase pension, you lose important guarantees. In particular, the pension - which, in the case of most company schemes, would have been a guaranteed proportion of your final salary - will now depend on a combination of the investment returns, the insurance company's charges, and the prevailing annuity rates. If you opt for an insurance product, you need expert advice on the type and provider. Buy-out bonds retain the guaranteed minimum pension. Personal pensions offer no minimum guarantees. Under both products, a proportion of the fund can be taken as tax-free cash. The maximum proportion under a personal pension is 25 per cent, whereas up to a third of the buy-out bond can be taken as cash. Walmesley-Cotham says: 'As a general rule, people with a shorter period to run to retirement, and a reasonably long period of pensionable service, may do better with a buy-out bond. Those who are further from retirement, with a shorter period of pensionable service, may do better with a personal pension.' Early retirement Companies that embark on a major redundancy programme may offer a special pension deal for volunteers. The most common perk is early retirement without actuarial reduction of the pension. This can boost the value of the benefits by as much as 20-30 per cent. Care should be taken with the golden handshake. Any excess over Pounds 30,000 will be taxed at the individual's highest rate, so you should ask to have this re-directed into the pension benefit - particularly where this will be taxed only at the basic rate. Clearly, the whole transfer process requires expert advice. If you think a mistake has been made by the company scheme, you should put your complaint in writing to the trustees. If you are still not satisfied, contact the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (tel. 071-233 8080), preferably through the local Citizens Advice Bureau. If the problem lies with an adviser or provider, you should contact the regulatory authority. This will normally be either Fimbra (tel. 071-538 8860) or Lautro (tel. 071-379 0444).</p>

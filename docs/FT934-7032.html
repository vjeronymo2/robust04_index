			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A contrast in environmental values Sir, I read with interest David Lascelles' comparison of the way Oxford and Freiburg manage their environmental and traffic problems (Business and the Environment, November 17). If I try and read between the lines, I see a number of contrasting approaches to the way we value the environment. 1. Is Oxford's privatisation strategy a better one? I feel that a market-oriented valuation of the environment is more sustainable because Freiburg's subsidisation only adds to unwanted budget deficits. 2. Is Freiburg's high level of community control sustainable? Heavy subsidisation adds up to higher costs, and if it continues, there may be a lasting risk of Germany having a relatively high inflation rate. 3. Is Oxford's environmental pricing likely to gain wider acceptance? The majority, I suspect, still need Freiburg's inflationary market. But the global market and European currency competition must be systematically deterring the inflationary market.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 12 TASS -- The output of fuel and energy-  carriers continues to slump in Russia. The production of oil  dropped by 15 per cent in the first quarter of this year as  compared to the corresponding period of 1993, the output of coal  -- by 9 per cent, gas -- by almost 1 per cent, light petroleum  products -- by 12-18 per cent, and electricity -- by 4 per cent.    In general, the slump in this sector of the economy remained  at last year's level and equalled to 6.5 per cent, ITAR-TASS was  told at the Russian Ministry for Fuel and Energy.    In expert opinion, the output of energy resources was  negatively influenced not only by the general recession, but  also by such factors as default of payments, which reached 19  trillion roubles in the fuel and energy complex alone, regularly  delayed budget allocations, and further reduction of  investments. Along with general economic factors, experts link  the dropping oil output of the recent years with the growing  share of deposits on the developed oilfields that yield to  extraction with great difficulty.    The marketing of refined products is another factor  responsible for slumping oil production, because the consumers  have turned insolvent. This explains the stoppage and closure  of about 15,000 oil wells, which brought down oil extraction by  approximately 4-4.5 million tonnes.    The fuel sector's financial "hunger" has had a negative  effect on the processing of crude oil and the production of  light petroleum products. Their volumes dropped by 15 per cent  in the first quarter of this year as compared to 1993, which  equals to more than eight million tonnes.</p>

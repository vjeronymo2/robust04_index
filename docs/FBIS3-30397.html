Approximately $285 million has already been  paid off, leaving a balance of $825 million. In 1992, the  balance was $339.6 million, and in 1991 $172.5 million. A  further growth in the balance is expected this year.    According to Zimola, the overall structure of the capital  flow into the Czech Republic is gradually changing. In the  first stage, to 1992, government arranged loans from  international financial institutions -- particularly the IMF --  were dominant. In 1992, direct investment exceeded $1 billion.  This year, this has declined somewhat (to approximately $500  million), but foreign credit and portfolio investment show an  upward trend.    The reasons for the increasing loans from abroad are mostly  their lower price (interest) and a shortage of, above all,  long-term loans from Czech banks. Two-thirds of the foreign  credits are loans for terms longer than four years. [passage  omitted]    On the whole, according to Zimola, it can be said that the  volume of credits from abroad shows a highly progressive trend,  and favorably influences the general development on the balance  of payments and the foreign currency reserves.

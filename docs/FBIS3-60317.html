			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>   [Text] Brussels, Dec 21 (AFP) -- Sweden and Austria  reported a breakthrough here Tuesday in their negotiations to  join the European Community along with Norway and Finland on  January 1, 1995.    They said the four countries had won the right to maintain  high environmental and health standards which exceed the E.C.'s  harmonised single market rules.    Swedish European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel said:  "This  is a major breakthrough."    The term was also used by Austrian Foreign Minister Alois  Mock to describe the enlargement negotiations which must be  finalised by March 1 next year if the four applicants are to  join the E.C. as scheduled by the 1995 target date.    Tuesday's negotiations between E.C. foreign ministers and  their counterparts from the four applicant countries did not  touch on agricultural subsidies -- the most controversial  unresolved issue.    Norway, Finland and Austria are all insisting on retaining  their high levels of protection for fragile Alpine, Arctic and  sub-Arctic farms, which are far higher than the maximum levels  permitted by the E.C.    But Mock said he believed this problem could be overcome by  the target date of March 1.    E.C. officials said the candidate countries had been given a  four-year period -- until 1999 -- to maintain their high  environmental standards after joining the E.C.    Over that period the E.C. will try to raise its own  standards  to match those of the newcomers.    The decision applies to such issues as automobile emissions,  lead-free petrol, product health labels, waste disposal and  restrictions on toxic substances.    The E.C. had earlier objected that excessively strict  "green"  regulations could hinder the free flow of products around the  enlarged community.    But the four countries all replied that their electorates  would not tolerate a lowering of environmental standards as the  price of joining the E.C.    Pressed on whether Sweden and the other three countries  might  have to lower their standards after 1999, the Swedish minister  said: "There is no reason whatsoever to believe that there will  be any lowering of standards."    In another concession, the E.C. also gave Swedes an  exemption  from a community health law that bans wet snuff or "snus" -- a  tobacco derivative.    And Sweden will be allowed to continue selling snus to  Norwegians.    Dinkelspiel called this a "Christmas present" from E.C.  negotiators, which overcame emotional Swedish resistance to any  ban on wet snuff.    Sweden will also be allowed to maintain a state monopoly on  retail selling of alcohol, but not on liquor imports or  wholesaling.    The monopoly, an attempt to limit alcohol use, contravenes  E.C. free trade regulations.    Diplomats said the four candidate countries had  unconditionally accepted most of the E.C.'s Maastricht union  treaty, which came into force on November 1.    It provides for common foreign and security policies,  economic integration leading to a single currency, and  cooperation in immigration and justice affairs.    However, there was no final accord on the single currency  issue because of a Spanish threat on Monday to hold up the  enlargement negotiations on the grounds that the four candidate  countries, being relatively wealthy, would upset the economic  balance in the E.C.    Spanish European Affairs Minister Carlos Westendorp had said  enlargement would make it more difficult for Spain to qualify  for a single currency bloc by 1999.    But Mock said this was just an "internal problem" of the  E.C.    And Dinkelspiel warned that the four candidate countries  would not accept any special rules to reduce their influence in  the process to decide when the single currency bloc would be  established and which countries were eligible to join.</p>

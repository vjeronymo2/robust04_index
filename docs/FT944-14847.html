			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Bolger defiant on threat from boundary changes New Zealand's prime minister Jim Bolger yesterday vowed that his National party would continue in power till the next elections due in 1996, in spite of boundary changes that will cost many of his MPs their seats. Some National party MPs are expected to form new political parties which could threaten the government's two-seat majority. The boundary changes, a result of the German-style electoral system under which the next elections are due to be held, reduce the number of electorates to 60 from the present 95. Under the new proportional system, the remaining seats will be on a list basis with MPs nominated by political parties. Many sitting MPs, including Mr Bolger and deputy prime minister Don McKinnon, say they intend to seek election and will not accept nomination for the party lists for the next parliament. The detailed boundary changes announced yesterday pose severe problems for the government. The reduction in seats leaves a number of prominent cabinet ministers, such as justice minister Doug Graham and consumer affairs minister Katharine O'Regan, without seats. The change to the electoral system has already led to two resignations. Junior minister Ross Meurant and Labour's Peter Dunne have left their present parties and announced they will stand under new labels in the next election. Both have said they will support Mr Bolger through what is expected to be a turbulent time in New Zealand politics.</p>

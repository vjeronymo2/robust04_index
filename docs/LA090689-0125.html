			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> HONDURAN BILLIONAIRE MATTA GUILTY OF RUNNING CALIFORNIA COCAINE RING  </P> <P> A Los Angeles jury found Honduran billionaire Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros  guilty today of operating a California cocaine ring in a decision hailed as a  powerful message of support for the Colombian government's war on drug  traffickers.  </P> <P> "We're sending the right message that we want to send to the Colombian  government, that if they extradite drug kingpins we will prosecute them to the  full extent of the law," said the prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Atty. Jimmy  Gurule.  </P> <P> Matta, 45, was accused of overseeing a network that distributed $72-million  worth of cocaine in Los Angeles. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration  claimed he controlled a narcotics empire worth up to $2 billion.  </P> <P> The U.S. District Court jury found Matta guilty of one count of conspiracy, one  count of running a continuing criminal enterprise, one count of possession with  intent to distribute cocaine and four counts of distribution of cocaine.  </P> <P> Matta's attorney sought to portray the Honduran as a legitimate businessman who  was the single largest employer in Honduras before his arrest there in 1988.  </P> <P> The government argued that Matta was a kingpin of the powerful cocaine cartel  based in Cali, Colombia, that distributed thousands of kilograms of cocaine to  Arizona and Southern California through Mexico.  </P> <P> The charges stemmed from a September, 1981, raid on a Van Nuys apartment  complex that netted $1.9 million in cash and 114 pounds of cocaine -- at that  time the largest seizure of the drug in California history.  </P></p>

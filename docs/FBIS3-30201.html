			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Knin, 28 Jan (TANJUG) -- The program I had offered  in the election campaign became the reflection of people's will  after the elections and it can and must be implemented, the  newly elected president of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK]  Milan Martic said at today's press conference. All creative  forces and teams of experts will gather to implement the  program. There is no place for political splits and all parties  must subordinate their activities to national and state  interests. As far as economic measures are concerned, the  president of the RSK announced the introduction of the "super"  dinar. According to Martic, a unified monetary policy of  Yugoslavia, the republic of Srpska and the RSK is the first step  toward the creation of a joint state.    Martic announced that he would meet the president of the  republic of Srpska, Radovan Karadzic, after he had talks with  Serbian President Milosevic.    As far as the make-up of the new Krajina government is  concerned and taking into account the multiparty structure of  the Krajina parliament, due to meet in about ten days, Martic  announced consultations and talks with the heads of  parliamentary groups and party leaders and went on to express  his belief that an agreement would be reached.    In any case, the government will be competent, the RSK  president stressed. He did not even hint who the new prime  minister could be or which party he belonged to. When the  largest parliamentary group, the Serb Democratic Party of  Krajina, was mentioned in this context, Martic said that it did  not have an absolute majority (32 out of 84 deputies) in the RSK  parliament.    Explaining the defense program, Martic said that an  efficient  and more economic army should be created, an army which would be  prepared to defend and preserve the borders. As the supreme  commander of the Serb army of Krajina, Martic announced his  first steps after the parliament's session, pointing out that  all incompetent people would have to go. This will also be true  regarding all other state bodies and the police.    Replying to one of the questions, Martic pledged that all  state bodies would have their headquarters in Knin, including  the ministry of foreign affairs, if this would prove to be  efficient and appropriate. Outlining his plan for a more  aggressive foreign policy, the RSK president pointed out that  Krajina must achieve full status at all negotiations in the  peace process. According to Martic, the RSK must achieve the  status currently enjoyed by the republic of Srpska.    Commenting on the declaration on the normalization of  relations between Croatia and Yugoslavia, Martic said: "The  declaration does not change anything in Krajina's status and it  does not mention that Krajina is back in Croatia as Croatian  politicians are claiming. In reality this is a document which  seeks political solutions in a peaceful manner." This is also  our aspiration and we want to hold talks with Croatia on an  equal footing, to reach a peaceful agreement on life as  neighbors and not under the same roof. As far as final  demarcation with Croatia is concerned, Martic said that an  internationally controlled referendum could be held so that the  Serbian people would get their right to self-determination as  all other peoples in the world.</p>

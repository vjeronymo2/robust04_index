			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LOUISIANA-PACIFIC THREATENS PULLOUT FROM BAJA VENTURE  </P> <P> Mired in a labor dispute with the Mexican government and unions,  Louisiana-Pacific Corp. has suspended construction of its huge maquiladora  plant near Ensenada and is threatening to pull out of the project altogether  unless the dispute is settled to its liking.  </P> <P> A Louisiana-Pacific spokesman confirmed reports published earlier this week in  the Tijuana newspaper El Mexicano that the company has laid off more than 400  construction employees. The workers were helping to build the first,  200,000-square-foot phase of a redwood planing and drying facility on 80 acres  that Louisiana-Pacific bought last year at El Sauzal, a few miles north of  Ensenada.  </P> <P> Louisiana-Pacific called the construction halt on June 14 after it said the  Mexican government reneged on a promise to let the company use its own  employees to unload rough-cut timber from barges transporting redwood from the  company's mills in Northern California. The government is now insisting that  Louisiana-Pacific use longshoremen to unload the timber, the company says.  Government officials were not available to respond to the allegation.  </P> <P> Using its own employees is cheaper than using unionized laborers and was one of  the main reasons that Louisiana-Pacific decided to become the first U.S. lumber  company to set up a large-scale maquiladora operation to Mexico, spokesman Shep  Tucker said Thursday.  </P> <P> Unless the dispute is solved in the next two or three weeks, Louisiana-Pacific  will "pull out" of its El Sauzal project altogether, Tucker said, despite  already having spent $7.8 million for land, construction and improved port  facilities at El Sauzal.  </P> <P> Although leaving the door open to negotiations, Tucker said the suspension was  "appropriate so as to clear up this important issue before more capital is  invested."  </P> <P> Officials at the Tijuana office of Mexican Secretary of Commerce and Industrial  Development, which approves maquiladora permits, were unavailable for comment  Thursday.  </P> <P> Portland-based Louisiana-Pacific, the nation's largest producer of redwood  timber, announced the purchase of the El Sauzal site last year for the purpose  of processing redwood to be shipped back across the border and sold mainly in  Southern California. The first barge-load of rough-cut redwood timber arrived  in February from Louisiana-Pacific mills in Northern California.  </P> <P> Louisiana-Pacific's decision to build the Baja California plant was viewed as  part of a trend by which U.S. manufacturers would move heavy manufacturing  operations to Mexico in addition to the light assembly work that has  characterized most of the maquiladoras that have opened in Mexico so far.  </P> <P> Tony Ramirez, a vice president of Made in Mexico, a Chula Vista-based  consultant who advises foreign manufacturers setting up plants in Mexico, said  Louisiana-Pacific's problems are indicative of the "mine fields" some U.S.  companies can encounter in Mexico if not sufficiently attuned to the political  and cultural differences between the two countries.  </P></p>

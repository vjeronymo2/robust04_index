			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT OF LEADING BLACK THINK TANK STRIVES TO REMAIN NONPARTISAN  </P> <P> Eddie N. Williams is constantly on the phone these days, what with black  politicians so much in the news.  </P> <P> Is Jesse Jackson maintaining his hold on black voters?  </P> <P> How did L. Douglas Wilder, Virginia's first black governor, manage to get  himself elected?  </P> <P> How is the indictment of Mayor Marion Barry playing with the voters in the  mostly black District of Columbia?  </P> <P> Those are the kinds of questions regularly put to Williams, who is president of  the Joint Center for Political Studies, a research institute he has built into  the nation's premier black think tank.  </P> <P> The center's staff of 60 studies and develops data on the social, political and  economic activities and concerns of African-Americans. It is best known for its  annual "Roster of Black Elected Officials," in which the number of blacks in  public office has risen from 600 in 1970 to more than 7,000 this year.  </P> <P> The center occupies a special niche at a time when black candidates and voters  are gaining influence in politics at all levels.  </P> <P> The mainstream is the "new frontier" for blacks seeking public office, Williams  says, citing the elections in 1989 of both Wilder and David N. Dinkins, the new  mayor of New York.  </P> <P> "That's where the jobs are," he said. "All of the positions that are in  predominantly black jurisdictions have just about been filled."  </P> <P> Largely disenfranchised in many Southern states until the mid-1960s, black  voters can claim credit for recent elections of Democratic senators in Alabama,  Georgia, Louisiana and North Carolina.  </P> <P> The mayors of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia are black.  </P> <P> The black electorate remains overwhelmingly Democratic, but two photographs on  a wall of Williams' office show how jealously he guards the center's political  neutrality.  </P> <P> One is a picture of Williams with President Bush; the other shows Williams with  two-time Democratic presidential contender Jackson.  </P> <P> "People don't knock the Joint Center as being liberal or conservative or  Republican or Democratic, and that's a very difficult position for a black  organization to maintain," said Robert Bates, a Mobil Oil Co. lobbyist and  close friend of Williams.  </P> <P> "It's a good role to be in, to call the shots as you see them," Williams said.  "I'll comment on the Republicans and I'll comment on the Democrats. I let the  chips fall where they may."  </P> <P> Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), the oldest and most senior black in  the House and chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, said that he often  makes use of statistical data and analyses from the center on a variety of  issues, "to focus on a minority viewpoint or get the specifics."  </P> <P> One question Williams is asked frequently is whether Bush and other Republican  Party leaders will be able to win black voters over to GOP candidates.  </P> <P> The opportunity is there, Williams said, "but until the Republicans can succeed  in recruiting some visible black leaders with a following, and until they  disabuse themselves of the notion that they can create a black leader, they're  going to only be modestly successful."  </P> <P> Williams, 57, was born in Memphis, Tenn., the only child of Ed Williams, a  one-armed jazz piano player, and his wife, Georgia.  </P> <P> From his mother, who worked as a maid, Williams learned the value of learning  and assembling information. She would often bring home books, clothes and other  articles from the households in which she worked.  </P> <P> "This is what that white boy's reading. Now, you ought to be reading it," she  would tell him. Thus Williams was able to read books not available to black  children in the segregated school system.  </P> <P> And he credits Bebe Bowers Fingall, a high school English teacher whose  students called her "Mama," with helping him develop a competitive spirit and  self-confidence. As one of "Mama's pets," he said, he was drawn into reading  all kinds of writings and speaking anthologies and plays.  </P> <P> He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of  Illinois and did graduate work in political science at Atlanta and Howard  universities.  </P> <P> He was director of the Center for Policy Studies at the University of Chicago,  a director of the U.S. Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and a State  Department foreign service reserve officer.  </P> <P> Then, 18 years ago, the president of the University of Chicago was startled to  hear that the school's vice president for public affairs was leaving to head an  obscure research organization.  </P> <P> "The challenge to me is to make you hear about it," Williams told him.  </P> <P> The unofficial link between black elected officials and the institute dates to  its beginnings in 1970, when psychologist Kenneth Clark and several leading  black politicians of the time started it with a $2-million grant from the Ford  Foundation. Today, the center is supported by $3 million a year from private  foundations and corporations, and Williams is working to raise $5 million to  match a Ford Foundation pledge of $5 million.  </P> <P> The institute's mission has been to supply technical assistance to the emerging  cadre of black elected officials from the ranks of teachers, preachers, farmers  and local community activists.  </P> <P> "Our role was to help them better understand the processes of governance, to  share some information and some expertise about administration, planning,  budgeting, identification of resource acquisition -- those kinds of technical  things," Williams said.  </P></p>

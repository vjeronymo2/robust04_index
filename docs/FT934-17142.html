			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Better safe than sorry: Will the Goode report prompt a long hard look at pensions? Pension fund investment managers breathed a sigh of relief yesterday at the moderate line taken by the Goode Committee on pension law reform. Upheavals on a scale that could have a serious impact on the stock market are not anticipated. But exactly how the committee's recommendations will look when they have been through the mangle of the parliamentary process remains to be seen. In any event, certain technical consequences for pension scheme solvency after the recent downward spiral in long-term interest rates have already been causing concern. And it is possible that other events will have important influences: last week's results from Guinness, for instance, provided a reminder that many companies are having to step up their pension scheme contributions once again, after several years of reductions and holidays; and some in the pensions industry are becoming nervous about next month's Budget, which could carry on the attack on pension fund tax reliefs begun by Norman Lamont last March. Britain's pension funds are uniquely able to invest in risky assets, notably equities, which make up nearly 80 per cent of the typical portfolio. In other countries there is a much bigger exposure to fixed interest bonds, which tend to give a significantly lower investment return in the long term. This exceptional risk tolerance in the UK arises from the ability of actuaries - the professionals who design and measure pension schemes - to take a relaxed attitude to short-term fluctuations in asset prices. Generally, they ignore share prices and value schemes on the basis of the long-term growth of investment income. But now there are several threats to this comfortable picture: Many schemes are now approaching danger level on the so-called 'discontinuance' test, which requires them to have enough assets to finance all past service liabilities should they be unexpectedly wound up; The rapid dividend growth rates that generated the pension scheme surpluses of the late 1980s have collapsed, both because of the recession and adverse tax changes; Schemes are becoming more mature, with fewer young members and more pensioners, which reduces their investment flexibility; Companies are increasingly considering a switch from final salary-linked to money purchase schemes, which transfer the investment risk from the company to the members. The discontinuance problem is highly technical, but it is an important issue for schemes where the company goes bust and members need to be sure that their benefits already accrued are safe. In such circumstances the trustees will normally seek to use the assets of the fund to buy guaranteed benefits from life assurance companies. Until the past year or two it was typical for schemes to be so far above the discontinuance solvency level as to be out of any conceivable danger. However, the terms quoted by life companies have deteriorated sharply. Many schemes therefore face the risk that in circumstances such as the 1987 stock market crash, when share prices suddenly tumbled by about 30 per cent, they might be technically insolvent. They can no longer be indifferent to the risks of holding a large proportion of equities in the portfolio. The Goode Committee has heightened this dilemma by proposing that for the first time there should be a statutory minimum solvency requirement, of 100 per cent of these legal commitments on discontinuance. Solvency may dip to a 90 per cent level before any urgent injection of new funds is required. Between 90 and 100 per cent, the scheme will have a leisurely three years to submit a plan for restoration to the minimum standard, so there will be plenty of time for stock market prices to rally after a future crash. Below 90 per cent, however, new resources would have to be injected within three months. When schemes are anywhere near the borderline, trustees will be under pressure to follow very prudent investment policies, and may even think it wise to take out futures contracts to protect the fund against market collapses. This will be to the detriment of long-term investment performance. One way in which the government could help pension schemes to handle these risks would be to offer them specially-tailored government bonds (or gilt-edged securities). Goode recommends that a new type of bond, a deferred income index-linked gilt, should be issued. Some in the pensions industry argue that two other kinds of indexed gilts should be invented, to match more precisely the two main kinds of current liability: for members in service the liabilities are likely to rise roughly in line with the index of average earnings, and for ex-employees who have left the company, statutory limited price indexation (inflation capped at 5 per cent) applies. The underlying theme is that the government could take advantage of the growing risk aversion in pension schemes to push sales of its own securities. This might suit the government when it is running a fiscal deficit at the rate of Pounds 50bn a year, but it would have the effect of crowding out the equity market. So far there is no evidence that pension funds are shunning equities, however. Although their exposure to gilts has risen a little in recent months it has been financed by running down their holdings of overseas bonds. As for the feared shift to money purchase schemes, this again remains conjectural. So long as contribution holidays persist, there is absolutely no incentive for companies to move to money purchase (where there can be no surpluses and no holidays). Guinness, though, warned last week of a Pounds 30m jump in pension contributions. Once they are paying out again, companies might reason that the changeover to money purchase will not involve them in any extra outgoings but will control their future risks. Money purchase funds are less risk-tolerant, because they are answerable to nervous scheme members rather than dessicated actuaries, and because, moreover, they have to provide cash sums in a rather inflexible way to retirees so that they can purchase annuities. Again, this argues for more gilts and fewer equities. It is clear that the Goode Committee has been careful to avoid radical change and none of its recommendations imply big portfolio shifts. But time is catching up with the UK's occupational pensions industry. It is up against a changing industrial culture and an unsympathetic government. Membership has been in decline. The question is whether Goode, and the legislation that may in due course follow, will prompt many British companies to take a long, hard look at their whole approach to pensions.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GOODE RECOMMENDATIONS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Compensation to cover fraud, misappropriation or theft, financed by a   levy on occupational schemes.  -Appointment of pensions regulator.  -Employers may take contributions holidays, but schemes must meet   statutory minimum solvency standard.  -Employers must obtain permission from regulator before withdrawing   cash from schemes.  -Employers allowed to amend schemes to reduce future service benefits,   but they must not restrict benefits for past service.  -Scheme members should be entitled to appoint at least a third of all   trustees, with a minimum of two per scheme.  -New Occupational Pensions Schemes Act to codify reforms.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

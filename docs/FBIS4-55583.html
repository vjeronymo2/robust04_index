			<p>BFN     [Text] Considering the obvious increase in tensions around  Sarajevo in the past few days, we have looked at the provisions  of the NATO ultimatum of 10 February this year to see under what  conditions the ultimatum is applicable, and came to the  conclusion that the current situation is unsatisfactory. This  was stated in a letter that Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, today sent to UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, chairman of the Security Council,  and Manfred Woerner, secretary general of NATO. Although more  than three months have passed, heavy weapons have not been  completely withdrawn from around Sarajevo, nor have they been  placed under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] control, President  Izetbegovic writes.    According to the information of the state leadership of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the aggressor still has one tank in  Zlatiste, one 122-mm gun in the Ilijas area, and one tank in the  Busile area. In Hadzici, the enemy has one tank and two  antiaircraft guns. In Grbavica, it has one tank, two armored  personnel carriers, and two (?three-barrel) antiaircraft guns.  The Serbs have another tank in Vojkovici. Regarding enemy  weapons in Vogosca, there are still two antiaircraft guns, one  mortar, and one hill gun there.    Since the responsible officials in UNPROFOR are aware of  this  situation, President Izetbegovic continues, but are not doing  anything against the aggressor apart from issuing appeals and  pleas, we ask ourselves whether the Security Council resolution  is binding for them and whether they are empowered to carry out  their private policy and personally assess what should and  should not be done.    No one has the right to play with the security of the town  that has suffered so much and with the lives of its residents.  Therefore, we expect the measures needed to put the situation in  the Sarajevo exclusion zone in order to be taken without delay.  This was stated in a letter that President Izetbegovic has sent  to the UN secretary general, the chairman of the Security  Council, and the secretary general of NATO.</p>

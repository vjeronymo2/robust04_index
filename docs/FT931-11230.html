			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Behind Paris's marriage of money and chic - Alice Rawsthorn examines the merger between Yves Saint-Laurent and Elf-Sanofi THE opulent Salon Imperial at the Inter-Continental Hotel in Paris resounded with applause last week when Mr Yves Saint-Laurent, one of France's most famous fashion designers, mounted the stage for a standing ovation at the end of his haute couture show. Mr Saint-Laurent has been showing couture in Paris for more than 30 years, but last week's collection was special. It was his last as an independent designer before YSL, his company, merges with Elf-Sanofi, the pharmaceuticals and cosmetics arm of Elf-Aquitaine, the flagship French oil group. YSL has struck a complex share swap agreement whereby its perfumes will be taken over by Elf-Sanofi, but the fashion business will continue to be run by Mr Pierre Berge, who co-founded the company with Mr Saint-Laurent. At first glance, the deal makes sense for both parties. Elf-Sanofi has been expanding in perfume to augment its pharmaceutical interests. It now has a portfolio of brands, including Nina Ricci and Fendi, which provide FFr3.2bn (Dollars 581m) of its FFr19bn annual sales. But Elf needs to increase its perfume portfolio, preferably with a prestigious brand, if it is to continue to compete for distribution in the increasingly consolidated retail sector against powerful players such as L'Oreal and LVMH of France as well as Estee Lauder of the US. YSL has the prestige that Elf lacks. Its scents, including Opium and Rive Gauche, represent roughly FFr2.5bn of its FFr3bn annual sales. It also needs new inward investment. The growth of the big groups, such as L'Oreal and LVMH, has raised the stakes in fashion and beauty. It now costs up to Dollars 50m to promote a new perfume worldwide. This is imposing intense financial pressure on independents, like YSL, which barely broke even in the first half of last year. In theory, last week's deal should give YSL and Elf what they want  - money and chic, respectively. In practice, though, things might prove more difficult. The challenge for Elf is to launch new YSL fragrances. It has the necessary financial resources, but has taken on YSL at a difficult time. The French fashion designers have seen sales fall by 20 per cent in real terms from their 1990 peak to FFr4.3bn in last year. The global beauty market has been relatively static for two years. Elf also has the problem that, although YSL is still prestigious, it is these days less obviously in the forefront of fashion. Mr Saint-Laurent's era as an innovator is rooted in the 1970s, when his most successful scents, Rive Gauche and Opium, came out. His classic style, beloved of haute bourgeoise Parisiennes, is not always in step with the informal fashions of the 1990s. This may make the YSL name less marketable for Elf when it tries to launch new perfumes in the future. There is also the question of what will happen after Mr Saint-Laurent, now 56 with a history of poor health, retires. Elf might be able to revive YSL under a new designer, as Chanel has done with Mr Karl Lagerfeld. But other houses have found the transition more difficult, notably Balmain and Lanvin, which have experienced a series of design and management changes. These difficulties are aggravated by the prospects for YSL's personnel within the Elf empire. Mr Saint-Laurent is seen as unpredictable even in the histrionic Paris fashion world. Mr Berge is called Pierre le Panthere in French business circles for his autocratic style. Until now, they have been free to run their company exactly as they wished. What occurred in the Scherrer house shows how difficult it can be for fashion entrepreneurs to adjust to a more buttoned-down corporate life. Mr Jean-Louis Scherrer, the founder, stormed out before Christmas after a row with its new owners and the house is now mired in legal suits. Mr Berge insists there is no possibility of that scenario recurring at YSL. Even so, the spectre of Scherrer provided an ominous backdrop to Mr Saint-Laurent's last independent couture show.</p>

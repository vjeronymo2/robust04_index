			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / People: Why Paul Kilduff has left TDG Alan Cole, chief executive of Transport Development Group, is on the lookout for what will be the fourth finance director he has worked with since he stepped into the boss's seat just over two years ago. Paul Kilduff, who joined from National Westminster last August, has just resigned 'by mutual agreement'. While Cole will not admit that there was a personality clash, he says 'it didn't work out. We both agreed we had made the wrong choice.' Asked what Kilduff had done since he arrived, he added 'he has not had time to do a lot'. Kilduff, 39, had been headhunted from NatWest where he had spent just 10 months as head of group strategy. The same firm of headhunters is now looking for his replacement. Previously, Kilduff had been finance director of Sealink for three years, before it was taken over by Stena; the Swedes brought in their own team, though sources close to Kilduff indicate he parted on very generous terms. Before Sealink the Peat Marwick-trained chartered accountant had been at Lonrho as finance director of Metropole Group between 1985 and 1987. Earlier in his career he had spent a year as chief financial executive of Micro Focus at the time of its stock market flotation. Five months after Cole became chief executive, David Horner, who had been finance director since 1973, took early retirement at age 57. Stephen Bodger, from ML Holdings, was his successor, but last August Bodger was put in charge of TDG's troubled French operations. Bodger, who remains on the board, had wanted a 'managerial role', according to Cole, who emphasises that the move constituted 'career enhancement'.</p>

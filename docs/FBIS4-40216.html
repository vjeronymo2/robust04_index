According to the  communique, "the delegations emphasized that their governments  had decided to implement the provisions of the Governmental  Agreement signed on 21 August 1992, according to which the  entrance and exit through all border crossing points for  international traffic or small traveler's traffic will be  permitted without restrictions on the basis of identification  documents or other travel documents issued by recognized  authorities of the two states." The consular offices in  Leuseni-Albita and Ungheni-Ungheni will suspend their activity  beginning 1 August 1994. The Moldovan delegation specified that  the suspension of the consular offices will not affect the free  traffic of Moldovan and Romanian citizens. "Responsible  authorities agreed to cooperate to prevent illegal crossing of  the Prut river by citizens of third countries, especially of  those with high emigration trends," states the communique. It  was decided that the deliveries of goods and humanitarian and  cultural packages will have priority. It was also decided that  beginning 15 July 1994, the Sculeni-Sculeni and Oancea- Cahul  points will be used according to international regulations for  travelers' traffic, and the Giurgiulesti-Galati point following  international regulations for goods traffic. The  Leuseni-Albita, Ungheni-Ungheni, Costesti-Stanca and  Stoianovca-Falciu points will function according to the current  program. It was decided that new passage points at  Braniste-Stefanesti and Lipcani-Radauti Prut will be opened in  the future, mentions the communique.</p>

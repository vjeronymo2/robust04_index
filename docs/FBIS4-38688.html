			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Kozlov and </F> Valeriy Sevryukov]    [Text] Moscow, 1 June -- "The visit by the President of the  Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, to Athens last year has set  Russian-Greek relations into full swing. After many centuries  of spiritual political and historical proximity, these relations  have revived with the breath of fresh air." This had been stated  by RF Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev before he started talks  with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias here today.    The head of the Russian foreign policy department said that  he attached great importance to the current meeting, considering  the big role Greece is playing in the Balkans and nowadays in  Europe as head of the European Union.    The talks are centred on the issues concerning bilateral  relations and preparations for the visit to Russia of the Greek  prime-minister Andreas Papandreou at the end of the year.  Regarding foreign policy, the sides intend to discuss the  situation in the former Yugoslavia and the Balkans as a whole,  as well as the Cypriot and the Near East problems.</p>

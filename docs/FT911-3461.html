			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Data and bank sales hit dollar THE DOLLAR fell back on weak US economic figures and co-ordinated central bank intervention yesterday. The German Bundesbank led an attack by central banks when the US currency was trading at around DM1.7540 during the European morning. It later retreated to a low of DM1.7375 in the face of unexpectedly weak US durable goods orders. Data on durable goods orders are regarded as volatile and not a reliable guide to economic trends, but dealers were still surprised that orders in March fell 6.2 per cent against expectations of a 0.2 per cent increase. It was the first time that the Bundesbank had intervened on the open market since mid-March. Other European central banks, including the Bank of England, appeared to sell dollars for D-Marks yesterday, although it was not until after the durable goods figures were announced that the dollar came under any pressure in the market. Comments by US officials also had a depressing influence on the currency, with Mr David Mullins, a Federal Reserve governor, saying the US economic recovery may not be very robust. In testimony before the Senate banking committee, Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, said the economy appears to be still moving modestly lower, but all indications are that the recession will bottom out within a 'reasonably short period'. He added that the Fed is keeping its options open on interest rates and is 'looking at the economy on a day by day basis'. At the close in London, the dollar had fallen to DM1.7420 from DM1.7660; to Y137.90 from Y139.40; to SFr1.4590 from SFr1.4795; and to FFr5.8750 from FFr5.9475. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index declined 0.6 to 66.5. Sterling gained ground with other European currencies against the dollar, but was replaced by the Italian lira as the second strongest member of the European exchange rate mechanism. Political risk is beginning to have a nervous effect ahead of next week's local elections in England and Wales. Recent economic news has also caused some concern. Erratic items were blamed by the authorities for yesterday's news that the UK current account deficit widened to Pounds 432m in March from the previous month's Pounds 227m, but dealers regarded the rise of 3.5 per cent in imports as worrying. Mr Nick Parsons, economist at Union Discount, said the official explanation was simply not good enough, given that the February improvement was entirely the result of the fourth largest surplus on erratic items since records began. The pound regained 1.90 cents to Dollars 1.7115, but slipped to DM2.9825 from DM2.9900; to SFr2.4975 from SFr2.5050; and to FFr10.0550 from FFr10.0650. It was unchanged at Y236.00. The sterling index improved 0.1 to 91.7. In New York the pound finished a further 15 points firmer at Dollars 1.7130.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of Bahrain (7): Economic changes add to the strain of adaptation - The prospects for political change IN AN ideal world of petrodollar surpluses and friendly neighbours, the need for change would not even be raised. But ruling families along the western shores of the Gulf are increasingly having to face the same broad issue of how much or how little political adaptation may be required to meet a markedly new set of economic circumstances. The fact that new political structures are being erected, albeit at a snail's pace, reflects the impact of unfriendly neighbours, flat oil prices, a high level of defence expenditure and the prospect of persistent budget deficits. Oman now has a consultative council which has been asking ministers some hard questions. Saudi Arabia, after more than a decade of waiting, is to have its own consultative body - but with powers and membership still to be defined. Kuwait goes to the polls in October to elect a national assembly. If it is anything like its predecessor, forcibly dissolved in 1986, ministers may again be in for a rough ride. It would be wrong to conclude from this that the Gulf is in the first flush of a democratic experiment. On the contrary: the experience of Algeria will have confirmed governments in their view that political liberalisation is a topic to be approached with the greatest caution. Bahrain was seen, in the years immediately after independence, as a democratic model for the region. But in 1975, after clashes with the government, the national assembly was dissolved, never to be resurrected. Sheikh Khalifa bin Sulman al-Khalifa, the prime minister, is not unhappy with the concept of a consultative council for Bahrain, but has said that his country will not lead the region on this issue - 'we cannot be singled out to be the good Samaritan,' he said, during an interview. There is particular reason for the prime minister's caution. There are 336,700 indigenous Bahrainis and more than 60 per cent of these are Shia Moslems. The ruling family is Sunni. After the revolution in Iran in 1979, and the creation of an Islamic republic under the spiritual guidance of Ayatollah Khomeini, the export of militancy became one of the central aims of the regime. Bahrain, with its majority of Shias (many are of Iranian descent), was a ready target. The Tehran government urged Bahrain's Shias to demonstrate against their rulers; from 1979 until 1986 a series of incidents on the island ranged from demonstrations to discoveries of arms caches. The efficiency of Bahrain's well-staffed and British-advised security forces contained the threat until the exhaustion of the revolution in Tehran. However, the Iranian political establishment is far from monolithic. Whatever the protestations of President Ali Akhbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Bahrain will remain watchful both of Tehran and of any militant tendency within its own borders. This situation easily explains why Bahrain is not tempted to make even modest political experiments. The foundations on which the existing system rests, however, must eventually become less secure as, in common with governments throughout the Gulf, Bahrain finds itself unable to provide all the benefits to which its citizens have become accustomed. The overall rate of population increase is estimated at 3.4 per cent; job creation is already one of the government's main preoccupations. Unemployment is officially put at 6.4 per cent, but western embassies believe it may be much higher; some estimates show it running at up to 20 per cent. (In part that might reflect the local distaste for particular forms of employment, and for less secure private sector jobs.) The squeeze on government finances also places additional strain on the provision of free public services such as health and education. Some modest  -and heavily disguised - attempts have been introduced to boost tax revenues, but more direct methods, such as an income tax, are deemed to be politically impossible. It is hardly surprising that the efficient management of the economy is coming under closer scrutiny, especially by Bahrainis who have been educated abroad. Their comments on the lack of co-ordination between ministries, the allocation of resources, the competence of some senior officials and the dispensation of patronage are a strong counterpoint to the official mood of self-confidence and economic optimism. But even that appears to wear a little thin when conversations turn to the commitment and competence of the younger generation to assume political responsibility. It should also be remembered that Bahrain is where other Gulf Arabs come to relax. Bars, discotheques, uncensored news, some of the best restaurants in the region and the cabin crews of Gulf Air International give Manama an atmosphere not found anywhere else in the region. Bahrain comes better-prepared than more rigidly controlled societies to accommodate the political changes which eventually will have to be made.</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Pick of the world's airlines - The factors that influence passengers' choice On a scale of one to 10, how would you rate the food on your most recent flight? What about the seating, the cabin crew and the in-flight entertainment? Every year, the Travel Research Centre puts these and other questions to about 20,000 passengers arriving at London's Gatwick and Heathrow airports. Based on the replies, Michael Brooks, the head of the centre, has attempted to formulate a general theory of airline choice. He will be presenting his findings to an airline conference in London next month. Brooks says some airlines score well on most of the questions asked, but remain at the bottom of the list of passengers' preferred carriers. The reason is that they are not regarded as safe. This might be because of specific incidents or because their aircraft look old and worn. Airlines that succeed on the safety test have to pass a second barrier: are they part of an attractive frequent-flyer programme? If they are, they might be chosen even if their service is less than adequate. In the US, however, business travellers participate in so many frequent-flyer schemes that they do not feel tied to one particular airline. What matters is how good the airline is. So which are the good airlines? Brooks says British Airways achieves some of the highest scores on all routes. Surprisingly, it comes top of hardly any of the individual categories, such as cabin crew and food. Nevertheless, its performance in each category is strong enough to make it a market leader overall. For south-east Asian carriers, it is not enough to be second best. Their advertising makes so much of their cabin service that, if this is not top class, their overall customer satisfaction rating drops. Brooks says both Malaysian Airlines and Singapore Airlines achieve high levels of customer satisfaction. Malaysian beats Singapore in the passenger satisfaction ratings for cabin crew, food and in-flight entertainment. On North Atlantic routes, Continental of the US scores well, beating Virgin Atlantic of the UK on all counts except for in-flight entertainment. Northwest, the US airline, does well on seating and check-in arrangements. Brooks says, however, that the carrier still has weaknesses, with passengers finding its cabin crew unenthusiastic.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: DESIGN;  </P> <P> '50S FUN  </P> <P> IN KEEPING WITH today's fascination with '50s designs, the San Diego store  called Boomerang was named for those bent kidney shapes on '50s Formica. Owner  David Skelley had been collecting "Twilight Zone"-era items for years, with the  thought of opening a diner, when he decided to start Boomerang instead.  </P> <P> Partner Jeff Spence joined him soon after.  </P> <P> Inside the store, zebra-striped vinyl pulses with '50s fervor, a  wood-and-leather Eames chair reposes near a sculptural coffee table by Isamu  Noguchi, and an arsenal of bowling balls with swirling patterns await their  next roll. Skelley's own Calderish mobiles and abstract paintings are for sale,  as is '50s-look furniture designed and built by the partners.  </P> <P> Prices are often half what they would be in cities with more demand for '50s  merchandise. That's why a third of Boomerang's customers come from Los Angeles,  San Francisco and destinations beyond. "We try to deal in pieces that are  good-to-excellent in quality, in designs that are either classical or  outrageous," Skelley says. "Colors are real important, too. You won't find  olive green or harvest gold in this store."  </P> <P>  Boomerang, 3795 Park Blvd., San Diego, (619) 295-1953.  </P> <P> DIRK SUTRO  </P></p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Hyundai strike cost mounts Hyundai Heavy Industries, South Korea's largest shipyard, says it has lost Won338bn (Pounds 274m) in sales as a result of a strike by its workers that began on June 24. The Korea Federation of Small Business warned that continuation of the Hyundai strike could push many of HHI's 1,500 suppliers close to insolvency. Labour disputes at HHI have become an almost annual event since 1987, when the trade union movement was freed from government controls. Strikes last year at HHI and other Hyundai companies cost the country's largest conglomerate an estimated Won900bn in lost sales. The small business association urged the government to call for emergency arbitration in the dispute and punish the HHI workers who have been occupying the shipyard since the company imposed a lock-out on July 20. Although the government recently warned that it would get tough with striking workers, it believes that police intervention to break the HHI strike could trigger labour unrest in other ind-ustries. The Hyundai trade unions are known as being the country's most militant.</p>

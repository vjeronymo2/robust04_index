			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary </F> Committee-General Command of the Zapatist National Liberation  Army "from the Mexican southeast" on 15 March]    [Text] 15 March 1994    "Shadows of a tender rage; our steps will protect the  have-nots."    To the State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations  (CEOIC), the Mexican people, the people and governments of the  world, the national and international press, and brothers:    The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General  Command [CCRI-CG] of the Zapatist Army of National Liberation  [EZLN] respectfully and honorably addresses all of you in order  to state the following:    The Federal Government, yesterday's usurper of the people's  power, once again is lying about the dialogue in San Cristobal  de las Casas, Chiapas. The government says there are  "agreements," when there was nothing more than a dialogue.  Brothers, do not be deceived by their lies; the powerful now  seek to usurp the truth, and they are trying to mislead you by  saying that peace is only a signature away.    How can there be peace if the ones who caused the war are  still calling for the continuation of our poverty? The  arrogance that dwells within the government palaces and the  houses of the monarchs of commerce and property continues to  call for war and for our genocide. They cannot accept that  Indian blood might be equal to that of the white man. We seek  to become part of the country, yet they continue to block our  efforts, and now they repay the sacrifice of our dead with  contempt and ridicule.    If they speak with contempt, how can there be peace in these  lands, or if they remain silent and murder our brothers? How  can we ask our collective heart whether the time has come for  peace to enter with dignity through the doors of our  impoverished lands? They seek to corner us once again and force  us to surrender. Through the destruction of our dignity they  seek to force us to accept a peace that represents war to our  people.    We will not do it. We will not surrender. If they refuse a  fair and honorable peace, then we -- the men and women of the  shadows -- will once again dress for war. Our rage will now  rise up from having been deceived. The machetes are once again  being sharpened, and our lands will once again wreak of  gunpowder.    We are shadows of a tender rage. Our strategy will once  again reverberate in the heavens and give shelter to the  have-nots and the good men and women who understand that justice  and peace go hand in hand. If they deny our rights, then our  tender rage will enter their haughty mansions. We will overrun  every wall. No door will remain intact, and no window will  remain unbroken. No wall will be left standing. Our shadow  will carry sorrow to those who call for war and the genocide of  our race. More tears will be spent and more deaths will take  place so that peace can sit at humanity's table.    We, the shadows of tender rage, will once again raise our  voice to drown out the lies. Our first "enough" was  insufficient. The land will not blossom with the blood of our  dead.    The men and women of tender rage will have to march once  again, our dead will have to rise once again, and the history of  our broken hearts will speak once again. Let the deceit and  lies cease. Let arrogance in the lands of Mexico perish once  and for all. Let the men of women of the shadows, adorned in  the dark clothes of tender rage, gather in order that we may  silence so many lies.    The powerful should no longer speak. From their lips come  poison and decay. They must stop the lies and duplicity.    It is time for our brothers who are following other paths to  speak out and carry our grief to new horizons. We want to hear  the voices of our brothers from the CEOIC. All of the Indians  of this land must speak their minds. The impoverished peasants  must not remain silent. The workers in the cities must shout.  This warriors' song must be sung by teachers, students,  workers, and all of those people who are diminutive in every  sense of the word.    Do not leave this heavy banner in our hands alone. Everyone  must help carry it. Let us all change the land on which its  shadow falls. Mexican brothers, do not forget this voice in the  wilderness. The light shed by our dead is very remote. Let us  add other lights. Let us end this shameful night once and for  all. The time has come for a new dawn.    Let the truth speak. Let its voice be heard now. Let it  walk with brave footfalls. We, who have no face or past listen  with open hearts and ears. Let the voice of everyone be heard.  Let our men and women remain silent, and let this silence  continue in the shadows of tender rage. [sentence as published]    All of you must watch over our dreams so that nothing bad  will happen to them -- so that black shadows will not threaten  them. For you, brothers, our hearts continue to beat and our  fire continues to burn, and we hope that everything will be well  with you so that, in the end, this tender rage will prevail in  these lands.    Peace is not possible with deceit. Peace is born of freedom  and is nurtured by justice. We are all worthy of democracy.    Cheers, brothers of the CEOIC! Cheers, Indian brothers!  Cheers, Mexican brothers! Walk without fear, lift your heads,  and pick up your feet. Our weapons are already guarding your  path...    Freedom! Justice! Democracy!    Respectfully yours from the Mexican southeast,    [Signed] CCRI-CG of the EZLN    [Dated] Mexico, March 1994</p>

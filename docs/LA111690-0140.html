			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> PHONE COMPANIES JOIN MADD EFFORT  </P> <P> For the first time, Pacific Bell and AT&amp;T are allowing company trucks to  promote something other than telephone calls.  </P> <P> Phone company employees will be able to join Mothers Against Drunk Driving's  annual campaign to keep drunk drivers off the road during the holidays by tying  red ribbons to vehicle door handles or radio antennas.  </P> <P> On Thursday, a brief ceremony was held in front of the Pacific Bell operations  building in Tustin. Several employees decked their trucks with red ribbons, and  the Telephone Pioneers, a volunteer group with members from both phone  companies, presented more than 100,000 information cards and red ribbons to  Sandy Gaar, vice president of the Orange County chapter of MADD.  </P> <P> Pioneer volunteers worked for several weeks to cut the ribbons and attach them  to the information cards. The ribbons are intended to remind anyone entering a  vehicle not to drink and drive and will be distributed and used between the  Thanksgiving and New Year's holidays. SHANNON SANDS  </P></p>

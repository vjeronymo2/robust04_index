			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Letter: Turkish Cypriots suffered Sir, In your leader, 'They must be stopped' (July 16), you talk of the failure of the international community to do anything to 'prevent the ethnic cleansing' carried out by Turkey in Cyprus. May I point out that the 'large numbers of people forcibly driven from their homes and killed' were the Turkish Cypriots in the first instance, not the Greeks. This 'ethnic cleansing' was done while Turkey waited patiently for 14 years for the international community to do something about it, as 'violence and ethnic cleansing' were not acceptable to Turkey either, only in this case it was not mere cleansing, but killing.

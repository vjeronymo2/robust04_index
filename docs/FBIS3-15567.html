			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have been informed by Sakenergo [electric power  production and consumption department] that electric power  supply has increased compared with previous weeks. The  operation of Tbilisi regional state power station has been  relatively stable. Due to the rise of the water level in rivers,  the efficiency of hydroelectric stations has increased almost by  the factor of two and reached five million kilowatt/hours.  Apart from this, the republic gets almost two million  kilowatt/hours of electric power from Azerbaijan. Thus, as for  today, the total power available reaches 18 million  kilowatt/hours. The shortage is still large but it can be  presumed that hydroelectric power stations will show a further  significant increase in efficiency after 15 or 20 March.</p>

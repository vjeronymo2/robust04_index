			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry has  misappropriated "work-drive funds" and illegally issued  passports, the Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) said Monday.    In its recent audit of the Ministry, the BAI found that  between June 1993 and March this year the Ministry used 186  million won (about 230,000 U.S. dollars) in work-drive funds, 30  percent of the 502 million won appropriated as such funds during  the period, without the treasurer's prior approval and then  notified the treasurer of such use up to 100 days later, the  announcement said.    Moreover, the Ministry used 64 million won in work-drive  funds to treat officials working overtime to special food,  though the funds cannot be used to pay for food.    In addition, last year the Ministry issued, through overseas  missions, passports to two citizens subjected to government  administrative action for wrongdoings, which is in violation of  the rules. The Ministry failed to advise the missions concerned  of the information about the persons in question.    The BAI also found that the Ministry issued in December last  year and February this year multiple-use passports to two  citizens whose administrative action was temporarily suspended,  though such citizens must be issued a single-use passport.</p>

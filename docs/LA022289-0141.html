			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM STABBING PROBE CONTINUES  </P> <P> Anaheim police today are continuing their investigation into Tuesday's robbery  and stabbing of a Loara High School student by three young men described as  "skinheads."  </P> <P> The victim, identified as Jose Irribarren, 18, was listed in fair condition  today at UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange, a hospital spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> The school's principal, Gerald Glenn, said today that none of the suspects are  Loara students. He said that the 3:30 p.m. attack occurred in front of the  school, almost an hour after classes had finished, and that few people remained  on the grounds. The school has not had any previous similar incidents, and the  student body has not had any problems with "skinheads," he said.  </P> <P> No additional security was planned at the school, he said.  </P> <P> Police said Tuesday that the victim received two stab wounds to the leg and  abdomen. He was stabbed with a "butterfly" knife, which flips open with a flick  of the wrist, they said. It was not known how much money was stolen from the  victim.  </P> <P> The attackers were identified as three boys, ages 16 to 17, with shaved heads,  leading police to identify them as skinheads. The attackers were described as  white males, between 5 foot 3 inches and 5 foot 7 inches tall, and each  weighing 120 to 170 pounds, police said.  </P></p>

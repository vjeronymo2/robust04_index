			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping in Bonn </F> by Ulrich Wickert in Cologne -- live]    [Text] [Wickert] When the traffic expert Christoph Zoepel  was criticized for a lack of discipline after his resignation,  he accused the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] of  authoritarian thinking. Good evening, Mr. Scharping.    [Scharping] Good evening, Mr. Wickert.    [Wickert] Is it not necessary for a party leader to be  authoritarian occasionally?    [Scharping] In any case, he should know what he wants, what  his goals are, and how they can be realized together with the  party.    [Wickert] What do you want?    [Scharping] A policy that ensures social justice and that  takes the people in Germany seriously, that fights against  unemployment, and that guarantees inner peace in this country on  the basis of completely solid finances.    [Wickert] Well, this is what everybody wants. However,  where are you leading your party as far as the program is  concerned?    [Scharping] We confirmed again today that economic growth,  entrepreneurial initiatives, competitive jobs, and ecological  progress are indivisibly linked. We suggested a number of  individual measures in this respect, including very specific  proposals for families with small children -- uniform family  allowances, a tax exemption for the subsistence minimum, and  other measures, for example.    [Wickert] Let me ask you how you have led the party here?    [Scharping] I hope that I have ensured that the SPD  concentrates on these important issues and adopts a clear  profile.    [Wickert] What are your guidelines as far as contents are  concerned?    [Scharping] I tell everybody my view. If I hear better  arguments, I am glad because one should never rule out that one  can learn something. I was negligent in the tax debate in that  I forgot to add the word taxable in connection with income  limits. If somebody points out such a mistake, this is a  necessary and important correction. By the way, my style is  leadership through arguments and teamwork, clear decisions, and  the joint implementation of decisions.    [Wickert] This is not really authoritarian. You have also  been accused of failing to present an unclear program.    [Scharping] I consider both accusations wrong. Actually,  both of them are new to me. I have never been accused of being  authoritarian before. I have the impression that certain people  are overreacting. Assertiveness is certainly a good quality in  a party chairman. One must also have clear goals. Yet one  cannot issue orders. One cannot lead a party like the SPD,  which has about 900,000 members, like a military unit.    [Wickert] Well, nobody is demanding that. However, a firm  hand is needed sometimes. Do you have a firm hand?    [Scharping] I think so, if it is required. This has become  clear during various debates in the past -- at our party  conference, and before and after that. I only hope that there  will not be too many situations in which one must not only lead,  but show a firm hand. That is not my style. However, if it is  necessary, I will be able to cope with it.    [Wickert] Has Mr. Zoepel's resignation prompted the large  extent of agreement today?    [Scharping] No. It existed before that event. We specified  -- improved, I believe -- the government program in numerous  areas today. The debate was worthwhile. After all, we are the  only party that discusses its government program with committed  and well-informed citizens at 200 public events. This is a sign  of open and living democracy. This is our policy.    [Wickert] Well, this is the way you present your party to  the public. Yet what happens within the party is also  important, whether there will be quarrels.    [Scharping] We will have to wait and see. However, I am  convinced that the SPD will continue to be what it has always  been and what it is: A reform-oriented people's party that  holds discussions, that defines its policy, and on which one can  rely.    [Wickert] Thank you very much, Mr. Scharping.</p>

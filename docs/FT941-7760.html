			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: LWT's final salvo in bid battle LWT yesterday fired the final salvo in its defence from Granada's Pounds 800m bid by underlining the management's confidence in its growth prospects as an independent company. In a letter to shareholders Sir Christopher Bland, chairman, said:'LWT's board and senior management are confident that the Granada offer fails to reflect the future earnings potential of the company. This confidence is based on an outstanding record, a strong start to 1994, and a detailed understanding of the television industry.' Referring to the management's large stake in the company he added:'We are backing our judgement with over Pounds 75m invested in LWT.' A spokesman for Granada replied: 'They passed the point of indifference in terms of their personal wealth some time ago.' Sir Christopher accused Granada of 'trying to scare' LWT into accepting by suggesting that the LWT share price would be vulnerable if the bid failed. But Sir Christopher pointed to the re-rating of the sector over the last three months which has seen three bids and the proposed subscription by Flextech for 20 per cent of HTV.</p>

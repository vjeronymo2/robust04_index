			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont rallies Tories on VAT THE government secured a majority of 25 in the Commons last night for its controversial proposal to extend value added tax to domestic fuel from April of next year. The government's majority of seats over all other parties is 20. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, won congratulations from cabinet colleagues and Tory backbenchers when he wound up the four-day Budget debate with a hard-hitting speech which appeared to have strengthened his hold on the chancellorship. Earlier Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, alleged that the government had deliberately massaged downwards its pre-election forecasts of public borrowing. Drawing on a report first published in the Financial Times last autumn Mr Brown demanded publication of internal Treasury documents showing that the chancellor had rejected as too high his officials' first forecast of the public-sector borrowing requirement. In a rowdy end to the debate Mr Lamont refused to be intimidated by persistent Labour barracking in support of demands that all retirement pensioners should be compensated in full for the increase in fuel charges resulting from the VAT levy. He ruled out such across-the-board payments, reaffirming that relief planned by the government through increased income support would be targeted on those most in need. To government cheers he insisted: 'This party has an excellent record in helping the worst-off'. Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, was among several Tory backbenchers who pressed for more generous compensation covering categories marginally above entitlement to income support. He stressed that those 'just above' the qualifying level for income support would also be hard hit by the new impost. The VAT resolution was carried by 303 votes to 278, with the numbers passing through the government lobby three short of the total (306) which enabled it to secure a majority of 27 to beat off an opposition challenge to the entire Budget package. Mr Nicholas Winterton (C Macclesfield) and Mr William Powell (C Corby) abstained in the VAT vote, when the government's majority fell to 25. Mr Michael Alison (C Selby) did not vote. The chancellor vigorously rebutted charges that the tax increases imposed in the Budget amounted to a betrayal of election promises by insisting that its commitment to 'sound finances and low direct taxation' took priority.</p>

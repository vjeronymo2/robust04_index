			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Letter to the Editor by Vladimir Palko, Jozef Klein, Juraj </F> Kohutiar, Pavol Katreniak, and Vladislav Chlipala: "Is There a  KGB Threat?"]    [Text] Yesterday, the editor received the text of a  statement by top functionaries of the former Federal Security  and Information Service (FBIS), in which they respond to the  implications of a visit to Bratislava by the head of the Russian  Foreign Secret Service.    ``Reports in the [Slovak] media covering the visit of J.  Primakov, director of Russia's Foreign Secret Service, reveal  that our intelligence service has `its man in the Russian  service and, vice versa, the Russians have their man in SIS  [Slovak Information Service].' Thus, four years after the day on  which the CSFR Interior Minister, Jan Langos, legally suspended  KGB activities on CSFR territory by canceling an agreement with  the KGB, we are again witnessing the legalization of activity by  members of the present Russian secret service on Slovak  territory.    ``The Russian secret service is a direct successor to the  First KGB Directorate and, from the personnel standpoint, is  practically identical with it. Even if one takes into account  the need for exchanging certain kinds of information between the  Slovak information service and foreign information services--the  Russian one included--we still consider that the presence of a  representative of the Russian service in SIS amounts to a breach  of the stated goals of the Slovak Republic's foreign policy. In  view of the philosophy and practices of the Russian intelligence  service, we feel that collaboration of the proposed sort  disqualifies us from participation in wider cooperation with the  special services of other democratic countries and, in  conjunction with other factors, practically predetermines  Slovakia's orientation toward the East. Neither can the  proclaimed reason for this kind of close cooperation--fight  against Russian and Chechen mafias--pass muster because these  targets are not included in the Russian Federation law on  foreign intelligence.''    Signed: Vladimir Palko, former FBIS First Deputy Director;  Jozef Klein, former Director, FBIS Office, Bratislava; Juraj  Kohutiar, former Deputy Director, FBIS Office, Bratislava; Pavol  Katreniak, former Director, FBIS Office, Banska Bystrica;  Vladislav Chlipala, former Director, FBIS Office, Kosice.</p>

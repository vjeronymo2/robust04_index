			<p>BFN     [Text] A delegation from Ukraine's Supreme Council has left  for Bucharest. It will take part in the work of the third  session of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Parliamentary  Assembly. Before departing, [Oleksandr Tkachenko,] the head of  the delegation and first deputy chairman of Ukraine's Supreme  Council, was interviewed.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] How do you see the role of  the assembly in improving our mutual relations, both in economic  and political life, with the countries which have already joined  the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Parliamentary Assembly?    [Tkachenko] I think that the Black Sea Economic Cooperation  Parliamentary Assembly has set itself (?three tasks): [First]  improving the political situation in the Black Sea region;  second, the establishment of economic mutual relations and  economic mutual assistance [words indistinct] creating its own  bank, on which fruitful work [words indistinct]; and the third  thing is undoubtedly our cooperation on issues of scientific and  technical (?progress).    I believe that our trip to the third session of the assembly  sets a number of cardinal tasks, especially on issues of  economic cooperation between our states, which have joined this  assembly. The main issue [words indistinct] is undoubtedly  security in this region, and the second issue is elaboration of  economic mutual relations and the creation of a single financial  bank.    [Correspondent] Will Ukraine be proposing such a package of  documents.    [Tkachenko] Undoubtedly we will be proposing our documents,  well, within the program of the agenda which was planned for  this meeting. [end recording]</p>

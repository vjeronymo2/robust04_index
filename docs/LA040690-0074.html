			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MURDER CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST VICTIM'S  WIFE  </P> <P> Charges that a Sun Valley housewife helped an 18-year-old "street kid" stab her  husband to death, then passed off the killing as the work of a burglar, were  dropped in San Fernando Municipal Court on Thursday after prosecutors announced  that they had too little evidence to win a conviction.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Craig Richman said prosecutors did not have enough evidence against Mary L.  Kellel-Sophiea. She had been charged with murdering her estranged husband,  Gregory Sophiea, with the aid of Anthony Thomas Moore, 18, who has been charged  in the case.  </P> <P> Richman said the charges against Kellel-Sophiea could be refiled later if  police uncover new evidence.  </P> <P> Kellel-Sophiea's defense lawyer, Leslie H. Abramson, accused police of trying  "to cover up the horrible mistake that they made in arresting an innocent  citizen."  </P></p>

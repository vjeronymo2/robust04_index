			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: AZUSA;  </P> <P> NARANJO MAY QUIT PANEL  </P> <P> Councilman Anthony Naranjo said he has tentatively decided to step down as  chairman of the city's Drug and Gang Task Force and as City Council liaison  with the Police Department, following a shouting match this week with another  councilman over Naranjo's police record.  </P> <P> Councilman Stephen Alexander on Monday proposed an ordinance that would prevent  anyone convicted of impersonating a police officer -- or of any misdemeanor or  felony -- from participating in police ride-alongs, an integral part of the  liaison job.  </P> <P> In 1986, Naranjo, working as a bail bond investigator, was arrested in West  Covina for impersonating a police officer. He later pleaded no contest and was  fined $150 and given six months' summary probation. He publicly disclosed his  record during his 1988 City Council campaign.  </P> <P> Naranjo said Tuesday his decision is not final: "I have received many phone  calls from the community urging me to stay. I'll make my decision by the end of  the week."  </P></p>

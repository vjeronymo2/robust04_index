			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Global business a fact of life - Unctad's World Investment Report assesses role of multinationals Governments and trade unions must accept the increasing globalisation of the world economy as a fact of life - and they must devise new ways of responding to the growing power of multinationals. This is the message of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) in its fourth World Investment Report, published today. But in a generally positive assessment of the role of multinationals in employment, the report absolves them of claims by trade unions and some governments that they rob rich countries of jobs in seeking to base production wherever labour costs are lowest. Multinationals employ directly about 73m people, representing nearly 10 per cent of paid non-farm jobs worldwide and close to 20 per cent in the industrialised countries. Unctad estimates that indirect employment may be at least as much again. This would bring the total number of jobs associated with multinationals to 150m or more. The US sports shoe manufacturer Nike, for example, employs 9,000 people but nearly 75,000 work for its independent sub-contractors around the globe. Despite the huge increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) flows over the past decade, employment in multinationals has not followed suit. The modest 8m increase in jobs since 1985 has been entirely concentrated in foreign affiliates, which now employ 29m people. In developing countries multinationals increased their workforce by 5m to 12m over the period. Much of the employment increase in developing countries has been in east and south-east Asia, especially China, and in export processing zones. Still, 'the job-relocation effect of FDI is very limited', Unctad maintains, pointing out that the number of jobs lost to Third World nations is tiny compared with the total labour force in the industrialised countries. It adds that the bulk of FDI is determined not by labour cost differentials (which may in any event be offset by productivity differences) but by the search for natural resources and for markets. Many of these markets, including those for services, require local production. Multinationals can in fact be a force making for higher labour standards in poor countries, according to Unctad. The workforce directly employed by foreign affiliates 'typically - but not always - enjoys better wages, conditions of work and social security benefits' compared with prevailing domestic levels. Multinationals can also help workers, especially those in developing countries, to acquire better skills to the benefit of the host economy as a whole. On the downside, Unctad acknowledges that competition between countries to attract foreign investment may tempt governments to cut social and labour standards - especially trade union rights - in the hope of securing extra jobs. But it says multinationals are increasingly looking for an educated, skilled and committed workforce, combined with a social and physical infrastructure capable of generating high productivity. At the same time, the report displays misgivings that international corporations are able to exercise growing economic influence largely unchecked by governments or trade unions. Though multinationals normally recognise unions and often appear to have a higher rate of unionisation than domestic companies, trade unions are ill equipped to deal with employers operating on a global basis and their problems are exacerbated if governments see unions as a deterrent to foreign investors. Unctad notes the revived interest by unions in international regulations or guidelines for multinationals, especially rules that would tie adoption of minimum labour standards (including free trade unions) to trade. The European works councils proposed by the European Union represent another type of response. However, the report says the need for companies constantly to 'reinvent' themselves - which puts a rising premium on committed, flexible workforces - paves the way for the development of 'new forms of co-operation' between multinationals and trade unions, at workplace as well as international level.

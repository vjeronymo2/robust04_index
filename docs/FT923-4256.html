			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Letter: Look to oneself for explanation of losses Sir, Recent media criticism of the accounting profession may be valid, but it is surely misdirected. On the basis that accounting standards embrace all, from sole traders to the largest quoted companies, it is hardly surprising that standards are flexible. What is surprising is how many times lenders and investors, having lost money in a company, try to mask their carelessness and inability by blaming the accountancy profession. It is improbable that Terry Smith (author of 'Accounting for Growth') is alone in being analytically capable, so how is it that there is always a much larger body of investors who have not become involved with these offending companies? The answer cannot exclusively be good luck; rather, that some of these non-investors work harder. Consequently, as they are more aware, they avoid these companies, simply through a more careful and informed scrutiny of the same financial information which is available to all, and which is based on the same accounting standards. My suggestion is not that the accountancy profession, or more precisely, the Accounting Standards Board, should go uncriticised, but that those who cry sour grapes should also look to themselves rather than to others for a reasonable explanation of their losses.

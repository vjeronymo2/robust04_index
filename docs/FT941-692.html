			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Arts: Dmitry Hvorostovsky - Recital A thoughtful gesture towards an English audience opened this recital. There cannot be many Russian singers who have taken Purcell in their repertoire. Although Music for a while was not meant to go at a funereal pace, at least Dmitry Hvorostovsky could use it as an opportunity to show off his unrivalled breath control. This young baritone arrived with such a big bang on the international music scene that he raised exaggerated expectations in many quarters. In recent years Hvorostovsky has had to proceed carefully. His appearances in opera have not always gone down well, often because audiences who know his singing from recordings have been surprised that his lyrical baritone is not more forceful when they hear it live. It was a sensible move to put more emphasis on recitals. (Last year's Russian programme on the South Bank was a noted success.) His Wigmore Hall recital on Sunday showed that he has started to venture into other repertory. And it is not just Purcell that he has included, but also Ravel, in whose Don Quichotte a Dulcinee he was more or less intelligible - a too youthful Don Quixote perhaps, but Hvorostovsky always has panache. A group of three rarely-heard Shostakovich songs gave us sombre Russian gravity in between. There was a greater rarity to come, however. Audiences in the West have heard little of those Soviet composers who dutifully toed the party line (Shostakovich, who seethed with resentment against the regime and wrote the best music, has monopolised Western attention). Georgy Sviridov has been neglected but his song cycle, Russia cast adrift, suggests that he might deserve better. Its musical style is conventional, but Sviridov has a knack of hitting upon striking and memorable ideas. The work is a sort of Russian autumn journey, not rivalling Schubert in its scope, but invoking similar pictures of villages in the frost, circling flocks of geese, maple trees and willows. Hvorostovsky sang the piece with such passion and imagination that he may have made it sound better than it really is. If only his accompanist, Mikhail Arkadiev, did not hammer away so.</p>

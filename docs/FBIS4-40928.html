			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 5, RIA -- The main parties to the  Bosnian conflict should step over their differences and realise  the need for the resumption of the Geneva cease-fire talks,  Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin said in an exclusive  interview with a RIA correspondent. Churkin is just back from  Geneva where a meeting between the leaders of the warring  parties and the main intermediaries in the Bosnian settlement  was to be held.    The attempt to resume the cease-fire talks has failed  because  of the stance of the Bosnian Moslem leaders. The latter claim  that the Serbs have not fulfilled their obligations with regard  to Gorazde. Moslems demand the withdrawal of Serbian troops from  Gorazde.    "On Saturday [4 June], Yasushi Akashi, special envoy of the  UN secretary-general, arrived at the conclusion that the Serbs  have fulfilled all the conditions with regard to Gorazde. The  Moslem leaders, however, decided that this was not enough to  resume the talks," Churkin said. He said that he was sorry that  the Bosnian Moslem leaders assumed such a position on the  resumption of the Geneva talks. It is so important to ensure a  reliable ceasefire that the parties drawn into the Bosnian  conflict should revise their own positions in the name of the  resumption of the talks, he went on.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (13): Monetary policy moves over / A look at the Bank of France LIKE an erratic sea-captain, Edouard Balladur is having to tack back and forth between the Scylla of budget deficits and the Charybdis of economic recession. But at least Edmond Alphandery - his first mate - has found a way to keep inflation down - by handing monetary policy over to the Bank of France. Parliamentary debate on the historic project to give the Bank of France autonomy in setting monetary policy started inauspiciously on June 8. Most of the central bank's staff were outside the National Assembly, protesting at what they saw as the lack of employment guarantees; inside the Palais Bourbon the extreme left and right joined together to denounce the government for abdicating its monetary sovereignty to faceless central bankers. 'One cannot serve two masters: the French people and money,' thundered Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, who has now left the Socialist party on the grounds that it has forsaken true socialism. Cheering him on from the conservative benches was, among others, Mr Jean de Gaulle, the late general-president's grandson. But it was quickly clear that the new statute for the Bank of France would have no difficulty winning parliamentary approval. Mindful, however, of the divisions that exist within the government majority over Maastricht, Mr Alphandery, the economy minister, has been at pains to stress two points. First, France would have a strong interest in giving its central bank autonomy in deciding on interest rates and the money supply, even if there were no Maastricht treaty to oblige it eventually to move in this direction. 'We can only rejoice that our European obligations happen to converge with our own internal self-interest,' he told parliament. Those countries (apart from Japan) which gave their central banks the most independence were also those with the lowest inflation. Second, the model chosen is distinctively Gallic. It owes little to either Germany's Bundesbank or the US Federal Reserve system. This assuages rather than aggravates French nationalist sentiment, at the same time incurring minimum change in how the Bank of France has developed since Napoleon set it up in 1800. In general terms, the Bank of France will keep its multifarious activities, which give it the largest staff of any central bank in Europe. Its 17,189 employees will continue to compile their enormous array of data on French companies and their debtors, to provide management advice to industry, to run the country's payment clearing system, to supervise commercial banks, and even to conduct some commercial banking themselves. The concern of the staff at the Bank of France's headquarters on rue de la Vrilliere in Paris, and the 212 branches around the country, has been that Mr Alphandery did not sufficiently guarantee in the new statute that all these activities would be maintained. Some activities, such as management consultancy, had started since the previous Bank of France law of 1973. Despite the June 8 strike, most staff concerns seem unfounded. Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the governor, has been adamant that the bank's scope of activity should be maintained, particularly in regulating commercial banks. He stoutly resists any idea that France should ape the German system which confides monetary policy to the Bundesbank and banking supervision to a separate office in Berlin. The sole change of emphasis, outside monetary policy-making, is that the Bank will henceforth not try to expand its own commercial banking activity. At present, the Bank of France holds some 100,000 accounts, mainly for its own staff but also for some companies. This number has not grown for some years, but the French Association of Banks had long complained about unfair competition from the central bank. In all these activities the government will continue to maintain its operational links with the central bank. Not so, of course, in monetary policy, which henceforth is to be run by a special committee. Mr Alphandery describes it as a 'sanctuary' (because of the way its members will be shielded from political interference). The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will have nine members - the governor and his two deputies (appointed by the government for renewable six year terms), together with six outsiders. The latter would also be appointed by the government, but from a short list of 18 provided by various parliamentary and judicial bodies. They will serve staggered nine year terms which cannot be renewed or revoked (except for serious venal offence). No MPC can have another job during his or her term, nor anything but a public function for three years after retiring. The structure is clear. But certain ambiguities will only become clearer over time. Article 1 of the law set the Bank's goal as 'ensuring price stability', but goes on to say that this should be 'in the framework of the government's general economic policy.' There is potential for conflict here. Nor is there any definition of price stability. That, says Mr Alphandery, would be for the Bank of France to judge, just as the Bundesbank does. Another grey area lies between the clear role of the government in setting overall exchange rate policy concerning the European Monetary System parity and fluctuation bands, and the Bank's clear role in deciding day-to-day intervention in the foreign exchange markets. The law is also silent on accountability. But Mr Alphandery says he expects it to lead to more openness about monetary policy, with the governor probably testifying to parliament twice a year, as the US Fed chairman does, and holding press conferences, as Bundesbank presidents do.</p>

Kennedy, has died at his Manhattan home after what a Kennedy family spokesman  described only as a long illness. He was 62 when he died Sunday.  </P> <P> Smith, the husband of Jean Kennedy Smith and a financial analyst, managed  Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign and served as adviser to members of  America's most famous family. He also aided the development in Boston of the  John F. Kennedy Library.  </P> <P> "For 34 years, from the day he married Jean, Steve was like a brother in our  family," said Sen. Edward M. (Ted) Kennedy (D-Mass.), who was with Smith when  he died. "He was the wisest adviser and the most skillful campaign manager and  the best friend that any of us ever had.  </P> <P> "There wouldn't have been a Camelot without Steve Smith."  </P> <P> Smith also managed the Senate campaigns of Edward Kennedy and his assassinated  brother, Robert.  </P> <P> Besides his wife, Smith is survived by two sons and two daughters, all of whom  were with him at his death.  </P></p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Ukrainians take wintery road to market: Matthew Kaminski finds despair in Kiev as economic reforms send prices soaring At the Khreshatyk metro station in central Kiev, a new monthly transport pass was pasted behind a grimy window, with the price scribbled in pencil. 'Today it's 175,000,' a middle-aged woman laughed scornfully. Last month it was 20,000 coupons (about 20 US cents). 'I don't know how we're going to live through this,' she said. Across Kiev this week, drastic price increases affected transport, rents, utilities and food, along with other retail goods under an IMF-tailored austerity programme unveiled by President Leonid Kuchma last month. The price increases are the clearest indication yet that painful 'shock therapy' market reform, which was pioneered by Poland five years ago and is already transforming the economy of much of eastern Europe, has finally made it to Ukraine. Earning an average monthly wage of around 2.3m coupons (about Dollars 23), Ukrainians are in for a painful passage into the market economy. But if Kiev's leaders - emulating their neighbours in Warsaw, Prague and Tallinn - can ignore public grumbling long enough to put into place the remaining pieces of a comprehensive reform programme, their country could have a chance to join in the economic boom now taking off in the more progressive nations of eastern Europe. This week's metro fare increase was accompanied by a drastic 10-fold rise in the price of trolley and tram tickets, and a seven-fold increase in rents, and utilities. Food prices varied across regions, but with state subsidies completely turned off they are also set to rise quickly. The first wave of price increases is due to be followed by another on January 1. Ukrainian wages and pensions went up last month, but only to 80 per cent of expected price increases. 'It's impossible to live on our salaries,' said Mrs Olha Stepanovich, a teacher who shops at the popular Vladimirsky market. 'Only a businessman can afford tomatoes for 150,000 coupons per kilogram. So most people just do not eat well.' Ukraine's social fabric is already stretched thin. The country has Europe's lowest minimum wage and highest hidden unemployment rate. The average real wage is down 70 per cent since 1990. However, many supplement their incomes in the black economy which, by one count, makes up 60 per cent of economic activity. However, as in Poland during 'shock therapy', people expect to improvise and survive. 'It's hard but we get by,' said Mrs Valentina Mykhailovych, a pensioner, standing outside a state bread store on Karl Marx Street. 'My son has a dacha outside Kiev where he grows vegetables. So my husband and I get fresh potatoes and carrots.' Factories have been hit hard, with higher oil and coal prices and an inability to acquire cheap dollars to import energy. Many enterprises are expected to close and lay off workers. State spending cuts also are needed to reduce Ukraine's large budget deficit. Reformers hope the pain will be brief - and checked by high interest rates to stop inflation. They are also relying on foreign capital being lured back as the currency stabilises and supplies of Russian and Turkmen energy are guaranteed - bought with western aid such as the Dollars 371m IMF loan approved last week. But Mr Kuchma recognises the public disquiet. 'To my great regret, ordinary people will not be affected by the arrival of this small amount (the IMF loan),' he said. 'That is why I appeal to our people to have more patience.' The president also knows western donors, sitting on up to Dollars 4bn in aid, have little patience. Ukraine must implement the first radical macroeconomic reforms in the next nine weeks to qualify for further IMF aid. Talks on a Dollars 1.5bn stand-by begin later this month. But the political opposition is gathering steam, too. Parliament, dominated by a communist coalition, called an emergency session for tomorrow to discuss the price rises. Organised labour, quiet since last year's coal strikes, this week threatened to walk out in protest against price increases and low, or often unpaid, wages. Mr Kuchma yesterday succeeded in convincing municipal leaders to implement bread price increases in all regions after widespread resistance to implementing his decrees. At the Karl Marx bread store, the night delivery man shrugged his shoulders as he unloaded the daily rye: 'Sadly, all these changes are needed.'</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SKY ABOVE, THE CHURCH BELOW  </P> <P> Looks as if the Rev. Robert Schuller really does have enormous influence in  high places. No one else has been able to stop aerial spraying of malathion in  his neighborhood. But Schuller did, and more than divine intervention, that  takes big-time political clout.  </P> <P> It seems that state agricultural officials ordered the helicopter pilots who  were sprayinga 36-square-mile area in Orange County Jan. 25 to spare Schuller's  famous Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove from an aerial shower of malathion.  And to date that's been the only exemption granted by the authorities in the  increasingly controversial and widespread spraying program to eradicate the  Mediterranean fruit fly from the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> One can hardly blame Schuller for requesting the cease-fire. (A pastor needs  always to look out for the physical as well as the spiritual health of his  flock). Indeed, many thousands of people would surely have liked similar  dispensation. The issue is the state's decision. Schuller got special  consideration, say officials, because on the night of the scheduled spraying of  that area, Schuller was hosting a conference at the Crystal Cathedral and had a  large outdoor dinner scheduled under a tent on church grounds.  </P> <P> Perhaps the official concern is understandable, but what of other,  less-well-connected people who may have been outdoors in the same area that  night? Say, the many homeless people unprotected in Garden Grove's Pioneer  Park? Moreover, the church grounds are less than 2 miles from where a Medfly  was found last month, and is well within the designated spray zone. The grounds  also contain an ample number of trees, shrubs and flower gardens.  </P> <P> It was wrong to make an exemption for the Crystal Cathedral. The decision only  adds to the controversy over spraying and undermines public confidence in the  state's claim that the spraying, which they say is absolutely necessary, poses  no health risks. The exception also raises another question: If the state  believes it is all right to exempt one property within a spray area, is the  need for widespread, blanket spraying really as critical as the state  agriculture officials claim it is?  </P> <P> No doubt officials will insist that the answer is yes, and continue to fight  all efforts to stop aerial malathion spraying. Perhaps they're right. And,  perhaps they now rue the night they made a no doubt well-intentioned exception  for a popular and influential public figure. At least we hope so.  </P></p>

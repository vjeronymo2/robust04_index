The district attorney Gligor Serafimovski confirmed this  information to MIC. However, he denied that Emini was  transferred from prison in Skopje to the state polyclinic, due  to heart difficulties.    MIC found out that the court proceedings of the group of  Albanians, including an Albanian with Macedonian and U.S.  citizenship, all indicted under the same charges, are expected  to begin toward the end of this week.    Toward the beginning of last November, the Macedonian police  arrested the Deputy Minister of Defense Husein Haskaj, together  with a larger group of Albanians, under the suspicion of  smuggling arms and organizing paramilitary and parapolice  organizations in Macedonia.    The Minister of the Interior Ljubomir Frckovski stated, at  the time, that "there is a founded suspicion that the Deputy  Minister of Defense Haskaj was involved in the expert estimation  and giving advice to a foreign state, which is in the sphere of  giving out state secrets." The Ministry of Defense denied this  information and explained that Haskaj did not have at his  disposal information about the defense plan of the Republic of  Macedonia.    Frckovski also denied that an arsenal of 300 automatic guns  were found on the suspects, but only 35. Frckovski also denied  that a list of 20,000 recruits of the Albanian paramilitary in  Macedonia was also found on the people arrested. "It is quite  possible," Frckovski said, "that the arrested individuals were  preparing a concept for organized paramilitary action."    The police then announced that this was otherwise the fourth  cut off arms smuggling channel in Macedonia. The first had come  from Croatia through Bulgaria, the second from FRY through  Bulgaria, and third through Salonika, into Macedonia.</p>

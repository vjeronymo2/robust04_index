			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN'S PLANS TO BOOST CHIP OUTPUT RAISE FEAR OF GLUT;  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: WITH ITS INVESTMENT, AND COMPETITION FROM OTHER NATIONS, SUPPLY IS  LIKELY TO EXCEED DEMAND -- AND EXACERBATE RELATIONS.  </P> <P> In their mad rush to position themselves for the next wave of microchip  production, Japan's giant semiconductor firms may end up clogging the market  just as they did five years ago.  </P> <P> The companies are pouring money into building production capacity that will  likely exceed demand, a situation that in the mid-1980s forced them to dump  chips at low prices and sparked a trade dispute with the United States.  </P> <P> But the firms say they remember their history and are not condemned to repeat  it. "We have learned a lot from that mistake, and now we know how to control  prices and balance demand and supply," a Toshiba Corp. spokesman said. "We will  not make the same mistake."  </P> <P> Some industry analysts are not so sure. They say fierce competition in the  memory chip game -- from U.S. and European manufacturers as well as new  entrants in South Korea and Taiwan -- will eat away at Japan's control of the  market for four-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) microchips.  </P> <P> "Their investments are so great, they will lose money unless they crank the  chips out. There will be significant oversupply of four-megabit DRAMs by  mid-1991," said Chuck Goto, senior analyst at S. G. Warburg Securities (Japan).  </P> <P> Total Japanese capital investment in these chips will reach $1.7 billion by  December this year, which will enable a total monthly production of about 20  million chips by year-end, another analyst estimated.  </P> <P> Barring an unexpected upturn in the U.S. personal computer market, that amount  will far exceed demand, according to Dataquest, a U.S. market research firm.  </P> <P> Global demand for four-megabit DRAMs will be less than 25 million units for all  1990 and will rise to 119 million in 1991 and 400 million in 1992, Dataquest  said.  </P> <P> Production by South Korean, Taiwanese, U.S. and European firms could further  bloat the microchip market.  </P> <P> "Japanese makers are likely to control their production, but there is still  concern about oversupply," said an analyst at a Japanese research institute.  </P> <P> Companies outside Japan also have invested massive sums to compete for memory  chip technology, one of the foundations of the electronics industry.  </P> <P> Fortunately for Japan's rivals, demand for four-megabit DRAMs has grown more  slowly than expected. This lag has given competitors time to close in on  Japan's waning technological lead.  </P> <P> All the players want to boost output to reduce costs per unit, which would  allow them to cut prices in hopes of gaining market share.  </P> <P> Already, soft prices for four-megabit DRAMs are pressuring novice chip makers  to outproduce their venerable rivals. Japanese firms may then have no choice  but to produce more too, thus increasing excess supplies.  </P> <P> Many industry analysts, however, believe that this time Japanese firms will not  be left holding the overflowing supply bag that caused them huge losses in the  mid-'80s.  </P> <P> The glut hit U.S. firms even harder, forcing many out of business. Washington,  angered by Japanese dumping, negotiated the 1986 Japan-U.S. semiconductor pact  in which Tokyo pledged not to sell chips below cost and to improve access to  its domestic market.  </P> <P> Tokyo now prizes its relations with the United States and would rather suffer a  slight erosion of its market share than risk Washington's wrath, some analysts  say.  </P> <P> "There is almost no possibility of oversupply of four-megabit DRAMs in the near  future," said Shigeru Yoshinaka, an analyst at Wako Research Institute of  Economics.  </P></p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: US consortium buys Astra's remaining assets THE LAST remaining assets of Astra Holdings, the munitions and fireworks maker which went into receivership earlier this year, have been sold. The disposal to a US consortium, led by Lion Holdings Corporation, has saved about 1,000 jobs. The businesses involved are: Astra Holdings Corporation, the US holding company. Tennessee-based Kilgore Corporation, which makes infra-red decoy flares and ammunition. Accudyne Corporation of Wisconsin, which makes armament fuses for the defence industry; and Acculyte of Virginia, which makes electronic circuitry. Astra, which is being investigated by the Department of Trade and Industry, went into receivership in February, owing Pounds 50m to five banks. Its principal UK subsidiary, BMARC, was sold to Royal Ordnance, in April for just under Pounds 10m. Its other UK subsidiary, Haley &amp; Weller, was sold to Chemring Group in July. The other US business, Astra Precision Products, was sold to a US fund in June. The disposals to date have raised about Pounds 30m. Although more money will be raised from selling some properties, the total will be short of the banks' exposure, so shareholders will receive nothing.</p>

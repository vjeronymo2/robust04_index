			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos expressed  optimism for the outcome of the EU [European Union] Commission's  appeal to the European Court for temporary measures against  Greece on the embargo against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. Among other things, Venizelos  said on Athens radio that Greece has strong arguments for the  European Court to reject the EU commission's appeal.  Correspondent Nina Asimakopoulou has the following report:    [Begin recording] [Venizelos] The Republic of Greece,  through  its representatives, has presented all its legal arguments, a  huge reserve of arguments, and all its political arguments,  because the issue is primarily political.    Our first argument is that the issue is political and one  that is associated with foreign policy and security in the  southern Balkans, sources of tension in an area that is already  tense. As is evident, a similar evaluation of developments  cannot be done by a judicial body but by a political one, and  this is why the EU Commission dealt with the issue politically  through the dispatch of Hans van den Broek, the EU commissioner  on foreign and security policy. In addition, the EU Commission  had asked for the opinion of the EU Council of Ministers that,  typically, was never given.    Our second argument is that there is no reason whatsoever to  consider the issue a priority, because the EU Commission delayed  any action for over two months by conducting a political  discussion around this issue. Also, the issue is dealt with  politically by the United Nations through Cyrus Vance's mission,  and by United States through the mission of Matthew Nimetz.    Our third argument is that there is no excessive use of  rights deriving from Article 224 of the EU Accord on behalf of  our country, because this regulation allows the assumption of  similar measures when there is international tension  constituting a threat of war. Of course all the above lead to  the rejection of the EU Commission's appeal that, and here is  the paradox, it claims harm Skopje, but not the EU, from  Greece's sanctions, even though there is a very small volume of  trade between EU and Skopje.    [Asimakopoulou] In other words, you are optimistic for the  outcome of the case, aren't you?    [Venizelos] Obviously I am optimistic, because our arguments  are very strong and this initiative by the EU Commission was  wrong.    [Asimakopoulou] If a sentence is issued against Greece, can  it be implemented? What would Greece do in such a case?    [Venizelos] There is no chance of a such a decision being  imposed. Such decisions have a symbolic character. Keep in  mind that we always talk about a process of temporary measures  that is not the main procedure, and it is not accidental that  all these have defused the EU Commission's political pressure on  this issue.

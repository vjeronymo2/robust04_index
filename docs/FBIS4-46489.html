			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Yermolin under "Events and Commentary" </F> rubric: "The 18-Trillion Ruble Contest: Will Appreciation of  the Country's Security Interests Prevail?"]    [Text] Again, for the umpteenth time in the last month,  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA is addressing the problem of the defense budget  for the current year, 1994. This week the State Duma -- if it  does not again, for some reason, have to change the agenda -- is  to complete discussion of the draft Law "On the Federal Budget  for 1994." As readers will be aware, military expenditure has  been the focus of discussion. The government draft law  specifies a figure of 37 trillion for it. Precisely this number  of rubles [R] is, in the opinion of the drafters of the law,  quite sufficient to cover actual defense expenditure. The  Defense Ministry regards R55 trillion as the minimum sum. Since  the State Duma passed the first reading of the government  version 11 May, the Russian president, the head of the Russian  Government, and the Federation Council have come out in favor of  allocating the missing R18 trillion. A number of parliamentary  factions and committees have also deemed it necessary to stress  publicly their agreement with the military. These include the  Committee on Economic Policy.    I would remind readers that this committee, in the person of  its chairman, Sergey Glazyev, did try to "bump up" the defense  budget to R55 trillion during the first reading. Many deputies  voted in favor at the time, but the requisite number of votes  failed to be mustered. Recommendations on the draft Law "On the  Federal Budget for 1994" have now been prepared in the bowels of  the Committee on Economic Policy. The amendments proposed by  the committee affect a number of items in the draft law,  including those coming under the "National Defense" heading.  The proposed breakdown of military expenditure reads as  follows: upkeep of the Armed Forces -- R28 trillion; arms and  military hardware purchases -- R11.1 trillion; research and  development -- R5.1 trillion; capital construction -- R7.1  trillion; Ministry of Atomic Energy expenditure -- R1.2  trillion; servicemen's pensions -- R2.5 trillion. A total of  R55 trillion. The following question will thus be put  point-blank during the second reading: CAN DEFENSE EXPENDITURE  BE INCREASED WITHOUT IN SO DOING INCREASING THE BUDGET DEFICIT?    Sergey Glazyev believes it can. The committee's  recommendations name two main sources of extra revenue: revenue  derived from the privatization of federally owned facilities,  and revenue derived from the abolition of concessions on  export-import duties. The first accounts for an increase of  R13.7 trillion, the second -- R6.6 trillion.    In Glazyev's opinion, the sum to be derived from  privatization indicated in the government draft is unjustifiably  low. "Judge for yourself," the deputy says. "The nominal value  of the state property undergoing privatization for money is R120  trillion. The market assessment, from the standpoint of the  profitability of the property, is R15 trillion. The export side  of Gazprom alone, which it has been resolved to privatize this  year, is R100 trillion, while the government is planning to  obtain a little more than R1 trillion in revenue from  privatization." Moreover, Glazyev is convinced that a number of  other opportunities to obtain revenue from the privatization of  property are still not being taken into account. For example,  the privatization of plots of land on which enterprises  undergoing privatization are sited, which is contained in the  draft program, will yield quite a lot of revenue, particularly  as the bulk of the enterprises is located within the boundaries  of the big cities, where the price of land is climbing rapidly.  As people will know, many enterprises were privatized with the  state retaining a block of 20 to 51 percent of the shares, but,  according to the parliamentarian, "The State Committee for the  Management of State Property has not given to date any  intelligible figures on the placement of these shares or the  dividends obtained on them." Sergey Glazyev regards the sum of  R15 trillion as a low estimate of the revenue from privatization  and the commercial use of state property provided, of course,  that, in accordance with the officially announced intentions, we  end the stage of free "voucher" privatization and instill order  in the milieu of state property management.    It must be stressed that Glazyev and his colleagues are  talking not so much about lost privatization opportunities as  fundamental changes in its implementation. They insist that the  privatization program be implemented by decisions of the owner  (the state).    As far as export-import duties are concerned, the potential  here, in the opinion of the Committee on Economic Policy, lies  not just in abolishing the illegally awarded concessions but in  "boosting budgetary revenue by reducing the smuggling in of  goods worth several billion dollars per annum." Establishing  currency control and preventing the export of capital could also  provide extra budget revenue by reducing shady transactions. I  think that when Glazyev, a former minister of foreign economic  relations, cites the $20 billion to $30 billion which Russian  entrepreneurs keep in foreign bank accounts, he knows what he is  talking about. The injection of even half that money into  Russia's economy would substantially boost economic activity and  augment the revenue side of the budget.    It should be noted that the recommendations of the Committee  on Economic Policy are designed not just to boost the defense  budget but also expenditure on state support for sectors of the  national economy, sociocultural measures, science, medicine, and  the implementation of international treaties to scrap, reduce,  and limit arms. And all this through additional revenue in the  light of the priorities declared in the president's message to  the Federal Assembly. Through, as Sergey Glazyev put it, a  "more assiduous" attitude toward state property.    It is clear that Sergey Glazyev expresses the views of a  particular economic school, and his political allegiances are  also entirely specific -- he is a member of the Democratic Party  of Russia faction -- but another thing is clear too: The  interests of national security should not be alien to any  political force. And the question then arises: WHY HAS IT BEEN  DECIDED TO COMBAT THE BUDGET DEFICIT AT THE ARMY'S EXPENSE?    There is no shortage of public assurances by statesmen that  they understand the problems of the Armed Forces and share the  concern over the future of the defense sector and its scientific  and technical potential. But when the time comes to allocate  the money, it becomes clear that the idea of "shock savings" on  defense needs is close to the heart of quite a number of  government members and parliamentarians. And it is the defense  budget which is the focus of attention of government and Duma  debates. In our search for an answer as to why the army is so  blithely made the scapegoat for everything, including economic  blunders, we have already given a platform to people of the most  diverse political persuasion. Here is Sergey Glazyev's opinion.    The government is deliberately pursuing an  expenditure-cutting policy. Not just the Armed Forces, but  higher education, health care, science, and so forth are being  underfinanced. The shadow sector continues to submerge the  economy, and tax revenues are declining even more quickly than  output. But even in this situation the government pursues the  goal of lowering inflation by reducing the budget deficit and  the amount of credit issued.    This policy is based on the naive belief that, in accordance  with monetarist ideas on the economy, all the remaining problems  will sort themselves out automatically. If we maintain a small  budget deficit, inflation will fall, investment and output will  pick up, budget revenue will increase, and there will also be  money for expenditure. In reality, everything in our country is  heading in the opposite direction: output is in decline, budget  revenue is falling, budget expenditure is also falling,  nonpayment is on the increase, and inflation is intensifying; to  overcome inflation they lower the budget deficit -- and  expenditure shrinks even further, output falls, and so forth.  As the well-known proverb has it, an idiot can't do anything  right. Moreover, such a policy proves to be both convenient  (you can do nothing -- keep the budget deficit down and wait  until output picks up) and advantageous (you always have the  choice of whom to give to and whom not -- and, furthermore,  without any responsibility). Hence the desire to reduce  expenditure.    In Glazyev's opinion, those whose interests are poorly  represented in the government leadership are the first to come  under attack. That is to say, we are talking about a relatively  new phenomeneon in our life, namely, lobbying. It transpires  that the economic advisability and significance for the state of  a particular program are sidelined -- the main thing is to get  busy with your elbows. The army -- like, say, scientists,  doctors, and teachers -- has not learned this yet. But again a  question comes to mind: IF THE PRESIDENT, THE PRIME MINISTER,  AND THE FEDERATION COUNCIL HAVE COME OUT IN FAVOR OF A  R55-TRILLION DEFENSE BUDGET, WHO THEN IS AGAINST?    So far the State Duma has been against. But Sergey Glazyev  cannot entirely accept this, if only because the Duma passed  without discussion, on trust, as it were, the budget presented  by the government for the second quarter of the current year.  And all the holdups in financing the ratified articles [of the  budget] during the first six months of the year in no way stem  from the Duma. I asked Sergey Yuryevich how actively the  government cooperated with the parliamentary committees in the  runup to the second reading. After all, the press had reported  the stance of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the intentions  of Russian Head of Government Viktor Chernomyrdin "to tinker  with the defense budget." It is logical to suppose that, after  that, joint work with government representatives was in full  swing in the Duma committees. It turns out there was nothing of  the kind. No fundamental modifications of the defense budget  were proposed by the government. "The paradox of today's  situation," according to Sergey Glazyev, "is that it is the  Finance Ministry's decisions rather than presidential edicts or  government decrees that are actually being carried out today.  The Finance Ministry plays the same role in the state today as  the CPSU Central Committee once did." All the budget-financed  sectors are now dependent on the whim of Finance Ministry  functionaries. The budget, however, is an instrument of  statewide policy. The government answers -- must answer -- for  its preparation and execution. For the time being, however,  according to Glazyev, "the real money is received by those who  know how decisions are made in the Finance Ministry and are  consequently able to influence them."    Clearly, it has to be understood that the future of the  defense sector and indeed of the entire Armed Forces is decided  by financiers today. And they alone. And even if the Duma does  ratify defense expenditure of R55 trillion, it could well be  that no more than R37 trillion actually ends up in the defense  coffers.    SO, WILL THE STATE DUMA RATIFY A "SUBSISTENCE MINIMUM" FOR  THE ARMED FORCES OR NOT?    Sergey Glazyev hopes that it will, although there are more  than enough grounds for pessimism: We are, after all, talking  about altering the correlation of the revenue and expenditure  sides. And this correlation was already ratified during the  first reading. Consequently, either the budget adoption  procedures will have to be violated or new, extrabudgetary funds  acquired. And, of course, departmental interests (interests  encumbered, moreover, by political considerations) will tell  here. Admittedly, the Budget Committee -- an opponent of the  Defense and Economic Policy Committees -- has already agreed to  add another R4 trillion to the defense budget. A half-measure,  to be sure, but movement for all that.    The main thing, Sergey Glazyev told me as we parted, is not  to build up illusions -- if the State Duma doesn't give the army  and the defense sector the R18 trillion, no one else will  provide them. Neither the president nor the government has any  "hidden reserves."    Consequently, the sole hope is that the interests of  national  security, and no others, will now prevail in the State Duma.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At the invitation of [name, words indistinct],  mayor of Christchurch, New Zealand and (Chelnek), governor of  the Australian State of Victoria, a friendly five-member  government delegation led by Governor Zhang Wule departed  Lanzhou yesterday for official friendly visits to New Zealand  and Australia. The 10th anniversary of the establishment of  sister-city ties between Gansu and Christchurch is 22 April  1994. Governor Zhang Wule will attend the celebration  activities sponsored by Christchurch.    In the last 10 years, our province and the city of  Christchurch have conducted extensive exchange and cooperation  in such areas as economics, trade, science and technology,  education, and culture, thereby promoting mutual understanding  and friendship between the peoples of China and New Zealand.    In recent years, our province and the State of Victoria, in  Australia, have made comparatively great advances in economic  cooperation and friendly relations. Our province has set up  trading companies, livestock farms, and Chinese-product shopping  malls in the state. These enterprises serve as an important  window through which our province is developing the Australian  market. Last year, the city of Tianshui established ties of  friendship and cooperation with the city of [name indistinct] in  Victoria. Zhang Wule's current visit to Victoria will have a  positive impact on further expanding the friendly relations  between our province and the State of Victoria, and on opening  more channels of cooperation in Australia.    Vice Governor Chen Qiling and persons in charge of relevant  departments went to the Zhongshan Airport to see the delegation  off. Vice Governors Guo Kun and Cui Zhenghua shook hands with  and said good-bye to Governor Zhang Wule at the gate of the  government office building.</p>

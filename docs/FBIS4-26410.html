			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 10 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The Chinese  Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently formulated  management regulations on raising and lowering the prices of  metallurgical products. The main points are as follows:    1. Raising or lowering metallurgical product prices is an  important component of metallurgical product prices. These  prices are verified by the state according to the users' needs  and product quality on the basis of the existing or partially  promulgated state criteria for metallurgical products. Whether  an enterprise increases or reduces its metallurgical product  prices must be based on the user's proposal, and the lowered or  raised prices must be clarified in the contract that is signed.    2. The names, sizes, physical properties, chemical  components, and specifications of products listed in the  catalogue of "ex-factory prices of metallurgical products" are  governed by the existing or partially promulgated state  criteria. If the names, sizes, physical properties, chemical  components, or specifications of metallurgical products are not  covered by the existing or partially promulgated state criteria,  the enterprise's criteria or the technical requirements set by  both parties' agreement can be taken as the basis.    3. Raising or lowering the state-set or state-guided prices  of products must strictly proceed in accordance with the  catalogue of "ex-factory prices of metallurgical products." If  an enterprise reduces a product's chemical component according  to its internally controlled criteria for production, changes  its workmanship, improves its precision, or increases its  inspection, but does not do so at the user's request, it cannot  raise the product's price.    4. Raising or lowering the state-set prices of products must  proceed under the management of the Ministry of Metallurgical  Industry; localities or enterprises are not allowed to change  prices without authorization.    5. Raising or lowering the market prices of iron and steel  products must be discussed by both parties and explained in  their purchase and sales contracts.</p>

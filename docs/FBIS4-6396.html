			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Apr 19 (ANTARA) -- Concern over a drastic  drop in the rupiah's value against the US dollar is unfounded,  head of money market and checking account affairs at the Central  Bank, Bank Indonesia, Dahlan Sutalaksana, said to journalists  here Monday. "Therefore, the rush to purchase US dollars in  large quantities is only an act of speculation spurred by  irresponsible rumours," he said.    Economic observers have said that 500 million US dollars  worth of rupiahs have been exchanged into US currency recently  due to a statement made by a government official saying that  although the rupiah will not be devalued, its depreciation will  accelerate to 6 percent in 1994/95 as against the expected 3 to  4 percent.    In previous years, the depreciation of the rupiah against  the  US dollar never rose above 6 percent, in 1990 the depreciation  was 5.9 percent, in 1991 4.8 percent, in 1992 3.5 percent and in  1993 3.8 percent.    Sutalaksana, who is now in charge of the development of the  capital market at the Ministry of Finance, said that both  domestically and overseas the rupiah's exchange rate against the  US dollar has been stable and is likely to remain so.    He also pointed out that the domestic real interest rate is  stable in comparison with countries like the United States,  Western Europe and Japan, ruling out the likelihood of capital  flight overseas.    It is expected that declining oil prices will not cause an  accelerated depreciation of the rupiah against the US dollar, he  said.    "The role of oil in our state's budget is only 30 percent,  so  if the oil prices drop the effect is insignificant, unlike in  1986 when the role of oil in the state's budget reached 80  percent," he said.    Regarding export value, he said that although the percentage  dropped, the nominal value increased.    In 1992 export value grew by 23 billion US dollars, an  increase of 28 percent over 1991, and in 1993 it rose by 28  billion US dollars, up by 20 percent over 1992.    The government has also successfully cut down on imports  which grew by 8 percent in 1992 and by only 7 percent in 1993.    "Our foreign exchange reserves are sufficient for 5 months  worth of imports, so there is no reason for the value of the  rupiah to be depreciated against US dollar at present," he added.    Sutalaksana attributed the present purchase of large  quantities of US dollars to the current hajj pilgrimage.    "We have some 157,000 hajj pilgrims. If one hajj pilgrim  requires 1,000 US dollars, then the quantities of US dollar  purchases will certainly be big," he said.,</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpts] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has declared that  the next few months will constitute a turning point in the  struggle against terrorism and for the unity and integrity of  the country. These issues will soon cease to occupy the top of  the country's agenda, she said. Ciller noted that this will  allow for increased efforts to improve the economy, which has  been drained by the struggle against terrorism.    In a news conference in Ankara today, Ciller recalled that  terrorism was at the top of the country's agenda when the  government assumed power seven to eight months ago. Citing  examples of newspaper headlines on terrorist incidents published  at the time, Ciller explained that the state is now able to  significantly counter terrorism. The prime minister said that  during this period, the government attacked the terrorist PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization's financial resources  and, to a large extent, put a stop to the organization's  narcotics smuggling activities. Some of the specially trained  antiterror teams have also been sent to the region, she added.  Recalling that the banning of the PKK in many countries also  occurred in this period, Ciller announced: The next few months  will constitute a turning point in the struggle against the PKK  and in protecting the unity and integrity of the country. These  issues will drop to the bottom of the agenda, she said. [passage  omitted]    Commenting on economic issues, the prime minister stated  that  when the government came to power, the growth rate was zero, the  inflation rate was 78 percent, the struggle against terrorism  drained 26 trillion Turkish lira, and the policy of subsidies no  longer served its original goals. Around the same time, Ciller  explained, the state economic enterprises, which employ 700,000  workers, showed a loss of 70-90 trillion Turkish lira; the  deficit of SST [Social Security Organization] was 24 trillion  Turkish lira and that of Bag-Kurt [Social Security Association  for Tradesmen, Artisans, and Independent Workers] was 6 trillion  Turkish lira; and the foreign currency rate adjustments were  kept below the rate of inflation. Ciller said that this  discrepancy in the currency adjustments and the debts accrued in  the past caused a public deficit of 217 trillion Turkish lira,  which must be paid by the people in the form of taxes.    Pointing out that the government assumed its duty with a  determination to break this vicious circle in the economy,  Ciller remarked that a certain distance has been covered in this  field as well. For the first time, the Treasury did not have to  borrow any money in January and February this year because the  state obtained new resources close to $5.5 million, thus  allowing existing debts to be stretched over longer terms.</p>

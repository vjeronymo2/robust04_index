			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTING UP FOR PLAYOFFS JUST FINE WITH THE NBA  </P> <P> Where does Mr. Stern draw the line when deciding where a team is putting forth  its best lineup? How many minutes must each starter play? Will he also decide  whether each player is giving his best effort? If Mr. Stern is going to hand  out fines for coaching decisions, he should explicitly state the rules, and not  leave it up to the coach to divine the league's vague expectations.  </P> <P> JAMES FRAZIER  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MALATHION CRITICS ADD ECONOMICS TO HEALTH ARGUMENT  </P> <P> Each time Medfly helicopters swoop down on Orange County, the local auto  dealership that Gary Jernegan runs has to spend $871 for workers to scrub down  hundreds of malathion-tarnished cars.  </P> <P> Rebecca Asano, manager of a local club called Reflections, isn't even bothering  to open the popular Vietnamese nightspot tonight during the latest round of  spraying, even though Thursdays are one of her busiest nights. "The last time  they sprayed, no one knew what was going on and everyone ran out scared," she  said.  </P> <P> Malathion critics and some local business people are beginning to complain more  stridently than ever as they shift and expand their attack on the state's  Medfly campaign from health concerns to financial woes.  </P> <P> Economics has long been the trump card of state officials in their assault on  the Mediterranean fruit fly, as they point vigorously to the necessity of  protecting California's $16-billion agriculture industry from the crop  attacker.  </P> <P> But some Southland malathion protesters, unable to sway state officials with  their allegations about malathion's health effects, are now trying to make the  Medfly a dollar-and-cents issue themselves.  </P> <P> Joined by some local business leaders, they claim the spraying could cost the  local economy millions of dollars in lost business. They plan to voice those  complaints for the first time formally today as part of a protest before the  scheduled spraying of a 36-square-mile area around Westminster and Garden  Grove.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, some people don't pay attention to an issue like this until it  affects their pocketbooks," said local resident Bob Taylor, a leader of Orange  County Citizens Against Malathion Spraying. "We know that money talks."  </P> <P> Malathion critics in Orange and Los Angeles counties are even considering a  fruit boycott. The idea got the backing of United Farm Workers President Cesar  Chavez, who discussed it with anti-malathion activists at a meeting in Burbank  earlier this week.  </P> <P> "As I see it," Chavez said in an interview Wednesday, "a lot of people are  pretty upset because they feel like their concerns have been completely  disregarded. (A boycott) would be a good way to do something about that."  </P> <P> But agriculture leaders counter-attacked Wednesday with a press conference of  their own to stress what they say is the safety and effectiveness of the  eradication effort, and to try to quell rising public protests.  </P> <P> Gathered at a scenic spot in front of an orange grove in Brea, leaders of the  Orange County Farm Bureau warned that if the Medfly is allowed to infest  Southern California permanently, farmers would spray thousands of pounds of  pesticides on their crops -- many times more than are now being used -- to  guard against maggots. And consumers have consistently said they want less  pesticide on their fruits, the farm representatives stressed.  </P> <P> If the state is not allowed to continue its eradication efforts, warned Alan  Reynolds, orchard manager for Treasure Farms in Irvine, "we are going to set  ourselves back a number of years" in the ongoing effort to reduce pesticide use  in agriculture.  </P> <P> Nanci M. Jimenez, Orange County Farm Bureau executive director, said: "This  issue has come to a head. And we're afraid the public is not getting both sides  of the debate."  </P> <P> But malathion critics insist they have heard both sides. And they conclude that  the effort is not worth the health or economic risks.  </P> <P> Kent Salholm, a Garden Grove chiropractor who is on the board of the city's  Chamber of Commerce, said he has heard from at least two dozen local merchants  who have expressed concern about the economic impact of the spraying. The  chamber called for an end to the spraying last month.  </P> <P> "The question is," Salholm said, "why should Garden Grove subsidize the  growers? That's really what we're doing.  </P> <P> Added Jernegan, general manager of the Garden Grove Hyundai dealership: "It's  costing me $871 every time they spray to hire outside help and wash all the  cars and soap 'em. That's expensive. . . . I don't appreciate it one bit."  </P> <P> Critics point to malls, shops, restaurants and schools in the eight-city spray  area around Garden Grove and Westminster that have had to close early on past  spray nights. They say the spraying may even have hurt some real estate values  in the spray area. And they say they are worried that nationwide publicity  about the spraying may scare away tourists if it continues through the popular  Garden Grove Strawberry Festival and into the summer season.  </P> <P> Lucien Truehill, president of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce, said: "If  the propaganda on both sides continues and it's built into a media event  through summer, I can see this having some real effect on tourists coming out.  Who wants to come for a vacation to a place getting all this kind of  publicity?"  </P> <P> Although local chambers of commerce said they have received some calls from  tourists concerned about the spraying, several large hotels in the area said  they have not suffered any real impact so far.  </P> <P> Orange County Citizens Against Malathion Spraying estimates a possible  $150-million loss to the local economy, although spraying critics concede that  estimates are based largely on anecdotal testimony from merchants and business  leaders. Several of those leaders will be turning out for a press conference  today before the 9 p.m. Garden Grove spraying.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tonight's Medfly Spraying  </P> <P> Helicopters are scheduled to spray a 36-square-mile area around sites where two  Medflies were found in the last three months. State officials say the malathion  pesticide is sae, but recommend that residents avoid being outside during the 9  p.m. spraying let pets in and cover their cars.  </P></p>

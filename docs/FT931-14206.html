			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Industry price rises exert strains on inflation policy MANUFACTURERS IN the UK are pushing up prices in the wake of sterling's devaluation, putting pressure on the government's anti-inflation strategy. Downing Street said yesterday it was confident the government's inflation target of between 1 and 4 per cent would be met, in spite of the spate of price rises. But one senior minister said: 'It is the old story. Companies seem to be throwing away their advantage, just when they should be strongly placed for recovery.' Price rises in the past few weeks include: More than 7 per cent on electrical goods from Siemens UK; 8 per cent on float glass from Pilkington; Up to 13 per cent on steel from British Steel; Up to 7.5 per cent on Ford cars; Up to 12.5 per cent on personal computers. Mr John Major yesterday reiterated to MPs the importance he attaches to reducing inflation, 'so we can create lasting jobs for the future'. Downing Street also said it expected price rises to be offset by price falls elsewhere. Manufacturers in hard-pressed industries such as building materials and chemicals expect no price increases until demand picks up. Ready-mixed Concrete, the cement maker, said: 'First we have to stop them falling'. However, importers of finished goods from the continent pointed out that devaluation meant cost increases in sterling terms of 15 per cent. The government had hoped that manufacturers would respond to devaluation by freezing prices and pushing up market share against imports, thus helping the balance of payments. However, Pilkington and British Steel have been losing money. It is not yet clear that all the mooted price rises will take effect. Pilkington and British Steel have tried to raise prices without success in the past few years. In glass, steel and personal computers prices have actually fallen sharply. In cars, it is not yet clear whether the latest price rises will be whittled away by discounts. However, the latest price rises from Ford come hard on the heels of a rise in October last year. Prices were also raised late last year by Rover and Vauxhall. Analysts said that industrial price increases could leave some companies exposed if the French franc were also forced to devalue. In addition, the deepening recession in continental Europe continues to push prices down in some products, thus offsetting the effects of devaluation for companies exporting to the UK. For the government, the dilemma is that if price increases fail to stick, it will be principally because the UK economy is not recovering as fast as companies hoped. In that case, industry's behaviour to date suggests that inflationary pressures will merely be postponed until recovery arrives. Recovery gamble, Page 8</p>

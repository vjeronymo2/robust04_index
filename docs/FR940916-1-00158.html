			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Meet or exceed current industry standards for brake system maintenance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Meet or exceed all requirements of this part; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Clearly identify those items or procedures that are safety critical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A railroad shall conduct maintenance in accordance with the procedures developed in paragraph (a) of this section. FRA shall enforce those items identified as safety critical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Train brake system maintenance shall be performed only by an individual qualified as a mechanical or electronic train brake system inspector who meets the qualification requirements of &sect;232.207 and &sect;232.209 or a person apprenticed to such an inspector acting under the inspector's direct supervision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) A qualified train brake system supervisor who meets the qualification requirements of &sect;232.205 shall perform frequent spot checks of all train brake system maintenance operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Prior to commencing revenue service of new train brake system technology, a railroad shall develop the maintenance plans and complete the tests and the demonstrations required by subpart J of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) A railroad proposing high speed service shall develop a train brake system inspection, maintenance, and test plan. This plan shall provide adequate technical detail on the train brake system inspection, maintenance and test procedures to be used to ensure safe train operation and to ensure the performance of the brake system does not deteriorate over time. The plan shall be submitted to FRA one year prior to planned commencement of revenue service. The plan is intended to be used as the basis for a set of safety standards tailored to the specific train brake system to be used. Such planned revenue service may not begin until FRA has approved the plan in writing. The plan shall be changed only when specifically agreed to by FRA. The plan shall become part of the safety standards that apply to the operation of the specific intermediate speed or high speed train to which the plan applies. FRA shall enforce compliance with the safety critical items identified in the plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart I_Operating Requirements for Train Brake Systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;232.801  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> General.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) A railroad shall develop, implement, and make available to FRA upon request written detailed operating requirements governing the safe operation of train brake systems over its railroad under all operating conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Railroads shall determine speed restrictions and issue train handling instructions based on air brake performance, tonnage and grade. Dynamic brake retarding force shall not be considered in determining speed restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The operating requirements contained in &sect;232.803 to &sect;232.811 and in &sect;232.815 to &sect;232.819 are applicable to all trains subject to this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;232.803  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Train information handling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) A railroad shall develop, implement, and make available to FRA upon request written procedures to ensure that a train crew employed by the railroad is given accurate information on the condition of the train brake system and train factors affecting brake system performance and testing when such crew takes over responsibility for the train. At a minimum, the procedures shall provide that each train crew coming on duty be informed of:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) On trains operating over 20 mph, the operational status of all dynamic brakes, including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The number of locomotive axles with operational dynamic brakes and their location in the train.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) An estimate of the total retarding force available from the dynamic brakes (as a function of speed in five mph increments covering the operational speed range of the train). Railroads shall develop and implement an accurate means to make this estimate by January 1, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The total weight and length of the train.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

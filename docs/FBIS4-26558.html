			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By M Y Sung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Beijing will develop alternative travel documents  for Hong Kong residents not eligible for Special Administrative  Region (SAR) passports after 1997 under proposals being studied  by the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC). The China-appointed  think-tank will also study a systematic plan for thousands of  mainland children with Hong Kong parents to return to the  territory.    The PWC's social security group ended a two-day session in  Beijing yesterday to draft a working agenda for the next six  months. The PWC social security group local leader Rita Fan said  an alternative to the SAR passport could be needed for residents  who had not gained permanent residency by living in the  territory for seven years. While details were yet to be  finalised, Mrs Fan said the documents would probably apply to  people who use Document of Identity (DI) as their travel papers.    Under the present system, about 1.5 million Hong Kong people  hold British Dependent Territory Citizen (BDTC) passports and  are able to apply for British National Overseas (BNO) passports.  Those who were not born in the territory, but obtained right of  abode after living here continuously for seven years, can use  the Certificate of Identity (CI) as their travel documents.  They are not entitled to apply for BDTC passports. People  living here who have not yet fulfilled the seven years  continuous residence requirement can use their original passport  or a Document of Identity (DI).    Mrs Fan said BNO and CI holders would be entitled to apply  for passports issued by the Special Administrative Region (SAR)  government. But DI holders-might not qualify.    The PWC would also focus on the fate of at least 75,000  mainland children who will be allowed into Hong Kong after 1997.  Under the Basic Law ethnic Chinese children born outside the  territory to Hong Kong permanent residents will have right of  abode in the territory. While the Hong Kong government has  extended the number of children allowed into the territory each  day there are still fears of a flood of immigrants on 1 July  1997. Mrs Fan said the PWC needed to make arrangements to allow  the systematic arrival of children in Hong Kong after 1997.</p>

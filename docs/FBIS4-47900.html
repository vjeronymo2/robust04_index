			<p>BFN     [Text] The general strike urged by the Federation of  Chadian Trade Unions and followed by Chadian civil servants  since 26 April in order to compel the government to sign a  social pact is still being observed. It spread yesterday to the  Posts and Telecommunications Corporation where employees have  stopped work. Journalists and technical personnel in the public  media are also on strike so radio and television are carrying  only minimal programming. The government has consequently asked  soldiers to operate these technical installations.</p>

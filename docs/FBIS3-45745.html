			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Jan 23 (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, Standing  Committee member of the Political Bureau and member of the  Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, gave an important  speech at the National Conference on Education of Party Members  this morning. He pointed out: The new situation and tasks  urgently ask us to further strengthen and improve education of  party members and raise the standards of the ranks in an  all-around way. Arming the vast numbers of party members with  the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics  constitutes the most important improvement in party members'  education in the new period. Successfully carrying out this task  will most effectively strengthen party member's education, push  forward party building in the ideological sphere and in all  other areas, and provide a stronger guarantee to the success of  our socialist modernization.    Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and Secretariat and secretary of the Central Discipline  Inspection Commission, attended the conference.    Hu Jintao said: In the course of leading us to blaze the  path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  begin a new undertaking, particularly in critical junctures,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping has time and again stressed the need to  build our party well. His thought on building the party in  power in the new period has greatly enriched and developed  theories on party building in Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong  Thought. We must earnestly learn and grasp his series of new  viewpoints, theses, and inventions to guide party building in  practice. After enumerating Comrade Deng Xiaoping's expositions  on strengthening the party's ideological building, improving  party members' education, and raising their standards, Hu Jintao  urged comrades involved in party building and party members'  education to systematically study Comrade Xiaoping's related  thoughts in his works, profoundly grasp their essence, integrate  them with the practice of conducting party education in previous  years, earnestly summarize the experience and lessons, further  raise their work standards, and more successfully carry out  their tasks in the future.    Hu Jintao stressed: In conducting party members' education,  we must regard arming the entire party with Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as a fundamental task and use it to help  accomplish other education tasks. He pointed out: Arming the  entire party with the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is a fundamental way to strengthen and improve  party building and raise party members' standards in an  all-around way. It has a bearing on whether the party's basic  theory and line will remain unchanged for 100 years and on the  future and destiny of our party, state, and nation. Party  organizations at all levels must work hard to carry out this  great ideological construction project vital to our fundamental  interests. At present, we must organize party members and  cadres to study the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping" in conjunction with the study and implementation of  the decisions of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee and direct them to use the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics to guide the practice of  reform -- accelerating the building of a socialist market  economy -- and seek tangible results on three issues: 1)  strengthen the determination and consciousness in building a  socialist market economic structure and developing a socialist  market economy, further unify our minds based on the guidelines  of the 14th National Party Congress and the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and firmly implement  the various policy decisions made by the central authorities to  promote reform; 2) work hard to acquire knowledge about  developing a socialist market economy, constantly seek to  improve the ability to operate a socialist market economy, and  approach problems with new ideas compatible with the  requirements of building the new economic structure, and try to  adapt as soon as possible our work methods to the process and  measures for in-depth reform; 3) consciously step up tempering  our party spirit in the course of developing a socialist market  economy, study and work hard to build the new economic  structure, correctly approach the adjustment of certain  interests necessary to deepening reform, correctly handle the  relationship between the overall and partial interests and  between the collective and the individual, uphold the party's  ideals and faith, and maintain correct values, integrity, and  self-discipline to stand the new test in the new period.    Hu Jintao said: Over the past several decades, our party  has accumulated a wealth of experience and developed a number of  good forms and methods in the education of party members, which  we undoubtedly should uphold. Meanwhile, we should also note  that with the in-depth development of reform and opening up, the  environment and conditions in which party members are today are  quite different from those in which they used to be. In such  circumstances, it is not inadequate to only use the past methods  to educate party members; we must improve such methods and  concentrate our efforts on the education of party members to  achieve actual results. He pointed out: First, we should link  the education of party members closely to the implementation of  the party's basic line and resolutely make it serve the purposes  of reform, development, and stability; second, we should  effectively use the theoretical weapon, have a definite object  in mind, enhance the purposefulness, persuasion, and appealing  of education for party members; third, we should link  strengthening education and settling ideological questions with  showing concern for party members and solving practical problems  for them; fourth, we should combine strengthening the education  of party members with the improvement of management and the  enforcement of party discipline; and fifth, we should strengthen  the building of primary party organizations while stepping up  the education and management of party members.    Hu Jintao said in his speech: Party organizations at all  levels are required to pay close attention to recruiting party  members from among people, especially from among young people,  working at the frontlines in production, scientific research,  and other work. He pointed out: The cause of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics is a cause led by our party with  the ultimate lofty aim of realization of communism, a cause of  never ceasing to break new ground in our march into the future.  This requires unremitting efforts by generation after  generation of Chinese communists, and it is also necessary for  us to continuously inject new blood into the body of the party.  The replacement of new party members for old ones, like the  replacement of new cadres for old ones, is an organizational  guarantee for unswervingly upholding the party's basic line for  a hundred years and a prerequisite for ensuring that there is no  lack of successors to carry on the party's cause and that the  party's cause will thrive. Proceeding from reality, party  organizations at various levels should analyze new conditions  for recruiting party members and seek ways and methods to solve  new problems. In recruiting party members, it is essential to  uphold the criteria for party members as stipulated in the party  constitution and to ensure that new party members are qualified.    Hu Jintao hoped that party committees at various levels  would  take the lead in implementing the principle of "the party  handling party affairs" and strengthen and improve their  leadership over the education of party members. They should  improve their leadership methods, change their work styles, and  strengthen their marco- guidance and specific supervision and  inspection; they should step up investigation and study and  conscientiously analyze the new changes brought about through  the establishment of a socialist market economy in the values,  thinking, feelings, and mentality of party members; they should  often sum up and popularize effective methods developed by  basic-level party organizations in the education of party  members; and they should accumulate experiences in practice and  gradually grasp the laws of educating party members in the new  situation to perform this work efficiently.    Lu Feng, director of the party Central Committee  Organization  Department, chaired today's meeting. Leaders of the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission and relevant departments under  the party Central Committee attended the meeting, including Hou  Zongbin, Song Defu, Zhao Zongnai, Xu Weicheng, Wang Jialiu, and  Chen Fujin. Also present at today's meeting were party committee  secretaries of various departments under the party Central  Committee and the State Council.</p>

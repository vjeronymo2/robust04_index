			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC farm reforms tripped in final straight - The battery of imponderables facing the Commission European Commission plans to reform fundamentally the Common Agricultural Policy entered what looked like the final straight yesterday - at which point several EC member states stuck out their legs to trip them up. Nonetheless, the main evidence that agriculture ministers are at last having to face up to decisions on reform was that some were forced to drop any pretence at going along with the Brussels blueprint and state their real objections. Before the ministers was a detailed compromise proposal by the Portuguese presidency of the EC, worked out by officials from the 12 within the Commission's framework. This was billed as 'the final compromise'. For cereals, the centrepiece of the reform, the Commission's planned 35 per cent price cut over three years has been reduced to 30 per cent. Less compensation for the price cuts would be paid, however, although the possibility of more compensation for taking land out of production is contemplated. The price cuts are meant to cut overproduction, while compensating farmers fully with direct income payments - conditional for larger farms on setting aside land. The policing of this scheme on an individual farm basis ran into strong administrative resistance among the 12. Germany claimed it would cost Ecu500m (Dollars 602m) to monitor and Belgium said it would take five years to introduce. That argument has been resolved by selecting the equivalent of an English county as the unit from which to calculate the areas sown and set aside. Individual farmers can also present their own 'base area", but both units will be penalised for any cheating. The compromise also envisages a less restrictive definition of beef and dairy herd eligibility for premium payments. The Commission had wanted to discourage intensive farming by setting a density limit of 1.4 head per hectare. This would now rise to 2 head per hectare. A ceiling on intervention stockpiles of beef would be established at 800,000 tonnes in 1993, descending gradually to 300,000 tonnes in 1997. The beef mountain now stands at some some 1m tonnes, but only because a further 1m tonnes was sold abroad last year at prices around a quarter of market levels. Equally, the complex 'safety net' arrangement, whereby the Commission must buy in surplus beef once prices fall below 72 per cent of EC 'intervention' prices, would have its price trigger lowered to 55 per cent - though this presupposes a 15 per cent price cut. British sheep farmers in disadvantaged hill areas would be subsidised for herds up to 1,000 head, as now, rather than 750, as Brussels had planned. And milk producers across the EC would be treated more flexibly than the reform envisaged - especially in Italy, Greece and Spain. Although ministers last November accepted the thrust of the Commission's reform, the UK, Denmark and the Netherlands - which as EC president at that time announced acceptance 'in principle' of the Brussels plan - yesterday raised objections of principle. Mr John Gummer, UK farm minister, said 'this was not a whole lot of countries whingeing about national interest, but saying that although we have to have reform, the avenue down which we are going is the wrong one.' He called for 'degressive compensation for price cuts ..so that the market signals get through.' France, the plan's most resolute opponent until recently, accepted its thrust. Ireland, its usual ally, was deeply unhappy with the proposed beef regime. But Germany, the EC's leading advocate of farm subsidy cuts to enable a Uruguay Round world trade deal, presented a point by point shopping list of objections which would greatly raise the already criticised cost of the reform. The German stance visibly disconcerted the Commission, which now faces a battery of imponderables before deciding its tactics: The fast-fading Uruguay Round talks, which hinge on farm subsidy cuts which condition CAP reform; Criticised Commission plans to increase EC revenue by a third in the next five years. Germany, the main net contributor to the EC budget, is least disposed towards the increase. Yet Mr Ignaz Kiechle, its farm minister, is adding to the bill even while the Commission is looking for budget cuts - which may start in agriculture; Forthcoming elections in the UK, France and Italy, seen as a disincentive to radical decision-making; The 1992-93 farm price regime, which the Commission is due to agree on March 18. Mr Ray MacSharry, author of the reform plan, said yesterday he would 'take account of the stage and state of the (reform) negotiations' before deciding whether to introduce new price cuts this year without compensation. This weapon is a double-edged sword, however, in that it would favour the position of the UK, Holland and Denmark, in a negotiation where each member state is trying to safeguard the competitive position of its farmers.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Thai road plan dispute worsens MR TAKAO Ninomiya knew his Dollars 1bn elevated motorway project was in trouble when he received more than three weeks' notice from the police of a demonstration against his company by angry motorists. A dispute between Thailand's Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority (ETA) and the Bangkok Expressway Co Ltd (BECL) - the Japanese-led contractors' consortium of which Mr Ninomiya is managing director - came to a head this week when the ETA, citing the possibility of violence by frustrated drivers, won a court order for the immediate opening of the completed stretch of motorway. Many residents of Bangkok, believing the new 20km road would relieve the city's notorious traffic congestion, were delighted. But investors and bankers were enraged by what they regard as bullying tactics by the Thai authorities, and said international financing for some Dollars 30bn of planned Thai infrastructure projects would be jeopardised. BECL and its main shareholder Kumagai Gumi did not want the motorway opened until the dispute over revenue-sharing and other matters was resolved. BECL's advisers say the road, which could be opened today by Mr Chuan Leekpai, prime minister, has not even been officially certified as safe. Behind the posturing lies a fundamental dispute over the contract, which BECL believed to be a 30-year build-operate-transfer deal (although Mr Sukavich Rangsitpol, ETA governor, insists BECL should transfer legal control to the ETA immediately). BECL is concerned about the late delivery of land for future parts of the road by the ETA, and about who will collect toll fees and handle the cash, although a dispute over the level of the tolls themselves appears to have been resolved after the cabinet agreed to the 30 baht (Dollars 1.20) per car fee established in the contract.</p>

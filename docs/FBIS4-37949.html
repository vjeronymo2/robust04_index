			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres will meet PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat on 6 July in  Paris. The three will be there to receive a special UNESCO  award. During the meeting, political discussions will be held  on, among other things, the coming stages of the political  process.    Our correspondent notes that several days later, another  meeting of the donor countries will be held in Paris, and  'Arafat is expected to attend this meeting as well. Hence, it  is assumed that 'Arafat will not arrive in Jericho and Gaza  before mid-July. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is  also expected in the region at that time.</p>

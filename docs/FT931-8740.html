			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Israel sells drone aircraft to US ISRAEL Aircraft Industries, flagship of Israel's troubled state-owned defence sector, has received a welcome shot in the arm by winning a Dollars 240m contract from the US Defence Department for 56 unmanned aircraft in partnership with San Diego-based TRW. IAI will make the so-called drones - increasingly used by armed forces to probe behind enemy lines without exposing the lives of pilots - their payloads and ground stations in Israel. TRW will manage the project and carry out testing and training. Earlier this month, the government agreed to provide a Dollars 280m restructuring package for IAI, the country's biggest company, to help it overcome a slump in sales which will result in a Dollars 50m-Dollars 60m loss when its 1992 results are reported. Now set to lay off 1,500 of its 17,400 workforce, IAI is struggling to stay competitive with its international rivals and increase its sales of civilian products. Ironically, last year it was the cancellation or postponement of several civilian aircraft contracts which knocked its annual overseas sales of Dollars 1.25bn back by Dollars 100m. IAI accounts for some 17 per cent of all Israel's industrial exports. One of its successes has been its leading world role in producing unmanned aircraft, used chiefly in military reconnaissance work. IAI drones were used by the US armed forces during the Gulf war to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait.</p>

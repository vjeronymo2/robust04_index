			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: BP upset The substantial outperformance of British Petroleum against the wider market and the oil sector since the turn of the year was being eroded again yesterday as the shares continued to react to sterling's appreciation against the dollar. BP shares have risen more than 16 per cent since the year-end, against a 0.3 per cent decline in the FT-SE 100 Index and a 3.4 per cent rise in the FT-Actuaries oil index. However, the near 5 cents decline in the sterling/dollar rate in the past couple of weeks has triggered a reappraisal of BP's earnings profile, which is substantially affected by currency shifts. And US investors, who have provided much of the buying in the past year or so, have pulled out of the market in recent sessions as Wall Street has come under pressure. BP dipped 6 to 283 1/2 p, albeit in thin turnover of 3.1m shares. Dealers said the market had merely adjusted to the latest currency shifts plus small profit-taking. Shell slipped 5 1/2 to 560 1/2 p with 2.3m traded. The banks sector came back with the rest of the market, with Barclays - said by dealers to have been overbought on Friday - retreating 9 to 431p on turnover of 4m. Lloyds lost 8 to 523p. National Westminster performed well, in spite of the substantial damage to its headquarters building in the City, the shares holding 468p on good volume of 3.8m. Bank of Scotland, the Footsie's best performing stock last week with an 11.5 per cent rise, eased 2 1/2 to 133 1/2 p. TSB, where the market is still expecting news of a sizeable disposal, possibly of the Hill Samuel merchant banking operation, and where there remains lingering takeover hopes, dipped 3 1/2 to 189p on heavy turnover of 6.6m shares. Merchant banks, meanwhile, continued to move ahead, with Kleinwort Benson the sector's best performer and climbing 7 more to break through the 400p barrier. The stock ended at 401p, its highest closing level since March 1990. The massive damage wrought in the City of London by the IRA bomb had little impact on an insurance sector still fretting about last week's slide in the equity market. Sun Alliance finished 5 lower at 325p and General Accident 7 off at 564p. Conglomerate Suter added 5 at 144p on a press tip. Engineering group Fenner was lifted 7 to 80p by speculation that Wassall, the mini-conglomerate run by former Hanson executives which acquired a 1.6 per cent stake last June, might be building up to a bid. Wassall shares held at 240p. Supermarket group Asda continued to climb, gaining 1 1/2 at 73p in turnover of 17m. The stock was aided by an upgrade from James Capel, which raised its 1994 profits forecast by Pounds 20m to Pounds 205m and the following year's by Pounds 35m to Pounds 250m. The last few month's trading at the group is said to have been encouraging. Hoare Govett was said to be positive on Booker. The shares firmed 4 to 384p. Internationally traded stocks with large dollar earnings suffered from the further slide of the US currency against the pound. Siebe, which earns 60 per cent of profits in the US, fell 11 to 466p, Reuters Holdings dropped 26 to 1258p and ICI shed 20 to 1237p. However, BAT Industries recovered 4 to 853p as several securities houses decided recent selling was overdone. Bank note printer De La Rue saw its highly valued shares rise a further 7 to 709p following an enthusiastic report in the US financial press. The article highlighted the company's links with the former communist countries of eastern Europe. Farnell jumped 9 to 387p after preliminary results at the top end of market estimates. Unitech moved forward 16 to 250p and Sage 23 to 619p. Building issues provided a handful of strong perfomers, notably John Mowlem, 3 higher at 114p, and Prowting, which rose 6 to 110p. Tarmac, reporting preliminary figures today and expected to include heavy provisions of around Pounds 300m, lost 6 to 134p. Talk of a UBS buy recommendation drove Rolls-Royce 3 higher to 135p. Water shares remained under moderate selling pressure, with the Footsie stocks attracting persistent small selling. Anglian receded 6 to 504p, North West 5 to 496p and Severn Trent 5 to 494p.

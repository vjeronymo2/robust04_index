			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Further disposals foreseen this year ICI's sale of its last coke business yesterday is only the latest disposal in a series that has been running for several years and promises to continue through 1994. The company is in the process of concentrating on fewer businesses. It wants to be active only in areas where it is a world leader and has global markets. This leaves a number of activities for which it is either negotiating a sale or looking for a buyer. They include: Polypropylene, which BASF of Germany is negotiating to buy. With annual sales of more than Pounds 100m, ICI could be hoping for something approaching that sum in payment. But the sector is dogged by overcapacity and talks with BASF have dragged on for a year. This week the German company said the talks were now in their 'final stage'. Polypropylene film is a slightly smaller business that turns the raw plastic into the likes of crisp packets and cigarette packet wrapping. Without the polypropylene business to supply it, it could be a candidate for disposal. Fertilisers, part of chemicals and polymers, could not be sold to Kemira, the Finnish state-owned company, in 1991 when the Monopolies and Mergers Commission judged that, among other things, the sale was tantamount to nationalisation. The business has since shrunk as it has been buffeted by falling demand from European farmers conforming to Community Agricultural Policy. The Indian fertiliser business was sold last month for about Pounds 25m. Advanced materials is also a non-core business, and most of it has been sold or closed. What remains is the Arizona-based Fiberite which supplies parts to the US aerospace industry. Disposal talks were revealed last year, although no buyer was named. Petrochemicals was, a decade ago, the company's biggest single division. Now it is focused on just a handful of activities of which non-core areas include production of ethylene and its derivatives. ICI Australia, 63 per cent owned by the parent company, has ploughed an independent furrow for many years. The result is that the shape of the business is very different from that controlled from the UK. Last year a reorganisation put the whole of ICI's Asian businesses under Australian command and the pressure is on to clarify which industrial strategy it is following. ICI confirmed yesterday that a string of disposals was planned for later this year, although it declined to specify which businesses would go.</p>

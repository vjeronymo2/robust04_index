			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Arts: Today's Television What I want to see is Richard Wilson (aka Victor Meldrew but now playing the rough diamond aesthete at Klinsky's) taking that 900cc Triumph round the reverse-banking on Westway at, say, 55mph with his visor up. In John Mortimer's auction house series Under The Hammer we keep getting macho poser shots of Wilson straddling the machine at rest, and footage of some anonymous person whirling around London on it. But I suspect that, unlike the late Ralph Richardson, Wilson is not really one of us, a genuine motorcyclist (9.00 ITV). Earlier, if all goes well, you can watch Torvill and Dean as they attempt to win the Olympic Ice Dance Championship again (7.30 BBC1). Even earlier comes the first of this year's Young Musician Of The Year Masterclasses given by clarinettist Michael Collins (7.20 BBC2). The last in a generally good series of Cutting Edge documentaries is a 'day in the life of' Gatwick Airport (9.00 C4). The final episode of Middlemarch is repeated (10.25 BBC1).</p>

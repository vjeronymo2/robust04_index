Controversial Returned Exiles Committee President Pat  Hlongwane, told a Radio Transkei talk-show on Sunday [6  February] his organisation was determined to track down and  eliminate the top ANC leaders responsible for all the atrocities  in ANC camps in Angola and Zambia.    Mr Hlongwane said Transkei military leder Maj-Gen Bantu  Holomisa was also on their hit list because Gen Holomisa had not  assisted with investigations into the death of returned exile,  Sipho Phungulwa, who was allegedly gunned down by Umkhonto we  Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- MK] members at the Ngangelizwe  township outside Umtata five years ago. "We were on the verge  of assassinating him (Gen Holomisa) the other year at the  Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg, but we missed him," Mr Hlongwane  said.    Mr Hlongwane called Gen Holomisa "a political prostitute"  whom he said was appointed by South African Foreign Minister Pik  Botha. The Transkei leader, however, had changed his allegiance  to the ANC when Mr Mandela was released.    Asked about his relationship with the Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB], Mr Hlongwane  said he had met the AWB leadership and attended a rally on  Saturday. He said he had approached the AWB in a bid to secure  arms to protect himself against threatened attacks by Gen  Holomisa.    Mr Hlongwane said he would align himself with any party  taking an anti-communist stance during the forthcoming elections.</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: No island trips for Greece's bankers - The Emerging Investor As trading volume on the Athens bourse wilts in the summer heat, Greek brokers are taking off for long weekends on the islands. Those left behind are the investment bankers, charged with bringing another 40 Greek companies to the market by the end of the year. The flow of equity issues this year has already exceeded expectations. Since January, scarcely a week has gone by without a new public offering, or a capital increase by a company already listed. The drachma crisis in May - which sent interest rates on government paper soaring to 27 per cent for a one-month zero coupon bond - failed to curb investors' enthusiasm for new issues. Greece saw new issues worth Dr47bn (Dollars 195m) in the first half of the year, and another Dr117bn in fresh capital was raised by listed companies. Most of the 21 newcomers have outperformed the market; several are currently trading at more than 20 per cent above issue price. The march to market was led by construction companies, looking for funds to back their bids for lucrative contracts offered under the European Union's new Ecu16.8bn (Pounds 13.2bn) aid package to Greece for infrastructure projects. The ease with which the contractors' offerings were covered encouraged companies in other sectors to follow suit. Textile manufacturers and software companies, medical equipment and cosmetics producers are some of the new entrants. One fishery has joined the bourse and another is on the waiting-list, reflec-ting Greece's position as Europe's largest producer of farm-fattened sea bream and sea bass. In July, Teletypos - a company owned by several local newspaper publishers, which controls Greece's most successful private television channel - raised Dr7bn, making it the first Greek media group to be listed. Issues in the pipeline include Achaia Clauss Wines and Intrasoft, the software subsidiary of Intracom, the telecoms equipment manufacturer. Mr Panagis Vourloumis, managing director of Alpha Finance, the investment banking arm of Alpha Credit Bank, says: 'The motivation is clear. Interest rates will remain prohibitively high for the foreseeable future, so the solution is to go public.' Greek companies keen to grow to international size have noted that several companies which joined the Athens bourse during its last period of expansion in 1990-91 are now the country's blue chips and sought after by foreign institutional investors. Such companies can now raise sizeable amounts on the bourse to fund their ambitions abroad. Mechaniki, the construction company linked with Fide of Italy, carried out a Dr9bn capital increase early this year. Delta Dairy, the food processor, raised Dr18bn to fund an aggressive expansion drive into the Balkans. About half the issue was covered by BSN, the French food manufacturer. Even Greece's shipping sector, which traditionally eschews the kind of scrutiny required for a stock market listing, is starting to make its appearance. Strintzis Lines, a coastal ferry operator which was floated in May, is one of the most active stocks, currently trading at 17 per cent above issue price. Though the capital markets committee, the watchdog for the bourse, set stringent conditions for Strintzis' entry, other shipping companies were not discouraged. Another passenger operator, DANE, has been restructured in order to comply with the regulations for shipping listings. The spate of new issues, together with a surge of investment from overseas, triggered record first-half trading volumes. Daily turnover averaged Dr6.5bn, against Dr2.5bn last year. Market capitalisation totalled Dr2.9bn at the end of June, equivalent to almost 13 per cent of Greece's gross domestic product. However, as the index declined from its January high of 1,194 to 845 at the end of last week, volume slipped back to around Dr2.3bn daily. Analysts said the market was slowing down for the August holiday season and was unlikely to revive until the next wave of flotations, due in September. Demand is not expected to shrink, as Greece is still cheap. The Athens market is valued at 14 times prospective earnings and the new issues are for the most part modestly priced. Investors' confidence will be seriously tested towards the end of the year. Then, the socialist government, now converted to partial privatisation of large state enterprises, plans to float minority stakes in both OTE, the Greek telecoms monopoly, and DEP, the holding company for state-owned refineries and petrol stations. The government's advisers say that only a small equity tranche in OTE, no more than Dr100bn, will be sold to domestic investors. The remainder of the Dr250bn offering is to be placed with institutional investors abroad. Another question mark hangs over the future of Greece's mutual funds, hard hit by the government's decision in April to tax interest earned on their holdings of Treasury bills at 15 per cent. Government paper remains tax-free to other investors. After two years of explosive growth, the funds are now stagnating, though there is no sign of a flight by investors: total assets remain steady at around Dr1,500bn. Mr Spyros Kriticopoulos, investment director at Alico Eurobank, which manages a group of mutual funds, said: 'It's a wait-and-see situation because the finance ministry still hasn't informed us how it proposes to implement this new tax. But we're worried.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          22/7/94                                          Dollars    Week on week change Stock                      Country        close       Dollars      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Guoco Holdings Phillipines Philippines    0.1727      0.0252      17.11 Phillipine National Bank   Philippines   17.2676      2.3337      15.63 Southern                   Peru           4.3488      0.5447      14.32 Banco Do Brasil (Pfd)      Brazil         0.0224      0.0027      13.52 Minsur                     Peru           7.7960      0.9103      13.22 Kordosa                    Turkey         0.4269      0.0472      12.44 Ayala Land (B)             Philippines    1.1006      0.1176      11.96 Banco Bradesco (Pfd)       Brazil         0.0074      0.0007      10.70 Buenaventura (C)           Peru           3.2559      0.2946       9.95 Telefonos                  Peru           3.8707      0.3387       9.59  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A news conference held today at the premises of the  Rosvooruzheniye [Russian weapons] state company was devoted to  matters relating to the arms trade. Our correspondent Marina  Chernukha has the details.    [Chernukha] Lieutenant General Viktor Samoylov, the  company's  director general, anticipated many of the journalists' questions  by stating that Russia unequivocally intends to defend its  position on the world arms market.    [Begin Samoylov recording] Regarding the trade in arms, yes,  we are going to fight, and we are already fighting on the  market. We have the advantage of not having lost our old  markets. We still have them. We are hoping for new markets as  well -- primarily the Pacific and Asian, the Latin American,  which we are beginning to penetrate, and also South Africa,  where we are already established normally. [end recording]    [Chernukha] Samoylov stressed that Russia does not intend to  act in contravention of UN sanctions regarding trade with Iraq  and Libya. However, he made it clear that as soon as these are  lifted, Russia could offer these countries competitive military  equipment and armaments.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets ZURICH Sandoz holds an analysts meeting in London on Thursday and, says NatWest Securities, is likely to present last week's acquisition of Gerber as part of a strategic refocusing which emphasises food and pharmaceuticals as core businesses. NatWest expects the company to hint at further acquisitions in these sectors and divestments in non-core areas. It says that while this is likely to be well received by the market, it remains cautious following the Gerber acquisition, which brings with it little apparent synergy with the existing nutrition business. Roche, whose certificates came under pressure after its acquisition of Syntex, has its annual general meeting tomorrow. In the insurance sector, Winterthur holds its annual news conference on already-announced results tomorrow, and Zurich Insurance's annual news conference takes place on Wednesday. AMSTERDAM First-quarter figures come from ING and KLM on Thursday. Hoare Govett forecasts net attributable profit from ING up 11 per cent to Fl 400m (Dollars 217.4m), with profit improvements coming in all lines. Results will also benefit from the absence of losses at Orion and NRG, which were still consolidated in the first quarter of 1993. Hoare Govett expects KLM's growth in operating income to be much higher than growth in operating costs, and therefore estimates an operating loss of Fl 128m against one of Fl 266m in the same period of last year. STOCKHOLM The privatisation of Pharmacia, expected to raise SKr13bn (Dollars 1.7bn), begins on Wednesday with domestic investors being offered 40m shares, with a further 32m earmarked for foreign investors. Four-month figures come from Saga Petroleum on Monday. Unibank forecasts turnover down to SKr1.88bn from SKr1.92bn, and net profits of SKr205m, after SKr209m last time. TOKYO Last week's rally of large capital steels and heavy industry stocks suggests that liquidity in the stock market is increasing. However, many corporate and financial investors are looking to sell holdings around the 20,800 to 20,900 level. So, while activity may increase, a sharp rise in prices is unlikely.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS DESIGN NEW PROFICIENCY TESTS  </P> <P> Seeking better ways to evaluate student achievement, the Fillmore Unified  School District is designing its own testing program for reading and writing.  </P> <P> Supt.  </P> <P> Marlene Davis said at a school board meeting Tuesday that standardized tests  such as the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills evaluate individual skills but  do not give teachers a full picture of student progress.  </P> <P> The board heard a presentation by members of a language arts committee that has  spent two years on the project. They explained educational goals and an  assessment process that will target grades two, five, seven and 10.  </P> <P> Committee members said teachers would require some training to adapt to new  methods of instruction and testing but were enthusiastic about the potential  improvements in education.  </P> <P> Davis said the district will continue to use the California Assessment Program  and District Proficiency tests when necessary to determine which students  require remedial help.

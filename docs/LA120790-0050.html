			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ROBERT CRAY'S BURNIN' SOUL  </P> <P> Robert Cray, blues savior, didn't show up at the Universal Amphitheatre on  Wednesday. But young Bob Cray and his burnin' Memphis soul band sure did.  </P> <P> Cray has made several personnel changes since his last L.A. appearance -- the  Memphis Horns and guitarist Tim Kaihatsu are now full-time members, along with  newcomers Kevin Hayes and Jimmy Pugh -- but nearly two hours of Bodyglove-tight  arrangements and razor-sharp playing Wednesday dispelled any doubt about the  wisdom of those moves.  </P> <P> That punchy Memphis soul sound has always been an integral component of Cray's  roots-nouveau style -- particularly his underrated singing -- but it's been  overshadowed by rock's blues-guitarist fixation since his 1986 breakthrough hit  "Smoking Gun." But not Wednesday. The soul element was apparent in everything  from O.V. Wright tapes to the intricately slick licks of the Memphis Horns and  Cray's feral, gospel-rooted howls on "All These Things."  </P> <P> Cray didn't cut a particularly charismatic figure, but he reached a level of  stagecraft that projected effectively to the audience. A couple more up-tempo  barn-burners in the repertoire wouldn't hurt, but the varied assortment of  kickin', mid-tempo grooves earned a richly deserved standing ovation from the  better than half-filled house.  </P> <P> Second-billed Joe Ely is still searching for the "Smoking Gun" that will enable  him to match Cray's commercial breakthrough, but his set only sporadically  connected. Old Ely fans probably found the arrangements of his current quartet  too monochromatic for the Texan's literate tales, but lead guitarist David  Grissom brilliantly fused guitar-hero technique with a roots-rocker's economy  and Keith Richards' chordal surges.

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / World Trade News: End Gatt talks, says Dunkel UNLESS the Uruguay Round of trade liberalising talks is concluded quickly it could founder, Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, warned yesterday. He told the Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC), which oversees the 112-nation round, that the talks were 'poised for conclusion'. 'We are critically short of time. We must conclude now or risk drifting into the sands.' The meeting was called to review progress in the six-year-old talks on the eve of President Clinton's inauguration today. It follows two weeks' intensive US-EC tariff negotiations which failed to produce breakthroughs. In an appeal to the new administration to conclude a Uruguay Round deal before the negotiating mandate granted by Congress expires in March, Mr Dunkel said it 'can, and must be, concluded quickly'. He saw 'growing fears that a long delay would cause a dangerous loss of momentum' where even the existing trading system could be put at risk. Frustration was growing that the biggest traders had not provided end-game leadership. Since December, the Round has focused on tariff cuts, initial commitments to liberalise services and possible changes to the draft package of rules known as the 'final act', drawn up by Mr Dunkel in December 1991. He said yesterday that most nations were willing to live with the draft final act in its present form 'in the interest of a quick conclusion', repeating that changes to the draft could only be by consensus. The strongest objections to the draft final act have come from Japan and South Korea over proposals to open their rice markets; Canada and others which would have to scrap farm supply management systems; India over the textiles accord; and the US over issues including creation of a powerful Multilateral Trade Organisation. Mr Hugo Paemen, EC chief negotiator, said Brussels was committed to a rapid end of the round 'within its present parameters'. This reflects fears that if Mr Clinton needs a fresh negotiating mandate new issues will be put on the agenda, delaying the talks further and risking agreements made in principle. Colombia, Costa Rica and Guatemala yesterday said they would veto any Round accord if the EC did not change its proposed regime for Latin American banana imports. The EC plan, applying punitive tariffs to 'dollar' bananas above a 2m-ton annual quota, could cut imports from Latin America 30 per cent, they said.</p>

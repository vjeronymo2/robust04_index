			<p>BFN     [Text] One could say that relative calm has returned to  Chad. After meeting with the government yesterday, the  Federation of Chadian Trade Unions [UST] has decided to suspend  its general strike. Here is Rene Dila Yombirim with a report.    [Begin Yombirim recording] After intense negotiations last  night, the government and the labor unions were able to sign a  joint communique stating that the 37-day general strike launched  by the UST has been suspended. The UST has therefore asked its  members to return to work today. In return, the government has  undertaken to suspend the notorious decree governing strikes in  Chad until the establishment of institutions with the competence  to abrogate or retain the decree.    The negotiators also said that the signing of the social  pact  -- the bone of contention -- will come into effect within a  period not exceeding one month. The social pact, according to  the UST, notably provides for a 35-percent salary increase, the  payment of salary arrears, and the abrogation of the ordinance  responsible for salary cuts since 1992. A unanimous agreement  has not yet been reached on the terms of this social pact and  the country has been paralyzed for more than a month now in  order to have it signed.    Although the situation has only been temporarily defused,  this is the first victory scored by the new government, which  held its first meeting only yesterday. The president of the  Republic said at yesterday's meeting that he would like the  social pact to be concluded rapidly to enable the country to  progress economically. [end recording]</p>

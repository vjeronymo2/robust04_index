			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FUNDS OKD FOR MAJOR DENVER AIRPORT  </P> <P> Approval of a $60-million federal grant today paved the way for construction of  the nation's first major new airport since 1974, to be built on a  53-square-mile tract in Denver.  </P> <P> Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner and Federal Aviation Administration  chief James Busey announced the grant after a signing ceremony attended by  Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, Denver Mayor Federico Pena and members of Colorado's  congressional delegation.  </P> <P> Busey said the new international airport, estimated to cost as much as $2.5  billion, will have "enormous implications for aviation nationally" and should  reduce air travel delays nationwide by 4%, saving $500 million by 1997.  </P> <P> "This is a significant event in view of the fact that no new major airport has  been built in the United States since the Dallas-Ft. Worth airport opened in  1974," Skinner said. "This clearly is a breakthrough in one of the cities where  we most need a new airport."  </P></p>

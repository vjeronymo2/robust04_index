			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by unidentified XINHUA special commentator: </F> "Severely Punish Lawbreakers Who Mob and Beat Up Price  Inspectors"]    [Text] Beijing, 11 Apr (XINHUA) -- Since 1983, when the  State Council gave the go-ahead to the establishment of price  inspection organs, the vast number of price inspectors have  performed their duties honestly, cautiously, and conscientiously  and have enforced the law strictly and impartially, thus playing  an important role in advancing reform, promoting development,  and preserving stability. The work of price inspection  departments has won praise from all sectors of society and the  public. The party and government have fully affirmed and highly  valued their work.    Price inspection departments are law-enforcement  administrative departments of the government, and price  inspectors exercise their functions on behalf of the state. All  enterprises and individuals engaged in production or business  and administrative units or institutions that charge fees are  subject to inspection without exception. Taken together, the  overwhelming majority of units and individuals that are subject  to inspections are supportive of and cooperative toward price  inspections. There are, however, indeed a handful of units and  individuals -- privately run enterprises and self-employed  industrial and commercial entities in particular -- who  interfere with, obstruct, or even refuse to be inspected. Some  even threaten, abuse, mob, and beat up inspectors. The incident  in Xinzhou city, Shanxi Province, in which price inspectors were  mobbed and beaten up shows how lacking is awareness of the law  among this handful of units and individuals. Some people  declare that because prices have been deregulated, they are free  to set their own prices, free to cheat and hustle consumers by  any means, and free from government supervision and price  inspection. They are greatly mistaken.    Obstructing price inspectors from carrying out their  official  duties is a rather prominent problem today. Governments and  departments concerned at all levels must take it seriously and  pay close attention. Article 34 of the "Provisions of the  People's Republic of China Concerning Price Inspection"  provides: When a party refuses to permit or obstructs price  inspectors from carrying out their duties according to the law,  he shall be punished by a public security department pursuant to  the provisions of the "Regulations Governing Offenses Against  Public Order of the People's Republic of China"; in cases of  gross violation or when a crime has resulted, the judicial  department shall investigate the party's criminal responsibility  according to the law. Governments and departments concerned at  all levels must take immediate, effective action to protect the  personal safety of price inspectors and ensure the smooth  progress of the general price inspection.</p>

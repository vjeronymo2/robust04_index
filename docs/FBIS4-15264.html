			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Marina Barinova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- All Russian nuclear power  stations now face stoppages. Because of various faults nuclear  reactors at many of them do not operate to full capacity. In  addition to technical reasons, the work of nine Russian nuclear  power stations is affected by huge indebtedness to them by  consumers. It amounts now to over 600 billion roubles.  Observers believe this urges operators to protest actions such  as the picketing of the government building conducted today.  Because of the lack of funds, nuclear fuel cannot be bought.  Prophylactic work cannot be done on time. Planned recharging  of reactors with fuel is skipped. So nuclear power plants in  Russia may turn out of energy producers into major energy  consumers.    Social tension is heightening among the personnel of nuclear  power plants. Wages have not been paid to them for three of  four months. Nuclear power plant operators have to resort to  extreme measures. Five operators of the Kursk nuclear power  station were recently fasting in protest against non-payment of  wages. Despite the government decision to conclude collective  agreements with workers in nuclear power, such an agreement was  concluded with the personnel of only one of the nine stations,  the Beloyarsk nuclear power plant.    The coordination council for joint actions formed by trade  unions of nuclear power sent an address to the Russian  president, government and parliament. The address pointed to  the need to stabilise the financial situation in the region.    So far all Russian nuclear power stations have to work in a  regime on strict economy. Because of this their output dropped  by half.</p>

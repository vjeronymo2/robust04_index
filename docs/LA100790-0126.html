			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A YOUNG MILLIONAIRE  </P> <P> Your article on scriptwriter Shane Black and the Pad O' Guys made it instantly  clear to me why current American films are in the hammerlock of a macho-buddy,  total-whammo, blast-'em, kick-'em-in-the-groin mentality. These creative  talents have been raised on the culture of their times: pop fiction and TV.  Their creative output is just so much fast-pizza delivery: Load it up, get it  there fast, and don't pick up the empty boxes.  </P> <P> REGINA M. MORIN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

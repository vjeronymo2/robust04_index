			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Denmark sets date for Euro-vote DENMARK will hold its second referendum on the Maastricht treaty on Tuesday May 18, and will include a vote on the opt-out agreement negotiated by Denmark and its European partners at the EC summit in Edinburgh in December. Recent opinion polls have indicated a comfortable majority for the treaty, narrowly rejected by Danes last June. The most recent showed a 53:31 majority in favour, with the rest undecided. However, a couple of setbacks have hit pro-Maastricht forces this week. For one thing, the Socialist People's party (SPP) has split over the national compromise behind the Edinburgh deal, with three of the SPP's parliamentary group now rejecting the agreement, claiming that party opinion is against the leaders' decision to support the deal. The other setback came when a big trade union, representing public-sector office workers, defied its leaders and urged a No vote.</p>

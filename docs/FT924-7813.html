			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / TUC says pay squeeze will cut real wages by up to 3.75% THE real wages of nearly 6m workers will be cut by between 2.25 per cent and 3.75 per cent as a result of the government's plan to limit public-sector pay increases to a ceiling of 1.5 per cent over the next year, according to an analysis of the Autumn Statement by the Trades Union Congress. The TUC also estimates that the cut in earnings power for 25 per cent of the workforce will further reduce consumer confidence and cost 90,000 jobs. Overall, the TUC says, the package will do nothing to reduce unemployment which the Treasury's own forecast suggests will remain at almost 3m until 1995-96. Meanwhile pay analysts are speculating about a radical long-term overhaul of the pay review bodies which have in effect been bypassed for 1993-94. The review bodies normally make recommendations on pay for about 1.5m employees including doctors, nurses, teachers and the armed forces. Although the government stressed in the statement that the review bodies would take up their duties again in the 1994-95 pay round, the Treasury also said that the bodies must accept 'changes from time to time to reflect developments in their remit groups'. The government may seek changes in the review bodies' terms of reference, such as encouraging more regional variations in pay, which would lead to less generous recommendations. Other public-sector groups whose pay is determined primarily by formulas which link their pay to the private sector - civil servants, police and firefighters - also fear government pressure to weaken their formulas once the current pay squeeze is past. The police formula, which links police pay to national average earnings, is already under scrutiny from the Sheehy committee, which is due to report next year. The firefighters' formula which links their pay to the upper quartile of male manual earnings is more likely to survive as it is operated by the unions and local-authority employers and not by the government. Other pay analysts speculate that the government's pay squeeze will not stick and will not even be rigorously applied in organisations such as local authorities, in which the government is not the direct employer. If the pay limit is not applied in local authorities or in the newly independent parts of the public sector such as trust hospitals, managers will have to find savings elsewhere. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, has written to councils saying 'it is absolutely vital' that local government plays its part in delivering pay restraint. He warns that higher awards will be achieved 'at the cost of job losses or a reduction in services'. But Mr Chris Trinder, of the Public Finance Foundation, has pointed out that in the early and mid 1980's the government's public sector pay 'factor' was broken almost every year. The TUC's analysis also warns that the suspension of the various pay-setting arrangements which have superseded collective bargaining for most public sector employees could create enormous pressure for catch-up rises.</p>

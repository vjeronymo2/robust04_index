			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / People: Last of the old guard at Trafalgar House James Watkins, 48, senior partner of the Hong Kong office of Linklaters &amp; Paines, is to be Trafalgar House's top legal expert. He will join the group in October as an executive director and is expected to fill a slot on the board currently occupied by Ian Fowler who has been company secretary since 1962. Fowler, 58, who joined the board in 1984 and is expected to retire at the end of the year, is the last of the old guard who served under Sir Nigel Broackes and Lord Matthews, the founders of Trafalgar House. Hongkong Land, which bought a 25 per cent stake in Trafalgar House last year, has been changing the top management team and Watkins' appointment bears all the hallmarks of the group's new owner. He joined Linklaters in 1967 and has been senior partner of the firm's Hong Kong office since 1986. Among the many projects he has been involved in are the Macau International airport, Hong Kong's second cross-harbour tunnel and the privatisation of New Zealand Telecom. Trafalgar House chief executive Allan Gormly will be replaced soon by Nigel Rich, the former managing director of Jardine Matheson, an affiliate of Hongkong Land. Gormly, who takes over as chairman of Royal Insurance in August, is to be a joint deputy chairman of the group along with Sir Charles Powell, who joined Jardine Matheson after he retired as an adviser to the former British prime minister. They take up their new roles at the end of September replacing Alan Clements, the current deputy chairman. Clements remains on the board.</p>

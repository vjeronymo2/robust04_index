			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: SAS rules out Continental bid SCANDINAVIAN Airlines Systems (SAS) has decided not to participate in any of the bids for Continental Airlines, the US air carrier which has been in bankruptcy since late 1990. SAS has had a co-operation agreement with Continental since 1988, under which it feeds around 150,000 passengers a year into Continental's US network. This was cemented by a Dollars 106m investment in Continental, since written off. The Scandinavian carrier said yesterday that it saw no point in making a further investment in Continental as the co-operation was now 'firmly established' and would continue. SAS has three members on the Continental board. The bid deadline for Continental expired on Monday, with at least three suitors thought to be still in the running. Continental confirmed that Lufthansa, the German airline which had considered making an offer with Mr Marvin Davis, the Californian financier, was no longer pursuing a deal. This appeared to leave three contenders: a consortium lead by Mr Charles Hurwitz's Maxxam group; an offer from Mr Alfredo Brener's Houston Air; and a proposal from Air Canada in conjunction with a Texan investment partnership. Shortly after bids closed, Air Canada confirmed it was still interested in Continental, but declined to give more details. The Maxxam group also said it had submitted an offer by the deadline. Although both the Air Canada and Maxxam consortia confirmed that they had submitted bids for Continental by Monday's deadline, Houston Air was less forthcoming. 'In the interest of the future of Continental Airlines and integrity of its bidding process, Houston Air believes it would be inappropriate to make further comment on the status of its bid for the airline at this time,' it said. Continental has to present the 'best offer' to the bankruptcy court on November 9.</p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Thomas Jourdan recovery continues Thomas Jourdan, the maker and marketer of consumer goods, continued its recovery in the first half of 1994 with operating losses on continuing businesses falling from Pounds 146,000 to Pounds 40,000. However, after charging Pounds 3.65m this time for goodwill previously written off to reserves and Pounds 221,000 closure costs for two businesses  -Woodstock Furniture and Corby France - the pre-tax deficit came out at Pounds 4.17m, against Pounds 465,000 restated for FRS 3. Mr Keith Whitten, chairman, pointed out that the goodwill write-off had had no effect on either cash or shareholders' funds and added that the combined closure costs of the two subsidiaries were at the lower end of his earlier estimates. As a supplier to the retail trade, the bulk of turnover and all profits would be earned in the second half, in the period before Christmas, he explained. 'Our companies are in general trading significantly better than last year, in what is still a very modest improvement in demand for consumer products over the market as a whole.' First-half sales on continuing operations were Pounds 8.97m (Pounds 8.36m) and losses per share on the same basis came to 0.89p (1.49p). A maintained interim dividend of 0.5p has been declared. Gearing at 46 per cent was substantially unchanged from last June's level - the increase from the December level of 19 per cent reflected the usual seasonal movement.</p>

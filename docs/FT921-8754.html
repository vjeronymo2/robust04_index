			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Gardening: Fisons' peat bogs gift FISONS has donated all its freehold peatland in England to English Nature, which will become responsible for its proper use ecologically. The gift includes key sites such as Thorne Moor, Crowle Moor and Hatfield in Yorkshire and South Humberside, all of which have planning consent for peat extraction, and Wedholm Flow and Glasson Moss, in Cumbria, which do not yet have such consent. Further commercial use of any of these peat bogs will be by agreement with English Nature. Part of that agreement is that 2,800 acres of peatland has been identified for immediate protection as nature reserves. This is the largest single donation of peatland for conservation yet made. All Fisons peatland in the Somerset level is included. The company is carrying out research to discover the best method of managing peatland in whatever state it is found; pristine, partly-extracted or at the end of its commercial use. In those areas to be managed for conservation, Fisons will initiate, under English Nature supervision, the blocking of drains, and other measures to ensure the retention of moisture in nature reserve areas. English Nature is a government agency set up in an attempt to limit the damage done to ecologicially-valuable sites. It has no statutory powers to enforce restrictions; it used to be part of the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC) which, among other activities, was responsible for designating Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The NCC has been split into national sections and English Nature deals with these matters in England. Within 24 hours of signing the agreement with Fisons, English Nature's employees were in the peat bogs blocking drains to prevent the loss of water, the life-blood of mires. Dr Derek Langslow, chief executive of English Nature, says the agreement immediately lifts the threat of any development from the areas, most of which have planning permission for peat extraction. They will be managed for the nature conservancy interest. The operation intends to ensure that there will be no loss of irreplaceable sites and that rare plants and animals will not be destroyed, while enabling Fisons to go on extracting sufficient peat for horticultural requirements. Where peat has been removed and the operation has ended, land will be restored to make it ecologically useful. There are many different types of peat. For example, it is not widely known that a lot of the peat worked commercially is not from actively regenerating wetland bog but is from secondary bog resulting from drainage, in some cases carried out hundreds of years ago. This has its own special flora and fauna, depending on the environment it provides, and research must take account of what best to do with used or partly used peatland, as well as how best to preserve the pristine bogs which are the conservationists' pride and joy.</p>

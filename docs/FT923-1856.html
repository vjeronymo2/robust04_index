			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Letter: Courage needed to defend the economy rather than currency Sir, ERM was an artificial barrier preventing the UK government from reducing interest rates to a level which would stimulate economic recovery. The markets are certain that the ERM is dead and any attempt at resuscitation either in a political or technical sense will be rebuffed. It would be ironic if the crisis of last week is now simply interpreted as allowing John Major his best opportunity to take the kind of action which otherwise would have been impossible without a humiliating political U-turn. Although a little late in the day, the government's action in suspending sterling's participation in the ERM deserves applause. The return to a floating rate presented the chancellor with an opportunity to reduce interest rates to below the 10 per cent which they started at last Wednesday. The German finance minister is right in stating that we must put our own house in order. Bundesbank monetary policy is focused on the German domestic economy. If you cannot beat them, then join them. Ever cloud has a silver lining. The question now is whether the government has the courage to set rates to defend the economy or whether it will cling to its now defunct policy of defending the currency. Of course, these actions over-simplify the underlying issues and put us in the realms of the short-term fix. It would be a mistake to allow political expediency to be a cause for ignoring that we are inseparably part of a European trading bloc. Ultimately, Europe must continue to strive to find a way of co-ordinating its responses to global economic imbalances. These are complex problems. ERM has proved to be an ineffective tool in smoothing the superficial manifestations of the underlying cause. If the ERM is to be completely abandoned then it is clear that the UK and its European partners must quickly put their heads together to deal forthrightly with the fundamentals of the multi-layered inter-relationships of their economies.

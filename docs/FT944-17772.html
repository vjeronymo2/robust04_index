			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Computer People to buy VNG for Pounds 7m Computer People Group is proposing to acquire VNG Group, the computing services and consultancy company. The offer, which values VNG at Pounds 7m, is being made on the basis of 1.025 shares for each VNG share, or a cash alternative of 186.5p per share. To fund the acquisition, Computer People has announced a placing and open offer of 3.07m new ordinary shares at 182p each, to raise Pounds 5m net of expenses. Up to Pounds 1.8m will be used to fund the cash consideration and Pounds 3.2m to refinance VNG's debt arrangements. The move follows the acquisition of Span last July for Pounds 5.5m when Pounds 5.8m was raised through a placing and open offer. Irrevocable undertakings to accept in respect of 91.9 per cent of VNG's shares have been received. The placing has been underwritten by NatWest Securities. The open offer is on a 1-for-6 basis. VNG, founded in 1979, reported operating losses in 1993 but returned to profit in the first half of 1994. The group comprises contracting arms in the UK and Europe, a UK-based training division, which had an interim turnover of Pounds 395,000, and a UK consulting business, which had an interim turnover of Pounds 593,000.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Selling a blueprint for black mining control - Anglo American's reorganisation has deep political implications Anglo American's decision to break up Johannesburg Consolidated Investment, its associate mining house, amounts to a significant corporate reorganisation in its own right. However, the aim of relinquishing control of many of its assets ideally to the black business community sets the manoeuvre apart. The African National Congress, however, which has called publicly for the establishment of a 'black mining house', is quick to point out that the move provides only a platform for what might be an important development towards greater formal black ownership of the economy. 'Let's wait and see,' says ANC spokesman Mr Carl Niehaus. Circumspection is required, because although Anglo has proved its word and designed a workable vehicle for black economic empowerment, quite who will emerge to manage a black-owned mining house and raise money to buy it is still unclear. 'There is no heir apparent,' say Mr Michael Spicer, an Anglo spokesman. He notes that Anglo's exercise in Afrikaner economic empowerment in the 1960s - when mining assets were sold to insurance group Sanlam - took six years to complete. Reaction from the local investment community is more welcoming, with surprise stemming not so much from the decision to dismantle JCI but the way in which it is going to be done. Analysts were aware Anglo was considering the disposal of JCI to black business, but they were puzzled how it could be done so as to reduce the cost of buying the group outright and the risks associated with raising that amount of capital, while ensuring Anglo would retain its strategic investments within JCI. JCI, in which Anglo and sister company De Beers have 39.6 per cent and 8.4 per cent stakes respectively, is a considerable mining industrial enterprise. It has a market value of R13bn (Dollars 3.8bn) and yearly sales of R2.6bn. Its assets include Rustenburg Platinum, the world's largest platinum producer, two quality gold mines, important coal and ferrochrome businesses, and large stakes in two of the countries leading industrial groups: South African Breweries and the Premier Group. The mechanism Anglo will use for the unbundling is the creation of three new holding companies, which will house JCI's platinum, other mining, and industrial interests. Anglo will retain control of the platinum mining arm - it will buy JCI's diamond trading interests, regarded as a natural fit with De Beers - while encouraging black investors to come forward to buy shares in in the other holding companies, which represent large but less formidable businesses from the point of view of an outside buyer. Mr William Bowler, head of research at stockbrokers Fergusson Brothers, says: 'It's a very clever move which makes a good deal of corporate and political sense.'</p>

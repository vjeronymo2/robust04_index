			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "DOXA: 66 Percent of Italians Trust </F> the Head of Government"]    [Text] Rome -- Sixty-six percent of the Italians trust  Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister, according to a poll taken  by DOXA prior to the European elections and published only  yesterday. Those interviewed said that they had "a lot" (27  percent) or "sufficient" (39 percent) trust in the present head  of the government, who in this way achieved an approval rating  of 66 percent. Eleven percent of those interviewed had no trust  in him and 18 percent "little," a dissapproval rating of 29  percent. This makes Berlusconi the prime minister who, since  1992, has inspired most trust in Italians. Previously Carlo  Azeglio Ciampi achieved a 60 percent approval rating in May  1993, which fell however to 51 percent in September and 49  percent in January of this year.</p>

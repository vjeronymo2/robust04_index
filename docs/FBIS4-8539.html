			<p>BFN     [Text] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and  minister of foreign affairs, has returned to Zagreb following a  visit to Greece today and Turkey yesterday. In Athens he had  talks with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. After the  talks both ministers concluded that it is possible to extend  cooperation between the two countries. Andjelko Perincic  reports on Minister Granic's visit to Athens:    [Perincic] Ministers Granic and Papoulias agreed that  interstate treaties on industry, traffic, protection of  investments, and the prevention of double taxation would soon be  signed, and that business transactions should begin immediately.    At the meeting the two delegations also discussed military  cooperation, Croatian-Greek cooperation in the sphere of  security in southeast Europe and in the Mediterranean, and  international military cooperation within the United Nations.  Croatia obtained Greek support for its admission to NATO's  Partnership for Peace. In this regard, Greece wants the same  kind of friendship with Croatia as with all other countries of  former Yugoslavia, it was said.    The Greek hosts also supported Croatia's efforts to  reintegrate occupied Croatian areas in a peaceful way, adding,  as Minister Papoulias himself stated at a news conference, that  peace in that area and in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be a basis  for peace in the entire region. Papoulias said that fighting  should be halted in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is endangering  peace processes, and that negotiations in which Serbs should  also be included ought to be initiated.    As regards Bosnia-Herzegovina, Minister Granic stated for  Croatian Radio:    [Begin Granic recording] Our joint conclusion is that a  cease-fire agreement, and after that, the inclusion of the third  party, the Serb party, into negotiations with the federation [of  Bosnia-Herzegovina] are the most important things at the moment.  Greece ought to take an even more active part, as the European  Union [EU] chairman, in the peace process, the process of  negotiations, together with the United States and the Russian  Federation. [end recording]    [Perincic] The talks in Athens were also useful because  Greece is currently the EU chairman. Therefore, its support for  Croatia to join the EU PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for  Poland and Hungary] program is not insignificant. Greece lends  its support to Croatia for other forms of cooperation with the  European Union and for our efforts to obtain aid from the IMF,  the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and other  international financial institutions for the reconstruction of  our country.</p>

In a telephone conversation with the Japanese foreign  minister that day, he "confirmed time and again the maintenance  of the international cooperation system".    His remarks vividly show that the base intrigues of the  South  Korean puppet clique to stifle the fellow countrymen in the  North have run into extremes.    He cried that the North "must change its attitude," not  uttering a word about the fact that the South Korean puppet  clique had broken up the North-South dialogue and driven the  situation of the country to a phase of crisis. This is a  stereotyped method of the puppet clique to commit crimes and  shift the blame on to others.    Han talked something about "dialogue". But this was a ruse  to evade the responsibility for the collapse of North-South  dialogue and a camouflage for the puppets' sinister intention to  do harm to the North.    He revealed the invariable intention of the puppets to  isolate and stifle the North when he prattled again about  "effectiveness of pressure" by the "international cooperation  system".    Facts clearly show that the Kim Yong-sam group is, indeed, a  never-to-be-condoned group of traitors who do not want either  North- South dialogue or peace and peaceful reunification of the  country but are trying to plunge the nation into the scourge of  a nuclear war with the help of outside forces.</p>

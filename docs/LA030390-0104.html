			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VALVANO CRITICISM EXPANDS;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: EDITORIALS, FACULTY SEEK OUSTER OF N.C. STATE COACH IN WAKE  OF ALLEGED POINT-SHAVING INCIDENTS.  </P> <P> As calls for Jim Valvano's resignation resonated throughout North Carolina  Friday, the embattled North Carolina State basketball coach continued to  distance himself from the point-shaving allegations swirling around his  program.  </P> <P> He also said he would give up his job if school officials thought it best.  </P> <P> "I'm as angry as I've ever been in my life," Valvano told reporters at  Raleigh-Durham International Airport after a flight from New York. "I am not  implicated in any way in any violations from the start. I think it's time some  of the blame be put where it belongs, on the people involved."  </P> <P> The alleged point-shaving scheme is the latest -- and certainly heaviest --  shoe to drop on Valvano's program in a year of problems. Citing those problems,  several newspapers in North Carolina Friday called for his ouster, as did a  petition circulated among N.C. State faculty.  </P> <P> Valvano said he wants to sit down with university officials as soon as  possible. "I am perfectly ready to accept what the university thinks is best,"  he said.  </P> <P> Asked if he would consider waiving a clause in his contract that guarantees him  $500,000 if he is terminated without appropriate cause, Valvano said: "Whatever  is done is going to be fair and equitable to all parties. I consider the  university my friend."  </P> <P> Still, Valvano was combative, saying those who suggest a coach should know if  players are shaving points are "people who have never been in that position."  </P> <P> ABC News, citing unidentified sources, reported Wednesday that as many as four  N.C. State players, including star forward Charles Shackleford, conspired to  hold down the scores of four games in return for cash payments from a New  Jersey contractor during the 1987-88 season.  </P> <P> According to Shackleford's lawyer and agent, Sal DiFazio of Bridgewater, N.J.,  Shackleford has never shaved points, although he has admitted taking $65,000  from two men -- one of whom was identified by ABC as the key figure in the  point-shaving scheme -- while playing for the Wolfpack.  </P> <P> Shackleford is with the New Jersey Nets in the NBA and has not commented  publicly on the allegations.  </P> <P> North Carolina's State Bureau of Investigation acknowledged Thursday that its  preliminary look into the point-shaving scheme has become a full investigation.  </P> <P> Bureau officials said the investigation was initiated at the request of Wake  County District Attorney Colon Willoughby.  </P> <P> The ABC report said one of the games in question is N.C. State's four-point  victory over Wake Forest on March 6, 1988. The Wolfpack had been favored to win  the game by 16 points, and the player Shackleford was guarding, Ralph Kitley,  scored a career-high 22 points. Kitley had been averaging seven points that  season.  </P> <P> Bill Dowdy, the chief investigator for the State Bureau of Investigation, said  the investigation probably will take "a pretty long time." He added:  "Certainly, we're aware that certain individuals will not be cooperating with  us."  </P> <P> According to ABC, the point-shaving scheme was "masterminded" by Robert Kramer  of Denville, N.J.  </P> <P> Kramer, a native of North Carolina, has admitted lending Shackleford $20,000  over about eight months in 1988. But Kramer has denied any involvement in a  point-shaving scheme, saying the money was to keep Shackleford out of the  clutches of a sports agent who was pressuring him to leave school early for the  NBA.  </P> <P> "I'm from North Carolina," Kramer was quoted in the New York Times as saying,  "and my home is very close to Charles' home. I'm a very big ACC fan,  particularly North Carolina State. After I befriended Charles, it came to my  attention that he had taken money from an agent to support himself and his  family. I interceded when Charles told me he was thinking about quitting school  after the basketball season."  </P> <P> The agent has been identified as Larry Gillman of Ridgefield, Conn., a former  head basketball coach at East Carolina University.  </P> <P> ABC, quoting unidentified law enforcement authorities working on the N.C. State  case, reported Friday that the investigation is focusing on Western Union cash  transfers. In March of 1988, ABC reported, two transfers for $400 each were  sent from a pharmacy in Orange, N.J., to Shackleford. Although the transfers  identified the sender's name as George Shackleford, ABC reported that the phone  numbers on the transfers trace to a phone paging device assigned to the  construction company owned by Kramer.  </P> <P> According to ABC, the law enforcement authorities are wondering why, if Kramer  was simply trying to help Shackleford deal with Gillman, the money was sent  under a fake name.  </P> <P> Valvano was removed as N.C. State athletic director but allowed to continue as  coach last year after evidence of academic irregularities and NCAA rules  violations surfaced. The NCAA placed his program on two years' probation for  violations that included the sale of complimentary tickets and athletic shoes  by Wolfpack players. Valvano said he had no knowledge of the violations.  </P> <P> With the point-shaving allegations coming to light, however, the pressure on  Valvano to leave N.C. State has intensified.  </P> <P> The Charlotte Observer editorialized: "For the sake of a great sport and a  great institution, Jim Valvano has to go. Now."  </P> <P> Said the Winston-Salem Journal: "For Coach Jim Valvano, it's only a matter of  time. The game is over."  </P> <P> But Larry K. Monteith, N.C. State's acting chancellor, has said he would not  suggest that any action be taken against Valvano until a review of the  basketball program, begun about a year ago, is completed.  </P> <P> "Everything is relevant to that review," Monteith said Thursday. "Obviously, I  don't have the circumstances at the moment to ask him to step down. We will  make no judgment until the allegations have been corroborated."  </P> <P> A Milan sports newspaper, Gazzetta dello Sport, reported that Valvano is  negotiating to become the coach of Phillips Milan of the Italian Basketball  League. Tony Cappellari, the team's general manager, called the report  "groundless."  </P> <P> Valvano, in his airport talk with reporters Friday, said: "Dealing in the  present is what my intention is, and there's no need to speculate about the  future."  </P> <P> Shackleford must deal with another matter -- his arrest Thursday night in  Orange, N.J., on a charge of possession of a small amount of marijuana.  </P></p>

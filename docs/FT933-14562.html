			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Japanese Elections: Takeshita forced on to the stump - But former prime minister is still the local hero 'LOOK, THERE he goes]' squeal women supporters as Mr Noboru Takeshita, former Japanese prime minister, climbs into his black chauffeur-driven Toyota surrounded by his 10 special police guards. While Mr Takeshita has faced heavy public criticism for his alleged links to gangsters and a more recent corruption scandal involving a gold leaf screen, back in Shimane prefecture, his local constituency in western Japan, he is still a hero. 'I know he'll get in,' says Mr Yutaka Adachi, who proudly says he is the same age as Mr Takeshita - 69. Shimane is a typical rural constituency. The sparsely populated region is represented by five MPs in the lower house, the same as a crowded urban district. For as long as people can remember, four out of the five seats have been held by the ruling Liberal Democratic party, and the benefits are brazenly apparent. The prefecture has the highest annual public works spending per capita. However, the political upheaval triggered by the no-confidence vote which brought down the government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa has also reached this traditionally conservative region. Mr Atsushi Nishikori, a 42-year-old candidate, is running for the New Harbinger Party, a splinter group from the LDP. Mr Takeshita, running as an independent because of LDP worries that his tarnished image would hurt the party, is facing one of the toughest election campaigns in his 35-year political career. He has been forced to run an unusually thorough campaign, holding meetings with his electorate for the first time in 24 years. He is aware of the opinion polls, where about 70 per cent of Japanese wanted Mr Takeshita's resignation, and is copying the exhaustive campaign tactics of his political mentor Mr Kakuei Tanaka, after he was indicted over a financial scandal in the 1970s. For the past week, Mr Takeshita has been driving through more than 20 towns and villages a day, speaking to groups of 30 to 60 supporters. Mr Takeshita looks relaxed, speaking in his hometown Shimane dialect, but he also feels the need to justify his past actions and blame the scandals on the media. He defends himself against claims that he had used gangster links to silence an extreme right-wing group which had mounted a 'praise to death' campaign against him in 1987 before his elevation to the premiership. 'I couldn't sue the Kominto (the right-wing group) because they were praising me,' he says in front of an audience of 30 in a hall in Hakuta, a village in the mountains. He also tells supporters that the scandal surrounding the sale of a gold leaf screen, the sale proceeds of which were allegedly given to politicians, including a secretary to Mr Takeshita, was 'made up by the media.' After apologising for the 'great sorrow caused among his friends back home,' he clenches his fist, claiming he has a mission to find the truth behind the scandal. Supporters listen intently to Mr Takeshita's recollections of the six summit meetings of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations he attended as finance minister or prime minister. 'I have many friends abroad,' he says, stressing his role as an elder statesman. Mr Takeshita expresses his concern for the environment, implying that he had proposed the earth summit in Rio last year. He does not fail to add his support to political reform. 'It's the sign of the times and I'd like to contribute what I can through my experience as a politician,' he says. After the 20-minute speech, Mr Takeshita leaves the modern village hall in the middle of the rice paddies. 'It's the media's fault that the LDP is having such a hard time,' says supporter Mr Adachi. With the help of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced former kingmaker of the LDP, Mr Takeshita led the largest faction within the party, but was forced to resign as prime minister in 1989 due to his involvement in the Recruit stock-for-favours scandal. However, even after Recruit, thanks to the vast supporter network and corporate votes from local construction companies, he managed to win the most votes in the prefecture. Elsewhere in the region, Mr Yoshio Sakurauchi, the 81-year-old former speaker of the lower house, who has represented Shimane for more than 40 years, calls through the loudspeakers for support. Although his age limits his campaigning to waving through the rice paddies from his van, and brief speeches in front of small local train stations, supporters rush out of their houses to cheer him on. Such deep-rooted support for the LDP has prevented NHP's Mr Nishikori from overtly criticising Mr Takeshita, although to many Japanese he is a symbol of political corruption. Mr Toshio Harada, head of Mr Nishikori's support group, says that some Shimane voters have come to realise that the prefecture is now the centre of the nation's attention. While national criticism of the old ways of Japanese politicking has heightened during the last few days of the election campaign, most Shimane voters expect Mr Takeshita to be elected. 'He still has very strong links with construction groups, who will give him the organised vote,' says Mr Kiyomi Osawa, a middle-aged office worker. However that is not the only reason he is likely to be re-elected. 'I don't care what the media says, Mr Takeshita is good for Shimane,' says a farmer, gazing at a newly road stretching towards the mountains.</p>

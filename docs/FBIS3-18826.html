			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock </F> by Ilse Oberhofer in Vienna -- live]    [Text] [Oberhofer] Good morning, Mr. Mock.    [Mock] Good morning.    [Oberhofer] We felt very bad about calling you so early. We  know that you came back from Brussels at 2 o'clock this morning.    [Mock] No problem.    [Oberhofer] Thank you. Your comment is important for us.  Things do not seem to be going well in Brussels at the moment.  You and State Secretary Ederer came back early this morning  without having achieved anything. Together with Sweden and  Finland, you were supposed to confirm officially and formally  the results achieved last week. This was not possible because  two other issues are still unresolved in Brussels. There are  claims that, if it is not possible to achieve agreement with  Norway, and if agreement cannot be reached in the discussion  about the blocking minority, the entire schedule of the European  Union might be in danger, and there might be problems concerning  Austrian membership in the European Union on 1 January 1995.  How do you assess the situation?    [Mock] Everything is open at the moment. Talks with the  three countries Sweden, Finland, and Austria have basically been  concluded. Thus, the only thing that was still missing was the  official confirmation and explanations concerning the wording of  the agreements. This has also been settled. The Norwegian  issue is still unresolved. Since negotiations always took place  on a bilateral basis, one can assume that our agreements might  be forwarded to the European Parliament, despite the suspension  of talks with Norway. However, the European Union must first  settle an internal issue -- the question concerning the blocking  minority. Today [Greek Foreign Minister Theodhoros] Pangalos,  the president of the Council of Ministers, will meet with the  president of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Then we  will see how things go.    [Oberhofer] Does this mean that we could go ahead without  Norway, but that the question of the blocking minority might be  crucial. When Austria negotiated with Brussels, was it possible  to foresee that this blocking minority might play such a big  role? There was never any mention of this problem.    [Mock] Since this question had been unsettled for a very  long time, everybody assumed that it would be resolved within a  week. Yet this was not the case.    [Oberhofer] You seem to believe that there are still major  difficulties ahead, that there is the possibility of a failure  to reach agreement. Talks on the blocking minority have not  only been postponed, but apparently they have been terminated.    [Mock] Political contacts are naturally taking place all the  time. Thus, negotiations have not really been terminated.  There are no official talks at the moment. The question now  has to be settled what the European Parliament can do, and what  is possible on the basis of the standing orders. This will be  discussed today.    [Oberhofer] Well, what is possible on the basis of the  standing orders? There have been contradictory statements in  this respect. Some officials claimed that a regulation is  required by 10 March, some mentioned 4 May. Generally, one has  the impression that the European institutions are rather  inflexible.    [Mock] I would say that, basically, this might happen in  every parliament. If the groups represented there reach  agreement, the standing orders can be handled in a relatively  flexible way. If they fail to achieve agreement, they have to  adhere closely to the standing orders. The same applies to the  European Parliament, which is much younger and does not have the  required experience.    [Oberhofer] Mr. Mock, is the impression correct that there  are currents in the European Union that are not really  interested in an enlargement of the community?    [Mock] This became apparent during the negotiations, and  it is one of the reasons why the talks were so tough. The  acceptance of new states was not a foregone conclusion. Some  members of the European Union are asking themselves whether the  union should be enlarged or not. However, the three countries  finally achieved a positive result. In the current difficult  situation, other factors are decisive -- that is, the fourth  applicant and, above all, an issue that must be settled  internally. The question is whether the European Parliament can  immediately start consultations and conclude them by the  beginning of May, prior to elections on 12 June, or whether this  is not possible.    [Oberhofer] Is is not frustrating for you, that, after the  enormous pressure under which you had to negotiate -- you  personally did not sleep for days -- things are now stagnating?    [Mock] Well, the situation is certainly not pleasant. Yet  one must always take a certain risk.    [Oberhofer] Mr. Mock, are you still hoping that things will  develop faster than one might expect at this point? Are you  still optimistic?    [Mock] I believe that we have achieved the most difficult  part. I hope that everything else will also be resolved on a  timely basis. Basically, I am optimistic.    [Oberhofer] Do you have to wait until you are called back to  Brussels to ratify and sign documents?    [Mock] We will certainly receive news today.    [Oberhofer] Mr. Mock, thank you very much for the interview.  Good bye.    [Mock] Good bye.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'LIFE IS A LONG QUIET RIVER' RUNS FUNNY AND DEEP  </P> <P> Etienne Chatiliez's stunningly original, provocative and darkly comic "Life Is  a Long Quiet River" (at the Music Hall), one of the best French films of recent  years, finds in the switching of babies at birth a rich source for social  satire. Putting a dizzying spin on the old nature-versus-nurture controversy,  Chatiliez introduces us two radically different households in a small  provincial city. (You may be surprised to find yourself reminded of the  made-in-Baltimore satires of John Waters, especially "Hairspray" and  "Crybaby.")  </P> <P> The Le Quesnoys live in a well-appointed, smoothly-run turn-of-the-century  townhouse. Monsieur Le Quesnoy (Andre Wilms) is the head of the local electric  company, and his determinedly smiling wife (Helene Vincent) works tirelessly at  being the perfect wife and mother.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, on the other side of town, the Groseilles are crammed into an untidy  apartment decorated in a riot of clashing floral prints. Monsieur Groseille  (Maurice Mons) is a skinny, tattooed deadbeat. Madame Le Quesnoy finds time to  run up place mats for charity sales and help her song-writing, pop-singing  priest stage his musical shows for children. All the pretty but fat Madame  Groseille (Christine Pignet) ever does is change the color of her hair.  </P> <P> Except that both families have a large number of children they would seem to  have nothing in common and no connection whatsoever -- until they learn that  the Le Quesnoys' 12-year-old Bernadette (Valerie Lalande) is really a Groseille  and that the Groseille's 12-year-old Maurice (Benoit Magimel) is a really a Le  Quesnoy. (How the two children came to be switched in the hospital where they  were born is too hilarious to be revealed here.)  </P> <P> Tone and control are overwhelmingly crucial in satire, and Chatiliez, an  esteemed, innovative director of commercials in his feature debut, reveals  himself to be a master of judiciousness who can tell as story with a camera as  easily as with a pen. "Life Is a Long Quiet River" -- that title is of course  ironic (and how!) -- is never, never merely a broad, superficial swipe at the  bourgeoisie. The beauty of the endlessly well-meaning Le Quesnoys' agonizingly  funny predicament when they try to do right by Maurice as well as Bernadette  derives from the fact that their religious piety and their passion for order is  a sincere, heartfelt expression of gratitude for their good fortune in life.  Chatiliez's point here is that security is after all an illusion, that  vulnerability in fact may be in direct proportion to the degree of one's moral  rectitude, and that life is inherently absurd anyway.  </P> <P> On the other hand, virtue and propriety are often luxuries that the Groseilles  simply cannot afford, yet they are warm and loving.  </P> <P> So often in satire filmmakers reserve sympathy for their central figures and  caricature everyone else, but while Chatiliez can be tart, even stinging, he is  steadfastly fair and clear-eyed. What makes "Life Is a Long Quiet River" (Times  rated Mature for adult themes, situations) work so well is that all its people  possess dimension, and its large cast, in which Helene Vincent is especially  notable for never letting Madame Le Quesnoy become merely a joke, is remarkably  disciplined yet seems always spontaneous. Of equal importance in the story are  veteran star Daniel Gelin as the local doctor, a veteran roue, and Catherine  Hiegel as his long-suffering nurse-mistress. Chatiliez, by the way, wisely  doesn't dwell on the heredity-versus-environment question but clearly comes  down on the side of environment when all is said and done.  </P> <P> 'LIFE IS A LONG QUIET RIVER'  </P> <P> An MK2 Productions USA release.

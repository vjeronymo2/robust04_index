			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dear listeners, we bring the following information  to your attention: The duration of programs of Azerbaijani  National Television is being reduced because of the energy  shortage in our Republic. For that reason, National Television  has been signing on at 1000, instead of 0900, since 14 March.  We will suspend the broadcast of the Azeri program by Tehran  Television on 16 March. Further reductions in our programs are  expected in the next few days.</p>

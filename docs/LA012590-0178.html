			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCIETY: A 'SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE' FOR THE ARTS IN S.D.  </P> <P> This town proved Friday that it is bigger than anybody thought.  </P> <P> That evening's "The Gala at the Center," a many-layered extravaganza wrapped  around the taping of the first America's Dance Awards and a showcase event for  the San Diego Convention Center, had the potential to be the Exxon Valdez of  San Diego fund-raisers.  </P> <P> Its failure would not have sunk the five performing arts organizations that  together benefitted to the tune of an estimated $250,000, but it would have  done nothing to smooth the increasingly roiled waters of local fund raising.  </P> <P> Among the rocks and shoals in the party's path were the many unknowns of  staging a monumental event -- in some respects, it was the largest in San Diego  history -- at the massive new center on Harbor Drive, a building with spaces  and dimensions that dwarf those of any other in the city.  </P> <P> Of equal significance was the response of many regular gala-goers, who  chorused, "Not me, Buddy," when invitations were mailed asking for ticket  purchases at $1,500 or $5,000 a couple.  </P> <P> But the last-minute sale of tickets priced at $125 brought the black-tie  attendance to more than 2,000, and, somehow, the logistics of feeding, moving  and entertaining more than 4,000 attendees were solved by 5 p.m. Friday.  </P> <P> "This is a significant milestone, and a sign that the arts and culture are  really hitting their stride in San Diego," said a very pleased Ernest Hahn, one  of the evening's honorary co-chairmen and the man acknowledged by insiders as  godfather of the gala's success.  </P> <P> "This is the terror of a lifetime," said event producer Kit Goldman as the  first guests began streaming up the outdoor ceremonial staircase that leads to  the center's bayside reception rooms. "You want everything to work, and it is  working, but I won't relax until the guests are eating, drinking and being  merry."  </P> <P> Goldman's Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company will share the gala's proceeds with  the Bowery Theatre, the San Diego Repertory Theatre, Sushi, the San Diego  Foundation for the Performing Arts and the "I Have a Dream" scholarship fund  jointly founded by the beneficiaries to assist local students pursuing careers  in the performing arts.  </P> <P> A crush of limousines and buses delivered the crowd into the arms of Marine  Corps and Navy personnel, who escorted guests down the Hollywood-style red  carpet and set them loose in Goldman's elaborately contrived fun house, a  series of reception rooms outfitted with movie studio-like sound stages that  invited guests to don costumes and be videotaped in scenes from "Gone with the  Wind," "Destry Rides Again," "Dracula" and other film classics. The tapes were  played hours later for the general amusement at the post-performance supper,  and, since supper was a far-off event, elaborate buffets offered witty rehashes  of the films' motifs. Tables near the "Dracula" set, for example, bore great  platters of steak tartare and blood sausage.  </P> <P> Dance patron Danah Fayman, who co-chaired the gala with former San Diego  Charger Kellen Winslow, was among those who assigned the focus of the event  more to the convention center than to the dance awards program, even though the  show included appearances by such dance greats as Shirley MacLaine,  Ann-Margret, Sammy Davis Jr., Harold and Fayard Nicholas (The Nicholas  Brothers), Cyd Charisse, Chita Rivera, Patrick Swayze and Liza Minnelli.  </P> <P> "Finally, it's really happening, at last," Fayman said. "A few people thought  tonight would never happen, but I never doubted. Too many people and groups --  and the city, for that matter -- wanted to celebrate this terrific building for  the gala not to happen."  </P> <P> The guest list, if it included a relatively small percentage of those on the  city's charity ball circuit, was certainly diversified. Among those bobbing and  weaving through the crowd were Gayle and Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.);  diminutive sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer; perennial America's Cup skipper  Dennis Conner with his wife, Judy, and developer Doug Manchester with his wife,  Betsy.  </P> <P> Fortified with quail legs and guacamole against the two-hour duration of the  awards taping, guests headed down to the main-floor auditorium and settled into  cushioned folding chairs whose backs are stamped "San Diego Convention Center,"  possibly to protect them against a fate similar to that suffered by countless  supermarket shopping carts.  </P> <P> The crowd applauded politely as choreographer Paula Abdul accepted three  "Gypsies," as the awards granted by the recently organized National Academy of  Dance are known, sat up straight when former first lady Betty Ford presented  and accepted the Dance Hall of Fame recognition given choreographer Martha  Graham, and cheered with a notable degree of enthusiasm when Ann-Margret strode  on stage to present the "Best Dance in a Television Special " Gypsy to  Disney/MGM Studios Theme Park Opening, which was accepted by legendary hoofer  Ann Miller and legendary rodent Mickey Mouse.  </P> <P> Some of the celebrities skipped the post-performance gala, but Betty Ford and  Liza Minelli joined the 1,400 who sat down to dinner in the cavernous upstairs  banquet hall. (Other hundreds in yet another ticket category attended a banquet  before the program, and the arrangements for the overall event were, quite  simply, staggeringly monumental.)  </P> <P> Servers numbering 150 in white mess jackets and gloves stood at attendance as  the throng streamed endlessly into the room, the Wayne Foster Orchestra caused  immediate traffic jams on both immense dance floors and the video monitors  played to no one, since the eyes of the crowd were turned upon itself.  </P> <P> The dinner, the first formal banquet to be served at the convention center, was  ambitious and consisted of salmon Charlotte, veal chops in morel mushroom sauce  and chocolate shells filled with vanilla mousse.  </P> <P> Wilson took a brief turn at the podium and declared the event "a very special  night for San Diego and a very special night for the arts."  </P> <P> Co-chair Winslow offered a longer and quite optimistic address.  </P> <P> "We have just seen the start of a great tradition in San Diego, and I hope you  all realize the magnitude of this event," he said. "Next year, there will be  twice as many people here, and the year after that three times as many, and,  after the center is expanded, we will use the whole facility."  </P> <P> Among the many others in attendance were steering committee chairman Ed Plant  with Kathy Hubbard; dinner chairman Sharon Considine; finance chair Stan  Heyman; Barry McComic; George Saadeh; San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau  director Dal Watkins; City Council members Abbe Wolfsheimer and Ron Roberts,  and Ed Cooperman, president and CEO of American Express Travel Related Services  Co., the corporate presenter of America's Dance Awards.  </P></p>

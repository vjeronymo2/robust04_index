			<p>CSO     [Text] Pozsony [Bratislava] -- Vladimir Zhirnovskiy,  chairman of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party, will not be  visiting Slovakia this weekend after all. According to  information received by the Slovak press, the reason for the  cancellation of what had been scheduled originally as "a  friendly tourist visit" was the situation that had developed in  Russia. Zhirnovskiy and his associates regard that situation as  too dangerous for the party leader to be absent for four or five  days abroad.    Meanwhile, very significant confidence-building documents  have been produced at the expert level, as a result of which a  Deportation Treaty will be signed between Hungary and Slovakia  in May (or at least the Slovak side so expects), and at least  one border-crossing point will be opened. It has not yet been  decided which of the three border-crossing points will be the  one to be opened while the Boross government is still in office,  but the signing of the Deportation Treaty has been decided, at  least by the Slovak side.    A dispute arose between the two countries due to Slovakia's  other deportation treaties, because they anticipated that  Hungary would become the "reception center" for refugees. As a  result of talks between experts, held in Budapest on 11 May, the  contracting parties agreed to take back their own citizens in  the normal way and to classify arrivals from third countries  into three categories. It was already indisputable earlier that  when citizens of a third country held residence permits or  visas, the contracting parties were willing to proceed in  accordance with international norms. In the case of persons  staying illegally in the other country's territory, a refugee  from a third country will be accepted back within 48 hours, even  it can be proved that he had arrived from the contracting  party's country, where he had likewise been staying illegally.  This provision of the treaty goes beyond the customary treaties  and presupposes an agreement that suggests good relations  between the two countries. In the Slovak side's opinion, it is  not necessary to wait with the signing of the treaty until a new  government has been formed. That would be an unnecessary delay  during the summer tourist season.</p>

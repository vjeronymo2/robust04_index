			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Reed Elsevier advances 30% but issues caveats Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch information and publishing group, yesterday celebrated its first year as a combined operation by announcing a 30 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 534m (Dollars 779m) from Pounds 412m. But the City marked down the shares of both partners, after warnings that price increases were more difficult to achieve in low inflation conditions and that paper and print costs were subject to upward pressures. In London, Reed International closed down 27p at 878p and Elsevier dropped Pounds 1.33 to Pounds 62.90. Mr Peter Davis, co-chairman, responded: 'We were not trying to signal an end to improvement in margins. We intend to continue to improve them.' Reed Elsevier's 1993 sales rose 14 per cent to Pounds 2.8bn, although the improvement was only 2 per cent stripping out currency factors and acquisitions. Operating profits rose 17 per cent to Pounds 558m. During the year Reed Elsevier spent Pounds 403m on acquisitions, including Pounds 277m on Official Airline Guides. Further acquisitions are likely this year, particularly in legal publishing, although the importance of continued organic growth was stressed by senior executives. Mr Pierre Vinken, co-chairman, commented that if the group stopped making acquisitions, 'you can say goodbye to double digit growth'. Professional publishing achieved 14 per cent underlying growth, excluding currency changes, acquisitions and pension credits. Business publishing came second with 12 per cent, while consumer rose 9 per cent. Scientific and medical was confined to 2 per cent, partly because of uncertainty in pharmaceuticals markets. The company warned that although 1993 ended more strongly than it began, there remained grounds for caution in the UK and US, while in continental Europe indications of any recovery in trading conditions were 'very limited'. For Reed International shareholders, earnings per share rose 40 per cent to 37.4p - or 17 per cent to 35.8p excluding exceptionals. The full-year dividend goes up 12 per cent to 18.75p. For Elsevier shareholders, the earnings increase was 20 per cent to Fl 7.96 - or 16 per cent to Fl 7.63 - and the dividend virtually doubles to Fl 5.19. Auditor change, Page 22; Lex, Page 20</p>

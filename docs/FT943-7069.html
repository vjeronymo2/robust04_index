			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / China orders controls on food prices as inflation hits 24.2% China signalled its alarm yesterday at a big jump in retail inflation by ordering a nation-wide drive against food price rises, the main cause of the latest inflationary surge. The country's newspapers, reflecting government concerns about social unrest, headlined a directive from the ministry of internal trade calling on state food distribution agencies to 'stabilise' the market. This demand coincided with the release of inflation figures for the 35 main cities showing that retail prices rose by 24.2 per cent in the 12 months to July. Prices were much higher than previous months because of big increases in staple commodities such as grain, vegetables and pork. The jump in July prices, reversing the moderating trend of the first six months, has unnerved the government, which had believed its tight money policies were beginning to counter an inflationary spiral. There was no mention in the directive of the reintroduction of price controls on staples, but localities were authorised to distribute commodities from stockpiles or use special funds earmarked for the purpose to stabilise prices. Official worries about possible social unrest fuelled by rising prices follow the release last week of figures showing that capital spending in July had leapt by 72.9 per cent compared with the same period last year. While western economists cautioned that not too much could be read into one month's fixed asset investment figures, the government was sufficiently concerned to announce it was tightening credit. The authorities are almost certainly bracing themselves for more bad news, with pressures on food prices in both southern China, where there has been widespread flooding, and the north, which has been suffering from drought. Beijing has also promised hard-pressed farmers further increases in grain prices. The state statistical bureau reported that the food price index for city-dwellers rose 31.9 per cent in July compared with the same month last year. Grain prices jumped by 57.8 per cent and vegetables by 29.7 per cent. The government's target of national retail inflation of 10 per cent for 1994 is now certain to be surpassed.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> 'Hour Of Power' Outage?: The Rev. Robert H. Schuller says he will pull the plug  on his "Hour of Power" worldwide TV ministry if viewers don't send in $3.2  million to cover its debts.  </P> <P> "What I said is not an exaggeration. We are that close to terminating the  television ministries. . . . There's no money in the bank," Schuller said. He  will warn viewers of the possible cancellation and launch a five-week  fund-raising drive on Sunday's program. He blamed his financial problems on the  rising costs of purchasing airtime. It costs $14 million annually to broadcast  the show. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

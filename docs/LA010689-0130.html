			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> A temporary suspension on debt payments announced over the weekend by Venezuela  President Jaime Lusinchi will probably be extended to include the second  quarter and maybe even the full year, foreign bankers said. Such an extension  could result in the nation postponing up to $1.532 billion of its $31-billion  international debt, they said. A telex that Venezuela sent to banks over the  weekend said the country would suspend payments from Jan. 17 to March 31.  </P></p>

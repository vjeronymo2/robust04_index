			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Gold price reaches 2 1/2-year high THE GOLD market bulls were in full cry at the end of this week as an accumulation of constructive signals prompted a surge in the London bullion market price to a 2 1/2 -year high. Only ten days ago speculators had been testing the bottom end of the recent trading range at about Dollars 366 a troy ounce. But when support at that level held they were quick to change tack. The resulting rally was interrupted briefly on Monday by a modest bout of technically-inspired selling. But the price fall was made up the next day in a prelude to an accelerating rise that culminated in yesterday's Dollars 6.50 advance to Dollars 390 an ounce, up Dollars 13.55 on the week. Investors seemed to be interested only in bullish developments, such as European interest rate cuts, signs of a quickening in US inflation and an announcement by international financier Sir James Goldsmith that he planned to swap gold mine shares for gold bullion. Professional traders took a more sceptical view of Sir James' announcement, however, expressing disbelief that a professional speculator would make such a revelation before the deal was completed. 'He has either already bought the gold,' said one trader, 'or he doesn't intend to buy any.' The traders suggested that the gold market had borrowed some of the renewed strength of the silver market, which was being buoyed up on a wave of buying from New York commodity funds. Gold was being dragged up, they said, because computer trading programmes frequently linked the two precious metals. Silver's upsurge continued yesterday, when it gained another 18.5 cents to close in London at 492.5 cents an ounce, up 44 cents on the week. The platinum market joined in the fun, the London price gaining Dollars 11.75 on the week to Dollars 395 an ounce at yesterday's afternoon fixing. But it was again outperformed by its sister metal, palladium, which rose Dollars 16.75 to a four-year high of Dollars 146 an ounce. Traders attributed palladium's impressive performance of late, which seems not to have been affected by the ups and downs of the other precious metals, to very strong physical demand from Japan, almost certainly from the electrical goods sector, and from US electrical goods producers. They also noted that the price rise had not elicited the usual increased deliveries from Russia, which accounts for about half the world's palladium supply. Mr Nikolai Menshikov, deputy director of the Platina unit of Russian precious metals exporter Almazyuvelirexport, denied suggestions that Russia was holding back on contracted supplies. He told Reuter his company was meeting all contracts to deliver the metal and would continue to act responsibly on world markets. At the London Metal Exchange the copper contract, which, along with lead, was switched on Thursday from sterling to US dollar denomination, at last managed to break through the Dollars 1,900-a-tonne barrier for three months metal. It closed yesterday at Dollars 1,923.50 a tonne, up Dollars 46.50 on the week. Traders said the rise partly reflected lost production at Chile's Chuquicamata mine but added that the market's attention was in particular focused on the US, where labour contracts at Kennecott and Phelps Dodge expired this week. Strike talk was in the air, they said. Another strong LME market was aluminium, aided by the long-awaited announcement of a substantial production cut. The mystery about where the expected retrenchment was to happen, which was still puzzling traders on Monday, was solved that night when Aluminum Company of America, the world's biggest producer, said it was to cut its primary aluminium production in the US by 268,000 tonnes a year, or nearly 25 per cent. As often happens when expected bullish news is announced, the market's immediate gains were quickly erased and LME aluminium prices actually ended lower on Tuesday. But they were quickly back into the plus column as traders looked around for other big producers to follow Alcoa's lead. So far none has appeared, but the expectations were given a boost yesterday by a strong rumour that the Bonneville Power Authority would shortly announce new electricity charges that could affect production policy decisions at several north-western US smelters. Three months delivery aluminium closed yesterday at Dollars 1,262.50 a tonne, up Dollars 33 on the week. Cocoa futures prices rallied at the London Commodities Exchange yesterday as concern about a possible supply squeeze forced up nearby positions. The September delivery position ended at Pounds 746 a tonne, up Pounds 26 on the day and Pounds 18 on the week. Robusta coffee prices were also stronger, the September quotation rising Dollars 12 on the day to finish Dollars 4 up on balance at Dollars 927 a tonne. But dealers noted that trading was very quiet. Oil prices, already depressed by continuing overproduction by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting countries, came under further pressure late this week after the US said it would allow Iraq to export some oil if Baghdad agreed on conditions with the United Nations in talks next week. On the European physical market North Sea Brent blend prices sank to six-month lows, and at London's International Petroleum Exchange the September futures price fell 61 cents on the week to an 18-month low of Dollars 17.08 a barrel in late trading yesterday.  --------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------- Aluminium     +11,450 to 1,899,375 Copper        -1,150  to 447,075 Lead          -75     to 261,600 Nickel        -1,170  to 85,476 Zinc          +1,625  to 689,500 Tin           -105    to 20,470  ---------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bonds weakness drives Footsie down to 3,100 - Market report Weakness in sterling and in UK government bonds left the FT-SE 100 Index down 25 points yesterday, and struggling to hold on to the 3,100 support level. Trading volume was not heavy but the announcement that Britain's MO money supply jumped by an annualised 6.2 per cent in April emphasised the market's growing fear that the next move in domestic interest rates could be up, rather than down. Losses in long-dated gilts were extended to nearly two points in late trading, and the investment mood turned significantly bearish. The bears justified yesterday's downturn by pointing to the UK local elections to be held tomorrow, at which Mr John Major's government is widely expected to suffer a setback. As always, political nervousness was more marked in the foreign exchange markets than in domestic equities. These factors combined to set an unhappy background to this morning's routine meeting between the chancellor of the exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England. The surge in money supply is likely to increase the Bank's caution towards any suggestion of cutting UK interest rates at present. Early deals brought a rash of gains in share prices as London hoped that the closure of Japanese markets for the Golden Week might lift the pressure from the US dollar. But initial firmness in stock index futures quickly disappeared when the money supply figures were announced, and from then on, the equity market unravelled steadily, with the stock index futures at a discount for much of the session. London tried to rally when Wall Street opened but, with the Dow Industrial Average uncertain and down 2.37 in UK hours, there was little to help the Footsie resist renewed losses in gilts. The FT-SE Index was 25.3 down at 3,100 exactly, having rallied from 3,095.8 at the day's low. The Footsie has been jousting with the 3,100 support level since the middle of March and traders sounded unconvinced last night that this important benchmark level would be held if bond markets continued to slip. The wider market, less closely linked to the futures contract, performed somewhat better than the blue chip sectors and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell only 5.8 to 3,775.3. The market setback was all the greater in that the pharmaceutical shares, which are heavily weighted in index terms, were in good form following news of nearly Dollars 8bn in acquisition deals in the US by multinational companies. SmithKline Beecham jumped sharply after paying Dollars 2.3bn for Diversified Pharmaceutical Services of the US, hard on the heels of the Pounds 5.3bn purchase of Syntex by Roche. The renewed focus on company takeovers kept the spotlight on Lasmo, although the shares continued to weaken behind its predator, Enterprise Oil, which is bidding in paper;there was little immediate reaction to a formal offer document from Enterprise. Trading volume increased as share prices gave ground, but the final total of 559.4m shares traded through the Seaq network was still below Friday's figure. Several trading programmes were identified. Traders drew little comfort from the moderate turnover, however, and the market closed on a distinctly unhappy note, with the domestic scene clouded over by prospects for sterling and the international scene by those for the US dollar/yen rate.</p>

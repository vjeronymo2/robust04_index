			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abdollah Nuri, member of Tajikistan's </F> Islamic movement, with an unidentified JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI  correspondent; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Please give us a brief  biography and speak about your Islamic activities.    [Nuri] In the name of God, the almighty and merciful. I am  'Abdollah Nuri and am 46 years old. I was born in Tajikistan's  mountainous region during the communist rule and at the peak of  atheistic and communist propaganda. [passage omitted]    Since my father was acquainted with Islam, he started to  teach religion to his children. At that time, the KGB put  pressure on the Muslims. But despite all these pressures, we  learned Islamic teachings and ideology from our father. I  continued my studies in Dushanbe with a learned scholar, Qari  Mohammad Jan, who had been in Afghanistan and India. [passage  omitted]    In 1971, I was officially summoned by the KGB for the first  time and was threatened because of my educational activities.  Again in 1973 I was arrested by the KGB in the basement of a  house in Dushanbe where we held secret classes. But fortunately  our teacher, Qari Mohammad Jan, was not present at that time.  However, all the students who were in the classroom were  arrested. The KGB intended to send us to prison and then to  exile us to Siberia. But we bribed them and were released.    Then pressures on us and on our father started and we were  unable to continue our studies in Dushanbe. Therefore, we went  to Forqan Tappeh which was our home and continued our lessons in  night classes. It was in the same year that liberation  movements were initiated by me and since we were under extreme  pressure, we sought solutions so that we would be free to  practice our religion and to carry out our Islamic duties. With  God's help, we received books from abroad which offered us  solutions to our problems. [passage omitted]    With the help of these books and Koranic teachings we  reached  the conclusion that the Islamic movement should be in the form  of an organization, and that the numerous Islamic forces inside  Tajikistan should be consolidated and work under the supervision  of a group and a movement to vindicate our rights and to  propagandize Islamic ideas among the youths who had been  distracted from Islam by the communists. For this reason, we  formed this group and continued our struggles. [passage omitted]    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Since then what have the activities of  this movement been?    [Nuri] [Passage omitted] The revolution in Afghanistan was  an  impetus to our movement. But the basis of our movement was the  victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran in which all the  forces in the movement and all the Muslims in Tajikistan  trusted. After the Islamic revolution in Iran, these forces  were convinced that when Islam was able to prevail in Iran, the  same could happen in other countries too. This gave the people  self-confidence. [passage omitted]    We were able to achieve the official recognition of the  Islamic Movement Party in Tajikistan. Following this  recognition, the movement was led by Hemmatzadeh. Our first  newspaper was HAQIQAT-E ESLAMI [Islamic Truth], the publication  of which led to the arrest of more than 24 of the Islamic  Movement's members. Later on a magazine called HEDAYAT  [Guidance] was published. After the official recognition of our  movement, the Islamic Movement Party started the publication of  another newspaper called NEJAT [Salvation].    [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Apart from publications, what other  activities did the Islamic Movement have?    [Nuri] Among the activities of the Islamic Movement was its  calls on youths to turn to Islam and the formation of meetings  and gatherings for the people. [passage omitted]    We also established a school with the people's help in order  to offer Islamic teaching to our Muslim children. [passage  omitted]</p>

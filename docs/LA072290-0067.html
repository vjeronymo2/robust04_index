			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASIA BETTER WISE UP ON ISSUES OF CONSCIENCE  </P> <P> "Asian Market Heats up for U.S. Furriers" (July 9) further convinced me that  Asian consumers and business leaders need to work on their humanity. It also  convinced me to make a greater effort to boycott Japanese and South Korean  products; I'm sure glad I didn't buy that Acura Legend last year.  </P> <P> Now that Americans and Europeans have become more aware of the cruelty and  waste involved in utilizing both wild and "ranch-raised" animals, it's time to  tap the consciences of those who will listen in Asia and to continue to wind  down the entire existence of a fur trade in any country, especially the United  States. Interestingly, it's also the Asians who continue to trade in illegal  ivory, promote drift nets in the eastern Pacific and slaughter certain  creatures for the aphrodisiac properties of some small part of their anatomies.  </P> <P> With due respect for positive qualities in Asian countries, many U.S. consumers  find all of that disgusting.  </P> <P> JOANNE HEDGE  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

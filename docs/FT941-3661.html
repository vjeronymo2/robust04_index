			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Calderburn 25% lower at Pounds 2.1m Calderburn, the Preston-based office furniture group, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.1m for 1993, a 25 per cent shortfall on the previous year's Pounds 2.83m. The 1993 figure took account of non-recurring costs of Pounds 400,000, but excluded any contribution from Specialised Banking Furniture International, acquired on December 29. Turnover improved from Pounds 25.9m to Pounds 26.7m. Earnings emerged at 5.7p (7.4p) but 'reflecting confidence in future prospects' the total dividend is held at 7.7p via a proposed final of 4.9p. The directors said there had been a strong start to the year across the group with order intake for the opening two months well ahead of the comparative period of 1993. They added that a continuation of the current trends would lead to an improved performance for the first half. The enlarged factory at Altham will be completed on schedule in July and directors stated that it would be within the budgeted cost of Pounds 4m.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Floods continue to threaten Midwest towns THE Mississippi threatened more towns and farmland in Illinois and Missouri yesterday as the swollen river pushed relentlessly south, Reuter reports from St Louis. Prison officials in Chester, Illinois, ordered a heightened state of alert as they planned to move inmates in low-lying cells to higher ground. At St Genevieve, Missouri, volunteers fought to keep a sandbag levee from crumbling. A city spokeswoman said that unless there was a surge of one inch 'we should be okay', as the crest approached the town later in the day. The floods have caused an estimated Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in damage. In Washington a congressional committee approved Dollars 3bn in emergency aid for the flood zone yesterday as some legislators predicted Congress might have to triple that amount eventually. The army's Corps of Engineers said the river had not fallen much at St Louis and would begin rising slightly again. The floods in river valleys and rain-soaked farm fields have persisted for more than a month in nine Midwestern states, killing as many as 31 people and driving at least 30,000 people from their homes. The misery spread to parts of Kansas yesterday where evacuations were under way along the Kansas river following heavy rainfall. Officials in Leavenworth County, north of Kansas City, warned residents that water being released from two reservoirs farther west in the state would cause additional flooding. The volume of the task facing clean-up crews was becoming clearer. Crews would face a smelly, difficult and dangerous job once the floodwaters receded, experts on flooding said. The overwhelming stench of spilt diesel fuel, rotting algae and animal carcasses will hamper their effort, as will a thick layer of mud, rusting appliances and other detritus swept up by the waters and dumped on the flood-plain. Petroleum products, agricultural pesticides and fertilisers, human and animal waste and tonnes of silt have been swept into the river, along with uprooted trees.</p>

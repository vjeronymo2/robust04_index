			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Girobank integration boosts Alliance Alliance &amp; Leicester, the UK's fourth largest building society, announced yesterday that it is to integrate personal customers of its Girobank subsidiary. From May the 1.4m personal Girobank customers will be transferred to A&amp;L although they will still have access to post office facilities and telephone banking services. The move will bring to A&amp;L about half of Girobank's balance sheet, including retail savings expected to amount to about Pounds 1bn. A&amp;L bought Girobank from the Post Office for Pounds 112m in 1990, and there has been considerable recent speculation among building societies as to how the relationship between the two would be resolved. The move was made possible by the Alliance &amp; Leicester (Girobank) Act 1993. It will not affect Girobank's corporate banking activities, including the cash-handling business and transaction processing operations. Mr Peter White, A&amp;L's chief executive, said the change would enhance the opportunities for cross-selling financial products to A&amp;L's customers. He said its strategy was 'relationship- rather than product-driven', and that customers would benefit as all the personal financial services of the group were more readily available to them. The extra liquidity which the transfer will bring to A&amp;L stands it in good stead as the market for mortgage lending recovers. It is likely to represent an increase of about 10 per cent in A&amp;L's existing retail deposits of about Pounds 10bn. Including Girobank, A&amp;L has about 5.5m personal customers. Only the relatively small number of Girobank mortgage borrowers will become A&amp;L shareholders, with the majority of customers, with current and savings accounts, becoming depositors.</p>

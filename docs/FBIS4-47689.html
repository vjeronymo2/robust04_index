			<p>BFN     [Tect] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- Election tallies from the  crucial Nasrec [National Exhibition Center] counting centre from  which the main PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] result  is expected would probably not be completed until midnight on  Monday [2 May], IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]  Commissioner Helen Suzman, predicted on Sunday. She said the  task was huge, had started under chaotic circumstances and now  faced the problem that many counters were teachers who had to be  back at school on Monday.    Permission would be sought, particularly from the DET  [Department of Education and Training], for these teachers to  continue counting.    Asked about the chances of the election being declared free  and fair, she said she would like to quote Prime Minister John  Vorster to say the alternative was too ghastly to contemplate.  "But we have a useful adjective," she said. It was the word  "substantially". "I don't know whether anybody knows what it  really means but its a useful word."</p>

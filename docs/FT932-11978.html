			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / The Property Market: Green shoots on building sites / Examining tentative evidence suggesting that the worst may soon be over 'There is now a widely held view that the property investment market has reached the bottom of the cycle.' - Knight Frank &amp; Rutley 'It seems that the worst is now behind us.' - Jones Lang Wootton 'There is a feeling that we are at the bottom.'  - Investment Property Databank After numerous false dawns, claims that the property slump is approaching an end are rightly treated with scepticism. None the less, there is hope that a recovery of sorts in certain parts of the market may be within sight. Yields have already hardened in pockets of the market in response to selective buying. In the central London office market, which has been the focus of interest from German investors, yields have dropped by as much as 1.75 per cent. There is also anecdotal evidence of increased interest from potential occupants. Brixton Estate, which owns offices and industrial property in the home counties, this week reported a significant rise in tenant inquiries over the past month. The case for optimism was summarised this week by the Investment Property Databank, a research group. 'Yields have risen to a point where many commentators argue that returns will exceed those of other investment media (gilts or equities) over the next five years,' said Mr Rupert Nabarro, director. 'When capital values cease to fall, a 9 per cent return or so will be on offer; in the medium term real rents, at historically low levels, are likely to rise,' said Mr Nabarro. Values, he added, are well below replacement costs, which will force rents to recover rapidly as and when new buildings are needed. 'High income yield, low market rents and property capitalisation rates above gilts are a potent cocktail,' he said. Optimists might draw further comfort from the equity market. Property shares have outperformed the rest of the market by 27 per cent over the past seven months. Investors recognised that sterling's 15 per cent devaluation following its exit from the exchange rate mechanism last September and falling interest rates rescued the market from its hopeless condition of last summer in which companies' ability to pay dividends came under increasing pressure. So far, so good. However, the fundamental problems facing the market remain largely unresolved. A swift turnaround in the fortunes of the industry has never been on the cards. The end of the recession, officially declared by the government this week, does not, by itself, signal an end to the property downturn. An economic recovery is a necessary, but not sufficient, requirement for an end to the property slump. With the exception of the retail warehouse market, rents are still falling. Last year, rents dropped by 12.2 per cent, according to IPD. Rents will continue to fall until the glut of empty buildings have been occupied and the trend of rising unemployment is reversed. It will also take a period of sustained economic growth before demand from investors spreads throughout the market. At present, investor demand is confined to buildings with financially secure tenants on long leases, which account for less than a quarter of the market. Investors will continue to play it safe until they are confident they would be able to relet a building if a tenant defaulted. Other factors that are likely to constrain recovery are the shortage of buyers compared with the numbers of would-be sellers, and the unwillingness of banks to lend to the industry. Banks are currently burdened with a mountain of property debt. Predicting the likely balance of buyers and sellers is complex. There is certainly no dearth of buyers. Even during the depths of recession, the market never dried up in the way it did during the property crash of the early 1970s. Some big players have emerged. The Wellcome Trust is to invest Pounds 250m in the market over the next few years. 'The market is coming to the bottom of the cycle . . . With yields of 7 to 8 per cent, property is looking very attractive. There must be opportunities to buy,' says Mr Ian Macgregor, director of finance. Moreover, overseas investors are increasingly important players, with a rapidly growing portfolio of about Pounds 9bn, according to IPD. Overseas buyers have increased their activity since sterling's departure from the ERM devaluation last September. That said, the current burst of optimism may well prove a blip in the same way as the surge of investment by Japanese and Swedish buyers in the late 1980s eventually came to nothing. Many investors still lack the funds to make new investments. For instance, most of the big property companies and several non-property groups with large property holdings may be forced to sell property. The decline in asset values has pushed their gearing up to unacceptable levels. This trend might be reversed if the recent outperformance of property equities allows companies to raise fresh equity. According to Andrew Walker of Erdman Lewis, chartered surveyors, if companies are able to raise Pounds 1bn this year balance sheets will have strengthened sufficiently to enable them to become net investors once more. The institutions are also reluctant purchasers, partly because of the sharp reduction in their own cash flow and partly because of the disastrous underperformance of property over the past decade. Last year net investment by pension funds and insurance companies was the lowest in 12 years at Pounds 750m - 32 per cent down on the previous year and only 40 per cent of the high point in 1989. The uncertain state of the British economy makes for unreliable forecasts. But some indication of the prospects of different sectors is gradually emerging. Retail property appears to be leading the pack. Industrial property rents will be depressed by the overhang of second-hand space, although strong manufacturing growth would generate a robust upturn in the mid-1990s. Prospects for the office sector are bleak, but the small supply pipeline could revive prospects in the mid-1990s. London and the south-east will suffer disproportionately this year from weak demand and oversupply. None the less the gap between north and south is less pronounced than it was two years ago, according to IPD. The disparities in market conditions across the country are narrowing rapidly.</p>

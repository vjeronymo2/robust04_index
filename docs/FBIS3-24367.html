			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by SELSKAYA ZHIZN correspondent Viktor Karpov, </F> Pskov Oblast, under rubric "Apropos Notes": "There's No Respect  for the Mandates...: What the Unheld Election Demonstrated to  the Pskov Oblast Assembly of Deputies"]    [Text] The election to the Pskov Oblast Assembly of  Deputies was scheduled for 29 January. After the Soviets had  been dispersed (it is difficult to use any other term), similar  kray, oblast, and city Dumas, boards, hurals, etc.,  etc. are supposed to be -- in the minds of the new  "constitutionalists" who seized the upper hand over the Soviet  authority in October of last year -- from now on the  representative authority at the regional level. They are  supposed to be, so to speak, a balance to the executive  authority. Although what kind of "balance" can that be, if their  weight categories are simply not comparable? It's like the  elephant and the mosquito. The executive authority long ago  become overgrown to its indecently swollen state, and more and  more departments are multiplying more rapidly than rabbits.  Incidentally, there were supposed to be a total of 21 "Duma men"  in that same Pskov Assembly, of whom only eight were "with  portfolio," that is, salaried. So just try "balancing" this  incomplete platoon with an army of officials which, a very long  time ago, became crowded in the thick-walled building of the  former cadet corps that, quite recently, used to be called the  oblast House of Soviets. It makes you wonder whether the "Duma  men" will become such important, but, alas, decorative  farces majeures under the ruling "court" for the  purpose of playing ring-around-the-rosy there.    As for the ring-around-the-rosy, there have already been  precedents. You might recall that, at the dawn of perestroyka,  its "romantic Rastrelli" reproached the Soviets, coupled with  the trade unions and public organizations: don't play  ring-around-the-rosy with us "prorabs [work  superintendents] of perestroyka, but toughen up! Fight for  people and for their welfare, without worrying about your own  stomach! But they did not take heed... It was all in vain. They  played ring-around-the-rosy... The Soviets do not exist as a  political force -- it took just one rescript to flatten them  like an importunate fly. The trade unions also do not really  exist any more, and those that do are completely remote from  real life... But this is really apropos. Let's return to the  Pskov election.    It was the first election to be held in Russia. It was  Saturday. I'm sitting there, drinking my tea... The voting  district where I am registered is around the corner, in a nearby  school. I wonder whether or not I should go there. I recall how  many times during the past two years the authority had called  me, requested me, and entreated me to go to the ballot box so  that I could give it my mandate to do what it later would  attempt to do in order to make my life happy and cloudfree. But  it is becoming not better, but increasingly difficult to live  from day to day.    So I'm sitting there, drinking my tea, and looking out of  the  window. I recall how, a month and a half earlier, when our last  and decisive fight in front of the ballot boxes was announced  again, people in the dark morning hours (it was, after all,  December) walked single-file across my courtyard on their way to  the school. But today it is already the middle of the day, and  there don't seem to be many citizens who are inspired by the  election. Just one or two, and that's it.    My contemplative tea-drinking was suddenly disturbed. The  local television company broke off its broadcast on the  Russia-wide channel, and a member of the okrug electoral  commission appeared on the screen: my dear voters, he says with  a somewhat reproachful tone of voice, it might be a good time to  remind you about performing your civic duty, rather than beating  all your carpets and vacuuming your rooms. The voting, he said,  is being discontinued so that it looks as though it might be  necessary to hold a re-election, once again at the expense of  you taxpayers. I must confess that this pressure upon my freedom  of choice, this unceremonious conduct, coupled with the threat  to empty once again my already empty pocket, irked me. And if  this had happened in the much vaunted Western democracies, it  certainly wouldn't have done much good for the frisky guy from  the electoral commission. Because he broke the citizens' right:  to vote for, or against, or not at all. And that "hand-breaker"  who had smashed the voter's hands would have been fired and  given a big fine,, and the election results would have been  disputed in court. But that is how "they" do it...    In our country, on the other hand, people, even though they  are not well versed with regard to their electoral right, are  nevertheless hardened -- they were not even afraid of those  goadings from the television set. The result was the complete  failure of the election in Pskov, in Velikiye Luki (and there  approximately one-third of the electoral oblast), and this  predetermined the failure of the election to the oblast  assembly. But in the rural rayons, on the other hand, the  activity was sufficient, and their residents gave mandates to  their 13 emissaries to the oblast parliament. (More later about  why that occurred.) However, there was just one mandate lacking  to get the quorum necessary to proclaim the oblast assembly of  deputies. Therefore the oblast parliament has not yet occurred,  and a re-election has been scheduled for 27 March. That is  enough time also to think a bit about why today's voter "does  not have any respect for mandates," and about where the pointer  of the political barometer in the province is currently pointing.    At a session of the okrug electoral commission the election  results were evaluated as a surprise. A few people also  mentioned the reason why the people had "voted with their feet":  they said that, both in Pskov and in Velikiye Luki, on the eve  of the election not only the so-called "budget people," but also  the workers at many plants and factories, had not received their  wages. And if that is so, then why the hell do we need an  authority that does not pay us for our work? They explained that  people have got completely tired of elections, referendums, and  also those that only worsen the Russia-wide crisis. It was noted  that even the day -- Saturday -- had been poorly chosen. And was  it really a good idea to come out with this election "ahead of  all of Russia"? Especially so early, in January, when nothing,  not even the budget, was yet definite.    Well, there probably is a grain of truth in these  explanations (true, they were made after the fact). They would  have been exhaustive if the executive authority -- and it was  precisely that authority that became the lead horse in holding  the election campaign -- would honestly admit that this time it  had been undone by impatience. They thought that people had not  yet recovered after the December "presidential triumph" and once  again would obediently do what they were told to do. But it did  not happen...    By and large, the voters in the major cities "voted with  their feet" against the unbearable living conditions today. They  voted against the reforms being carried out hurriedly,  high-handedly, at a full gallop. And, finally, the impoverished  people, who in addition are under the threat of complete  unemployment tomorrow, oppose such attacks. Are we really  supposed to believe that there is anyone who does not understand  this yet?    Just as, incidentally, the fact that the voters lowered the  boom on the way to the seats in the oblast parliament to those  contenders for those seats who include themselves in the  "democratic" camp. And with what a clamor they had been making  their way there! With what "programs"! One contender beat  himself on the chest, swearing that he would become the only  defender of all the offended and abused. Another one promised in  a single blow to end all the political battles that had brought  the country and the oblast to collapse. And still another one, a  businessman, planned to start a "vendetta" against bureaucrats  of all kinds. What scope, what boldness of ideas! One might  think that this was not an oblast assembly with a clearly  delineated scope of competency that the person was dashing into,  but at least some European parliament. "All this, my friend, is  words, words, words," Pushkin used to say, and so the voter  proved to be nobody's fool. He saw through the blabbermouths  with their promises. The rating that most of the "Pskov fathers  of democracy" got was bad enough for them to shoot themselves.    They were not even helped by the "letters of recommendation"  from the Moscow "fathers of democracy and apostles of reforms,"  that were widely printed in the local newspapers. Yes, that is  what the general practice is now -- "just like in the better  homes..." Previously the recommendations used to be given there  to all the governesses, intellectuals not of noble birth, and  beginning clerks who were seeking work with ruined  petty-bourgeois noblemen... Today they also are taking care of  "their own," but it is their own from one political clan. True,  it is with the proviso that this "tutor" serves the clan  loyally. Unfortunately, the undertaking with these letters also  was unsuccessful. As they say, this is a matter not just of  cash, but also of the Moscow "wedding generals" who once again  got into a mess with their wards, this time having proven at the  regional level that they always, in any pre-election battles,  superciliously underestimate the voter, refusing the "man in the  street" the right to decide for himself what is what.    And now let us consider this from the position of the oblast  "province," those 13 rural electoral districts where the  election to the oblast assembly took place. In and of itself,  the fact that the "province" had gone to the ballot boxes is not  really surprising. Even in these harrowing times, the ordinary  peasant understands that it is impossible to live without  authority. With authority, things are more reliable. But whether  the authority always worries about the peasant is another  question. So he went to the ballot box, taking with him possibly  his last hope that now Moscow would know what was pressing down  on the peasant, and that his own homegrown people would do  everything to stand up for him. So he chose. Whom? The one who  is well aware of whom he can trust, to whom he is accustomed to  go with every need of his.    Well, actually, why is there a need for some kind of  laudatory indulgence from some high and mighty "democrat"  flitting around the Moscow corridors? Why does Ivan  Mikhaylovich Semenov, director of the Vyazye State Pedigree  Stock Farm, need it, if the voters of Dedobichskiy and Dnovskiy  rayons know him as an excellent specialist, organizer, and  understanding person? If Vyazye, even today, in the grip of  stifling reforms, continues to be famous for its superelite  pure-bred hogs which foreigners envy! Or Gennadiy Aleksandrovich  Sharstuk, chairman of the Pamyat Ilicha Kolkhoz, Pechorskiy  Rayon, a young, energetic person who, during his short period of  time as chairman, has completed the construction of an excellent  settlement on half the kolkhoz -- why does he need it?.. Or  Aleksandr Ivanovich Bukashkin, who took the Truzhenik Kolkhoz  out of his father's hands and improved the farm... It is the  deeds themselves and the Christian spirit of these and other  agrarians that are the best propaganda for them.    Incidentally, the rural candidates, unfortunately, could not  even count on those propaganda "volleys" by which many of their  urban associates literally deafened their voters. But the only  funny thing that happened is that, having lost, certain  city-dweller candidates immediately began crying, "Who will give  me back those `lemons' that were spent on the importunate  `Choose me, choose me...'?" Because it turns out that that's how  much a seat in the oblast parliament costs -- a paltry two or  three million. And that is not including the funds that were  officially allocated to the oblast election along the line of  Tsentrizbirkom [Central Electoral Commission]. Funds, we might  note, that were tremendous.    But the "bird of happiness tomorrow," fortunately, is in the  possession of those who were chosen. It is gratifying that,  among them, more than a third are pure agrarians. And this is  symptomatic: in an agrarian oblast, it would seem, the people  who are running the dance, in the good sense of the word, should  be people not from the asphalt, but people from the land, people  from behind the plow. It is good that the legitimate deputies to  the oblast assembly have already realized that and have offered  the administration a package of documents pertaining to the fate  of the agrarian reform in Pskov Oblast. Without waiting for the  March re-election, they are already holding their working  meetings, gradually developing the drafts of working documents  for the oblast "Duma." People like this are not accustomed to  let things get mired down in empty talking. Thank God!</p>

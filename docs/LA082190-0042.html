			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LITTLE MCAFEE, A WALK-ON, MAKES BIG MARK AT FULLERTON  </P> <P> Most freshman walk-ons who show potential are redshirted their first season,  but it appears Cal State Fullerton's Dwayne McAfee, from Lincoln High School in  San Diego, will be sporting a jersey of different colors -- blue and orange --  when the Titans open Sept. 1 against Sonoma State.  </P> <P> McAfee, 5-foot-6, 160 pounds, has so impressed the Fullerton coaching staff  that Coach Gene Murphy has scrapped his plans to redshirt him and will use him  as a kickoff returner and, possibly, as a wide receiver and punt returner.  </P> <P> McAfee made the most impressive play of Saturday's intra-squad scrimmage,  catching a short pass, eluding several defenders and turning it into a 40-yard  gain. He's extremely quick, has soft hands and is dangerous when he gets some  running room.  </P> <P> "He's an exciting little guy," offensive coordinator Bill Wentworth said. "We  were going to redshirt him, but he has put himself in the picture to play."  </P> <P> McAfee's quickness was obvious to Titan coaches in the first week of summer  practice, when players wear shorts and T-shirts. Wentworth said he figured  McAfee wouldn't look as good once he got into a helmet, shoulder pads and  started hitting.  </P> <P> But McAfee continued to impress coaches.  </P> <P> "Any time a walk-on is ready to play as a freshman, it surprises you,"  Wentworth said. "But he's a tough kid, and the more pressure we put on him, the  more he has come on." MIKE DiGIOVANNA  </P></p>

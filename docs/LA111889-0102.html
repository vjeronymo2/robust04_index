			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EFFECTIVENESS OF ROPING OFF DRUG AREAS QUESTIONED  </P> <P> Police barricades thrown up this week to reduce drug traffic in a Sepulveda  neighborhood have worked dramatically there, but they did so by pushing the  narcotics trade into nearby areas, Los Angeles police officials conceded  Friday.  </P> <P> As a result, police have stepped up enforcement efforts in areas to the west  and south of the 12-square block Columbus Avenue neighborhood they barricaded  Nov. 7. In one area just four blocks west of the barricaded zone, for example,  more than 40 drug buyers were arrested in a two-day undercover sweep this week.  </P> <P> "It's like pushing an air bubble around inside an air mattress -- it changes  location, but it doesn't go away," said Lt. Gary Rogness, who heads the Los  Angeles Police Department's narcotics field enforcement unit in the San  Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> "But that doesn't mean you don't try to get rid of it."  </P> <P> The increase in drug traffic in nearby areas has raised questions about the  effectiveness of cordoning off neighborhoods to fight drug activity, a tactic  that Los Angeles police were said to be the first to use on a large scale.  </P> <P> An aide to Councilman John Ferraro said the councilman wonders whether police  will ultimately have to put "a Berlin Wall around Sepulveda" in order to stamp  out drive-by drug traffic.  </P> <P> "We're not opposed to the barricades, but I think the question in the council  will be, 'What have you accomplished if the dealers and buyers just move  elsewhere?' " said Bill Gilson, Ferraro's deputy.  </P> <P> Capt. Mark D. Stevens said police expected that closing Columbus Avenue would  cause narcotics traffic to spill over into nearby areas, which already were  active drug spots. Now, officers want to temporarily barricade the neighborhood  to the west, but Stevens said it may be difficult because it contains two  schools and a church.  </P> <P> "We've ferreted the dealers out of their holes and we're going to keep after  them," said Stevens, adding that he believes drug dealers will not move into  single-family neighborhoods to the north and east because they would be too  visible there.  </P> <P> Stevens said he has increased patrols in surrounding Sepulveda areas, using a  10-officer task force that previously concentrated efforts in the Columbus  Avenue neighborhood.  </P> <P> In addition, Rogness sent his special narcotics enforcement unit into Sepulveda  neighborhoods surrounding the barricaded area for two days last week.  </P> <P> Police are urging the City Council to make permanent the barricades around the  Columbus Avenue neighborhood. Under the proposal, apartment owners in the area  would donate money to set up and staff a guard station at the corner of  Sepulveda Boulevard and Rayen Street. City public works officials had no  estimate Friday of how much the proposal would cost.  </P> <P> Six of the 15 council members said this week that they support the idea -- and  two said they were considering it -- but some have reservations about the  impact on nearby areas.  </P> <P> The plan is being lauded by apartment owners who say they are tired of  grappling with the problem. "I'm for anything that helps keep (the area) clear  of drug traffic," said Guenter Pauly, owner of a six-unit building he fenced  last year to keep drug dealers from using his parking lot.  </P> <P> Councilmen Joel Wachs, Ernani Bernardi, Hal Bernson, Mike Woo, Gloria Molina  and Zev Yaroslavsky said they support the proposal. Yaroslavsky said that  "nothing is more important than the peace of mind" of the Columbus Avenue  residents, whose neighborhood has long been the most active drug-trafficking  spot in the Valley, according to Rogness.  </P> <P> But the barricades have not contributed to the peace of mind of Teresa Guzman,  a baby-sitter who lives west of the cordoned-off area.  </P> <P> She said friends living on Columbus Avenue tell her that the dealers have  vanished. "They have all come over here," Guzman said. "I wish they'd close the  streets here too."  </P></p>

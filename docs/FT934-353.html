			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Directors upbeat on jobs outlook Last month's Budget appears to have boosted optimism among directors about prospects for their businesses in 1994 and may encourage them to increase staff, the Institute of Directors says in its latest business opinion survey. Compared with October, the survey found a slight increase in overall business confidence among a representative sample of 300 of the institute's 33,000 members polled in the last week of November and the first two weeks of December. However, while the Budget had little impact on their overall assessment of the UK economy, those polled after November 30 were markedly more bullish about taking on staff and on the outlook for their companies. The institute said that 47 per cent of directors were more optimistic about the economy in November and December than they were six months before, compared with 42 per cent in October. The balance of those expressing more optimism over those who were less optimistic increased to 32 percentage points from 26 points in October. Although the institute warned that businesses would not be able to assess the full impact of the Budget until April, when tax increases take effect, the Budget appeared to have made good impression the 221 directors interviewed in December. Altogether 61 per cent of those polled after the Budget were more optimistic about the prospects for their own company against 52 per cent immediately before the Budget and 56 per cent in October. The balance of company optimists over pessimists increased to 53 points post-Budget from 34 points immediately before, and 43 points in October. The survey's answers on jobs showed a similar post-Budget rise, with the balance predicting higher employment in their companies increasing to 37 points after the Budget from 19 points in the last week of November and 25 points in October. Mr Peter Morgan, institute director-general, said the survey showed 'cautious but slowly increasing optimism about the economic and business prospects for next year'. He said low inflation and interest rates, falling unemployment and the recent Gatt agreement to lower trade barriers made for an 'extremely encouraging' outlook in 1994. The institute's survey showed that volumes, orders and profits were continuing on a gradual upwards trend with confidence above average in the manufacturing and business services sectors. The biggest preoccupation of directors over the next six months will be maintaining and stimulating demand.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, March 13 (AFP)--Two teams of 10 UN  military observers each arrived Sunday evening [13 March] in the  besieged Moslem enclave of Maglaj, a United Nations Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman said.    Their arrival marks the first time the United Nations has  had  a presence in this Moslem enclave, which has been besieged by  Bosnian Serb forces since last June, said spokesman Major Rob  Annink. The spokesman did not provide further details.    UN officials have been unable to confirm reports of the  latest round of fighting in Maglaj as there have been no  international observers there.    In addition, UN humanitarian aid has been blocked from  Maglaj  since October. Western concern has grown about Maglaj as Serb  attacks are continuing there despite ceasefires in Sarajevo and  central and southern Bosnia.    A UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) convoy was  refused passage into Maglaj last week by Serb troops.    UNHCR officials have said the situation in Maglaj is  desperate, with attacks mounting on the 16,000 people in the  town since Serbs and Moslems reached a ceasefire in Sarajevo  February 11 and since a Moslem-Croat ceasefire in central and  southern Bosnia came into effect on February 28.    Radio Sarajevo reported that Serb forces began as of 5:30  A.M. Sunday (0430 GMT) artillery and mortar attacks on the  enclave that lasted for two hours. There was then sporadic  mortar fire. Two people were wounded, it said.</p>

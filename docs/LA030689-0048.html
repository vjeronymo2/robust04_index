			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> STYLISH 'DON PASQUALE' IN SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> For some blissfully unaccustomed, patently coincidental reason, this has been  bel-canto season in Southern California.  </P> <P> The Music Center recently exhumed Rossini's "Tancredi," while Opera Pacific  offered Bellini's "Norma" as a prelude to Rossini's "Barbiere." San Diego began  a Donizetti mini-survey with the pretty madness of "Lucia" and, for a sprightly  encore, turned Saturday night to "Don Pasquale."  </P> <P> All this in an area that suffered just a couple of years ago from chronic  operatic deprivation. There may be hope.  </P> <P> After San Diego's disastrous effort last month to transform Beethoven's  "Fidelio" into a relevant political farce, one approached the Civic Theatre  with some trepidation. Would "Don Pasquale" take place in the Persian Gulf?  Would the crusty Roman septuagenarian resemble a womanizing cabinet nominee or  inhabit a space ship? Would the ancient formula intrigues be fraught with  neo-socio-symbolic meanings?  </P> <P> The answers turned out to be negative. Relief.  </P> <P> This, essentially, was the 19th-Century opera buffa we know and love. It  required, and received, no aesthetic rethinking, no temporal updating, no  theatrical embellishing.  </P> <P> Using the charming storybook decors designed by John Conklin for the San  Francisco Opera, Wolfgang Weber was content to stage the comedy of mannerisms  as a reasonably witty period piece. Even when the humor tended toward the  ponderous, his action scheme remained picturesque and stylish.  </P> <P> Weber's ideas -- even the sporadic dubious ones -- were deftly executed by a  handsome, resourceful, generally youthful ensemble. For better or worse --  mostly better -- this was a team effort unjarred by star turns.  </P> <P> As the classically duped, generously forgiving protagonist, Francois Loup  resisted the usual comic cliches. He discovered a welcome trace of pathos  behind the old man's grouchy facade, and sang quite beautifully. One wanted to  forgive his proclivity for mugging and to forget his weakness for  scene-stealing.  </P> <P> Cheryl Parrish sang the first Norina of her fast-rising career. She chirped  with reasonable bravura, a fuzzy trill notwithstanding, and commanded the stage  with easy bravado. She also dampened delight somewhat by reducing the quixotic,  essentially sympathetic heroine to one very tough cookie.  </P> <P> Mark DuBois as the ardent Ernesto sounded voice-sick, not just love-sick.  Although no apologies were offered on his behalf, his tastefully employed  tenorino all but strangled in the stratosphere. One would like to blame his  problems on physical indisposition rather than technical indiscretion.  </P> <P> Victor Ledbetter of the San Francisco Opera Center revealed a flair for the  debonair and correspondingly elegant vocalism as Malatesta, the  quintessentially wily baritone. Remember his name.  </P> <P> The chorus of motley servants, trained by Martin Wright, looked unusually  animated and sounded exceptionally mellifluous.  </P> <P> Everyone in the cast seemed willing and able to shape Donizetti's graceful,  grateful cantilena with expressive freedom. Any such effort was doomed,  unfortunately, by Karen Keltner, who conducted with unyielding, mechanical  brio. At least she kept the articulation crisp and the textures light.  </P></p>

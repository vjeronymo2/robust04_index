			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: BP strikes cash The recovery in BP's share price and profitability since the dark days of 1992 has been remarkable. Perhaps most impressive has been the reduction in costs and the repayment of 25 per cent of its Dollars 16.5bn debt mountain. The real touchstone of renewed stability is, however, for the company to generate sufficient cash from underlying operations to pay for capital expenditure, tax, and its dividend. BP achieved that state of grace in the second half of 1993. It must then be galling for the management to have had so little help from the market. If oil prices had remained around Dollars 16 a barrel, the company could have maintained a steady cash flow and set the seal on its improved fortunes with a dividend increase this summer. With oil now nearer Dollars 13, that is much harder. If crude prices remain weak, the company can keep pressure on costs and tweak the timing of its capital spending to keep underlying cash flow neutral. But with the emphasis on prudence, the management will not want to send the wrong signal by increasing the dividend until the crude price firms and stabilises. While that may cause understandable disappointment, it is hardly a serious problem. A dividend increase can be afforded at a relatively low cash cost. Even then, there is a strong argument for redeploying most of the improved cash flow within the company. The choice is between increased capital spending and further debt reduction. Since it has plenty on its plate, it may well choose to pay off more borrowings in the short term. But it is a measure of its transformed prospects that BP can now make choices between the dividend, debt and capital spending, which threatened to crush it barely 18 months ago.</p>

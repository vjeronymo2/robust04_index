			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Derivatives bill put to House A bill to give the US Securities and Exchange Commission greater powers to regulate the derivatives industry was introduced yesterday by Mr Edward Markey, chairman of the House of Representatives sub-committee on telecommunications and finance. The bill, which would extend SEC oversight to many dealers not now regulated, follows a call from the General Accounting Office of Congress two months ago for greater control of the derivatives markets. The rapid growth of these financial instruments, and the concentration of trading in the hands of a few companies, has increased the risk of a meltdown in financial markets, the GAO warned. The Markey bill runs counter to the more consensual approach to regulation of derivatives preferred by Mr Arthur Levitt, SEC chairman. He recently started talks with various securities companies on voluntary regulation of their derivatives activities. Wall Street's traditional broking and dealing activities come under the SEC, but most securities firms have set up separate subsidiaries to trade in the specialised derivatives markets, putting them outside the SEC's regulatory net. The bill introduced yesterday would require all unregulated dealers, such as those owned by securities firms and insurance companies, to register with the SEC, and give the regulators power to set capital standards for dealers. It would also set rules for the sales practices of derivatives firms, including a requirement for them to assess the suitability of instruments for particular customers. The Markey bill follows legislation proposed by the House banking committee, which would cover the derivatives activities of commercial banks.</p>

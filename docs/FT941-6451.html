			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Vietnam's jobless problem comes out into the open: Roads into Hanoi are now informal job centres As the sun rises over Hanoi, hundreds of young men gather on the dusty verge in the middle of Giang Vo street. Some sit in groups; others lie on blankets trying to sleep. Most of the men are peasant farmers. All are looking for work. Giang Vo street is one of six or more main roads leading into the Vietnamese capital which have become informal job centres. Foremen looking for labour on one of the dozens of construction sites around Hanoi come to hire workers by the day, the week or the hour. Giang Vo is lined with shops selling building materials, and the men waiting for work hope some of the customers will need labour as well as bricks and cement. If they are lucky, they will earn up to Dollars 3 (Pounds 2) a day and return at night to the cheap, crowded hostels where they stay while they are working in Hanoi. Some men come every day from the countryside around Hanoi to look for work; others have trekked several hundred miles from the provinces of central Vietnam, where, when the rice is planted, there is little else to do. Unemployment is one of the biggest problems now facing the government in Vietnam. Since pro-market economic reforms were introduced in 1986, the level of joblessness has increased rapidly. Official figures show more than 2m people unemployed out of a workforce of 32m. There are also 5m-6m people who are under-employed. Tens of thousands of workers have also been laid off by bankrupt state factories and are looking for new jobs. Also unemployed are many former soldiers demobilised after the Vietnamese army pulled its troops out of Cambodia in 1989. Most of the under-employed are peasant farmers, who work in the fields for four to six months of the year. For the rest of the time there is no work in their home villages, so they go to towns and cities in search of other work. Until recently, the problem of rural under-employment was disguised because people from the countryside were not allowed to travel to cities such as Hanoi; any found looking for a job were rounded up and sent home. Since 1992, as internal travel restrictions have eased, the under-employed have appeared on the streets of the capital. One group of men waiting for work on Giang Vo street had arrived in Hanoi a week earlier from the central province of Quang Tri, one of the poorest in Vietnam. 'Living in the countryside, I have no job. I came here so that I can feed my family,' one of the men said. But he would not move his family to Hanoi because he could not make enough money for them all to live. The government hopes that growing foreign investment and the domestic economic boom will create work for many of the people now jobless. But western economists in Hanoi believe unemployment will continue to be a serious problem in Vietnam for many years to come.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Representatives of the nation's black mayors approved a resolution condemning  the Supreme Court's ruling that minority set-aside programs are  unconstitutional unless discrimination can be proven. The draft resolution  drawn in Atlantic City, N.J., by the executive committee of the National  Conference of Black Mayors said the decision implies that set-asides are  "simple racial politics" and is an attack on minorities. The Supreme Court  struck down last month a Richmond, Va., ordinance that set aside 30% of public  construction projects for minority-owned businesses. The opinion by Justice  Sandra Day O'Connor said discrimination must be proven before such programs can  be constitutional. The resolution notes that many jurisdictions have similar  ordinances and urged that they be kept intact.  </P></p>

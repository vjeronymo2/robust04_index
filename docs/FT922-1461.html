			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (23): Market's new kingmaker - Value Added Resellers THE VALUE Added Reseller is the new kingmaker of the computer market. The 'added value' of the acronym refers to the intangible assets which go to make a successful installation. These can include the supply of appropriate software, bespoke adjustments, expert advice, and ongoing support to the end user. The commodity to which these things are added is usually the 'box' or hardware. But the raw material with which the VAR works might include a piece of software such as a database, on top of which the VAR has developed a specific application. So what differentiates the VAR from the good old fashioned dealer, or retail outlet? The answer, certainly in the case of good VARs, is expertise. VARs are often also developers, who have built up valuable experience in their particular field. Some even employ consultants to analyse the needs of their customers in specific 'vertical market' areas such as manufacturing, retail, or banking. Dealers, software houses, systems integrators and consultancies have metamorphosed into 'VARs' by dint of forming alliances with particular hardware suppliers, such as Olivetti, Unisys, ICL, DEC, and Hewlett-Packard. In recent years, even IBM has come to rely on 'third parties', particularly in the sales of its mid-range AS400 computer, which needs dedicated applications . The transition has been quickened by the spread of open systems, dating from the advent of the MS-DOS PC operating system, and now perpetuated with Unix for larger multi-user systems. This gives software developers and their users a wide choice of equipment under one operating system, on which their software will run with few or no changes. Alongside this development has come users' recognition that the software is the most expensive part of the investment in a new system. It has to be long-lived, allowing for enhancements and even tailored additions. Accordingly, users look for experts who can understand their business problems, and supply the right software to solve them, recommending a reliable hardware environment in which to run it. The hackneyed phrase for this single-source shopping is 'selling solutions', an activity now fronted almost entirely by VARs. Previously, hardware suppliers used to commission a software house to write a suite of programs for its new computer, into which both user and developer would then be locked. Now, the VAR can operate with a chosen hardware supplier, but without being locked in. This ongoing relationship usually includes volume discounts, investment in training on the quirks of the hardware vendor's kit, and joint marketing programs. It does not include exclusive loyalty: some VARs have two or more regular sources of hardware, supplying whichever is more appropriate or profitable in a particular installation. Now that the hardware comes bundled with the application instead of the other way round, VARs have become the axis of the software industry. On them turns the decision of the end-users, who depend on VARs and their alliances for a pre-selection of software environment and hardware. The relationship between hardware vendors and VARs is complementary, as they introduce business to one another. But the VAR now holds the balance of power in a market where the developers and suppliers of hardware and software no longer know who all their end-users are. Far more than a middle man, the good VAR can more or less dictate the choice of hardware to the user. The choice of a software environment takes as much skill as hardware selection, especially as the VAR may have to integrate standard packages in the area of accounting, and so on, with his own specialist package. Research among users carried out on various Software At Work topics in the FT has shown a marked increase in the end-users' reliance on the VAR as a single-source supplier. So how does the VAR choose the software, and the end-user choose the VAR? A good example is Integra, whose specialist packages include sports and leisure centre administration. The Football Association, a discerning IT buyer, chose Integra for its Sports-PRO software, but also wanted accounting and electronic office systems. Integra has supplied Multisoft Premier accounting software, with Uniplex office automation software, integrated with its own package for the specialist business of fixture lists, players registrations, and gate receipts. The Pounds 200,000 contract, won in the face of competition from 14 other suppliers, includes tailoring for the Unix and PC hardware, also supplied by Integra. The Football Association's chief accountant, Mark Day, chose Integra 'because they demonstrated a good understanding of our business.' Integra, he says, played a critical role in the installation - 'we used them completely: we have strong commitment to the concept of partnership.' Integra in turn, has software partnerships. Originally an Altos reseller, four years ago, it sought a database as the basis for new applications, and chose Informix for performance, reliablility, and flexibility in tailoring. Now Informix wins new users with every installation of Integra's Sports-PRO. The point of these alliances are that the user gets the best possible service, without the problems of integrating products from different sources. Increasingly, the VAR is picking up the extra titbits that vendors used to supply: consultancy, training, and business analysis. As a market sector, VARs are now important enough to be served by their own magazine, The VAR, a stylish glossy which concentrates on market trends, innovations, and often comments on vendors' marketing incentives, or lack of them. Vertical markets and business know-how are a constant theme. Users trust the judgement of people who are closer to their businesses than hardware vendors can ever be. It's not what you buy - but who you buy it from that matters in the world of the Value Added Reseller.</p>

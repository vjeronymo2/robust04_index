			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, February 3 (BTA) -- A Bulgarian delegation,  led by Deputy Foreign Minister Todor Churov, attended a meeting  in Vienna of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe. The need of a transport and communications  infrastructure skirting the territory of the former Yugoslavia  was on the agenda. The Bulgarian delegation returned from Vienna  today.    According to Mr. Churov the meeting was a success, at least  in the short term. "In a longer-term prospect, things are a  little bit more complicated because funding is involved," he  said.    "Still, I think that the Bulgarian priorities were accepted  at the meeting," the deputy foreign minister said. The  Bulgarian projects concerning the overloaded border crossings,  could be arranged in nine to twelve months time, as Mr. Churov  put it. "As to our longer-term proposals, it all depends on what  the EU members of the G-24 will decide, and specifically whether  funding will be provided within a reasonable period of three to  five years."</p>

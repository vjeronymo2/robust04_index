			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> OAKLAND BALLET RECONSTRUCTS 'LE TRAIN BLEU'  </P> <P> The great secret of the Oakland Ballet's newly reconstructed "Le Train Bleu" is  immediacy. The setting by sculptor Henri Laurens may slice an ordinary beach  landscape into exotic Cubist planes and angles, but we instantly recognize it  and its inhabitants: sleek bathing beauties in designer swimwear (by Coco  Chanel, no less) and hot musclemen on the make. If we connect with this  long-lost 1924 "operette dansee" through our own direct observation and  experience, so do the dancers. "Train Bleu" may be a fabled relic of Serge  Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, but it's also the ancestor of every surf frolic  from "The Boy Friend" to "Beach Blanket Bingo." These young Californians  understand it perfectly. Cast as seaside "poules" and "gigolos," they revel in  the witty mock athleticism of Bronislava Nijinska's choreography, along with  the preening narcissism that she so inventively filters through classical  style.  </P> <P> The pantomimic sexual byplay devised by Jean Cocteau also seems second nature  to them -- and that's crucial, because "Train Bleu" is very much concerned with  people selling themselves to one another. Sometimes the score by Darius Milhaud  becomes an ironic comment on this lust-and-sand milieu -- rather like  Nijinska's pointed references to "Giselle" and "The Sleeping Beauty" -- but  elsewhere the use of familiar '20s idioms makes it sound like pop records  playing in nearby hotels.  </P> <P> Although both Irina Nijinska (the choreographer's daughter) and Frank W. D.  Ries (a Cocteau specialist) had to rely on guesswork as well as scholarship in  assembling their reconstruction, "Le Train Bleu" always feels fully alive in  the present tense.  </P> <P> Indeed, this insistently trivial and topical collaboration -- which also  originally enlisted the contributions of Pablo Picasso and Anton Dolin -- seems  infinitely closer to us than any of the dance masterworks created by Nijinska  or her brother, Vaslav Nijinsky. As the irresistible "Beau Gosse" (Dolin's  character), Michael Lowe can't smoothly switch between mime, gymnastics and  classical bravura, so the role looks imposed on him rather than a  custom-tailored tour de force. But Abra Rudisill makes every seductive flapper  mannerism newly incendiary as "Perlouse" (originally danced by Lydia Sokolova),  a portrayal exactly on target.  </P> <P> (Oakland Ballet originally announced it would unveil this reconstruction at UC  Irvine in February, 1989. However, the company withdrew the work following  complaints from Irina Nijinska that she had not been consulted despite her  claim to the copyrights of her mother's work.)  </P></p>

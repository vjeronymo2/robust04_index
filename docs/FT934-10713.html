			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Building society to close centre ALLIANCE &amp; Leicester, the fourth-largest building society, is to close its administrative office in Hove, East Sussex, with the loss of 700 jobs to the town over the next four years. Mr Peter White, the society's chief executive, said it had to rationalise administrative sites, and would be concentrating its retail financial services operation in Leicester. He said some redundancies, almost all at Hove, would be necessary but that it was too early to say how many. Some staff would be relocated. The first department to leave Hove will be computer services which will move to Leicester in the next six months. The society employs about 9,500 staff in the UK, more than 1,000 of them at sites in or near Leicester, and more than 3,000 in Bootle, Merseyside. Mr White said the Sussex branch network would not be affected by the changes. The measures were needed to improve efficiency and customer service.</p>

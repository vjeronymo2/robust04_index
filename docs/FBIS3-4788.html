			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Tapos (ANGKATAN BERSENJATA)--President Suharto  expects ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] to be constantly alert to  efforts by certain groups who want to replace Pancasila  [ideology of the Indonesian state] as the foundation of the  state and the philosophy of life of the Indonesian people.    The president expressed this expectation Sunday [23 January]  at the Tapos Livestock Center at Bogor, West Java, as he  received about 200 TNI-AL [Indonesian Navy] officers attending  the "Back to Basics" Program led by KASAL [Navy Chief of Staff]  Vice Admiral Tanto Koeswanto. ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces]  Commander General Feisal Tanjung was also present.    "ABRI has never wavered regarding Pancasila and the 1945  Constitution as the foundation of the state and the philosophy  of life of the Indonesian people. Pancasila and the 1945  Constitution as the ideology of the Indonesian people are not  negotiable. The Sapta Marga [Armed Forces oath], too, says that  Pancasila is the principle of the life of the state," Pak Harto  [President Suharto] declared.    According to the president, this needs to be remembered  always, because in the framework of democracy there are groups  that use the issue to dismantle the national consensus that has  been achieved, although this consensus has been tested in five  general elections.    "Some people are still looking for ways to use other  principles that were previously shown to bring no improvements  for the people. It is not possible for us to reconstruct those  things from the past. Therefore, we must be alert."    The president noted that the people have accepted Pancasila  as the sole principle of the life of society, the nation, and  the state. This acceptance was made through a long and difficult  process, because initially there were many groups in society who  rejected it.    The only objective of development based on Pancasila and the  1945 Constitution is the achievement of material and spiritual  prosperity, prosperity in this world and the next.    How can we provide for life in this world and the next?  There  are only two things: material needs and spiritual needs. "Thus,  through this state ideology, we establish programs so that we  will live in happiness and prosperity in this world and in the  next. People should not think about material things alone,  forgetting the spiritual. Neither should people think about  spiritual things alone, forgetting the material. Neither is  complete. The two things cannot be separated. There will then be  those who emphasize the material, while not forgetting spiritual  life. There will be those who emphasize the spiritual, but they  should not forget the material," Pak Harto declared.    The president also explained the effort through which 10  parties were simplified into only three sociopolitical forces;  why ABRI as a sociopolitical force sits in legislative and  deliberative bodies; the need for the three political parties;  and the fact that the PPP [Development Unity Party], GOLKAR  [Functional Group], and the PDI [Indonesian Democratic Party]  use Pancasila as their sole basis.    "At that time, I asked whether ABRI was recognized as a  sociopolitical force. The reply was that they continued to be  recognized as such because of their history. Therefore, I said  they must have the same rights as other political forces."    According to the chief of state, the appointment of ABRI  members to legislative bodies is not to control votes in those  bodies but to act as a provider of dynamics and as stabilizer.    "We do not want to change the 1945 Constitution, although  changes are made possible through Article 37 of the  Constitution. To make sure that no change takes place in the  1945 Constitution, a third of the MPR [People's Consultative  Council] comes from ABRI."    The president said that history shows that the appointment  of  ABRI as a political force was actually by national consensus.  "It was not I who originated it," he said.    According to the president, none of these achievements are  the results of an instantaneous act but are products of gradual  action.    The president also guaranteed that ABRI will not make  Pancasila into a religion or make religion into Pancasila. ABRI  will not do such things. It has now been demonstrated that ABRI  will not make Pancasila into a religion or make religion into  Pancasila. Pancasila is a philosophy of life and is the ideology  of the Indonesian people as a pluralistic nation in their life  as a state.    The president also warned of efforts to distort the facts of  history by claiming that it was Pak Harto who orchestrated the  G-30-S/PKI [30 September Movement/Indonesian Communist Party],  remembering that Lieutenant Colonel Untung used to be one of his  men.    "I have received a book, intended for distribution, entitled  Prima Dosa, which accuses the present government,  saying that I am the one who created the G-30-S/PKI, since Lt.  Col. Untung used to be one of my men. They have distorted  things," said Pak Harto, laughing.    The book was published by a person who says he has suffered  constantly under the New Order, being shoved from place to  place. Pak Harto asked that everyone, especially ABRI, be alert  to this, since such things continue to go on.    Pak Harto stressed that as a soldier and an ABRI fighter he  holds firmly to Sapta Marga and that Sapta Marga will remain the  ideology of generations of ABRI who are devoted to the nation  and the state.    "I have one ideology as a Sapta Marga soldier. Therefore, I  faced everything connected with the beginning of the New Order  myself without any exposure to the outside," Pak Harto said  firmly.    The president also denied that the Tapos Livestock Center is  equipped with all kinds of facilities, such as helipad, golf  course, and swimming pool. "It is a fact that there are people  who are vigorously discrediting me," the president said. He  added that what they call a swimming pool is a storage tank for  water for cattle. There is also no palace, and what they call a  helipad is not that at all but is only a place for drying coffee.    "Such criticism does not matter, however, for it is merely a  challenge to me," Pak Harto said.</p>

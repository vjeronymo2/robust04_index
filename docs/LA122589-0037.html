			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN'S DEFENSE BUDGET WILL SLIP BELOW 1% OF GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT NEXT YEAR  </P> <P> Japan's defense budget is set to slip next year below the key level of 1% of  gross national product, though actual military spending will rise, Finance  Ministry officials said Sunday.  </P> <P> Strong growth of the Japanese economy means a proposed 5.5% increase in 1990-91  defense spending, to $29 billion, will still put it beneath 1% of GNP for the  first time in four years.  </P> <P> But the drop back below the controversial defense spending ceiling scrapped by  former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone in 1987 has less to do with thawing  East-West tensions than with the booming Japanese economy.  </P> <P> "At this stage, we remain very prudent and cautious (about East-West  relations)," one official told reporters.  </P> <P> Nakasone's decision to scrap the 11-year-old ceiling in 1987, aiming to  increase Japanese self-reliance in defense, was criticized by some of its  neighbors in Asia who were worried about a possible resurgence of Japanese  militarism.  </P> <P> Tokyo's defense budget is the third biggest in the world, after the United  States and the Soviet Union, but that is partly because of high personnel  expenses.  </P> <P> The draft budget proposed by the Finance Ministry for the fiscal year beginning  in April calls for the 5.5% increase in defense spending, after a 5.9% rise  this year. The Defense Agency has asked for a 6.35% increase.  </P> <P> Finance Ministry officials said they rejected many Defense Agency requests for  new equipment, including 30 new tanks and a $940-million destroyer with a  sophisticated Aegis weapons system. Instead, the proposed budget put more  emphasis on improved logistics and support services.  </P> <P> "The Finance Ministry agreed to the minimum budget needed to support an  efficient and balanced self-defense force in the final year of the midterm  plan," one ministry official said.  </P> <P> Finance Ministry officials said that spending to help the United States offset  the cost of troops stationed in Japan would rise more than 40% next fiscal  year, to $320 million.  </P> <P> Strapped with a big budget deficit, Washington has been pressing Tokyo to pick  up a bigger share of the tab.  </P></p>

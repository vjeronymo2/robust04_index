			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Voldemar Koreshkov: "Come to Your Senses, Miss </F> Novodvorskaya: The Appeals of the Democratic Union of Russia Are  Involved With Blood"]    [Text] The second congress of the Russian Movement for  Democratic Reforms began its work in the Moscow parliamentary  center, and leaflets of the Russian Democratic Union party  entitled "Fascism and Communism Outlawed" were distributed  persistently at the entrance.    But what does V. Novodvorskaya, the scandalously well-known  leader of the RDU [Russian Democratic Union], offer that is new?  Well, nothing. That very same unpardonable extremism and the  very same frenzied persistence to inflame the situation in  society.    The expressions themselves are interesting: "troglodytic  ideas," "Red cannibals," "enemies of the human race," etc.    It is possible, of course, to react in different ways to  Zhirinovskiy's party and the Communists and to those results  that characterize the elections to the State Duma.    But no kind of moral restrictions exist for V.  Novodvorskaya.  The RDU does not recognize the results of the elections, even if  the whole solar system votes for the "red-browns."    It is not so much the barefaced malevolence and disregard  for  the law that puts one on guard. Far more dangerous are the  instigating appeals. There is an appeal to the president of the  Russian Federation in the leaflet to act with the new parliament  just as was done with the Supreme Soviet. Support at the  barricades is assured. There is a request "immediately to create  a national guard from among his devoted followers and to arm it  for the defense of democracy."    It turns out that RDU members "are ready to fight to the  death for freedom, as in August 1991, and as on the night of 4  October."    Come to your senses, Miss Novodvorskaya! We remember those  tragedies. They should be a stern lesson for everyone. The  revanchist delirium is akin to fascism. Again a summons to  confrontation, a thirst for bloody conflicts. It is startling  that everything is possible in Russia, and no one is responsible  for his provocative appeals and actions. Everyone, as the saying  goes, gets away with it unpunished.    The leaflet in many ways is directed at B.N. Yeltsin. Lord!  Save our president from such advisers and defenders.</p>

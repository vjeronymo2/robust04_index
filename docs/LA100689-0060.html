			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israel's Inner Cabinet avoided a government crisis by postponing a vote on  whether to participate in Israeli-Palestinian talks proposed by Egypt. The  Inner Cabinet, divided evenly between the Likud and Labor parties, debated for  5 1/2 hours and decided to meet again today. The discussions centered on the  Labor Party's call for acceptance of Egypt's proposal on the selection of the  Palestinian delegation. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud Party  opposes the Egyptian proposal, contending that it would lead to direct  negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which the government  rejects.  </P></p>

This is Estrada's first China visit since he became vice-  president of the Philippines.    During the visit which is aimed to expand the existing good  ties between China and the Philippines, he is expected to meet  with Chinese leaders and exchange views with Vice-President Rong  on the growth of bilateral ties and issues of common concern.

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Haitians lose US asylum battle THE US Supreme Court yesterday allowed the Bush administration to complete the forced return of thousands of asylum-seeking Haitian boat people to their Caribbean homeland, Reuter reports from Washington. The high court, by an 8-1 vote, rejected an emergency request by human rights lawyers to halt the controversial US repatriations on grounds that the Haitians would suffer irreparable harm and possibly death if sent back. The court issued the ruling a day after Haiti's quarrelling factions reached an agreement mediated by the Organisation of American States to restore democracy and return ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. President George Bush's government had argued strongly in favour of allowing forced repatriations. It said the Haitians were fleeing the impoverished nation for economic rather than political reasons and therefore were not entitled to political asylum in the US. The only dissenter was Justice Harry Blackmun, a liberal, who said the court gave 'full and careful consideration' to whether the Haitians would face persecution upon returning to their strife-torn homeland. The court, with a solid majority of justices appointed by Mr Bush or his conservative predecessor Mr Ronald Reagan, has now sided twice with the Bush administration during a three-month-long legal battle that has become an embarrassment for the government. About 15,000 Haitians have tried to enter the US since Mr Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president, was overthrown in a military coup on September 30. Most of the refugees were picked up at sea and taken to the US Navy base at Guantanamo, Cuba. About one-third have already been returned to Haiti. The Supreme Court's ruling cannot be appealed, but activists have vowed to keep fighting in Congress.</p>

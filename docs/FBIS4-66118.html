			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 19 (ATA) -- "The new government will  not decrease but it will increase more the traditional Italian  commitment to the Balkans and especially to Albania which its  geographical vicinity and the relations' density is particularly  close," the new Italian foreign minister, Antonio Martini, said  in an interview with the GAZETA SHQIPTARE in his first  commitment in the press in regard to the new Italian foreign  policy.    "Italy has been committed to economically support the  country  which is few miles from us when it was in the most dramatic  moment -- passing to the democratic ways of governing," Mr.  Martini has said, mentioning the Pelican Operation [Italian  humanitarian military operation] carried out by Italian military  units which made a very significant contribution to release the  difficult conditions of the Albanian population. "The  cooperation is destined to continue in new forms taking into  consideration the historical relations between the two  countries," Martini emphasises.    The Italian foreign minister said in the interview that the  deep change which took place in the stage of the Italian policy  as a consequence of the last elections, represents in many  aspects a turning point in the history of the country. Mr.  Martini said that the Corfu meeting of the Council of Europe, to  be held at the end of the June, will offer the most important  opportunity for a confrontation with the EU [European Union]  partners and where the deep views of the Italian Government on  the European question will be expressed in a high level.    The Italian foreign minister, Martini, mentioned also the  G-7  meeting to be held on July in Napoli [Naples], which will give  an opportunity to the Italian Government for presenting its  program and initiatives in the interior and international aspect.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Fiat Fiat's management should be congratulated for extricating the company so rapidly from the most wretched period in its history. The battered car maker is back in the black far quicker than expected, partly because of the market, but in no small measure, thanks to timely self-help. The lira's devaluation also assisted, aiding exports and making competitors' products more expensive in Italy. The Brazilian experience also augurs well for international sales. The 34 per cent fall in net debt was a pleasant surprise. A further recovery can be expected when the Italian market, representing more than 40 per cent of automotive sales, finally recovers. The management's determined cost cutting has been particularly impressive. In only 12 months, overheads as a percentage of sales have been slashed 2.8 percentage points to 13.6 per cent. Production costs have also been sharply reduced. A new engine plant, and two new assembly plants in southern Italy where Fiat can take advantage of lower wage costs, are both making their mark. Such rationalisation was necessary for Fiat's survival, but the group's success is by no means assured. Fiat must continue to prepare for 1999 when the Japanese will enter the Italian market without hindrance. Everything will depend on the group's new products, an area in which Fiat lacks credibility. The recently-launched Punto may have been a hit, but the jury is out on other models. Fiat cannot afford another Dollars 32bn of rationalisation and investment. This is an all or nothing throw of the dice.</p>

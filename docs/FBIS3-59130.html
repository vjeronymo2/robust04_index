			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Norderney/Oldenburg (DPA) -- Packets containing the  highly poisonous pesticide Apron Plus have been found for the  first time on the North Sea islands of Norderney and Juist this  afternoon. The Weser-Ems District Council in Oldenburg confirmed  that two packets had been clearly identified. The contents of  three other packets still had to be tested.    Authorities estimate that around 130,000 packets of Apron  Plus had been collected on the Dutch coast by yesterday evening.  About 70,000 more packets are drifting eastward off the Dutch  North Sea islands. They come from the French freighter the  Sherbro. It lost 88 containers last December.</p>

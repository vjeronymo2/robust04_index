			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / People: Yassukovich picks up from Cragnotti Stanislas Yassukovich, once upon a time a big name in the Euromarkets, has become chairman of a new trading vehicle, Park Place Capital, formed via a management buy-out of Cominvest UK from the Cragnotti &amp; Partners Capital Investment Group, writes Katharine Campbell. Cragnotti has decided to withdraw from financial services, and the formation of Park Place Capital represents the first in a series of disposals. Yassukovich's involvement with Sergio Cragnotti has been nothing if not eventful. The Italian financier brought in Yassukovich in 1991 to run the London end of his newly created Cragnotti &amp; Partners Capital Investment Group. A former chairman of the Securities Association, Yassukovich was supposed to lend the venture credibility. The original idea of drumming up cross-border M&amp;A business quickly fell through. 'Cragnotti was such an active acquiror of businesses on its own behalf that it produced too many conflicts to have a parallel agency operation,' Yassukovich explains. Called a merchant bank in Italy, Cragnotti's raison d'etre is the acquisition and development of consumer product companies. The M&amp;A business gone, that left, in London, an arbitrage team, hired from Banque Nationale de Paris, which has, according to Yassukovich, done well. Essentially a 'very equity-oriented' hedge fund, it focuses on the Continent. But then came Cragnotti's own problems towards the end of last year. A former Ferruzzi executive, he gave himself up to police in Italy for questioning at around the same time as he came to a settlement regarding allegations of violations of Canadian securities law. This 'accelerated the group's decision to pull out of financial services' is how Yassukovich puts it. Yassukovich, 59, remains vice-chairman of the Cragnotti group - but why, particularly seeing he is not exactly short of directors' fees? He sits, in various capacities, on at least ten other boards. 'I have no doubts about (Cragnotti's) integrity; he is a very skilled industrialist. Unless you are Italian, it is very difficult to follow the incredible complexities of what is going on in that country,' says Yassukovich. 'I'm also a very loyal chap,' he adds, almost as an afterthought.</p>

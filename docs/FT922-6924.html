			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The importance of selection in realising better prices for wool was illustrated at the Goulburn auction in Australia on May 20. Better style merino fleece of good length and soundness attracted very good competition and prices moved up by 10 to 30 cents a kg. compared with the previous week. Otherwise the market was firm. The market indicator rose 6 cents to 588 cents a kg. Offerings in all primary producing markets are declining in selection and quality at this stage of the season, with drought a contributory factor leading to lower offerings this season.</p>

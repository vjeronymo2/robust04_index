In this meeting, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i began his  speech by congratulating the auspicious birthday of the lord of  the age, may God hasten his advent to the oppressed people and  nations of the world, and the followers of the Ahl al-Bayt  school of thought all over the world. [passage omitted]    His eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i considered the formation of  the first ever powerful Islamic political system in Iran through  the efforts of the followers of the Ahl al-Bayt--may peace be  upon them--as a cause for pride among all Islamic sects and  denominations. He said: The followers of the Ahl al-Bayt, may  peace be upon them, have raised the flag of Islam and the Koran  in this part of the world, and in continuation of the efforts  and struggles by the family of purity and modesty, may peace be  upon them, they have managed to rid Islam of oppression and  alienation. Today, the Islamic system is a significant political  rallying point devoted to serving Islam and the Muslims.  [passage omitted]    His eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i then said that one of the  main objectives of America, the world's domineering powers and  their dependent political regimes, is to create a rift between  the Shiites and the Sunnis. He added: The gathering of the  followers of Ahl al-Bayt in Islamic Iran is step toward unifying  the adherent of the great Koran. This gathering will also pave  the way for unity in the Islamic world and understanding among  all Islamic sects. The great nation of Iran praises God that it  has been able to put all its integrity, might, and capability a  global scale at the disposal of Islam and the Koran.    His eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i stressed the sensitivity of  the Islamic republic of Iran toward the issues of Muslim  nations, and said: The Muslim nation of Iran does not consider  itself aloof from the problems of the Muslim nations. While  refraining from interference in the affairs of other countries,  Iran is carefully following the issues of the Islamic world, to  which it attaches great importance. The Islamic republic of Iran  considers the problems of Kashmir, Afghanistan, and the  oppressed but courageous nations of Palestine and Lebanon, as  its own problems, and makes endeavors on a global level to  resolve them.    The leader of Islamic revolution expressed profound regret  at  the process of fratricide in Afghanistan, and set out to  question the leaders of armed parties and groups in that  country. He said: What excuses can the Afghan leaders give to  the Afghan nation, and what justification can they provide for  the Islamic community? They have managed to deliver the kind of  blow to the Afghan nation that the communists had not been able  to deliver. They must know that the Islamic Ummah will question  those individuals who inflict so much destruction and bloodbath  on a nation on the grounds of sectarian, partisan, and personal  issues.

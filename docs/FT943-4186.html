			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Lean times for New Zealand meat industry The sudden collapse of two big New Zealand meat processing companies - UK-owned Weddel and the innovative Fortex group - has underlined the deep financial problems that have plagued for the past decade the country's biggest export industry. The crash of Weddel last month after banks refused to lend it more money has drawn attention to the indebtedness of remaining companies, and aroused national concern for the future of the NZDollars 4bn (USDollars 2.4bn) industry. Weddel, which had been controlled by the wealthy UK Vestey family for most of the century, had been considered one of the stronger players, and handled an estimated 18 per cent of the industry through its six works. The company's failure marked the end of UK investment in the industry. Over the past decade Borthwicks and the British Co-operative Society had been forced to quit due to changing markets and high costs. A string of locally owned companies, including Fletcher Challenge, Goodman Fielder Wattie, Waitaki, Gear, Waitane Meats, and Venison New Zealand had also been forced out of the industry. Collectively the losses total about NZDollars 950m over the past five years, according to a study by merchant bank Southpac, which also said the industry as a whole had shown no return on capital during that period. Nor had it earned enough to cover interest payments in two of the past three years; and would be unable to do so again this year. The banks, which are owed NZDollars 1.9bn by the companies, are said to be running out of patience. The problem is largely a structural one. The meat processing companies receive an inadequate share of profits. Most have inadequate capital and continuing funding problems as they try to cope with a deregulated environment. There are also too many players, leading to big marketing and overcapacity problems. The industry's troubles have intensified over the past 10 years. The last period of strong profitability was in the early to mid 1980s when the Meat Board dominated the industry. As the government poured in taxpayer's money in farm support payments, sheep numbers soared to 73m. But from the mid 1980s things started to go badly wrong; the industry was turned on its head after the Labour government removed farm incentives, forcing companies to resume competitive bidding for stock, marketing and other roles. As sheep numbers plummeted - the national flock now numbers just over 50m - the processing companies were placed under increasing pressure. The ensuing tangle of ownership, mergers and plant closures grew increasingly complex, as did changing industrial attitudes. Initially unions battled management attempts to cut staff numbers, tighten conditions and close works. But more recently they have decided to co-operate to try to ensure the industry's future. The role of the co-operatives, which dominate the industry, is seen as a significant problem. Three big groups - Affco on North Island and PPCS and the Alliance in the south - handle 66 per cent of the sheep and 45 per cent of the beef kill. It is claimed that the lower cost structure of the co-operatives, allied with less pressure on them to make returns on capital to their farmer shareholders, were factors which effectively helped PPCS and the Alliance to squeeze the Fortex group out of business by forcing it to pay higher prices for stock. 'Given the influence of co-operatives within the industry, the overall profitability may not improve,' the Southpac report said. Analysts believe the banks, which carry most of the risk, will be loathe to finance the industry, aim to charge prohibitively high risk margins on loan capital, or impose draconian restraints and other conditions on the way the companies conduct business. Many lenders are seeking to reduce their exposure by withdrawing funds they have committed in the past. Nevertheless, the industry has overcome many of its old problems. Real lamb processing costs have fallen by 20 per cent in the past 10 years, and costs are considerably lower than in Australia. A decade ago New Zealand processing costs were 50 per cent higher than in competing countries.</p>

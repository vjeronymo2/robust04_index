			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL REJECTS STEALTH CURBS, OKS FUNDING  </P> <P> Despite growing congressional opposition to the stealth bomber, the Senate  Armed Services Committee Thursday rejected a proposal by Sen. John Glenn  (D-Ohio) to save an estimated $1 billion by slowing down production of the  expensive new aircraft.  </P> <P> The committee vote means that the Administration's request for $4.8 billion for  the bomber in fiscal 1990 will be referred to the full Senate without any  reduction. The House Armed Services Committee recently voted to slash $800  million from the stealth program for fiscal 1990.  </P> <P> Glenn's proposal would have created a series of "milestones" or specific  hurdles over which the stealth program would be required to pass before  receiving additional funds for the next stage of its development -- the first  being that it must be able to fly.  </P> <P> He estimated that his proposal could have saved the government about $1  billion. It is now expected that the government will spend at least $70 billion  if the Pentagon buys all of the 132 bombers it seeks.  </P> <P> Like many other stealth opponents, Glenn has argued that the bomber should not  be fully funded until it has been proven effective.  </P> <P> "This is the biggest departure in aircraft design, ever," he said. "Why go into  it -- at a cost of $538 million per copy -- without seeing if it can fly  first?"  </P> <P> The vote on Glenn's proposal took place in a closed session of the Senate  committee.  </P> <P> Northrop Corp., which has been developing the boomerang-shaped bomber -- also  known as the B-2 -- is preparing for the craft's maiden flight, perhaps as  early as Saturday.  </P> <P> Despite the setback, Glenn vowed to revive his proposal to slow down B-2  production when the fiscal 1990 defense authorization bill is considered on the  Senate floor later this summer.  </P> <P> Opponents of Glenn's proposal have argued that a production slowdown actually  would cost more money than it would save. Air Force officials testified before  the House Armed Services Committee Wednesday that the program would cost an  extra $4.2 billion if Congress withheld production funds for 1990.  </P> <P> Supporters of the stealth have also argued that the aircraft represents a  bargain for the government in comparison to the alternatives. Air Force  officials contend that it would cost $60 billion to scrap the stealth program  and instead buy sufficient numbers of B-1 bombers to perform stealth's intended  mission.  </P> <P> Earlier Thursday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told the House Armed Services  Committee that the $800-million cut in funding that that panel had agreed on  recently could add as much as $1.4 billion to the stealth program's price.  </P> <P> Cheney defended the B-2's soaring cost but warned lawmakers in a hearing that,  if Congress makes yearly cuts in B-2 budget requests, the cost would spiral out  of control.  </P> <P> "You might decide you want to cancel the program," he said. "That would be a  perfectly legitimate decision . . . (although) I think it would be wrong. But  what you should not do is nickel-and-dime-it to death."  </P> <P> When asked about the consequences of cancellation, Cheney said: "If, in fact,  we do not go forward with the B-2, we will not have the capacity that we had  anticipated in terms of the number of weapons we would be able to deliver to  the Soviet Union in wartime."  </P> <P> RUNWAY TESTS: Bomber completes high-speed runs.

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Unita rebels take northern cities The Angolan government has lost control of two strategic northern cities to Unita rebels and warned the nation it was on the brink of renewed civil war, Reuter reports from Luanda. State-run radio said Uige, 300km north-east of Luanda, and the nearby city of Negage with its important airbase were both in Unita hands after two days of fighting. The radio added that while police had driven back Unita forces about 12 miles from the north-western oil town of Soyo the rebels were massing elsewhere in Zaire province for an expected attack on the provincial capital, M'Banza Congo. There was no immediate response from Unita.</p>

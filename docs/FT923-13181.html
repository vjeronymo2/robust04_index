			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: John D Wood losses rise to Pounds 497,000 By the end of the year to April 30, pre-tax losses at John D Wood, the estate agent, had risen to Pounds 497,000, including Pounds 100,000 of non-recurring expenditure. At the halfway mark the loss came to Pounds 194,000. For the 1990-91 year the profit was Pounds 15,000. Losses per share were 4.8p (0.3p) and there is no dividend, compared with an interim of 1.5p for the previous year. Turnover fell 8 per cent to Pounds 4.71m. The London residential department traded profitably, the Wimbledon sales office was successful and expenditure had been cut, directors reported. However, the country business was again badly hit by market conditions with values falling by 40 per cent from their 1988 peak.</p>

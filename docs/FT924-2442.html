			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Man in the news: Lead role in the Scottish play - Uffe Ellemann-Jensen Shortly before 8 o'clock yesterday morning in Edinburgh, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, was in nostalgic mood as he strode through the well-guarded gates of the Palace of Holyrood House, the site of the EC summit. The moustachioed 51-year-old minister recalled he had last been here nearly 40 years ago on a school exchange visit. 'It was my first European experience. I first spoke English with a Scottish accent.' Yesterday at daybreak, the palace appeared a lot smaller than in his boyhood memory. 'Everything looks bigger when you're a child.' Mr Ellemann-Jensen hopes his second journey to the Scottish capital will also prove memorable - but for different reasons, and on a much larger scale. He is a pivotal figure in the EC's weary efforts to overcome the obstacles created by Denmark's No to the Maastricht treaty in June. The setback, combined with a general upsurge in strains over European integration, has threatened for months to paralyse the European Community. Last night, the problems seemed nearer resolution, even though the final outcome will be decided only in a second Danish referendum, provisionally planned for April or May. As the result of complex negotiations both with other Danish political parties and with the rest of the EC, Mr Ellemann-Jensen hopes to come up with additions to the treaty fulfilling two vital aims. Amendments must allay the doubts of Danish voters over European union, by allowing exemptions in areas such as monetary union and common European defence. But they must not upset other EC members firmly committed to Maastricht-style integration. In particular, no country - especially Britain, with its own ratification process still dragging on - wants to see changes which would require Maastricht legislation to be resubmitted to national parliaments. 'It's very difficult to have an agreement which is legally binding for us, but which does not reopen the treaty,' said Mr Ellemann-Jensen yesterday. 'It looks impossible - but it will be done.' June's No vote was an important setback for the leader of Denmark's Liberal party, the minority partner in the centre-right coalition government. An irrepressible pro-European, he campaigned energetically for a Yes. 'The rejection was his greatest personal and political failure,' said a close aide. 'But his greatest personal and political victory would be a Yes in a new referendum next year.' Mr Ellemann-Jensen admitted that the 'natural reaction' to the June No would have been to resign his office. But he thought about it for only 20 seconds. 'Since all the major parties supported the Maastricht treaty, there was no better alternative than for me to try to reverse the decision.' His spirits have been lifted by the proposals by the British government, currently chairing the EC, to find a way out of the impasse. Although doubts remain over their precise legal status, the latest proposals yesterday won a surprisingly positive reception from French President Francois Mitterrand. He recognises he must find a delicate balance between securing changes capable of winning a referendum majority, and testing other EC members' patience by overplaying Denmark's objections to the treaty. One senior German official warned yesterday: 'The Danes must not exaggerate.' Mr Ellemann-Jensen admitted his discomfort with some aspects of recent bargaining. When touring EC capitals in the past few weeks, 'I was sometimes travelling with demands (for amendments to the treaty) with which I did not agree'. He is playing for the highest stakes. He confirmed that, should a new referendum result in another No, 'one way or the other we would have to leave the Community'. On the other hand, since the treaty cannot come into force unless it is ratified by all EC members, Mr Ellemann-Jensen has powerful leverage to win concessions. He does not take too seriously the threat that the other 10 EC members, could go ahead with a new treaty without Denmark or the UK. 'This would be very complicated. They would have to start all over again.' Borrowing an analogy from the divorce court, he added: 'They would have to fight over the children and the furniture.' He believes that the No vote had triggered some positive debate. 'In some ways it has been healthy that we had the shock of the Danish referendum at an early stage. There was a fear that the Community was going ahead too fast.' The new efforts to improve openness and democracy throughout the Community owed much to the Danish 'early warning', he said. However, he sees drawbacks as well as benefits in the Community's new emphasis on 'subsidiarity' - making decisions at the lowest level of government. 'You could use subsidiarity to undermine common policies in areas like the environment.' The minister concedes that this year's vicissitudes have made him more cautious. Compared with the first referendum, his pro-Europe campaign for the one next year is likely to be less high-profile. By the time that Denmark takes over the rotating EC presidency at the beginning of January, he hopes that the main Maastricht hurdles will have been overcome - allowing the EC to direct more energy to tackling growing chaos in the east of the continent. Mr Ellemann-Jensen will spend a few days cod-fishing between Christmas and the new year. In the first week of January, he plans to tour trouble spots in the former Yugoslavia, turning his attention to a crisis where the EC has so far shown itself impotent. With the EC's disarray still palpable, the Danes will have to work hard simply to prevent it getting worse. But at least Mr Ellemann-Jensen is promising that the style of the Danish presidency will be as communautaire as possible. 'I have told my staff how important it is to look at our presidency not as Danes, but in terms of the Community.' This is not simply a question of principle: 'Otherwise everyone will be even more suspicious of us.'</p>

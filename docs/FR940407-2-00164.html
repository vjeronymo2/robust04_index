It provides limited exemptions for Indian tribes and tribal organizations. Current and prospective recipients (and their subtier contractors and/or grantees) are prohibited from using appropriated funds for lobbying Congress or any Federal agency in connection with the award of a contract, grant, cooperative agreement or loan. In addition, for each award action in excess of $100,000 (or $150,000 for loans) the law requires recipients and their subtier contractors and/or subgrantees (1) to certify that they have neither used nor will use any appropriated funds for payment to lobbyists, (2) to submit a declaration setting forth whether payments to lobbyists have been or will be made out of nonappropriated funds and, if so, the name, address, payment details, and purpose of any agreements with such lobbyists whom recipients or their subtier contractors or subgrantees will pay with the nonappropriated funds and (3) to file quarterly up-dates about the use of lobbyists if an event occurs that materially affects the accuracy of the information submitted by way of declaration and certification. The law establishes civil penalties for noncompliance and is effective with respect to contracts, grants, cooperative agreements and loans entered into or made on or after December 23, 1989. See Attachment F for certification and disclosure forms to be submitted with the applications for this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Attachment G indicates the regulations which apply to all applicants/grantees under the Job Opportunities for Low-Income Individuals Program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: March 31, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald Sykes, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Director, Office of Community Services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

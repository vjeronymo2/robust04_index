			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg March 31 SAPA -- The African National  Congress on Thursday [31 March] said it welcomed the  announcement of a state of emergency in kwaZulu as long as it  allowed free and fair political activity in the area, ANC  spokesman Carl Niehaus told SAPA soon after the announcement by  President F.W. de Klerk.    He said the ANC, as a member of the Transitional Executive  Council [TEC], called on Wednesday for a state of emergency  "because of the very serious situation that prevails in Natal".    "The ANC therefore welcomes the announcement by Mr de Klerk  that a state of emergency is introduced in Natal/kwaZulu.    "We fully support the state of emergency as long as it  allows  full freedom of political activity and full freedom to hold  political meetings, voter education and that preparations for  the elections can be fully guaranteed," Mr Niehaus said.    He added that a leadership summit to address the serious  situation in Natal was now even more urgent than before and the  ANC hoped it would be held as soon as possible.</p>

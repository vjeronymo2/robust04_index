At the meeting, State Council Vice Premier Zou Jiahua  pointed  out: To develop the regional economy, we should formulate an  overall and comprehensive plan along the thought of linking up  the local economy while opening up a channel to the outside  world by capitalizing on geographical, resources, market, and  industrial edges of different but economically related provinces  and cities in the region. We should exploit the vitality that  could be generated through different localities supplementing  each other's advantages. Regional economy has become a new  pattern in our country's economic development.    Leading comrades from provinces and cities including Hebei,  Liaoning, Shandong, Shanxi, Beijing, and Tianjin, as well as  from the ministries of railways, communications, power industry,  coal industry, metallurgical industry, chemical industry, and  agriculture, attended the discussion meeting.    It was the fourth regional economic planning meeting  following those held in 1992 and 1993 for southwest China and  part of south China, Chang Jiang Delta and Chang Jiang regions,  and northwest China.    In his speech, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua summed up the  principle of our country's regional economic planning as overall  planning; mutual cooperation; supplementing each other's  advantages; equality and mutual benefit; gearing toward markets;  domestic and international cooperation; rational division of  work; and joint development.    Zou Jiahua pointed out: The pan-Bo Hai region has superior  location advantages. It is the center of the northeast Asian  economic sphere and the most convenient access to the sea for  our country's north, northeast, and part of northwest regions.  The region leads the country in comprehensive scientific and  technological advantages, with the number of institutes of  higher learning and scientific and technological personnel in  the region constituting about one-third of the nation's total.  The region holds advantages in its energy and heavy and  chemical industries, with coal, oil, and steel production making  up 40 percent of the nation's total production. The region is  also our country's aviation and communications center, and has  the most concentrated network of railways, roads, large ports,  and expressways. The Bo Hai region is situated in our country's  political center, and is also our country's economic center.  Quickening the region's economic development plays a decisive  and strategic role in the overall national economic development.    Zou Jiahua said: These advantages are not of a specific  locality but of the entire region. Therefore, when developing  the region's economy, we should not go separate ways and  duplicate development efforts. On the contrary, localities  should supplement each other's advantages and support one  another in their cooperation to create a new productive force.  When formulating the regional economic development plan, it is  necessary to break down restrictions of administrative  divisions. Localities should make joint and long-term plans for  development projects of common concern and benefits within the  region. We should impose a certain binding force for this type  of plan, and require various localities to carry out their  duties in cooperation with one another. Meanwhile, we should  integrate the plan with national plans and incorporate it into  the country's long-term development program.    Zou Jiahua also stressed the following key points for the Bo  Hai regional development plan:    -- Overall consideration should be given to the region's  transportation and communications networks, particularly the  construction of principal transportation and communications  facilities. This is a most urgent matter, and yet unable to be  undertaken individually by various localities. We should focus  our tasks on building coal, foreign trade, and passenger  transportation facilities. It is necessary to develop a  comprehensive sea, land, and air transportation network based  principally on energy and foreign trade transportation services  in the region, as well as a communications network system  centered in Beijing and linked to the entire nation.    -- Energy resources as well as raw and semifinished material  industries within the region should be developed jointly. Based  on the overall need of national economic development and  regional division of work, it is necessary to continue to  strengthen the development of Shanxi's energy resource base. We  should actively develop Kengkou power plant and increase the  capability of transporting power from west to east.    -- The socialist market economic framework should be  established. We should replace the divided and closed economic  patterns with a regional, comprehensive, and open large market.  Resources should mainly be disposed through the market. We  must establish product markets and bring into play the region's  advantages to establish the scientific and technological market,  information market, and financial market. The regional market  should be geared toward the country and the international  markets of the northeast Asian economic sphere and pan-Pacific  regions.    -- The problem of water shortage that restricts the region's  economic development should be tackled effectively. It is  expected that the Bo Hai region will be short of 15 billion  cubic meters of water supply by the end of this century. It is  necessary to make early preparations and quicken the project of  piping water from south to north, so that advance progress may  be made in establishing the region's water supply network.  Meanwhile, we should strengthen water resources management and  promote water conservation.    -- The tasks of aiding the rural poor and turning losses of  industrial enterprises into profits should be effectively  undertaken to drive the region's economy onto the path of  sustained, rapid, and healthy development.</p>

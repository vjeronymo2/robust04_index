			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Spain and France bear brunt of turnround EUROPEAN government bond markets fell yesterday after the strong rally of recent days, though traders said that the markets remained generally positive on the expectations of further German interest rate cuts. The falls were most pronounced in Spain and France, two of the countries which have had the strongest run compared with German bonds. The yield on 10-year Spanish bonds eased to 11.37 per cent from 11.29 per cent by yesterday's close as the peseta weakened on the foreign exchanges, though it remained around one-third of a percentage point lower than a week before. French bond futures fell back, with the Matif contract falling to 115.30 from 115.50 in moderate trade. The reversal led to a widening in the yield spread between German and French bonds, which had narrowed to around 75 basis points at the end of last week. By the end of yesterday, the spread stood at around 85 basis points. Italian bonds also slid, though for domestic political reasons rather than on the general trend in Europe. Prices fell sharply ahead of yesterday's special cabinet meeting on the corruption scandal as traders expressed fears that Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, may have been about to resign. The Italian bond futures contract on Liffe reflected the volatility, falling to a low of 96.30 from 96.78 before bouncing to a high of 97.10. It settled back to end around 96.60. UK government bond prices fell yesterday, with losses concentrated in longer-dated issues, partially reversing the recent flattening of the yield curve. Producer price figures showing a higher-than-expected rise in input prices, due to sterling's devaluation, aroused some concerns about inflation. Input prices rose 1.4 per cent in February (6.9 per cent year-on-year), though little of the extra cost was passed on in output prices, which rose 0.4 per cent in the month. With 28,000 contracts traded, the June long gilt contract on Liffe opened at 107 5/32 and hit of a high of 107 11/32 before ending back at 106 15/16 . The tranche of 6 3/4 per cent gilts due 1995, announced on Monday before, was exhausted during the day. US Treasury prices were flat to lower yesterday as the market consolidated the big gains on Monday morning. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/16 at 105 5/32 , yielding 6.722 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 3/4 , to yield 4.996 per cent. In the absence of the economic statistics, trading was relatively calm, at least compared to Monday's early business when prices rose on reports that President Bill Clinton was ready to accept more spending cuts in his budget. The lack of buying in early trading was in part a reflection of nervousness among investors about today's expected announcement from the president of new measures to tackle the credit crunch. The bond market was worried that rules would be introduced restricting banks' acquisitions of Treasuries. Some politicians have argued that banks have been buying government securities instead of extending loans to business and consumers. The treasury eased concerns later in the day, saying there were no plans to curb bank buying of government securities. This helped prices recover but by late afternoon Treasuries had dropped back to near their lows for the day.</p>

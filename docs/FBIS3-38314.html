			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] A statement yesterday by U.S. Ambassador Thomas  Niles in Veryina could be described as insinuation against the  government. Niles said: "If the Greek Government shows an  interest in working with us to fight terrorism, certainly, we  will help."    The U.S. ambassador has obviously considered it expedient to  repeat his reservations over the Greek intention to cooperate.  In his next sentence, he said: "It will be just enough if the  Greek Government shows real interest in such cooperation."    Regarding his statement following the murder of Mikhail  Vranopoulos, when he said: "We will catch those guys," Niles  made the following correction: "I believe murderers such as  those in `17 November' will be arrested. My remarks came during  an emotional moment; it was Vranopoulos' funeral. I did not  mean the United States would do it, but that these people would  be arrested. Unfortunately, I do not know exactly when they will  be arrested and I cannot forecast it." [passage omitted]</p>

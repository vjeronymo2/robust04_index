			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Rabin rails against EC over terms of trade MR Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday accused the European Community of trade discrimination in a sharp attack on Brussels that stood in stark contrast to the friendly tone which characterised relations after he came to power last July. Speaking at a conference in Tel Aviv on high-tech industry, Mr Rabin bitterly criticised the imbalance in Israel-EC trade in which Israeli exports to the Community in 1991 were worth only half of the Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.8bn) imported from EC members. '(This was) not because Israel cannot compete in the European markets but because in Europe there is high talk of a free economy, of a free market economy, but when it comes to Israel there is discrimination,' Mr Rabin said. The EC welcomed the advent of Mr Rabin's Labour-led government. It rewarded Labour's pledge to abandon the former Likud administration's uncompromising stance in Middle East peace talks by agreeing to speed talks on enhancing Israel's 1975 co-operation accord with the EC to possible inclusion in the European Economic Area. But Mr Rabin appeared to have been angered by EC reaction to the expulsion last month of 415 Palestinians to Lebanon, including a delay of further talks on a new agreement. He said the 1975 accord was 'old and distorted' and 'does not give us conditions of equal competition with East Europe and North Africa.' 'It is time for Europe to change this because Israel too has the possibility to buy elsewhere,' he added. Reverting to traditional Labour positions, he said he was 'shocked' that government agencies and companies often purchased from foreign suppliers for the sake of 'two or three per cent' savings and supported moves to exclude from government tenders foreign vehicle suppliers - mainly Japanese - which refuse to enter counter-purchase deals to buy Israeli goods.</p>

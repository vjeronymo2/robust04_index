			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Grachev] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok May 17 -- Three Chinese warships arrived  for a friendly visit to the port of Vladivostok under the flag  of the Chinese Northern Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Wan Jin.    The group comprises missile command ship "Zhuhai", another  missile command ship "Huainan" and rescuer "Changxingdao".    At the approach to Vladivostok, the Chinese ships were met  by  three Pacific Fleet ships -- the big anti-submarine ship  "Admiral Vinogradov", the big anti-submarine ship  "Petropavlovsk" and cruiser "Bystry".    A guard of honour was mustered on the pier. Pacific Fleet  Acting Commander Vice Admiral Igor Khmelnov and Chinese Vice  Admiral Wan Jin exchanged greetings and the two national anthems  were played. Both sides expressed the hope that friendly ties  between Russian and Chinese seamen will strengthen and develop  and cooperation in the military field will continue thanks to  mutual familiarisation with each other's achievements in  military theory and technology, organisation of command of naval  forces and means.    The Chinese sailors are touring the city's landmarks and  memorial places. They will leave Vladivostok on May 20.</p>

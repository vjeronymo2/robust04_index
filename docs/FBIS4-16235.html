			<p>BFN     [Text] The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) foreign  ministers have once again failed to reach agreement on a draft  convention on the rights of national minorities, Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev said.    "Unfortunately, the convention caused debates again. I hope  they were motivated by the desire to improve the document. We  are getting closer to the approval of the convention, although  it is a painful and difficult process," he said after a meeting  of CIS foreign ministers held in Moscow on Thursday.    Kozyrev said the convention was a "difficult political  matter  for some states." "It deals with the lives of millions of  people, and therefore it's important here to evade mistakes, so  we should feel relaxed about the postponement of the approval of  the convention," he added.    But the meeting did approve a declaration of sovereignty,  territorial integrity and inviolability of the borders of CIS  countries, the Russian minister said. "It is a useful document  giving the lie to the speculations that the CIS is some kind of  neo-imperialist club," he said.    Meanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told  Interfax the declaration had been opposed only by Armenia,  which, he thought, might not sign it. "It proposed its own  declaration, which it had the right to do," he said.    Kozyrev said positive decisions had been taken on all other  matters, including collective security.    The ministers also approved a flag for the CIS, proposed by  the Commonwealth's Interparliamentary Assembly, and recommended  that Friday's CIS summit approve it too.    "That is not a national symbol. It doesn't have the same  meaning as national flags do. It's something like the United  Nations flag. It symbolizes humanitarian ideals, unity and  common goals," Kozyrev said.</p>

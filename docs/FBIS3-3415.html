			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary on NPC and CPPCC Sessions" by XINHUA reporters </F> Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524), Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900),  and Wang Haizheng (3769 3189 1767)]    [Text] Beijing, 17 Mar (XINHUA) -- In discussing issues  related to Chinese economic development, deputies and members  attending the Second Sessions of the Eighth National People's  Congress [NPC] and the Eighth Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee held that  while the country scored tremendous successes in economic  development last year, some conspicuous contradictions and  problems have cropped up. Hence, they proposed that in  continuing to develop the economy, it is necessary to search for  new ideas instead of following the trodden path of emphasizing  speed alone.    In searching for new ideas for development, it is necessary,  first of all, to proceed from the national strength and  conditions in deciding a scientific rate of economic growth.  Deputies and members said: Despite a marked increase in our  overall national strength in recent years, the country's  financial and material capabilities remain rather limited  because of its low starting point. Therefore, we must decide on  a growth rate and construction scale that are within our  capabilities. Citing an example, deputies recalled the housing  and real estate boom last year that led to a rush in the  construction of luxurious apartments, tourist resorts, and  modern recreational facilities in disregard of actual benefits,  demands, and capabilities. On the surface, such a construction  boom could accelerate the pace of development and improve the  economy; but in actuality, it caused a series of problems, such  as capital shortages, price increases, and strains on  "bottleneck" industries.    Second, it is necessary to strive to develop the national  economy with high efficiency and quality. Describing low  efficiency and high growth rate as the most salient  characteristics of a "bubble economy," deputies said: Local  governments and enterprises should guard against one-sided  emphasis of high output value and speed; and should concentrate  efforts on upgrading technology, improving management and  operation, developing new products, conserving energy to lower  consumption, and tapping potential. To this end, they should  adopt effective measures to raise major indices reflecting  economic efficiency, such as the sales rate of manufactured  goods, profit and tax payment rates of industrial capital,  profit rates of costs and expenses, turnover rates of working  funds, and all- personnel labor productivity.    Moreover, it is necessary to proceed from the realities of  each locality, making the best possible use of favorable  conditions and avoiding the unfavorable, and refraining from  demanding a unified speed. Because of the vast differences in  geographical locations and resources, economic development is  extremely uneven throughout the country, with an enormous gap  between the eastern and western regions. In developing the  economy, localities should not pursue the same target and speed,  but should proceed from local conditions in exploring the most  effective way of developing local economy. For examples,  Zhejiang should rely on Pudong's opening up and development in  achieving new economic advances; Henan should transform itself  from a major agricultural province with rich resources into a  major industrial province as a motive force for scaling new  heights in economic development; Sichuan should energetically  develop transportation and communications as an important way to  taking off from its southwestern region-oriented economy and  converge its economy with the international market; and Gansu  should expedite the development of village and town enterprises  and help poor mountainous areas cast off poverty and become well  off as this is crucial to narrowing the gap between the western  and eastern regions. These measures for developing the  economies, which correspond with the local realities, can avoid  aimlessness, overcome one-sidedness, and allow each locality to  develop on its own while ultimately contributing to an excellent  situation characterized by a sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy.</p>

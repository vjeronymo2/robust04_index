			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Books: Renko comes in from the cold RED SQUARE by Martin Cruz Smith Harvill, Pounds 14.99 431 pages RENKO is back, Arkady Renko, the Russian detective from Gorky Park and Polar Star. He was in Siberia, fans will recall, after serving a spell in a psychiatric hospital as an enemy of the state. But times have changed, especially in Russia. Renko has been retrieved from Siberia and restored to his old job as a special investigator. He is back in Moscow again, back in Red Square, on the eve of last year's abortive political coup. Not that Renko knows anything about politics, or any of that. He is far more interested in Moscow's black market: the illicit trade in Marlboros, porn videos, spare parts, you name it, that is conducted nightly at various unspecified locations along the city's ring road. In particular he is interested in finding the killer of Rudy Rosen, a market operator whose car blew to bits one night, with Rosen still inside it. Who murdered Rosen, and why? One of the city's Mafia gangs no doubt, but which of the many? And how will Renko nail them, when not one of the hundreds of witnesses to the killing ever saw a thing? The trail begins in Moscow - a city seething with discontent, immediately prior to the coup - and leads from there to Munich and Berlin, where Renko is reunited with ex-girlfriend Irina, now a dissident newsreader on Radio Liberty. He visits a German sex club en route, and witnesses the death of an American contact, killed the same way as Rosen, before returning at length to Mother Russia. There he catches up with his villains against a backdrop of tanks with flowers in their barrels and Boris Yeltsin defending Moscow's 'White House' against all comers. It's a splendid story, full of atmosphere, packed with the everyday details of Muscovite life that are Martin Cruz Smith's trademark. The details in fact are rather stronger than the plot as a whole, and the story has been cheerfully padded in places to make for a bigger book. But character has always been as important as plot to Cruz Smith, and he is in his element describing the arcane workings of the Soviet system. He has created a thoroughly believable detective in Renko, a character much more in the tradition of Tolstoy's Levin or Dostoevsky's Petrovitch than, say, Holmes or Sam Spade.</p>

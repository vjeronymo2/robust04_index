			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf by </F> 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Sayyid in Baghdad; date not given; from a  Qatari Television program on Iraq]    [Text] [Al-Sayyid] Welcome, minister.    [Al-Sahhaf] Welcome to you.    [Al-Sayyid] Minister, the Security Council says that Iraq  has  not yet implemented every Security Council resolution relating  to the Gulf war. What is your comment on this?    [Al-Sahhaf] If we discuss Iraq's implementation of the  obligations imposed on it by Resolution 687 accurately, we will  notice--even those hostile to Iraq and the Arabs cannot deny  this--that Iraq has met most of the obligations imposed on it by  this resolution. The other issues do not require practical  implementation, but compliance. And Iraq has announced that it  complies with them. So talk of Iraq not complying with the  Security Council resolutions is inaccurate and has political  objectives. The clear answer is that Iraq has honored what is  contained in this resolution. Section C of this particular  resolution deals with the need for Iraq to get rid of the mass  destruction weapons. In this regard, Iraq possesses no such  weapons and has no capability to manufacture them. So why keep  repeating that Iraq is not complying? The logical answer, no  matter what side you are on, is that there are political reasons  for maintaining the blockade of Iraq and keeping up the hostile  campaign against Iraq. This is primarily because this crisis  and this war have goals that are greater than, goals that have  nothing to do with what is being alleged, that is, that it is  about Kuwait. The foreign parties within the Security Council,  chiefly the United States, have political objectives that have  nothing to do with the crisis. Now that Iraq has implemented  the obligations imposed on it by this resolution, they have  started to implement the objectives of their policies in the  region. It is no longer an issue of the resolutions in  connection with this crisis. We have complied with and honored  Iraq's obligations and continue to cooperate in terms of the  details relating to all the clauses that require measures under  Section C. By accepting Resolution 715, there is nothing left,  but the technical details of the long-term monitoring.    [Al-Sayyid] Minister, there is a Security Council resolution  that calls on Iraq to export limited amounts of its oil to meet  its basic needs, such as buying food and medicine. But Iraq  refuses to implement this resolution. What is Iraq's  justification for refusing to implement this resolution?    [Al-Sahhaf] You mean Resolution 706, don't you?    [Al-Sayyid] Yes.    [Al-Sahhaf] The background of Resolution 706 is that Prince  Sadruddin Agha Khan, a special representative of the UN  secretary general, has come to Iraq as part of the job of the UN  General Secretariat and the UN secretary general to examine the  so-called humanitarian situation in Iraq and Kuwait. The team  working under Prince Sadruddin Agha Khan carried out studies  relating to the serious humanitarian situation resulting from  the war that destroyed much of the civilian facilities in the  cities and even villages, such as projects for drinking water,  sewage, fuel, hospitals, etc. Those people submitted reports  giving a realistic picture of the humanitarian situation that  became a threat to the lives of millions.    In this report--this study--they urged prompt action to  enable Iraq to provide the necessary services such as health,  water, and sewage. They specified the utilities concerned,  including potable water, sewage, and agriculture. The report  was sent to New York but instead of responding to Sadruddin Agha  Khan's appeal, the Americans and their allies turned the affair  into a political game. They referred the whole issue to a  resolution adopted in line with the UN Charter's Chapter 7 but  still claimed that they were acting in line with humanitarian  concerns. Chapter 7 deals with the measures the UN Security  Council can adopt to maintain security and peace when a  situation threatening world security and peace arises, including  issues of nuclear armament and violent strife. They sought to  govern humanitarian requests dealing with sewage and hygiene in  line with Chapter 7.    They said that Iraq could export oil worth $1.6 billion. But  they said they wanted to station inspectors inside the Iraqi oil  marketing authority. When an oil importer comes to buy, say a  Netherlands buyer or the Netherlands Government, the inspectors  would take part in the negotiations over the transaction. They  could say: Sorry, we will not permit this transaction. Let's  suppose the deal is carried through. The contract to sell the  oil would go to New York and would be submitted to the sanctions  committee, which might not permit the deal. Suppose the  sanctions committee agreed, they would want to station  inspectors at the loading terminals, for example the deep water  al-Bakr Port. We export our oil via the Arab Gulf. They would  want to station inspectors at the deep water al-Bakr Port. One  inspector might say he won't allow the deal to go through and  that he believes the Iraqis are cheating on the quality of the  oil. He might ask that a tanker already loaded with oil be  unloaded. Let's suppose the tanker leaves the port and the  cargo is sold. As soon as the oil is sold, the proceeds will be  taken from Iraq and placed in a closed account with the UN  secretary general, who is empowered to release funds from it,  not Iraq.    Let us suppose Iraq accepts this too, it must then submit a  list of its needs including potatoes, rice, and sugar to the  sanctions committee. The committee would then say it does not  approve of so much rice for the Iraqis and would want a smaller  quantity. It would make the decisions, not us. Let us suppose  they accepted the list of commodities, they would want to  appoint overseers [preceding word in English] who would decide  where Iraq would buy the rice, say from Thailand. They would  want to inspect the rice and state whether they would approve  its purchase or not. Let us suppose they approved it, they  would put a Security Council stamp on it. Let us suppose they  did so, they would then monitor the transporting ship. Suppose  we want this shipment to arrive via al-'Aqabah, they would want  to station inspectors in al-'Aqabah to see if it is the same  rice. They would want to station inspectors on the border and  in Baghdad. When the rice reached the outskirts of Baghdad,  they would ask to see the warehouses where it was going to be  stored. They would see them. They would then ask to be  informed where we want to distribute it. We would for example  tell them: Babil Governorate. They would go to supervise  operations in Babil. Who would be selling it? Say, for example,  11,000 food commodity agents in a governorate of 1.5 million  people. They would want to go and watch how those 11,000 agents  sell the rice. This resolution was not adopted to ease the  Iraqi people's hardships. It was a political resolution  designed to provoke. They claim they have given Iraq a chance  that Iraq has declined to use. It follows then that the Iraqi  Government does not want to feed its people. If you examined  the conditions they have set, you would not only reject them,  but would lose faith in these people as human beings. The  objective is a political one. We told them: Although you  turned Prince Sadruddin Agha Khan's report upside down and  transformed its humanitarian objective into a colonialist  scheme, you must feel that this resolution cannot be  implemented. This is because when you drafted it and had it  issued by the Security Council, you had a political objective.  Because of your erroneous information, you imagined that if you  pressured the Iraqis in this manner, they would proclaim their  surrender and invite you to colonize them as you wished. This  erroneous interpretation of affairs led to the adoption of an  ugly resolution that cannot be implemented. We explained that  in a clear, calm manner.    After that, they sent us UN Assistant Secretary General  Kofi Annan, who is from Africa. He told us: We know that this  resolution is not applicable in the first place. We asked  technical experts and they said the resolution is not  applicable. We are prepared to hold talks with you to reach a  reasonable formula [words indistinct].    We held three rounds of negotiations in Vienna. We would  have reached an agreement each time, but when the UN delegation  returned to New York, the U.S. ambassador would find fault with  it and say: Why did you do this? How could you agree with the  Iraqis on this? No, we do not concur, we have this condition and  that one.    The talks would then stop, and the United Nations would come  later to propose new talks. This we did, and the same story  happened, and it happened a third time in Vienna. The talks  then stopped.    Recently, UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali  renewed the idea. An Iraqi delegation went to New York and they  discussed the issue. Still, the UN General Assembly delegation  had no flexibility, not even half of the flexibility that  existed in the Vienna talks. I sent a message to the UN general  secretary telling him... [pauses] By then, that is, in the  fourth round of talks, we had made major progress with the  Special Commission and Ambassador Ekeus. We had agreed that  only the implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687  remained after we accepted Resolution 715 on future monitoring.    I said in my message to the UN secretary general that we  believe we were very close to the implementation of Paragraph 22  of Resolution 687. This paragraph calls for lifting the embargo  on Iraq's exports in general. The paragraph is permanent and  better than a temporary one. You know that Resolution 706 is  valid for six months and is renewable.    So, we propose that we concentrate our efforts on reaching  and implementing Paragraph 22, and consequently lifting the  embargo on the export of Iraqi oil. I proposed, as an interim  formula, that Iraq be allowed to export an amount of oil in  accordance with a formula that guarantees the UN's ability to  know the amount sold and the price. The UN will take its share  for the reparations fund and the rest will go to Iraq to buy  [food and medicines]. The agreement was (?public), and we even  made this proposal: If some sides claim that we may use this  little amount of money to buy things other than food and  medicine, then we propose that we buy from the markets of  Security Council members. If we buy from the markets of the 15  Security Council members, then nothing will remain hidden. They  gave no answer. Now, we are concentrating on reaching Paragraph  22, which is better.    [Al-Sayyid] Mr. Minister, you said that part of the Iraqi  oil  revenues, when exported, will be deposited into the reparation  fund. How does Iraq view the issue of compensations, especially  of those harmed by the Gulf war?    [Al-Sahhaf] Iraq is the biggest victim of the events and the  American-Atlantic aggression. When we accepted Resolution 687,  and before that the other resolutions, we accepted the principle  of compensations in accordance with the rules of international  law. This is our position: Compensation in accordance with  international law.    [Al-Sayyid] Your Excellency, does Iraq expect the blockade  to be partially or completely lifted in the foreseeable future?    [Al-Sahhaf] We are working toward complete implementation of  Paragraph 22. Logic dictates this. The sound thing to do is to  finish work along with the Security Council to implement  Paragraph 22 without either party adding any political  conditions to this paragraph. The text is very clear. There  are requirements that should be met to implement this text.  These requirements provide that in accordance with the mission  assigned them, envoy Ekeus -- the executive chairman of the  Security Council ad hoc committee -- and Hans Blix -- the IAEA  director general -- submit a report to the Security Council  notifying it that Iraq has fulfilled its commitments outlined in  the (?new) section, namely Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13.  We are now very close to this goal. We will work with the ad  hoc committee and the IAEA to work out the technical formulas to  start implementing the control programs in accordance with  Resolution 715. Consequently, the Security Council will be  dutybound to implement Paragraph [word indistinct]    [Al-Sayyid] Your Excellency, another issue that pertains to  the ceasefire in the Gulf War is the demarcation of borders  between the Republic of Iraq and the State of Kuwait. We would  like to know Iraq's justifications for refraining from  demarcation of the borders with Kuwait despite the Security  Council resolution passed on the issue and despite the fact that  an Iraqi representative attended some meetings on the issue  under the auspices of the United Nations.    [Al-Sahhaf] We have not signed [on the demarcation of  borders]. The paragraphs of Resolution 687 require compliance;  that is, there is nothing we can do. They went and demarcated  the borders in accordance with the Security Council resolutions.  They laid down the bases for the demarcation and that is that.  Land has been taken from a number of farmers according to the  new border line. Iraqi territories and homes were taken from  their owners. These people are (?vacating) the area [words  indistinct]. There is a difference. When they ask me if I have  something that I must get rid of, for instance, they said that  we have chemical weapons. We said yes, here they are. They said  that these weapons must be destroyed. Alright, they will be  destroyed. Regarding the issue you have raised, there is no  measure or function left for us to do. They want us to comply.  When we agreed on Resolution 687, it meant that we complied.  They should not have asked anything more.    [Al-Sayyid] What is your view on this issue?    [Al-Sahhaf] I have no other comment. We are now discussing  the issue as a whole between Iraq and the Security Council.  When there is a paragraph that requires a certain measure and  agreement is reached on the measure, we do what is required.  All paragraphs require compliance, and nothing else. All that  they demand of us is compliance. Iraq has done nothing  indicating it is not complying. On the contrary: There are very  clear examples showing we are complying, such as the farmers and  their lands, the people living in the border area and their  homes, our problems, and territory. These Iraqis left their  land and homes.    [Al-Sayyid] There is also the issue of Kuwaiti POW's. Kuwait  says that Iraq has been holding more than 600 people since the  Iraqi forces entered Kuwait in August 1990. Iraq, through  contacts by the Arab League, the United nations, and other world  organizations, maintains that it does not hold Kuwaitis. What  is your comment on this issue?    [Al-Sahhaf] I have no comment. I myself said this at the  Arab League and at the United Nations. I stated this fact.  There are no Kuwaiti detainees in Iraq. There is absolutely  not one Kuwaiti behind bars in Iraq. After the aggression  against Iraq stopped, Iraq handed over the POW's it had, be they  Kuwaitis, Americans, French, Saudis, or others. We handed them  over through the International Committee of the Red Cross  [ICRC]. However, there are a number of Kuwaitis who live in  iraq. They still live in Iraq. If you travel in Iraq you can  see and perhaps meet Kuwaitis who still live in Iraq. There are  some Kuwaitis in Iraq. Some of them are called Bidun [Kuwaitis  without Kuwaiti nationality], and other Kuwaitis. They still  live in Iraq. Some of them have shops or homes and others have  relatives or clans in Iraq. [words indistinct] We asked them to  register their names with the ICRC, because maybe some of them  want to return to Kuwait. Indeed, many of them wish to return  to Kuwait. The Kuwaitis said that Iraq has Kuwaiti POW's and  detainees. They said that the first list includes 7,000 or  7,400. We said that [words indistinct] and that they are  mistaken.    After a while, they said no, we are wrong; what you have  are 6,000 and something, and they presented a new list. We told  them the same thing and repeated that we do not have them; we  said that some names were included in the previous list you  talked about. They said no; the real number is 5,000 and  something. In this way, we have received seven lists through  the Red Cross. The number boiled down to 622. Who are they?  If you look at their personal files you will find someone named  so and so, who is the son of so and so, and who was seen at a  supermarket in Kuwait--say in al-Salmiyah area or some other  place--and after that nothing is known about him. How could you  be so inaccurate as to presume that this person is in Iraq?  There is a specific method followed in such cases. There is an  internationally recognized method according to which the Red  Cross gives out application forms and procedures. So it is a  question of missing persons. Didn't they call it Desert Storm?  This storm took many people; Iraqis, Kuwaitis, and other human  beings. So we are facing a question of missing persons, not  prisoners deliberately captured by the Iraqi troops or Iraqi  authorities and taken to jail and whom we refuse to release.  This is a lie. This is a game usually played in times of  crisis to keep the atmosphere tense and keep a standing  accusation, so that someone can come to you and tell you:  Brother, why are you doing this? This is a natural human  reaction. Why keep them? They have families and they are  miserable. Thus, an atmosphere of tension against Iraq will  remain. This is the whole idea. Look at what they are doing  now, for instance. Kuwaiti television signs off with prayers  that say: May God return our prisoners to us. In their planes,  they write: Do not forget our prisoners, and so on. When they  go to a meeting they deliberately start a discussion on the  subject so as to create certain feelings and to gain sympathy  for political reasons. The fact of the matter is that we have  to work to gather information on people who have gone missing  and whose whereabouts we should ascertain. They talk and  present personal files of 622 or a similar figure. We will  present files on about 63,000 missing Iraqis. Sixty-three  thousand Iraqis. We will present them through the Red Cross.  You know that whenever crises and armed struggles take place,  [pauses] ... Even up to today, the Americans are running around  looking for the missing in action [previous three words in  English] in Vietnam. Do they want by this game to keep....  [sentence incomplete as heard] This is governed by rules that  are recognized internationally and are sponsored by the ICRC and  we proceed according to these rules. We have received personal  files of missing people. Enough lying to people and saying that  there are prisoners held by Iraq. There are missing people and  we all have to cooperate to learn their whereabouts. Those  among the missing people who have files and are accounted for,  as the Kuwaitis admit, are 600 or 622 persons. We will present  63,000 Iraqi files to the ICRC. From the first moment we have  shown full readiness to cooperate in this regard--and not only  with the ICRC--to track down these people, where they are, how,  and what happened to them. In short, to search in every  possible way. In addition, we have stated that we are ready to  cooperate unconditionally with the Arab League. We have  received two envoys: Rashid Idris and 'Abdallah Adam before him.  We will receive a third envoy, Mayhub al-Mayhubi, Arab League  Assistant Secretary General. You brothers in Qatar know that we  have welcomed proposals from the Gulf. Do it any way you want.  You may set up a committee from all the Gulf countries, except  for the Kuwaiti Government. You may set up this committee and  bring people from the Kuwaiti parliament, because they do not  tell the truth. You may bring people from the Kuwaiti  parliament. You will be most welcome to come, see, investigate,  and search and we will open all doors for you. They proposed a  popular committee, and we said a popular committee is fine and  welcome. His Majesty King Hassan has raised the possibility,  and we said welcome. Very briefly, usually after conflicts a  search is mounted for missing persons, and we cooperate in this  regard without any conditions.    [Al-Sayyid] How does Iraq view current developments in the  Middle East, particularly the political settlement in the Middle  East, and the Declaration of Principles, the Gaza-Jericho  agreement between the PLO and Israel, and the political  settlement plan between Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon and Israel?    [Al-Sahhaf] The developments in the Arab region do not  inspire optimism because of the actual strategic situation and  the imbalance in the international situation which increased  foreign domination of the region. The available opportunities  for Arab countries to defend their rights and pan-Arab rights  are very limited. Therefore, I believe that overall developments  do not serve pan-Arab interests. We are not concerned with the  other details you mentioned.    [Al-Sayyid] Since we are discussing the settlement plan in  the Middle East, do you see a role for Iraq in this plan,  especially since news agencies recently referred to a plan to  resettle a portion of the Palestinians in Arab countries,  including Iraq? What is your response to this issue?    [Al-Sahhaf] This is nonsense. You know the extent of  Zionism's control of the media, news agencies, particularly in  the Western world. This is part of the psychological warfare  against the Arabs. It is nonsense intended to confuse readers,  viewers, and listeners. We are absolutely not and will never be  involved in this plan. We worked within the framework of the  Arab League and within its sole terms of reference, namely, the  Arab summit resolutions. We have nothing else to add.    [Al-Sayyid] How does Iraq view the Gulf Cooperation Council  after approximately 3 and 1/2 years since the Gulf events? What  is your view of Gulf security?    [Al-Sahhaf] In the summer of 1991, more than one statement  was made by Iraq affirming that Iraq welcomes any Arab country  that is prepared to continue joint Arab action and cooperation  to serve the mutual interests and rightful issues for which we  all work. This applies to all Arabs and certainly to Iraq's  ties with its brothers in the Gulf. We have not changed and  will not change regarding this issue. We welcome any relations  based on common understanding of safeguarding and promoting our  interests and any voluntary agreement by the fraternal Arab  countries to serve their interests. Iraq's stance on this issue  is very clear. We are happy that Iraq and Qatar have maintained  a useful and practical level of fraternal relations. Casual  crises do not affect these ties. Ties remain and crises vanish.  In fact, this stance is not casual but firm and Iraq will  continue to adopt it sincerely and with honest intentions and  without discrimination. Brothers experience deep differences  and encounter difficult times, but blood never turns into water.  The genuine interests among us remain stronger than casual  crises.    [Al-Sayyid] Concerning the Arab Cooperation Council [ACC]  which, in addition to Iraq, includes Jordan, Yemen, and the Arab  Republic of Egypt, some coolness has affected the relations  among these countries since the Gulf crisis. What about this  group? Will these countries resume their cooperation?    [Al-Sahhaf] It is difficult to speculate on this now. The  actual situation is that the ACC is frozen. It appears to me to  be suspended. What things will be like, it is really difficult  to speculate on, at least for the near future. Originally it  was a good step but the crisis halted it. We will see how  things turn out.    [Al-Sayyid] Mr. Minister, let us move on now to the future  relations between Iraq and its neighbors, particularly Turkey  and Iran. Your Excellency, how do you view future relations  with these countries?    [Al-Sahhaf] We earnestly wish to do what we can to create a  climate that will encourage our non-Arab neighbors--Iran and  Turkey--to move toward a normalization of relations. This is  especially important in the case of Iran following a bloody  eight-year war. We are seeking to normalize ties and build a  sound foundation that benefits from the lessons learned from the  crisis and to create opportunities of stability and cooperation  for the Iraqi and Iranian nations in a way that is to their  mutual good. We have tried to do this in the past and we are  still trying. We are always urging Iran to begin settling  certain unresolved issues between us, foremost among them the  POW issue and MIA issue and also the retrieval of the remains of  such MIA's. We also wish to cooperate in connection with the  issue of nonintervention, including crossing the border and  infiltrations. We also would like both parties to fulfill  certain commitments to each other. For example, the Iranians  gave safe haven to a number of Iraqi aircraft. They must now  return these planes, both the civilian and military ones. There  are several other issues that are ready for settlement if the  necessary steps are taken. These would be steps illustrating  normal transactions between neighboring countries. During  meetings in Karachi and New York, I agreed with Iranian Foreign  Minister Velayati to adopt a policy that would lead to the  results I have outlined above. This policy would involve an  exchange of visits, holding meetings, and beginning a political  dialogue. We made the first steps but later the atmosphere  became a bit muddled. We hope to resume this effort soon. We  might meet in Geneva to begin discussing the POW issue.    [Al-Sayyid] Dear viewers, at the end of this interview we  express our profound thanks to His Excellency Iraqi Foreign  Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf. Thank you, Minister. We  hope your efforts will succeed, God willing.    [Al-Sahhaf] You are most welcome.</p>

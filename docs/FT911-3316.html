			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Saudi investor lifts Chase stake AN investment group controlled by Mr Suliman Olayan, the billionaire Saudi financier, has increased its holding in Chase Manhattan Bank from about 4.2 per cent to about 5.2 per cent, writes Karen Zagor. The Dollars 159m stake in Chase, the second biggest US commercial banking group, is held by Crescent Diversified, a subsidiary of Mr Olayan's US investment arm Olayan Group. The investment comes two months after Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talel bought Dollars 590m of convertible stock in Citicorp. Unlike Prince Alwaleed, who had been a private customer of Citicorp for about 10 years but only started buying Citicorp shares on the open market last year, the Olayan Group has invested in Chase for many years. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Crescent said it bought 1.2m shares between March 1 and April 15 at prices ranging from Dollars 14.37 to Dollars 20. The Olayan Group, founded by Mr Olayan in 1947, holds stakes in JP Morgan, First Chicago and Transamerica, First Chicago.</p>

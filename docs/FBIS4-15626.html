			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM-TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev, 8 Apr -- The press service of the Ukrainian  president and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine today issued a  statement. It says:    In his recent address on Crimean television and at a news  conference, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov used assessments and  allegations that deny the expediency and lawfulness of setting  up a mission of the Ukrainian president in the Republic of  Crimea.    In this connection the press service of the Ukrainian  president and the Cabinet of Ministers thinks it is necessary to  remember that the mission of the Ukrainian president in Crimea  was set up in accordance with the resolution of the Ukrainian  Supreme Council of 24 February 1994: On the status of the  Autonomous Republic of Crimea under the existing Constitution  and legislation of Ukraine, and the resolution of the Ukrainian  Supreme Council of 17 December 1992: On the procedure of  putting into force the Ukrainian law on the mission of the  Ukrainian president in the Republic of Crimea.    The setting up of the president's mission in Crimea is not a  political act, as it is being interpreted by some, but a normal  legal process of forming appropriate power structures in  accordance with the Constitutions of Ukraine and Crimea, which  are intended to ensure cooperation between the bodies of state  power in Crimea and the central bodies of state executive power  in Ukraine.    Attempts to present the normal process of improving the ties  between the Ukrainian and Crimean power structures in a  distorted way do not help at all in creating the businesslike  atmosphere and stability necessary for economic transformations  in this Ukrainian region.    The press service stresses that by their actions the Crimean  president and his entourage are not only not assisting in  developing friendly and goodneighborly relations between Ukraine  and Russia but are also even trying to bring elements of  misunderstanding in them.</p>

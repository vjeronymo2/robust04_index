			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECOND AMENDMENT AND GUN CONTROL  </P> <P> In the editorial, The Times stated its support for a bill which allows people  to own weapons in part that "are more than adequate . . . to have the fun of  killing game animals. . . ." Few people (The Times included, apparently)  question the notion that killing animals is fun, but I believe it represents an  arrogant and repugnant side of human character.  </P> <P> Today most people would be repulsed by the idea of killing human beings for  fun, but the Romans and Nazis had no problem with it. Killing for fun requires  the greatest insensitivity to life and a callous indifference to suffering.  </P> <P> The killing of any animal for fun should be strictly prohibited. We should  recognize target shooting as an appropriate outlet for this murderous instinct,  just as arena sports have become our civilized version of the Roman Coliseum  blood baths.  </P> <P> STEVE SCHLEIN  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

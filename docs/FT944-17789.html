			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Prestwick on recovery path Prestwick Holdings, the Scottish printed circuit board maker, returned to profit at the operating level in the year to August 1 as measures to revive it after heavy losses following ill-judged acquisitions took effect. Its pre-tax loss was also sharply reduced. Operating profit on continuing operations was Pounds 815,000 compared with a restated deficit of Pounds 875,000. Losses on discontinued operations fell to Pounds 141,000 from Pounds 950,000. At the pre-tax level losses were cut to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 3.97m) after exceptional reorganisation costs of Pounds 493,000 (Pounds 478,000). Turnover on continuing operations inched ahead to Pounds 32.9m, against Pounds 32.4m, and the interest charge was reduced to Pounds 562,000 (Pounds 652,000). Losses per share emerged at 7.11p (20.34p). Mr Archie Coulson, a company rescue specialist who became executive chairman at the request of institutional shareholders in January, said the company had achieved the forecasts made in August when it launched a Pounds 4.5m rights issue. Prestwick also sold Electroconnect, its electronic design subsidiary, to management for Pounds 1.65m. The company has no distributable reserves and is thus unable to pay dividends. It intends to apply to the High Court to eliminate the deficit on its distributable reserves and resume dividend payments when it is prudent to do so. Mr Coulson said the refinancing had given the company the flexibility to choose between raising profit margins or going for volume growth. It had to increase productivity, improve its processes and invest to improve the quality of its capital equipment. Parts of its business were doing well but others were not performing satisfactorily.</p>

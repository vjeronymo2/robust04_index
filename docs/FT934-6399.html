			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / People: City teams shuffle packs Smith New Court's Mike Unsworth, 44, who claims to be the longest-serving head of research of a major City broker, is moving into the firm's corporate finance team and handing his research baton over to Bruce Davidson. Davidson, 38, has been following the conglomerate sector and, like Unsworth, joined SNC at the time of Smith Brothers' merger with the much smaller broker, Scott Goff. The reshuffle coincides with another high-level defection from one of the City's most aggressive stockbrokers. Alistair Buchanan, SNC's number one rated electrical utility analyst, has left to join BZW along with colleagues Tim Ancher and Daniel Martin. It is understood that Buchanan had been offered the job of joint deputy head of research at SNC along with Richard Dale. The departure of Buchanan and his team is a blow for SNC which is corporate broker to several well known utilities. However, the firm has had little difficulty replacing other star analysts who have been poached by rival firms and expects to fill the gap left by Buchanan's departure. Meanwhile, Ken Taylor, currently head of sales at SNC's agency operations, has been promoted to deputy managing director of UK agency and will have overall responsibility for the business when Paul Roy, managing director UK agency, is away. Michael Davids has been appointed deputy managing director UK agency and will be primarily responsible for closer integration between the overseas and UK agency business. Rennie McConnochie takes over as head of UK sales and Mark Pumfrey will be deputy head.</p>

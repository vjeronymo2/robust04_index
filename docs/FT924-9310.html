			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Hong Kong manoeuvres postponed A BRITISH military exercise in Hong Kong, which would have included a mock invasion by Chinese troops, has been postponed. The manoeuvre would have been certain to cause a further rift in already sensitive Sino-British relations. The instructions to cancel the exercise came from the British Defence Ministry but are believed to have originated from Governor Chris Patten. Mr Patten is already enmeshed in a tense struggle over his political blueprint for the colony in its last five years of British rule. The military operation was a command post exercise, code named Operation Winged Dragon. Troops from Britain's rapid deployment force were to be flown in for the exercise which had been in the planning stage for several months. A military spokesman said 'it was felt that it wasn't the best time to hold an exercise of this nature.' However, there are concerns within Hong Kong that such an operation could ever have been considered appropriate. Mr Ronald Arculli, a legislative councillor, warned that if the operation were to proceed, the People's Liberation Army might set up its own exercise on the other side of the border, which would be disastrous for local confidence. The military exercise has been postponed to an unspecified date, rather than cancelled altogether, but it is likely to meet significant opposition from members of the Legislative Council if the plans resurface. Britain and China are already at loggerheads over the financing of the proposed HKDollars 163bn (Pounds 13.7bn) Chek Lap Kok airport, and over Mr Patten's push for further democratisation in Hong Kong before 1997.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (16): Focus on profits curbed reforms - The authors leave the NYSE with a stark choice: adapt or die / New York Stock Exchange 'REVOLUTION ON WALL STREET: THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE' by Marshall E Blume, Jeremy J Siegel and Dan Rottenberg Norton, Pounds 19.95, 320 pages The prologue to Revolution on Wall Street opens with an irresistible quote: 'You gentlemen are making a great mistake. The Exchange is a perfect institution.' So said stockbroker Richard Whitney in 1934. The then president of the NYSE, Whitney was telling the US Senate of his opposition to plans to create the Securities and Exchange Commission, a watchdog that would police the rapidly expanding US financial markets. In spite of his confidence, Whitney fooled no one. The SEC was duly set up, and four years later Whitney himself was imprisoned for the theft of his client's securities. In its 200 years, the NYSE has had its fair share of Richard Whitneys. Yet Revolution on Wall Street does not dwell long on the crooks and con-men. The book's main purpose is to tell the story of the NYSE, how the world's greatest stock exchange ended up today as an impressive, still-powerful institution, but one besieged by technological change and competitive forces that threaten its very existence. It does this very well. Although the narrative occasionally digresses into technical issues - such as the collapse of the Bretton Woods exchange rate system; the development of new investment theories and techniques by academics and professional money managers; and the oil and inflation crises of the 1970s - the authors (two University of Pennsylvania professors, Marshall Blume and Jeremy Siegel, and financial journalist Dan Rottenberg) manage to keep their eyes on the ball most of the time. At each juncture in the story, they explain how exterior forces were fashioning a new, less regulated, financial system, and how the NYSE stood by while the financial world around it was reshaped. In the 1970s, for example, the book tells how the birth of the financial futures and options markets in Chicago left the New York markets, and the NYSE in particular, trailing in the wake of innovation. Within a few years, the enormous popularity of stock index futures such as the future on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 meant that share price levels were increasingly being determined in the futures trading pits in Chicago, and not in New York on the NYSE's floor - as investors would discover to their cost in October, 1987. The authors also tell, in brisk and readable fashion, of the rise of the institutional investor - a new, smarter version than the NYSE had ever encountered before - of their revolt against the fixed-commission system that had for so long filled the pockets of the brokers with easy money, of the breakdown of the securities clearing system, and of the arrival of the first computers. This is when the book's central theme - the Exchange's failure to adapt to technological change - begins to emerge. In the 1970s, while the SEC was promoting the establishment of an electronic system for centralising the trading on all the nation's different exchanges and markets, and while small regional exchanges and broking firms were using computer technology to develop new methods of buying and selling securities that by-passed the traditional trading floors, the NYSE was fiercely for the status quo. By the 1980s, the new markets - such as the Nasdaq screen-based 'over-the-counter' trading system, and the 'third' and 'fourth' markets where securities firms and institutions traded with each other or within their own institutions - were flourishing, and the NYSE was losing market share. At this time, the NYSE was not entirely neglecting the new technology. It invested millions in updating its trade processing, monitoring and compliance systems. Yet, as the authors point out, the basic procedures for trading securities at the Exchange hardly changed at all. Market-makers, or 'specialists', were still at their trading posts on the floor handling transactions on behalf of brokers and their customers. And while that system remained unchanged, investors, small and large, began discovering other, newer systems which offered cheaper, more efficient service - such as Bernard Madoff Securities' in-house market, which not only offered to execute trades for no charge, but actually paid broking houses to direct the flow of orders its way. The reason why the NYSE has failed to adapt to change is simple, say the authors: the Exchange is run by its members, the specialists and brokers, whose overriding concern is their own profitability. The ancient structure of the NYSE virtually guarantees that profitability - any reforms to alter drastically the structure, would undermine it. Hence, the NYSE's resistance to change. The authors leave the NYSE with a stark choice: adapt or die. It should take control of the Exchange away from the members, and start developing one or more new trading systems to suit the needs of the investors, not the intermediaries. Whether the NYSE's members will heed this advice is doubtful.</p>

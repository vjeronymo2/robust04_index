			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 'SWAMP GAS' ELECTRIC PLANT IS READY TO LOG IN  </P> <P> A $13.7-million plant at the Palos Verdes Landfill that makes electricity from  gas given off by decomposing organic material will be dedicated and open for  tours on Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.  </P> <P> The plant eventually will earn as much as $7 million a year by harnessing what  otherwise would be a waste product. It burns methane -- sometimes called "swamp  gas" -- to produce steam that powers an electrical generator.  </P> <P> The plant produces 11 megawatts of electrical power, which is enough for about  20,000 homes, according to the county Sanitation Districts. The electricity is  sold to Southern California Edison Co. The 180-acre landfill, at 25706  Hawthorne Blvd. in Rolling Hills Estates, has been closed to dumping since  1980.  </P> <P> While the main purpose of the plant is to eliminate the unpleasant odors, the  sanitation districts said the project also turns a waste product -- normally  burned off -- into usable energy and eventually will earn between $5 million  and $7 million a year for landfill maintenance.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills Estates will receive 1% of the gross revenue.  </P> <P> Built by Mitsui &amp; Co. (USA), a Japanese-based construction company, the  plant will be acquired by the sanitation districts by 1993 under a  lease-purchase agreement.  </P> <P> John Eppich, assistant head of the districts' Solid Waste Management  Department, said there will be little profit before then because of operating  and acquisition expenses. But he estimated that from 1994 to 1998, the profits  will be between $5 million and $7 million a year. The profits will decrease  later, upon the expiration of the fixed-price agreement under which Edison has  agreed to buy electricity.  </P> <P> After 1998, Edison will pay "on the basis of the cheapest power it can buy . .  . an unknown figure at this time."  </P> <P> The county operates a similar, but larger, gas-to-energy facility at the Puente  Hills Landfill in Whittier.  </P></p>

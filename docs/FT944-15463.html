			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sun Microsystems doubles first-term profits to Dollars 38.4m Sun Microsystems, the computer workstation manufacturer, more than doubled first-quarter net earnings while the per-share earnings figure tripled, writes Louise Kehoe. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 1.27bn, up almost 33 per cent from last year's corresponding Dollars 960.5m. Net income surged to Dollars 38.4m from Dollars 16.6m in last year's first quarter. Earnings per share were 40 cents, up 150 per cent from 16 cents and well above Wall Street projections of about 26 cents. 'We had an outstanding quarter - both in the marketplace and financially,' said Mr Michael E. Lehman, chief financial officer. 'We experienced strong worldwide demand across all our major products and businesses in what is normally a seasonally weak quarter. First-quarter unit shipments jumped nearly 50 per cent over the year-ago levels, to 74,000 systems in the quarter.' Sun leads the market for computer workstations - powerful desktop computers used by engineers, financial analysts and a broad range of design and graphics professionals.</p>

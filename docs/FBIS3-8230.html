			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Army General Rasim Delic, the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army commander in chief, spoke about the current military  situation in our country at a public debate hosted by the  Council of the Bosnian Intellectuals' Congress today.    Gen. Delic spoke about the creation and the strengthening of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, stressing that the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army had gained considerable strength in a  short period of time thanks to the existence of organized  patriotic forces. The creation of such a military force,  according to Delic, thwarted the goals of the aggression: The  creation of Greater Serbia, the occupation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the complete annihilation of the Muslim  nation.    The Tudjman-Milosevic and Karadzic-Boban agreements should  have served the enemy in the realization of its goals. For the  Serbs they only represented Phase One in the creation of Greater  Serbia. Following the signing of these agreements, the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army began fighting two aggressors. The  front with the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] was still to be  established. The HVO had blockaded roads and thwarted the  dispatch of humanitarian aid.    Even though the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army had lost some  important positions in that period -- Grebak, Trnovo, and Zepce  -- Delic stressed, HVO forces were completely eliminated on the  territory of Jablanica, Kakanj, Zenica, Travnik, and Bugojno.  The HVO was defeated militarily and would have completely  disappeared had not Croatia sent in its huge forces, Delic said.    A military balance with the forces of the Serb aggressor has  been established. The enemy launched several offensives over  the past few months -- against Teocak, Olovo, Bihac, and Maglaj  -- but did not succeed in shifting our defense lines. Huge  losses in manpower and equipment were inflicted on it. On some  parts of the battlefield our forces even advanced.    According to Gen. Delic, results of strategic importance  achieved by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army are: The thwarting of  the occupation, the survival of the people, the opening up of  roads, and the strengthening of the political reputation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina in the world. The agreement reached with the  Republic of Croatia should be regarded in this light. The  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army gained a lot by this agreement -- it no  longer has to fight two enemies. The opening up of roads is  also of great importance.    Speaking about the situation in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army,  Delic said this was an army in which military hierarchy was  respected. The Army was cleansed of crime and paramilitary  formations. He particularly stressed that good cooperation with  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Internal Affairs Ministry existed.  According to Delic, Internal Affairs Ministry forces and the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army represent a united defense factor of our  country. It is necessary to continue the strengthening of the  Army regarding its organization and cadres, because there will  more fighting, Rasim Delic said.</p>

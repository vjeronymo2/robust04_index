			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Arts: Seven figure Digital - Sponsorship The pleasure of a recession must be that, like banging your head against a brick wall, it feels so good when it stops. Announcements of seven-figure sponsorships have been thin on the ground in recent years, but last week the arts world was reminded of the glory days when the Secretary of State for National Heritage announced, at the new British Library at St Pancras - surely the largest and grandest brick wall in London - a Pounds 1 million sponsorship from Digital. In return for having an interactive exhibition gallery named after them, Digital has provided the Library with its largest ever private sponsorship in the form of computer systems integral to the Online Public Access Catalogue and the Automated Book Retrieval System, which will ensure that items from the 12 million volume London holdings can be identified, retrieved and delivered in 30 minutes. Digital is also computerising the Tate Gallery's library and archive - a significant collection of more than 250,000 documents and artefacts relating to 20th century art. This will be the first art library to go on to such an image retrieval system in Britain, and Digital will benefit by demonstrating it to clients and employees as well as receiving traditional corporate benefits. These sponsorships build on Digital's existing provision of computer systems  -which already run the box offices at the Royal National Theatre, Sadler's Wells and elsewhere - and its continuing support of dance. Where would the arts be without Digital?                           *       *      * If Digital were in Scotland, it would be able to win an Award specifically for 'sponsorship in kind' - one of the categories in the ABSA Scottish Awards, held last week in Glasgow and sponsored by United Distillers and The Scotsman. It is understandable that, in a recession, sponsorship in kind has grown. It is less ostentatious in hard times, and the exchange of goods or services it involves can be more personal than a traditional cheque-signing sponsorship. This year's category winner was Safeway, which made possible Scottish Ballet's first ever tour to Russia and the Ukraine by providing three pantechnicons, with drivers, to transport sets, scenery and costumes, together with enough Safeway products to feed an entire ballet company, many of whom were vegetarian. Six other sponsors - BP Oil, Mobil North Sea, General Accident, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Scottish Television and One-Up - also received Awards for their support of the arts in Scotland in 1992. Current sponsorship in Scotland is healthy and diverse. This year's Edinburgh International Festival has achieved a record sponsorship and donation level of Pounds 805,000, compared with Pounds 789,000 last year, with Scottish Power as the major sponsor. In the Highlands and Islands, Hydro-Electric has joined forces with the Edinburgh's Traverse Theatre to take a new play to those remote communities and to use the play as a springboard for seeking out new playwrights who are working in isolation, providing them with workshops and rehearsed readings. This is Hydro-Electric's adventurous first move into theatre: the sponsorship aims to show a commitment to customers and communities and the hunt is on within Hydro-Electric for staff with hidden play-writing talents. In another in-kind sponsorship, the Portfolio Gallery has brought together artist Calum Colvin with three businesses - Tayburn, B&amp;S Visual Technologies and Fuji Film - to create a Bosch-inspired exhibition, using state-of-the-art graphics and photographic technology, of 'The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things'. Steven Shear of B&amp;S commented that producing an artist's images had brought a new dimension to the usage of their software, more usually employed in advertising, and provided a showcase demonstrating that the scope of their technology was limited only by the imagination of the user. Scotland is also represented in the libidinous ice-cream brand Haagen Dazs' new arts sponsorship programme, 'Dedicated to Pleasure, Dedicated to the Arts'. The programme includes the reopening of Edinburgh's Fruitmarket Gallery and the Edinburgh Book and Film Festivals, and also features video at the Tate Liverpool, contemporary sculpture in an 18th century National Trust garden, and an exhibition at Manchester's Cornerhouse.                           *       *      * Green sponsorship shoots are also being gobbled up by arts organisations south of the border. Tyne Tees Television has just contributed a substantial Pounds 100,000 over four years to the Newcastle-based Northern Sinfonia, strengthening its existing relationship to the orchestra by becoming a Platinum Corporate Member of the Northern Sinfonia's new Development Plan. This goes some way to reassure those concerned about the genuine regional commitment of the new TV companies: there is an exact overlap between the home patch of Tyne Tees and the Northern Sinfonia, and it is in both of their interests to present a vibrant cultural and economic image of the North East. Northern Sinfonia will be reinforcing role as the North East's cultural ambassador, expanding the orchestra's activities in the community and creating an instrument bank of quality instruments for its young players. With a similar eye to public perceptions of the private sector, BUPA is to sponsor live music recitals in NHS hospitals, nursing homes and hospices through the Council for Music in Hospitals, as well as running a series of concerts with high profile musicians in stately homes in order to raise the profile and funds of the Council.                           *       *      * Back in London, the British Land Company PLC has put Pounds 180,000 towards the Tate's major Ben Nicholson retrospective - the first major Nicholson exhibition since 1969, which will tour to St Etienne and Frankfurt after London. In addition to client entertainment, the sponsor will give shareholders a free ticket to the exhibition and will use images from it in its annual report - designed by another Tate sponsor CDT.

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Observer: Fashion model Has Brenda Dean, a working Labour peer who used to run the Sogat printing union, given up all hope of political office, or is she the shape of things to come? The question is prompted by her appearance on the board of Chamberlain Phipps, the shoe company which is just about to get its shares listed on the stock market. A few months ago she went on the board of Inveresk, the Scottish paper company. In Labour's good old days it would have been heresy for her to be seen mixing with the bosses. Admittedly, she is no longer a working trade unionist, but she seems to be much more comfortable in accepting positions around the boardroom table than most of her fellow Labour peers. Former Labour chancellor of the exchequer Lord Healey, for example, probably could have had a clutch of well-paid non-executive directorships if he'd wanted. That Baroness Dean is prepared to tread where the likes of Lord Healey would not may say something about the way Tony Blair's new-look Labour party is cosying up to big business. Then again, it is hard to see the likes of Jimmy Knapp, the RMT boss, ever taking a retirement job on the board of ScotRail.</p>

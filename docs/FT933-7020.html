			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper traders expect Japanese output cuts JAPANESE COPPER smelters are likely to cut output soon, removing up to 200,000 tonnes of annual supply from the market, according to traders and analysts. The cuts are expected because of weak demand in Japan itself and because the charges smelters make for treating copper concentrates, an intermediate material, are falling. The Highland Valley mining company is reported to have completed a deal recently with Mitsubishi, Dowa and Sumitomo of Japan for between 65,000 and 75,000 tonnes at treatment charges of USDollars 102 a tonne, substantially below the Dollars 115 to Dollars 120 a tonne levels negotiated earlier this year between miners and custom smelters. 'If, as we expect, the concentrates market continues to tighten, treatment charges will move increasingly in favour of the mines,' says Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal/Dutch Shell group. 'Some observers believe that the Japanese smelter pool, which is exporting copper for less than it would get in its protected domestic market, will cut output and reduce its demand for concentrates.' Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, suggests that in the short term there is 'a very good floor' under the three-month London Metal Exchange copper price at 80 to 83 cents a lb. However, 'if the Japanese smelters start to cut back production in coming weeks, as we and many other observers expect, then copper prices will stabilise at a higher level'. One complicating factor is a deal being put together by a big trading house for some consumers to give them guaranteed long-term copper prices. This may be completed by the end of August. 'When the deal is concluded there may be a temporary price setback,' says Mr Arnold. But, 'if the pricing deal results, as more and more observers think it will, in the withdrawal of 100,000 tonnes of copper from LME warehouse stocks, then copper prices are unlikely to fall far for very long'. In Merrill's latest Weekly Futures Report he says that, although copper stocks are high, 'they can hardly be described as crushing at around eight weeks of consumption'. Mr Arnold says Merrill is not expecting 'runaway copper prices. But price surges up to the 90 to 95 cents a lb area in coming months would not surprise us'. In Billiton's latest Metals Report, Mr MacMillan argues that fears about a lack of world copper smelting capacity are unfounded. A tightness in capacity last year was eased by merchants shipping concentrates to remote locations such as the Commonwealth of Independent States and Zambia for treatment, he points out. While some greenfield smelter projects have been cancelled, additions to existing smelters will add more than 700,000 tonnes of annual capacity between 1992 and the end of 1994. Also, nearly half the 972,000 tonnes of new annual copper mining capacity by the end of 1995 would use the SX-EW (solvent extraction-electro winning) technology which dispenses with the need for conventional smelting plants. Estimates vary, but there is a broad consensus that SX-EW now accounts for more than 10 per cent of total western world refined copper output compared with 7 per cent in the mid-1980s, Mr MacMillan points out. 'This proportion is likely to rise to about 15-16 per cent during the second half of this decade and could be as high as 18 per cent by the year 2000. By 1994 the production of copper by the SX-EW route will almost certain exceed 1m tonnes.'</p>

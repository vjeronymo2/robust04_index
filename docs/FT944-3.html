			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Pay ranking blow for chief executives Britain's chief executives are paid less than most of their international counterparts, says a survey by management consultants Towers Perrin. British chief executive officers came 16th out of 19 countries surveyed in terms of total cash remuneration (salary and bonuses) - one place higher than in 1993. Their total pay amounted to Pounds 158,000 compared with Pounds 311,000 received by their equivalents in the US, who topped the league table.</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA WEST PLANS PALMDALE AIR SERVICE EARLY NEXT YEAR  </P> <P> America West Airlines said Monday that it expects to offer round-trip flights  to Las Vegas from Palmdale early next year, marking the return of scheduled  commercial airline service to the Antelope Valley community 35 miles north of  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> With its move into Palmdale, Phoenix-based America West now serves 12  California cities, including Los Angeles. Earlier this year, as part of its  expansion in the state, it began service from Santa Barbara and Fresno.  </P> <P> America West plans to begin Palmdale service Jan. 2, with four departures a day  using 37-seat Dash 8 turboprop aircraft. America West will use the Palmdale Air  Terminal, which has not been used for scheduled service since 1985, when Desert  Sun Airlines halted operations there.  </P> <P> Besides America West, the start-up airline Westates has plans to use Palmdale's  airport. However, a spokesman for Burlingame, Calif.-based Westates said Monday  that the airline does not expect to begin commercial operations until sometime  in December and that its Palmdale service is expected to begin sometime after  that.

Yelchishchev, chief of </F> operational rear services and transport of the CIS Combined  Armed Forces Staff: "Army and Navy Rear Services: Support to  Collective Forces"]    [Text] The political and economic processes now occurring  in regions of the former USSR are resulting in destabilization  in some places, causing crisis situations, and sometimes  provoking adjacent countries to intervene in the affairs of  significantly weakened and disunited republics. In this  situation, the governments and parliaments of a number of CIS  countries are giving serious thought to their national security  and seeking to ensure it, among other ways, in the form of  collective security, through integration in defense issues  within the commonwealth framework.    The member states of the Collective Security Treaty of May  15, 1992--Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian  Federation, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan--are cooperating closest  of all in the defense sphere. Among other things, the treaty  calls for coordinating the member states' activities in basic  areas of the mobilizational readiness of their armed forces and  economic structures and for drawing up recommendations on key  aspects of military-technical policy and on equipping the member  states' armed forces with weapons and military hardware.    An agreement entitled "On Military Observer Groups and  Collective Peacekeeping Forces in the Commonwealth of  Independent States" was signed earlier, in March 1992. Under  this agreement, collective peacekeeping (also known as  peacemaking) troops were designated from virtually all the CIS  states. Depending on the capabilities and interests of each  specific country, these forces take the form of a battalion,  regiment, or division. In addition to combat units and subunits,  the military observers group and collective peacekeeping forces  can include command personnel, administrative services, an  expert group, a military police group, and logistical and  technical support subunits (units).    The basic approaches to the organization of rear service  support for the collective forces are still being worked out on  the basis of the experience of UN multinational peacekeeping  forces and command and staff games and exercises.    The legal basis for rear services support to the  peacekeeping  forces is the protocol "On the Structure of Military Observer  Groups and Collective Peacekeeping Forces in the Commonwealth of  Independent States and Their Manning and Logical, Technical, and  Financial Support." For example, it states that logistical and  transport support for observers, units, and subunits is to be  provided by the state that allocates the manpower and equipment  or, alternatively, by other Commonwealth member states. This  option for providing support was adopted as the basis at an  operational assembly of the Main Command of the CIS Combined  Armed Forces, as well as in the course of a command and staff  war game that dealt with the training and use of peacekeeping  contingents.    The first phase of the command and staff game, which was  held  against the backdrop of the situation that has arisen in the  Central Asian region by decision of the chiefs of states (the  decision was confirmed by their parliaments), called for the  creation of an observers group and collective peacekeeping  forces from units and subunits of five Commonwealth countries.  The need to clarify fundamental issues relating to logistical,  transport, and other types of support in the peacekeeping  operation mandate became apparent even then. This also applies  to support to observer groups that, as a rule, will be sent far  in advance of peacekeeping forces and operate in observation  zones autonomously, in groups of five to 10 men. Unless it is  determined in advance how they will be supplied, disruptions and  misunderstandings are inevitable.    In modeling the observers' actions, we relied on the  experience of the UN, in which the observation areas and objects  are determined first, and then the territory is divided into  command and staff zones of responsibility for organizing the  work of these groups and ensuring that they receive  comprehensive support. A mobile transport subunit with  communications equipment is set up in each zone. It is  indicative that a number of the inspectors have life support  sets containing all essential supplies, from binoculars and  bullet-proof vests to food products and personal hygiene items.    In speaking about the specific mechanism used to support the  observer groups, it is quite clear that much will depend on the  situation. For example, the observer group that operated in  Tajikistan was based with units of the 201st Division, and no  special supply problems arose. But not everything went smoothly.  For example, the border troops command refused to supply a  helicopter to evacuate 12 observers from Kurgan-Tyube when  combat operations were under way in the city. Colonel I. Ozerov,  chief of an operational rear services and transport group of the  CIS Combined Armed Forces Staff, was then tasked with evacuating  the observers to Dushanbe. Breaking through to Kurgan-Tyube and  back while under fire in two armored personnel transports  provided by the 201st Division, the officer accomplished his  mission, for which he was decorated with the Order of Personal  Bravery. The conclusion was drawn that if observers are  operating separately in disparate areas, their main transport  equipment must be armored, and their equipment stocks must  guarantee that the groups are mobile and can operate  autonomously.    It was thus proposed at the command and staff war game that  there should be one all-terrain vehicle, such as a command and  staff vehicle, for every 10 observers, and that it should be  equipped with work and rest areas and a life-support module  allowing at least 10 days' functioning.    It was proposed that the equipment and supplies be  air-dropped together with the personnel using the manpower and  assets of the countries providing the military observers.    The example of providing rear service support to the  multinational forces in the Persian Gulf region is indicative.  Their success was to a considerable extent predetermined by the  prompt creation of logistical and technical support facilities.  The American command had 13 major arms and ammunition  stockpiles, up to 10 fuel and lubricant depots, and 17 supply  ships carrying aircraft fuel, diesel fuel, food, and other  supplies in the region. All told, there were enough reserves to  supply 180,000 men for 30 days. Consequently, in preparing the  CIS collective forces for operations, it would obviously be a  good idea to establish support facilities for them in advance.  In general, this task can be successfully accomplished only on  the basis of an analytical forecast of potential areas of  tension, a study of their possibilities from a rear service  standpoint, a determination of the manpower and equipment to be  used in the operations, and a procedure for augmenting them.    In view of the peacekeeping forces' coalitional character  and  the fact that it is not always possible to envision their exact  makeup, we considered during the command and staff war game the  option of creating modular rear service supply sets. It was  proposed that the composition of rear services and their  functional strength be based on the makeup of the peacekeeping  forces: command structures and a regiment rear services supply  set for every three to four battalions, command structures and a  division rear service supply set for every three to four  regiments, and so on. Only this approach would seem to ensure  the possibility of maneuver of rear services personnel and  equipment and of organizing reliable rear services support in  any situation.    An example of such organization is provided once again by  the  operations of the multinational forces in the Persian Gulf. The  number of rear service units and subunits in the first command  varied in relation to the grouping of forces and the character  of combat operations. This was facilitated by a bloc, or  nonattached, structure of the main rear service units. For  example, a fuel and lubricants supply battalion could have from  one to two supply companies and from two to four fuel and  lubricant transport companies. The same applies to other rear  service subunits.    The command and staff war game also reviewed the option of  using local economic capabilities to support peacekeeping  forces. Specifically, it was planned to attach observers, for  all types of supplies to units and subunits already in the  observation zone. Furthermore, if, for example, there is a  petroleum products depot with required types of fuel and  lubricants in the zone of responsibility, efforts must be made  to use that depot to augment stocks on site; the same applies to  buying fresh vegetables and fruits, obtaining fuel and water,  and carrying out sanitation-hygienic, antiepidemic, and other  measures.    In a number of cases, it is impossible for peacekeeping  units  to deal with such matters as restoring facilities along  communication lines activated for their transport support. It  must be pointed out that support can hardly come solely from the  states providing the peacekeeping forces or solely from the use  of local resources. Support is most likely to be of a mixed  character. In any case, the use of local capabilities is always  desirable.    An indispensable condition for the timely and uninterrupted  support to peacekeeping forces is clear-cut command. For this  reason, it was deemed advisable at the command and staff war  game to form a combined staff for the military observers group  and the CIS collective peacekeeping forces under the Main  Command of the CIS Combined Armed Forces. This staff would  operate on a permanent basis and include a functional  subdivision to manage rear services and transport supply. At the  same time, it is important to have close cooperation between the  rear service command structures and combined-arms staffs. A veil  of excessive secrecy between them will be detrimental. This was  the case in the Transcaucasus a few years ago, when an  operational rear services group was not told which airfields  would be used to bring in airborne assault units and how many  units would be coming. The result was fuel shortages for the  military transport planes.    According to normatives, the basic peacekeeping force  unit--the reinforced battalion--is to have supplies for three to  five days. But to ensure autonomous operation, it realistically  has to have food and fuel reserves for at least 30 days. At the  same time, the battalion has no agencies that can take delivery,  properly store, stockpile, and distribute equipment and  supplies. The conclusion is clear: A peacekeeping unit or  subunit operating autonomously must be reinforced from a rear  services standpoint and be equipped with compact equipment for  life in the field, for storing large reserves of equipment and  supplies, and for obtaining, storing and disinfecting water.  Calculations made at the command and staff war game show that  the following supplies must be on hand in amounts over and above  the prescribed levels:     -  at the regiment level, a mobile field bakery, MMP-2  (MPP-6) mechanized compact laundry units, a PKS-2m mobile field  kitchen and mess hall, an AVTS-1.7 vehicle-mounted water tank,  200 bullet-proof vests, tanks for extra fuel supplies (nearly  600 metric tons), one camp tent for every 10 men, one officer  camp tent for every two to three men, staff tents, and  standardized tents for housing staffs, storing weapons,  ammunition, food, and other equipment, and four bundles of  canvas;    -  at the battalion level, one AVTS-1.7, one PKHB-0.4, tanks in  an  MSB [motorized rifle battalion] for 60 metric tons of fuel, for  1.8 gasoline refuelings, and for 1.4 diesel fuel refuelings (in  a PDB, tanks for 50 metric tons of fuel, two gasoline  refuelings, and two diesel fuel refuelings), and tents in the  same ratio specified for the regiment level.       The units must also have three MK-30 and KP-20 field  kitchens  per battalion to support an outpost, posts, and patrols.    A peacekeeping operation can last a long time. And by the  end  of the first month, it will likely be necessary to have a  temporary rear service group to take delivery of equipment and  supplies from the republics' national commands and to distribute  them to the peacekeeping forces. When operations are very  prolonged, and also when forces are introduced to prevent local  conflicts on external borders (based on the experience of the  command and staff war game), it will be necessary to create up a  forward support facility for the collective forces.    It must be pointed out that supporting mixed collective  forces is in itself a difficult task. And as some Commonwealth  states introduce their own currencies, take steps to equip their  forces with Western arms and equipment, set their own supply  norms, and introduce their own uniforms, this task will become  more and more difficult. When the Warsaw Pact countries' joint  armed forces existed, a system of bases and stockpiles of  equipment and supplies was created, and effective efforts were  made to establish a common transport network and system for  maintaining it. Protocols and agreements were rigorously  observed. But the question of supporting coalitional groupings,  especially in the course of counterstrikes and counteroffensives  away from supply bases, has never been fully resolved. The same  applies to standardizing rear services manpower and equipment.  Therefore, in our view, in order to avoid or at least alleviate  the problem of using collective peacekeeping forces in the  Commonwealth of Independent States, the CIS states' armed forces  must follow common rear service support principles and preserve  a common rear service support system, common rear service  organization and common operational tactics. Preserving the most  important integrative components of the rear service system of  the former Soviet armed forces is also invaluable--above all a  common defense communications network and maintenance elements  and regional rear service preparations. It is important to take  common approaches to the creation, stockpiling, and siting of  logistical supplies for the Combined Armed Forces and armed  forces of the Commonwealth states and to the operation of  mobilizational agencies to deploy rear service troops and  installations.    Finally, the mobilizational and operational plans of the  former Soviet armed forces were formulated with due regard for  the actual correlation of forces and equipment and capabilities  for utilizing them. Corresponding logistical, technical, and  transport facilities were created. In destroying it, the  Commonwealth states are dooming themselves to a struggle for  survival in which each state is on its own, and this poses  problems.

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Observer: Body building Welcome signs of movement at The Body Shop. Texan Gwen Gober, who professionalised Kingfisher's public relations, has been recruited to help the embattled cosmetics group rebuild its environmentally-friendly public image. She is being brought in to help ease the strain on Gavin Grant, the former architect of the RSPCA's controversial dead dogs and ponies advertising campaign, who has not had much luck persuading Anita and Gordon Roddick to love journalists. For starters, Gober must try to prevent the Roddicks from continually referring to City financiers as 'pin-striped dinosaurs'. Such descriptions may be well deserved, but as Gerald Ratner can testify some home truths are best left unsaid. Body Shop need not go the same way as Ratners.</p>

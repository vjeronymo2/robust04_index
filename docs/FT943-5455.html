			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Markets: Keep your eye on the managers, too - Serious Money Hundreds of private shareholders will have cheered as Tiny Rowland once again showed his Houdini-like capacity for survival. Dieter Bock, his fellow chief executive at Lonrho, had planned to strip Rowland of his executive powers in the wake of revelations that he costs Lonrho more than Pounds 5.5m a year. But Rowland shrugged off the attack, as he has shrugged off so many in his 33 years at Lonrho's helm. It is more than 20 years since the early chapters in the Lonrho saga spawned the epithet 'the unacceptable face of capitalism'. The shares have never been a favourite with professional fund managers since, but many private investors have stuck with their maverick hero through thick and thin. Sadly, their loyalty has not been rewarded. Apart from a couple of brief flickers in the mid-1970s and late-1980s, Lonrho shares have been a remarkably poor investment. Is Lonrho a typical example of what happens when investors back an entrepreneurial company run by a single dominant figure? Many serious investors prefer to invest in companies which are run by their founders, or by managers who act like owners. Warren Buffett, an outstandingly successful American investor, often takes long-term minority stakes in sound, family-run businesses and likes all managers to have a significant share stake in the companies they manage. His typically homely analogy is with a restaurant where the proprietors can honestly say 'We eat our own cooking'. And his favourite investment is in the local furniture store run by its founder, Mrs Rose Blumkin. But it is just as simplistic to conclude that owner-run businesses make better investments than those run by professional managers as the reverse. There are good and bad companies in both categories. What really matters to the outside investor is not the status of the company or its managers/owners but their attitude. Take a few other examples. Fallen favourite Amstrad had a brilliant start. It gave its high street customers what they wanted at unbeatable prices: its computers worked and were cheap, smart and easy to use. But the real problem was that Amstrad boss Alan Sugar showed very little interest in the well-being of his outside shareholders. He sold a large part of his own holding before the share price collapsed - and offered to buy out the outside shareholders when the price was on the floor. Now take Hanson, one of the few founder-run companies which has stayed the course. Its shares consistently beat the index until the mid-1980s. Since then, though, it has moved broadly in line with the market and it has been a relatively unexciting investment for the past decade. The founders have treated outside shareholders well, but the company has lost the fizz of youth. Our last company is Marks and Spencer. Over the past 20 years, M&amp;S shares have done slightly better than the stock market. It is a fascinating example of a company run by professional managers who behave as if they were owners, in the best sense. The message for investors is that weighing up their managers can be as important as crunching the balance sheet numbers. * * * Maverick directors and cowboy companies can appear on any market. But they tend to cluster thickest on fringe markets - the Over the Counter Market, the Unlisted Securities Market (in its early days) and the Third Market: all had their clutch of black sheep. This does not mean that all private investors should avoid the new Alternative Investment Market (AIM) planned to replace the USM. It does mean that they should approach it with extreme caution and keep a padlock on their wallet until they can see the whites of the managers' eyes. The new stock exchange boss, Michael Lawrence, pointed out months ago that 'while companies want cheaper access to equity capital, investors want a similar level of protection to that now provided. These are incompatible requirements'. AIM gives the companies cheap access to equity capital with the minimum of red tape. And, already, some bystanders are warning that it could be more dangerous than the OTC. But the intelligent investor who understands the risks might enjoy spicing up his portfolio with a few carefully researched AIM shares. It appears probable that they will have tax advantages. And fund managers are already launching funds concentrating on AIM shares. Just keep your eyes wide open.</p>

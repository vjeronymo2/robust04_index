			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Denisov: "The Military Police Has Been </F> Ordered To `Live Long'"]    [Text] The military police were abolished by an order of  Georgian Armed Forces Supreme Commander-in-Chief Eduard  Shevardnadze as "a structure failing to meet modern  requirements." The order notes that the reorganization is being  carried out in order to confirm the principle of one-man  command. Military policemen will be placed into the composition  of motorized rifle units, the directorate has been disbanded,  and the armament and equipment are being transferred to other  units.    It is interesting that the republic's National Guard remains  beyond the control of the Georgian Ministry of Defense. National  Guard personnel were the main striking force of the coup of  winter 1991-1992, as a result of which President Zviad  Gamsakhurdia was removed from power.</p>

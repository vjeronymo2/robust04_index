			<p>BFN     [Text] The fiftieth session of the GCC Ministerial Council  began at the general-secretariat headquarters this afternoon.  The meetings are chaired by His Royal Highness [HRH] Prince  Sa'ud al-Faysal, minister for foreign affairs and chairman of  the current session. At the beginning of the meeting, HRH  minister for foreign affairs made the following speech:    [Begin recording] [Faysal] In the name of God, the  Compassionate and the Merciful, prayers and peace upon the  prophets and messengers.    Your Highnesses and excellencies, secretary general,  respected brothers, God's peace and blessings upon you. It  gives me great pleasure to express to you the warmest of  welcomes to your country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; which is  today pleased to welcome you in the GCC Ministerial Council  fiftieth session. With God's assistance, I pronounce this  session open, and would like to praise the elements of  cooperation and solidarity existing among our countries, as  exemplified in the most effective resolutions adopted by our  leaders during the sessions of the GCC summits. [passage omitted]    The field of bolstering military cooperation between the GCC  states represented the most important issues discussed during  the 14th summit. The higher council decided to set up a higher  committee to implement resolutions pertaining to collective  defense and military cooperation whose chairmanship will be  assumed on a alternate basis by the GCC defense ministers. The  committee will include the chiefs of staff and the chairman of  the military committee of the GCC general-secretariat. The time  has now come for the UAE to assume the chairmanship term.    Brothers, our meeting takes place at a time when our Gulf  region is still witnessing difficult and critical situations.  The Iraqi regime continues its policy of violating and  selecting all UN Security Council resolutions regarding its  aggression against Kuwait; and its breaking of the UN Security  Council 773 and 833 Resolutions which stipulated a demarcation  of land and sea borders between Iraq and Kuwait, its  continuation to keep as hostages Kuwaiti prisoners and other  nationals thus violating international laws and appropriate UNSC  resolutions.    Also, Iran has again started to reiterate its claims of  control and sovereignty over Greater and Lesser Tunb Islands and  the island of Abu Musa, which belong to the UAE. However, we  remain hopeful that Iran will respond to the voice of reason  regarding the issue of the three islands and reach a final  solution with the UAE through peaceful means; and in the process  prove its sincere intention concerning its claims of  good-neighborliness, development of friendly relations, and its  desire for bilateral cooperation with GCC states. [end recording]    HRH the minister for foreign affairs added that the GCC  fiftieth session is taking place at time which is at best not  reassuring, because the Iraqi regime continues to pose a threat  to the security and stability of our countries. There are also  threats aimed at destroying our cooperation council which  represented the solid rock that quashed Iraq's ambitions and  thwarted its ugly aggression.    His highness went on to say that Iraq's latest efforts are  represented in its large-scale campaign which it is conducting  in the Arab arena, in an attempt to help lift the embargo  imposed against it by the the UN Security Council resolution;  and its attempt to re-establish relations without respecting and  fully implementing these resolutions and recommendations.    His highness added that it is absolutely crucial for our  current meeting to issue resolutions that stress and underline  our determined and strong stance regarding this matter, to close  the door in the face of any such attempts.    His highness said that our hearts continue to bleed  profusely  because of the ugly crime committed by the criminal Zionist  settlers against defenceless and innocent worshippers in the  sacred Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron; and its ensuing consequences  and complications on the the peace process.    Stemming from this, his highness went on to say, we call on  the international community to shoulder its responsibility  regarding the provision of protection for the Palestinians and  the sacred places from the savagery of the Jewish settlers in  the occupied land.    Regarding Somalia, his highness said that we are still  hopeful that the Somali leaders would be at the level of  responsibility to implement what they had agreed upon in  Nairobi, Kenya, to save their country from the ravages of a  civil war and the tragedy of a deadly famine.    His highness added that we also have not lost hope that the  Afghan leaders would use the voice of reason and raise above  their differences to spare Afghanistan from a total destruction.    We also hope that the international community would continue  to implement its promises to stop the criminal Serbs from  implementing their criminal ethnic plans against Muslim  Bosnians. His highness expressed his hope that the Bosnian  Muslims and Croats would be able to reap the fruits of their  confederation plan to live together in security, stability, and  peace; hoping that this plan would convince the Serbs to join  the peace efforts and accept the solutions which are on the  negotiating table.    In conclusion, his highness asked God to help them achieve  success. Following this speech, the opening session was  adjourned, and a meeting behind closed door was held.</p>

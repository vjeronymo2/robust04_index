			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Koji Takeuchi] </F>   [Text] A delegation of the Japan-Vietnam Economic Committee  (chairman: Akira Nishio, president of the Nissho Iwai  Corporation) of the Federation of Economic Organizations of  Japan [Keidanren] is now on a visit to Vietnam. The delegation  paid a call on Do Muoi, Communist Party of Vietnam general  secretary, in Hanoi on 5 April. During the meeting with members  of the delegation, the Vietnamese leader stated: "Japan is  Vietnam's biggest trading partner and a top aid donor of  Vietnam. I am grateful to Japan. The amount of investment in  Vietnam from the Japanese private sector remains small,  however." In this way, he asked for Japan's increased  investment in Vietnam. Specifically, he asked Japan to invest  in Vietnam's machinery industry, which can generate employment,  transfer high technology to Vietnam, and provide Vietnam with  business management know-how.    In response, Chairman Nishio said, "Japan's investment in  Vietnam lags behind that of other nations, but Japan will be a  top investor in Vietnam sometime in the future." Thus, the  Japanese business leader indicated that in taking advantage of  the lifting of the U.S. embargo against Vietnam, Japan would  make aggressive investments in Vietnam in the future.</p>

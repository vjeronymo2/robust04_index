The  investigation's goal is to uncover the weaknesses in the  organization of work and ensuring its secrecy in the light of  the arrest of former-CIA official Aldrich Ames, who is now  accused of working for Moscow for nine years.    Woolsey mentioned that, to head the commission, he would  like  to recruit former National Security Adviser under Bush's  administration Brent Scowcroft, former secretary of defence  under President Jimmy Carter Harold Brown, and the former head  of the counter-espionage department in the FBI, Douglas Gow.  The commission will also include current CIA officials.    Besides, Woolsey delclared, the CIA would also conduct an  "independent and energetic" investigation into the Ames affair.  This will be headed by Fred Hitz, the inspector general of the  intelligence department.    Woolsey noted that the parallel investigations will be  carried on without applying pressure on the on-going judicial  investigation into the activity of Ames and his wife, who is  also accused of espionage.</p>

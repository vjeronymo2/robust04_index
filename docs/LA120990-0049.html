			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW COUNCIL MUST HEED VOTER MESSAGE  </P> <P> As we usher in a new Santa Monica City Council, it is important to recognize  the messages the voters sent this past election.  </P> <P> We will no longer tolerate large-scale development that adversely affects our  residential quality of life.  </P> <P> The significant support garnered by the independent candidates, coupled with  the passage of Propositions S and Z, amply attest to that. The council should  now begin to intelligently manage commercial development to stay within our  infrastructural capacities and to have it serve our neighborhoods. An essential  component of such a strategy is immediate downzoning in certain areas and the  implementation of plans to protect residential neighborhoods from the impacts  of already-approved development.  </P> <P> The voters also said that violent behavior by the homeless must stop, and  solutions need to be developed to help them move back into society. I was  heartened to see several council candidates adopt the position that, in  exchange for meals and temporary shelter, able-bodied homeless provide public  work, such as cleaning up our parks and beaches.  </P> <P> Finally, the voters said, as did I, that both rent control initiatives were  unacceptable. The Rent Control Board should now move forward with the Incentive  Housing Program that would provide landlords substantial rent relief, while at  the same time assuring preservation of affordable housing through covenants to  stay in business, enhanced tenant protections and a sensible "inclusionary"  housing quotient.  </P> <P> KATHLEEN T. SCHWALLIE  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P> <P> Editor's note: Schwallie was an unsuccessful candidate for the City Council in  the Nov. 6 election.  </P> <P> </P></p>

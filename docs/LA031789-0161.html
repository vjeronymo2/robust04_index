			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EX-HAZELTINE EXECUTIVE SENTENCED IN ARMS FRAUD  </P> <P> A former executive of the Hazeltine Corp., the first figure in the sweeping  Pentagon corruption investigation to face sentencing, was ordered today to  serve three months in prison for conspiring to defraud the government.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton granted leniency to Charles Furciniti, 54,  under federal sentencing guidelines after Assistant U.S. Atty. Joseph Aronica  declared that Furciniti had been fully cooperative with investigators and had  shown remorse since pleading guilty Jan. 6.  </P> <P> The judge also sentenced Furciniti to pay a $20,000 fine and to serve 150 hours  of community service.  </P> <P> Furciniti, in a brief statement requesting that he be spared jail time, told  the judge:  </P> <P> "My 30-year career in the defense industry is over. . . . I have become  infamous in my community and have embarrassed myself with my family. I am so  ashamed that I have asked none of my five children to attend today's hearing. .  . . I am truly sorry."  </P> <P> Furciniti pleaded guilty along with another former executive of Hazeltine,  which is a subsidiary of Emerson Electric Co., to conspiracy to defraud the  federal government and to commit wire fraud, a charge stemming from  investigators' use of electronic listening devices during the inquiry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gained Bidding Information  </P> <P> Furciniti and Joseph Colarusso admitted obtaining inside information from two  industry consultants about competitors' bids to help their firm win a  $150-million contract for aircraft radar testing devices.  </P> <P> Cooperation from Furciniti and Colarusso is believed to have bolstered the  government's case against consultants William Parkin and Fred Lackner, key  figures in the investigation code-named "Operation Ill Wind."  </P> <P> Parkin and Lackner face trial next week along with a Navy engineer, Teledyne  Industries Inc. and three Teledyne executives on the remaining 25 counts of an  indictment charging an elaborate scheme to pass bribes in exchange for inside  contract information.  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, Hilton granted defense requests to dismiss two racketeering  counts from the indictment.  </P> <P> Furciniti told Hilton today, "I have asked myself a thousand times why did I  agree to participate with Mr. Parkin. . . . I rationalized my behavior. I never  asked myself who Parkin was dealing with and behaved accordingly."  </P> <P> He said that in trying to win the contract for the Navy's UPM-150 program, he  "never really looked at the actions from the Navy or government viewpoint."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General 'Ali Muhammad al-Mu'min, chief </F> of staff of the Kuwaiti Armed Forces, by Samir Yasin; place and  date not given]    [Excerpt] [Yasin] What is the strategic objective of  building a military force outgunned and outmanned by Iraq. Is  it to stall an Iraqi offensive for a few days, pending the  arrival of aid from the allies, or to be a match for the enemy  and inflict defeat on it?    [Al-Mu'min] Relevant studies have been made and endorsed by  the government. We are in the process of building a highly  trained and technically advanced force with the potential of  deterring aggression on Kuwait. We do have connections in the  Gulf and wider Arab spheres, as well as with allies and friends.    [Yasin] The way Kuwait has diversified the sources of its  arms purchases leads one to believe the contracts were awarded  to reward the allies for their role in the liberation of Kuwait.  How much of a role does politics play in Kuwait's arms  purchases? Were previous purchases something of a reward?    [Al-Mu'min] The choice of one weapon over another is  determined first and foremost by our defense requirements, as  well as by quality. Without a doubt, the political factor does  come into it, albeit only marginally.    [Yasin] You are concentrating on sophisticated weapons in  pursuit of quality. How do you think you can offset the deficit  in manpower qualified to absorb complex military technology?    [Al-Mu'min] We are indeed after such technologically  sophisticated weaponry to make up for a deficit in manpower. I  do not think, however, that the lack of personnel is that much  of a problem. We conducted a survey, and it emerged that the  human resources can be made available. We are now looking into  how to institute incentives for a voluntary enlistment in the  military. We need all the help we can get from the Kuwaiti  people. Needless to say, joining the ranks of the military  amounts to a career that may come in handy once a conscript is  released from service.    Compulsory service and reservists together make up a good  percentage of the military's requirements for personnel. It is  also possible to recruit civilians for bureaucratic duties in  the rear lines.    [Yasin] What are the ultimate military and political  objectives you seek from the military training with the allied  forces?    [Al-Mu'min] The most important objective we seek from  military training is to upgrade Kuwaiti military efficiency in  general, with an emphasis on dealing with foreign military  forces to gain experience and establish joint coordination on  the command level, taking into consideration the experiences of  Desert Storm.    [Yasin] Has Kuwait benefited from the competition between  the  countries that export weapons? How this has taken place?    [Al-Mu'min] Yes, and this style is used to open the door for  competition between various countries in the field of military  industry. This competition encourages the companies to present  their best offers. I cannot define specific fields in which  Kuwait benefited from this competition, but this is something  possible during the field experiments and through armament  offers to Kuwait.    [Yasin] What military systems have been adopted by the  Kuwaiti Army to ensure maximum benefit for the three fighting  services when there is a need?    [Al-Mu'min] The current systems reflect the importance of  cooperation between the three fighting services. This was  emphasized during joint training. Systems on the command level  were worked out, and there are representatives of each force in  all other forces.    [Yasin] Iraq can produce a 150-km range missiles. How can  this striking power, which is capable of hitting deep into  Kuwait, be confronted?    [Al-Mu'min] We can confront this threat through taking a  host  of negative and positive precautions. The negative precautions  are represented in security precautions and improving warning  systems. As for the positive precautions, they are represented  in being equipped with weapons able to deal with the Iraqi  missiles, and we do not hide this objective.    [Yasin] The sea is seen as a main area from which Kuwaiti  security can be penetrated. What stage has the process of  reconstructing the Kuwait navy reached?    [Al-Mu'min] The naval force's plans were decided after the  naval force conducted studies on its needs to carry out its  duties. The studies are in an advanced stage of evaluation, but  selecting boats and ships is more complicated than selecting  other weapons. Deciding their specifications needs more time,  but we have to take into consideration the protection of our  waters and maritime borders.    [Yasin] Today is the third anniversary of the start of the  liberation war, Desert Storm. What are the beneficial lessons  of this war? Are these lessons being translated on the level of  Kuwaiti military action?</p>

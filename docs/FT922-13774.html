			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: US bid to restore Stempel's credibility THE BOARD of General Motors, which this week announced a large executive shake-up, yesterday sought to shore up the battered credibility of Mr Robert Stempel, the company's chairman, with a declaration that non-executive directors did not intend to interfere in his day-to-day running of the business. A board meeting on Monday demoted Mr Stempel's long-time lieutenant, Mr Lloyd Reuss, and also appeared to clip the chairman's wings when it announced that Mr John Smale, a non-executive director, would take over Mr Stempel's leadership of the board's executive committee. This was generally interpreted as a rebuke to Mr Stempel, since the committee has enjoyed the power to run General Motors between regular board meetings. However, the company yesterday belatedly explained that the executive committee had never actually met, and its function had been changed at Monday's meeting: it was no longer authorised to act on behalf of the full board but now had the role of advising the chairman. The aim was to make communication between the board and the chairman quicker and more effective. Explaining Mr Stempel's replacement by Mr Smale, a company spokesman said: 'The chairman could not be the chairman of a committee that is meant to advise him.' Mr Smale, who played a leading behind-the-scenes role in encouraging Monday's shake-up, himself issued a brief statement saying that outside directors did not 'intend to involve ourselves in the day-to-day business of GM. 'That job is the responsibility of Bob Stempel and he has the board's full support and confidence in pursuing the goal to accelerate the return to profitability of GM's North American operations.' Despite these explanations, Wall Street observers said the new responsibilities of the executive committee, together with the staff changes, underlined the concern of non-executive directors at the pace of change within the company, and their determination to get a more rapid and thorough flow of information on developing events.</p>

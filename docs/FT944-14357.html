			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Kyrgyzstan vote clears way for December poll President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan was on course for a convincing victory in this weekend's controversial referendum amending the constitution and clearing the way for parliamentary elections in December. Kyrgyzstan's electoral commission said preliminary results suggested that more than 70 per cent of those who had voted had approved the amendments. The final count, which was expected yesterday, was delayed after sudden snowstorms hampered the horse - riders delivering votes in the more remote regions of the mountainous Central Asian state. Before Saturday's vote, Mr Akayev said he hoped the referendum would lead to a more pro-reform parliament and stressed his commitment to the development of democracy in the country. The previous parliament, which was elected in 1990 before the collapse of the former Soviet Union, had frequently clashed with the president. Opposition politicians fiercely criticised Mr Akayev's arbitrary dissolution of parliament and the banning of some outspoken newspapers. The Res Publica newspaper, the voice of Kyrgyz intelligentsia which resumed publication before the vote, strongly condemned the referendum although voters in the streets of the capital, Bishkek, last week appeared largely indifferent to its outcome. Following the referendum's approval, 35 parliamentary deputies will be elected to a lower house, responsible for drafting new laws. The upper house of 75 deputies will meet twice a year to scrutinise proposed legislation. Western diplomats in Bishkek fear Mr Akayev's action might signal a lurch towards a more authoritarian style of politics, common in the region. They have urged the president to observe constitutional means for resolving disputes and will now press for international observers to scrutinise the forthcoming parliamentary elections. Since 1991, Kyrgyzstan has established a reputation as one of the most progressive states to emerge from the former Soviet Union. Wedged between Kazakhstan and China and boasting few natural resources, Kyrgyzstan moved quickly to create a market democracy which would attract foreign investment and harboured ambitions of becoming the 'Switzerland of Central Asia'. The monthly inflation rate has been brought down to 0.7 per cent although Kyrgyzstan's privatisation plans have been slow to materialise. So far, the international financial institutions have warmly endorsed Mr Akayev's reforms and have committed more money per head to Kyrgyzstan than to any other post-Soviet state. A mission from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (Opic), the US government's investment agency, which was in Bishkek on Friday continued to express backing for Mr Akayev's reforms. Mrs Ruth Harkin, president of Opic, signed a deal committing more than Dollars 250m (Pounds 155m) of US government support to am American-Kyrgyz joint venture to extract and process gold from the Jerooy field.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bonuses feel the squeeze again - Drop in with-profits pay-outs angers policyholders WITH-PROFITS bonuses are on their way down again, arousing anger from policyholders. Normally, bonuses and pay-outs rise steadily and nobody pays much attention to the complicated way they are worked out, or the massive discretion left to actuaries. But investment returns have been so bad over the past few years that final pay-outs are sliding, revealing the creakings of the life office system. The system is based on two types of bonus: reversionary, which are declared each year and, once announced, cannot be taken away; and terminal, which are added once the policy has matured. Reversionary bonuses have an element of security because they are backed by gilts or other fixed interest investments. Using terminal bonuses permits more flexibility to profit in the long term from equities. The system also allows the peaks and troughs of the market to be smoothed out. Unfortunately, the drop in markets in 1990 was not followed by reductions in bonus because companies continued to anticipate a recovery that never arrived. That bad year must soon be reflected in pay-outs to investors. Terminal bonuses can easily be altered, making final pay-outs volatile. And reversionary bonuses can be an awkward drag on a company's reserves when times are hard. So, both are under pressure. Scottish Equitable announced this week that it will cut its terminal and interim reversionary bonuses from December 1. The general effect is to reduce the cash amounts paid to policyholders on maturity by around 5 per cent, with cuts being greater for short-term policies. The company will not be writing to individual policyholders, however. Marketing director Bill Stewart denied the move was needed to shore up reserves, and said: 'The rates of return available on investments world-wide are such that it doesn't matter how good you are at investment - it just hasn't been possible over the past three years to earn returns to maintain bonuses at current levels.' Beale Dobie, which makes a market in endowment policies by buying them from investors who need cash and then selling them, has decided to cut its prices on the assumption that there will be a 10 per cent reduction in all reversionary bonus rates as well as terminal bonus rates on policies with an original term of 18 years or less. Beale Dobie expects terminal bonuses to fall by only 5 per cent for longer-term policies of 19 years or more because the bad stock market returns since Black Monday in October 1987 have had a proportionately greater effect on shorter policies. This makes policies cheaper by about 3 or 4 per cent. The company admits that the assumptions are crude but believes them to be realistic. A change in the assumptions used by secondhand policy marketmakers seems overdue. One Weekend FT reader, Benjamin Lemer, was angry to discover that the pay-out on a Scottish Amicable policy he had bought, which matured in October this year, was Pounds 14,457.60. When he bought the policy secondhand, it had been calculated that it would make Pounds 15,218.53 if bonus rates were maintained. He then discovered that terminal bonuses had been cut on September 1. Lemer complained that policyholders were entitled to full information and that Scottish Amicable was 'attempting to hoodwink them into believing your performance is better than it is.' Scottish Amicable responded by providing a list of the 16 times it has altered its terminal bonus over the past 10 years (none of which was announced generally to policyholders) and made clear that 'the rate of terminal bonus can be altered or suspended at any time whatsoever.' The company claimed it would be 'totally inappropriate' to make announcements of all terminal bonus changes because it 'would not wish to build up anticipation of the amount of the terminal bonus in the minds of individual policyholders.' Maurice Paterson, of Scottish Amicable, said that any projection of the maturity value provided by the office itself would have been conservative, and added: 'I suspect the secondhand price might have been less if our more conservative quote had gone out.' Another reader, SJ Martin, noticed in his statement from Pearl Assurance that his terminal bonus had been reduced from Pounds 9,892.29 for 1990 to Pounds 8,742.17 for 1991, meaning that the on-going value had dropped. In response to his complaint that his 'with-profits' policy had made 'no profits' for 1991, Pearl made a telling response: 'You have not lost any money as the terminal bonus was not guaranteed and would only have been applicable if the policy had become a claim in that year.' Terminal bonuses are fragile things, and investment returns on with-profits policies are much more variable than many people realise. But it is important to remember that life insurers are acting prudently and taking steps which are, ultimately, in the interests of policyholders. What the present difficulties do suggest, however, is that the public does not understand the policies they are sold. The case for providing investors with much more information when they buy looks even stronger.</p>

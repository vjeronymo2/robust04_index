Disgruntled members of the Royal Lesotho Defence Force were  still holding hostage the wing commander of the country's Air  Force, Lt- Col Patrick Majare on Saturday after they shot him  during an armed confrontation on Friday morning. Wing Commander  Majare was believed to be under armed guard in a Maseru hospital  following an operation to an injured shoulder carried out by a  civilian doctor.    The rebel soldiers have ignored pleas from the government to  release the commander so he can receive further medical  treatment in Bloemfontein.    The situation in the capital of the tiny mountain kingdom  appeared calm on Saturday, with shops trading and residents  going about their business as usual.    By lunchtime Mr Botha had met senior government and  opposition figures, including the Prime Minister and Defence  Minister Dr Ntsu Mokhehle. After lunch he was scheduled to meet  with all the senior army officers, before trying to bring the  two factions face-to-face to resolve their differences.    The rebel soldiers ostensibly are demanding a doubling of  their salaries, but South African and Lesotho Government sources  confirmed to SAPA it appeared the salary issue was a smokescreen  for political grievances. The real issue is believed to be  opposition to the ruling Basotholand Congress Party. Lesotho  and South African Government officials have not ruled out an  attempted coup.    However, the leader of the main opposition party -- the  Basotho National Party -- on Saturday scoffed at such  speculation. Mr E R Sekhonyane admitted the situation was  serious but said the chances of resolving it were good. "I  don't even want to think of a coup," he told SAPA after a  meeting with Mr Botha at the home of South Africa's Ambassador  Gerhard Visser.    Mr Botha, speaking after his first round of talks, stressed  the region could not afford more conflict and disruption.  Southern Africa would end up being ignored by the First World  if it didn't get its house in order, he said.    Resolution of the issue depended largely on goodwill from  all  sides, Mr Botha said. He warned even such a seemingly small  issue as a pay dispute could blow up into a major problem:  "Don't even start a small fire. You don't know how much dry  grass there is around," Mr Botha said.    Both Mr Botha and Lesotho Foreign Minister Molapo Qhobela  were at pains to point out Mr Botha's visit was at the request  of Maseru. "The prospects are good of resolving this thing,"  Foreign Minister Molapo Qhobela said. "We've had a coup before,  and it would be silly if the people of Lesotho were now to have  another."    He pointed out that all the country's political parties had  issued a joint statement on Friday calling on the disgruntled  soldiers to lay down their arms. "This little problem can be  resolved," Mr Qhobela said.    Mr Botha is scheduled to fly back to Pretoria around 5PM on  Saturday.</p>

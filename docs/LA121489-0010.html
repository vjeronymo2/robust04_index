			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ALHAMBRA MAY EXEMPT BINGO FROM SMOKING BAN  </P> <P> Responding to a drop in attendance at bingo games sponsored by a local church  and temple, the Alhambra City Council Monday night voted to consider exempting  such games from the city's ban on smoking in public places.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for St. Therese Church and Temple Beth Torah said that shortly after  the Alhambra smoking ban took effect in July, attendance at their fund-raising  bingo games began tumbling.  </P> <P> Under the proposed ordinance, bingo games conducted on private property and  sponsored by religious groups or charitable organizations would qualify for the  exemption. Also, bingo sponsors would have to install smoke reducers in the  ceiling and provide smoke-filtering ashtrays. If the bingo room has more than  40 players, at least 25% of the seats must be reserved for nonsmokers. A final  vote on the exemption is scheduled Jan. 8.  </P></p>

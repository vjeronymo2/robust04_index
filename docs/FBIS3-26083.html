			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Shi Qingbin (2457 3237 1755)] </F>   [Text] Nanning, 23 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Lei Yu,  vice chairman of the Guangxi Autonomous Region Government, said:  The volume of border trade between Guangxi and Vietnam exceeded  2.3 billion yuan last year. Standing at over 1 billion yuan,  export volume was slightly more than the import volume. As the  Vietnamese side continuously raised import tariff rates for  Chinese goods at the second half of last year, it is now more  difficult to carry out border trade than it was before. Guangxi  plans to turn the focus of economic cooperation with Vietnam to  upgrading Vietnam's outdated enterprises.    In reply to reporters' questions a few days ago, Lei Yu  said:  Now that Vietnam is engaging in post-war reconstruction and  conducting reform and opening up, Guangxi has become the most  favorable place in China to do business with Vietnam. In his  view, trade contacts between the two countries are beneficial to  both parties and some of the outstanding issues in border trade  can be resolved through consultation.    Lei pointed out: In the past, when China and Vietnam had  intimate relations, China helped Vietnam build a large number of  industrial projects. The equipment of these enterprises is now  very old and needs to be renovated, while China's manufacturing  technology, managerial expertise, and equipment technology are  most suitable to the existing level in Vietnam. Guangxi is  currently holding talks with Vietnam on helping them renovate  those projects.    Lei disclosed: Guangxi has successfully helped Vietnam  upgrade a chemical fertilizer plant, expanding the plant's  annual production capacity from 20,000 metric tons to 100,000  metric tons. It has also helped them build a fairly large  modern market in Haiphong, Vietnam. Moreover, Guangxi plans to  hold a commodity fair in Ho Chi Minh City very soon to further  promote Chinese products in Vietnam.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Hype in a downbeat market: Rock concert promoters fear the new Phoenix festival may add to their woes AS THE rock groups get ready to plug in their guitars this weekend for the launch of Phoenix, a new open-air pop festival to be staged on an airfield site at Marston, Stratford-upon-Avon, the nervous promoters will be reaching for their calculators and balance sheets. Two years of recession have left much of Britain's already volatile pop business feeling decidedly downbeat. Although this latest festival, launched at a cost of Pounds 1.2m, seems likely to be a financial success pop pundits fear the emergence of a third weekend festival on the British summer music scene could add to promoters' woes. In the cut-throat world of pop, hard data on the health of the business is elusive. Nevertheless, most promoters admit takings have dropped by at least 20 per cent in the past two years. While a few of the bigger promoters have expanded in spite of recession, and the biggest concerts can still realise a turnover of more than Pounds 1m in a single night, many of the smaller promoters are struggling. Audiences have dropped in most venues, from the 2,000-a-night-ticket club to giants like the 72,000 seater Wembley Arena. But ticket prices have barely risen, after a rapid surge at the end of the 1980s. Part of the promoters' problem stems from longer-term trends. While the teenage population is shrinking the music scene is becoming fragmented and undermined by an increase in home entertainment. Mr Martin Corrie, press officer for the Wembley complex in London, says: 'The actual number of bands performing is not necessarily down, but the tendency is for shorter runs. Whereas in the past a band might have played for five nights, now they only play for three nights.' He says Wembley Stadium is staging just four all-day 'mega' concerts this year, compared with 13 last year, with a 20 per cent reduction in the number of concerts staged in the smaller Wembley Arena. Mr Corrie says that like other large promoters Wembley has successfully filled the gap in concert demand by staging non-pop events. Smaller promoters rarely have the flexibility to do this. And with all promoters reporting late ticket sales, the margins are tighter. Mr Paul Hutton of pop promotors Metropolis Music says: 'People have less money in their pocket so they don't decide to go to a show until later in the day. It makes it harder with your cashflows and harder to gauge your advertising.' Metropolis Music promotes about 250 concerts a year at medium-sized venues in London. Mr Hutton, like most promoters, estimates that he needs to have at least 85 per cent capacity at his venues before breaking even, making him dependant on a last-minute surge in ticket sales. Many promoters insist the downturn in audience numbers is natural in a business which is cyclical and open to fashion changes. Indeed, the success of the huge Glastonbury Festival earlier this summer has left some believing that the worst of the recession in the pop business is over. 'If you've got the right bands you can still make money,' says Mr Paul Waldren of the Flying Music company, which is gearing up to promote Prince at Wembley next month. 'It's just a question of picking them.' But with more and more festivals on the scene, some promoters believe bands and audiences are being spread too thinly. Consequently it is harder for the smaller club venues to compete - not least because festivals are often more lucrative than tours for the bands. Mr David McLean, of River Man, promoters of small London club venues, says: 'The festivals make it harder for the smaller clubs because the bands end up playing there. And if you've got 18 bands playing in one place a lot of the fans will think that's better value too.' Some promoters have responded to audience uncertainty by moving up-market. Wembley Arena promoters have, for example, planned future business around the over-thirties. It believes this audience will still attend concerts - many of the big bands promoted over the past year are names familiar from the 1970s. Upgrading Wembley Arena's facilities recently cost Pounds 60m - with extra toilets, sound systems, merchandising stalls and up-market catering installed. Mr Danny Betesh, of Kennedy Street Enterprises, also believes that it is the older pop fan who could sustain the business. 'The older audiences tend to have higher disposable income,' he says, adding that one of his most successful events in recent months was a 'Solid Silver Sixties tour'. Others fear this growing conservatism could backfire on the industry. Mr Chris Lysett, head of live music on BBC Radio 1, says: 'There's not a lot of new stuff coming through. The bands that emerged in the 1980s have all rather fizzled out.' The Phoenix organisers, who expect an average audience age of 17, insist there is still a market for new bands - like Pop Will Eat Itself and New Fast Automatic Daffodils. Nevertheless, as a sign of the times, the festival is hedging its bets and offering jazz and Shakespeare shows along with the more up-beat music.</p>

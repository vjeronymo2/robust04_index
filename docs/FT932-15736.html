			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: Directors' pay doubled at Hillsdown HILLSDOWN Holdings, the food group which made a retained loss of nearly Pounds 60m last year, paid its directors twice as much as in 1991. The increase in their remuneration from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 4m last year included a Pounds 490,000 bonus for Mr David Newton, chief executive, bringing his total pay to Pounds 752,000. The company said the bonus was for five years' 'performance related services' in Canada, mainly working on Maple Leaf Foods. He had been sent there for six months in 1987, when he was 'grossly underpaid compared with Canadian counterparts.' He ended up staying until 1992, by which time profits had tripled - albeit from a low base - and CDollars 380m (Pounds 199m) debt had been turned into CDollars 200m cash. Mr Newton was one of three Hillsdown executives paid more than Pounds 300,000 last year whereas only one achieved that level in 1991. Six were paid more than Pounds 255,000, compared with three the previous year. Apart from higher levels of pay, the total bill was pushed up by greater numbers on the board - 12 instead of nine. It was a year of change. Sir Harry Solomon, co-founder and chairman, devolved the chief executive role to Mr Newton and announced that Sir John Nott, joint deputy chairman, would become executive chairman at the forthcoming annual meeting on April 29. There was also a change of finance director; and Mr Barry Legg, company secretary, left the board - with a Pounds 200,000 severance payment - after becoming Tory MP for Milton Keynes South West. The management shake-up has accompanied a move to sell or close less profitable parts of the group, shedding about 10 per cent of its Pounds 4.37bn turnover. A Pounds 92.3m extraordinary provision was made in the 1992 results to cover the reorganisation. Pre-tax profits fell 17 per cent to Pounds 154.1m.</p>

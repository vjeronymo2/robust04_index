			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Iron fist and an iron glove: Yeltsin has won the first round in his struggle, but can he hold Russia together Handsome, bluff and straight, grey-haired but young for a politician, acting President Alexander Rutskoi played his part well. Late Thursday night in the Russian parliament, he took the podium and struck the right note, patriotic but not rabid: 'This is not an assault on the deputies and the parliament: it is an assault on the citizens of Russia, on their children and grandchildren. Each of you stand before a choice - to defend, or not to defend, your rights, your statehood, your future.' But he spoke to one of the smaller audiences of his political life. Before him sprawled little more than half the full complement of the Congress of People's Deputies. Inside the White House, a few television monitors gave a fixed, fuzzy picture of the parliamentary chairmen on the podium, with the acting president on the rostrum, speaking into a void. No TV or radio channel broadcast his words (a sign of the still supine nature of the Russian media); his aides and colleagues had to scrounge time on reporters' mobile telephones to make calls, because the phones are shut off. A number of leading centrist deputies - such as Mr Yevgeny Ambartsumov, head of the foreign affairs committee, and Mr Viktor Stepashin, former head of the security committee - had resigned their mandate rather than, when push finally came to shove, stand with parliament: two have already been rewarded with ministerial jobs. Many more simply did not come to Moscow, their enthusiasm for defending the present constitutional order deflated by having to pay their own air fares once their free travel privileges had been stripped from them. That which, in a settled democratic country, would have been an outrage is here accepted by the majority as a welcome end to an empty confrontation, a natural response by the presidential power in the Kremlin to provocation. Even the deputies seemed so little possessed of a sense of themselves as a critical element in a civil society that they could neither invest the situation with great meaning nor make - so far - sensible strategic decisions on reversing their own descent into nullity. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the real president in possession of the Kremlin, has clearly won this week's first round. Buttressed by the military, the interior and the security forces, assured of the allegiance of the central bank and the procurator general (the state prosecutor), his government actively supportive and busy with orders, plans and initiatives, he could leave the parliamentarians to stew while, yesterday, he conferred with his fellow Commonwealth heads of state on how best to bring their economies into line. The sudden deference to him is almost stifling: in a revival of pre-Gorbachevian Soviet practice, Moscow Spartak, current premier football league leaders, released a statement expressing their support for and trust in their president. Mr Yeltsin acted as he did for reasons which are still opaque. What is clear is that the basic dilemma he faced - the inability to bring in a new constitutional and parliamentary order without ripping through the old one - had been long discussed, and the declaration of presidential rule foreshadowed as long ago as March, in a TV speech. More recently, he has been under strong pressure from the US and other Group of Seven leading industrial countries, together with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, to put order in the country's finances. Some senior western officials believe this pressure has been crucial in assisting him to make up his mind to act decisively. Finally, he is a man of emotion and impulse. In speeches last weekend, both Mr Rutskoi and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, launched tirades of abuse at Mr Yeltsin - the latter going so far as to call him a drunkard. According to two separate presidential advisers, this was crucial in tipping the scale as to when to act - even as many of these advisers, including Mr Yegor Gaidar whom he last week reinstated as first deputy prime minister, pleaded with him to delay. Thus he promulgated his fateful decree 'on step-by-step constitutional reform in the Russian Federation'. The central concept in this, as in his address to the people on Tuesday night, was that formal constitutional bars could no longer be allowed to inhibit the rapid creation of the mechanisms of a new state and economic order. To give this decree coherence, Mr Yeltsin had to represent the parliament as the single, malevolent hurdle to the country's progress. Aided by the media and a largely supportive, or unconcerned, populace, he has achieved this aim. He is now in the position of many of his predecessors who led Russia, both tsars and commissars, who claimed and genuinely thought, perhaps, that their enlightened or patriotic action in suppressing internal dissent set the stage for a healthy development of society. They then found themselves in a position where fear of a resumption of dissent, coupled with the discovery that authoritarian government is simpler than the democratic kind, led them to justify their continuing tyranny as the only antidote to chaos. 'Yeltsin is appealing to Russians' fear of an interregnum without clear leadership,' said Dr Jana Howlett, a lecturer in Russian history at Cambridge university. 'For them the most terrible times have been associated with internal dissent rather than external attack.' Mr Yeltsin's special claim is that he will use his temporarily untrammelled authority to break, not confirm, the vicious cycle, of Russian history: that he will, finally, use state power to break the state of ever again having too much power. If he has round his neck the oppressive weight of the Russian past, he has at least the pacific example of his predecessor, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, who gave up power with an ill grace but clean hands, and the pressure of foreign states whose open purses he still needs. He also has his own instincts, which to date have usually pushed him in a liberal direction. Indeed, those closest to him worry more that he is too soft than that he will be too hard. Mr Victor Smoryagin, one of the president's advisers on regional policy, said this week that 'with the president it can be less of the iron fist in the velvet glove than the velvet fist in the iron glove'. The president has before him a range of daunting barriers. The best he can hope for, or that his country can hope for from him, is that he will prevail in part, or at least not retreat. Nothing he has done this week has helped the economy - indeed, the one stable part of it, the rouble-dollar rate, has slipped, and the rouble is falling heavily once more. The signing of an economic union treaty yesterday with most of the leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States is likely to put further strain on Russia's budget - if it works. He has wars on and inside his frontiers, terrible collapse in health and other vital services, an unparalleled rise of violent crime in big cities and a continuing fall in the output of oil, his one sure earner of hard currency. Yet his greatest task is elsewhere. It is keeping the Russian Federation together. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the first-declared of the serious candidates who will challenge him for the presidency if elections are held next June, said yesterday: 'Yeltsin is in something of the same position as Gorbachev was in 1991. He has the same problem - to stop the disintegration of the country. That disintegration is a reality, it is going on.' Republics and regions, having been given some autonomy from Moscow, have taken even more as they have sensed the centre's weakness. The 'diamond state' of Yakutia (re-named Sakha) has simply withheld taxes. In neighbouring Irkutsk region, although the politicians have stepped back from that extreme, they voice the same resentments: 'Moscow can no longer decide everything from so far away,' says Mr Victor Ignatenko, head of the region's parliament. This 'freedom' does not mean greater economic freedom. In practice, the local administrative and political classes seek to recreate a socialist state in miniature - with ministries controlling various sectors and investment coming from state, not private, funding. Thus the reformists in the federal cabinet find themselves thwarted as soon as their decrees leave their desks - by officials and politicians who find them a threat and who are no longer sufficiently frightened by Moscow's power to carry out its orders. The regions, ranked lower in the constitutional pecking order than the autonomous republics in Mr Yeltsin's proposed constitution, are demanding equality of treatment: the republics want to preserve their privileges; both want to keep their resources, and continue to receive subsidies. 'Can we allow this (inequality)?' asks Mr Ivan Zelent, deputy chairman of the Irkutsk regional council. 'If we say the republics are sovereign, then we need to divide everything up - army, budget, citizenship rights. Our country must be fully federal and not just in words, as now.' The worst scenario - which Mr Yavlinsky evokes - is of a disintegration so extreme that a kind of industrial feudalism overtakes Russia - with regional army commanders allying with politicians and business or criminal circles to declare full sovereignty, to set themselves up as 'national governments' and to begin the systematic plunder of whatever riches the region/state offers. Something of the kind has already happened in Chechnya, in the Russian North Caucasus: while republics like Tatarstan, Bashkiria, Yakutia and others, along with regions which are now declaring themselves as republics to enjoy greater benefits, are now far down the path of self-rule - too far for rational coexistence within a federal state. It is this process, above all else, to which Mr Yeltsin must put a stop. It will entail manoeuvres of a Machiavellian (and economically irrational) kind, coupled with the use of both the iron fist and the iron glove, and the promotion of Russia as once again a state within which the regions and republics could feel valued. He has volunteered to carry the burden, saying he will again stand for the presidency even though it is, as he put it yesterday, 'inconvenient'. Yet it is not at all obvious that he is the man for the job ahead. He has taken further the great work started by Mr Gorbachev of destroying the communist system. The latter carelessly lost the Communist party, the system's political base, and Mr Yeltsin has largely torn the heart out of its economic mechanism, the central-command economy and the parliament linked to it. But to create a different order may be, for this very considerable man, to reach beyond his grasp.</p>

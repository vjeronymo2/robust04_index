			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Paris and Algiers During the past month the situation in Algeria has continued to get worse, and France has become more deeply embroiled in it. On August 3, five French citizens were killed in Algiers, in an attack for which the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) claimed responsibility. The GIA is a radical group which has been winning supporters from the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) since 1992, when the army intervened to cancel elections in which the FIS was about to win an overall majority. The killing happened in Algeria, but the French government reacted by clamping down on suspected Islamic militants in France. At the same time Mr Charles Pasqua, the French interior minister, complained that other western governments had failed to act against people 'who claim to be official representatives of the FIS' on their territory - a criticism not surprisingly rejected by the governments concerned. By arresting Islamic militants in France, Mr Pasqua risks drawing the conflict on to French soil. He has also declared his full support for the regime in Algeria. The choice there, according to him, 'lies between the capacity of the present regime to control the situation and the arrival of the fundamentalists in power'. Mr Pasqua thus trespassed on the domain of his colleague Alain Juppe, minister of foreign affairs, whose view of the situation in Algeria is rather more nuanced. A year ago Mr Juppe said that the status quo there was 'not tenable', and that security measures alone could not offer a solution. He advocates opening 'a political perspective', by preparing for new elections. He also indignantly rejects the notion that France's position is one of 'unconditional support' for the Algerian authorities. But he is not ready to attach political conditions to France's financial aid, by insisting on respect for human rights and a genuine dialogue with all opposition parties, as other western governments have suggested. France's dislike of violence is entirely justified, and its fear of an Islamic regime in Algeria is understandable. What it has to face up to is that the counter-violence of the present Algerian regime offers no guarantee of avoiding such an outcome, while the longer it goes on the bloodier and more unmanageable the denouement is likely to be. For that, western governments will share the responsibility so long as they do not make their aid strictly conditional on the start of a political process which offers a credible hope of ending the violence: an amnesty, followed by free elections under international supervision. Meanwhile, for Mr Pasqua to import the conflict into France, effectively targeting France's largest racial minority, is rightwing populist politics of the worst sort. Race relations in general, and relations between Moslems and other communities in particular, are bad enough in western Europe as it is.</p>

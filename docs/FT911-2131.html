			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Arts: Manon Lescaut - Bastille, Paris The amount of opera available in Paris this season is astonishing. In terms of quantity, at least, the city is currently the world's most varied operatic emporium. Rarities and novelties of all kinds find outlets at the Chatelet, pro the Champs-Elysees and the Opera-Comique. At the new Bastille theatre, in its first full season, a groundplan of repertory works is being fulfilled. After Otello, Figaro, Berio's Un re in ascolto, and Queen of Spades comes the Puccini Manon Lescaut; Samson et Dalila, Flute and Katya Kabanova follow shortly. The list is an intelligent piece of bread-and-butter planning; the early Puccini opera, a copious lyrical outpouring of youthful passions, is just the sort of work to set a large theatre Italianately ringing the way opera audiences love it to do. At a Manon Lescaut performance in the middle of the run, a uniquely depressing and alarming experience, that seemed the foremost problem: the theatre doesn't allow ringing. The acoustics have been the source of controversy since it was opened, but there can surely be no disagreement over the wrong-end-of-the-telescope reductive impact they are forcing on Puccini's vocal lines. Placed anywhere but at the very front of that incommodiously broad, deep stage, the singers are audible  - but as if their voices were coming in on the breeze from the next quartier. As in this unevenly shaped, narratively zigzagging opera it is in the vocal outbursts, solo or duet, that dramatic impetus is most strongly sustained, it is impossible to exaggerate the cumulatively disastrous effect of the acoustics on the voices and on the opera. Puccini distanced, Puccini prevented from hitting a listener smack in the solar plexus, is Puccini denatured; the orchestral sound is clear, if not exactly ripe in bloom, but from pit and stage no sort of musical blend or even balance seems possible. As if in covert admission of all the theatre's self-generated handicaps, the production by Robert Carsen seeks to plump out the stage with huge, glitzy spectacle. The stage is at almost all times chock-full of supers - Mardi Gras revellers wearing gaudy capes and carrying huge umbrellas, perruqued and white-powdered courtiers at the stage margins, Act 2 servants in endless formations. The designs (by Anthony Ward) suggest touches of theatrical avant-garderie (with mirrors, huge falling drapes, skewed walls) without making the audience nervous; the tricks of novelty in the staging do likewise. It's the latest form of what Brecht deemed 'culinary' entertainment. Since the production bears surtitles in French and English, and is shared with Antwerp, it's also, I would say, International Opera in its most worrying incarnation: opera that looks good, means nothing, can be taken from house to house, and is capable of supporting a procession of unrehearsed singers without much damage. For the Manon Lescaut run the house had planned alternate casts, but on this occasion there were substitutes - unexplained - for those alternates: the conductor Nello Santi was replaced by Maurizio Barbacini, the tenor Vasile Moldoveanu by Antonio Ordonez. In the circumstances, it was something of a miracle that things held together as well as they did (Mr Barbacini is obviously a conductor worth trying out in better-ordered conditions); one saluted the professionalism of Patrick Raftery (Lescaut), and the trenchant delivery of Ian Caley (Edmondo) and Jules Bastin (Geronte): no holding their voices back] I had been looking forward to a first hearing of Ordonez, a Spanish tenor who burst on the European scene a few years ago; the timbre is plangently appealing, but the loud high phrases are all in overdrive, and on this occasion he simply ran out of them in Act 3. The heroine was Barbara Daniels. She is what the Italians call a vero artista: a performer who communicates warmth and engagement, a sense of the words, a feeling for the musical style. In these disconnected circumstances her Manon came across in eye- and ear-catching bursts, not all of a piece; but at least she came across. It is time for those in charge at the Bastille to stop pussyfooting about. The scale of the acoustical problems is immense, and no earthly purpose is served by the continuing denial of their existence.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- A former Diet member of  Komeito was questioned in court Thursday [20 January] as the  first of two politicians indicted in the 1989 Recruit  stocks-for-favors scandal.    Katsuya Ikeda, 56, a former House of Representatives  legislator of Komeito, which is now in the ruling coalition, was  questioned by his defense council and prosecutors at the Tokyo  District Court about his alleged involvement in the scandal. He  denied all the charges against him.    In May 1989, prosecutors indicted Ikeda without arresting  him, on charges of receiving 5,000 unlisted shares of Recruit  Cosmos, a real estate company, and 7 million yen in cash from  Hiromasa Ezoe, founder and then chairman of Recruit Co., a major  publisher of job information magazines, in September 1986. The  shares appreciated considerably after being listed.    Ikeda is accused of taking the shares and the money in  return  for acting on the firm's behalf in the Diet in 1984 and 1985,  when a "gentlemen's agreement" that companies fix the date to  recruit university graduates was on the verge of becoming a  titular accord.    Ikeda said his Diet questioning was not done on behalf of  the  firm.    In response to his defense council's questioning on the  issue, Ikeda said he already had an interest in problems of job  placement for university students before he was asked by Recruit  to bring up the issue in the Diet as asserted by prosecutors.    Ikeda said he began to have an interest in the job placement  accord around 1977 just after becoming a member of the lower  house and had a recognition the accord would be difficult to  observe.    Along with Ikeda, then Chief Cabinet Secretary Takao  Fujinami  of the then ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was indicted  in the influence-peddling scandal.    Fujinami is being tried on charges of receiving Recruit  Cosmos shares before their flotation as a bribe from Ezoe, 57,  for similar favors to the firm.    The stocks-for-favors scandal involved secretaries or  relatives of LDP heavyweights such as former Premiers Yasuhiro  Nakasone, Noboru Takeshita, Kiichi Miyazawa and former Foreign  Minister Michio Watanabe.    Takeshita, then prime minister, and Miyazawa, then finance  minister, were forced to resign because of the scandal.</p>

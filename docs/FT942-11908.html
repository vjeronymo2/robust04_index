			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Bank of England share settlement system faces delay The Bank of England yesterday acknowledged that its timetable for speeding share settlement will not be met. It said the second phase of the project to introduce paperless settlement would be delayed, it hoped by no more than six months. The Bank indicated that the cost of the system, Crest, might be higher than expected. It announced a 'cap' on Crest's cost of Pounds 35m, compared with an initial estimate of Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m. Crest is intended to replace the London Stock Exchange's failed Taurus system. However the Stock Exchange's request to be a significant minority shareholder in Crest was rebuffed, although the Bank said that the exchange could still be chosen as the 'operator' of Crest. The operation of Crest, set for 1996, requires a large reduction in the number of days between the striking of a bargain and receipt of the shares or payment for them. From July 18, share transactions will settle 10 days after bargains are struck, but the Bank had planned to move to a five-day gap from next January. It will decide by year end when 'Trade Date Plus Five' should be phased in. 'I expect it will be in the first half of 1995. If it is any later than that I will be very disappointed,' said Mr Pen Kent, associate director of the Bank of England who is spearheading the project. The Stock Exchange said yesterday that it 'understands that the Bank is not in a position to offer participation in the ownership structure on the basis of a significant minority interest, as proposed'. However, it will be a member of a consultative committee advising the Bank of England-appointed board and will consider whether a small shareholding is still appropriate. Large Stock Exchange members have supported its application but fund managers and bankers have been concerned that a large stake would give it undue influence over Crest which it could use to advance its own interests. The Bank said yesterday that 50 City institutions had signed up to become Crest shareholders and that it was extending the deadline for additional shareholders by one month. While these shareholders will not have a direct vote in the ultimate design of Crest, the Bank will appoint a 'shadow board' of representatives of some shareholder companies who will make key decisions. The Bank will not be legally obligated to follow the wishes of the shadow board but will be minded to abide by its recommendations. Share settlement system shows results, Page 10 Lex, Page 22</p>

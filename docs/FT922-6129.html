			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Komatsu hit by housing slump KOMATSU, the Japanese construction equipment manufacturer, has reported a 50.6 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax earnings to Y41.9bn (Dollars 324.8m) for the fiscal year ending March 31. The profit slide and a 7 per cent decline in sales to Y919.8bn were blamed on weak demand for construction equipment in Japan, the US and Europe as housing starts were hit hard by recession. Komatsu predicted that pre-tax profits would level off at Y42bn in the current fiscal year on higher sales of Y950bn, while net profit would increase to Y15bn from Y10.9bn. Sales of construction equipment, which account for almost two-thirds of total sales, fell by 12.3 per cent to Y579bn. However Komatsu recorded sales growth in other business areas that it has been developing in an attempt to diversify. Revenues from industrial machinery, including machine tools, rose by 1.5 per cent to Y87.9bn. Turnover in the electronics division climbed by 7.5 per cent to Y54.9bn, while civil engineering and construction services increased by 11 per cent to Y86.2bn due to the steady expansion of public sector projects.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RALPHS AND LUCKY SCRAP FREQUENT-SHOPPER PLANS  </P> <P> A yearlong test program to reward loyal grocery shoppers with rebates or  merchandise is being discontinued by the Ralphs and Lucky supermarket chains.  </P> <P> Two Eastern supermarket chains are also ending limited testing of  frequent-shopper programs run by Catalina Marketing Corp. of Anaheim. After an  initial surge of customer enthusiasm, shoppers lost interest when they realized  how slowly they were earning bonuses on the system, said Al Marasca, executive  vice president of marketing for Ralphs Grocery Co.  </P> <P> "We tested the program because it seemed to be a program that made sense,"  Marasca said. But compared to some of the chain's other promotional programs,  "the customers told us that this was just not a big deal."  </P> <P> Customers at four Ralphs stores and four Lucky stores in Southern California  were given plastic identification cards with a bar code on the back that  identified the shoppers. A scanner links the customer to purchases made and  rewards him or her with rebates or points toward the purchase of merchandise --  much as a frequent flyer piles up airline mileage toward free travel.  </P> <P> Dan Granger of Catalina Marketing said the test was due to lapse at the end of  September, after being extended three months. Also discontinuing the test are  the Giant and Pathmark chains in the East.  </P> <P> "It was just a test of some ideas," Granger said. "We've learned a lot, and  they did also."  </P> <P> Granger said the frequent-shopper program was a tiny part of Catalina  Marketing's business. The company is best known for its electronic coupon  dispensers that spit out cents-off coupons right at the register.  </P> <P> "We have 3,300 grocery stores across the country doing checkout coupons as well  as over 400 in Southern California," he said. "Quite frankly, it doesn't impact  the rest of our business."  </P> <P> The program at all four grocery chains, including operating costs and  merchandise awarded, ran up a tab of roughly $1 million through March, he said.

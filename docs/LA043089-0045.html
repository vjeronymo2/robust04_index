			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A black trade union is seeking to stop the sale of Mobil Corp. assets in South  Africa until it negotiates a disinvestment procedure providing job security and  other benefits, the union said. The Chemical Workers Industrial Union, which  represents 1,200 of Mobil's 1,500 South African black workers, said it applied  for relief to the Industrial Court, a government labor tribunal. Mobil said it  is selling its operations to General Mining Union Corp. Ltd. "Far from being  moral or politically progressive, Mobil has seriously disadvantaged its work  force by selling to one of the most notoriously anti-union South African  corporations," a union statement said. However, Mobil has said General Mining  agreed to honor all existing labor agreements.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S HUNTING SEASON IN WESTWOOD AS FANS GO AFTER THE BRUINS  </P> <P> The only consistency that Coach Terry Donahue and his staff seem to have is  their inconsistency. They fail to motivate their teams, fail to effectively  alter game plans, and fail to win games when they are overwhelming favorites.  </P> <P> Calling for that field goal, which left the team vulnerable to a one-point  loss, tells it all. Don't tell me about the seven straight bowl wins. Tell me  about two straight USC losses, leading to losing the Rose Bowl bid.  </P> <P> HY GLASS, Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INJURIES REDUCE UCLA'S CHANCES FOR GYMNASTICS TITLE  </P> <P> With three All-American seniors leading the way, the UCLA women's gymnastics  team had hoped that 1990 would be its year to win a national championship.  </P> <P> The Bruins have finished in the top three the past three seasons, and last year  lost to Georgia by only .05 of a point.  </P> <P> But injuries to two key performers will make their quest difficult when the  NCAA West Regional begins tonight at 7 at UCLA's John Wooden Center.  </P> <P> The Bruins, ranked No. 6, will play host to No. 7 Oregon State, No. 12 Cal  State Fullerton, No. 16 Washington, No. 25 Boise State, No. 26 California and  No. 32 Stanford.  </P> <P> In addition, seven individual all-around gymnasts from teams that did not  qualify will compete.  </P> <P> Jill Andrews, a two-time national champion, is the key for the Bruins. Andrews  is the nation's top all-around gymnast and vaulter, and is the Pacific 10  Conference gymnast of the year.  </P> <P> UCLA All-Americans Shawn McGinnis and Kim Hamilton both have ruptured foot  tendons and will miss the meet. Hamilton is a three-time national champion in  the floor exercise.  </P> <P> Lisa Dolan, a two-time All-American whose specialty is the balance beam, leads  Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> The West Regional is one of five nationwide. From these, 12 teams will be  selected to compete in the NCAA championships April 20-21 at Corvallis, Ore.  MARYANN HUDSON  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Georges Timmerman: ``Saudi Arabia Remains a Mega </F> Customer'']    [Text] Brussels 29 Dec -- Most of the 120 major weapons  shipments from the ports of Antwerp and Zeebrugge in recent  years have been destined for Saudi Arabia or the other Gulf  States.    Detailed information in DE MORGEN's possession shows that  between January 1991 and April 1993 more than 40 consignments of  Belgian weapons left for Saudi Arabia, seven went to Qatar, five  to Oman and five to the United Arab Emirates.    Mecar-Seneffe [subsidiary of Allied Research Associates]  mainly supplied smoke generators, igniters, percussion caps,  rifle grenades and mortar bombs to the Saudis. However, FN  Herstal [National Factory of Herstal] was the biggest supplier.    This company supplied hundreds of pallets of ammunition of  every caliber, automatic hand weapons, rifles, machine guns,  heavy machine guns, mortars, Kalashnikovs, hand grenades,  antitank projectiles, anti-aircraft artillery and components for  every type of other weapon.    The lists of arms shipments from our two sea harbors show  that a considerable share of Belgian arms exports were destined  for Third- World countries.    For example arms shipments went to Thailand (11 tonnes of  war  ammunition and 755 tonnes of components for 155-mm projectiles  from FN Herstal on 8 February 1991), Venezuela (2,000 rocket  motors and 1,560 rocket heads from Forges de Zeebruges on 12  February 1991, 13 tonnes of ammunition and projectiles on 31  December 1991), Chile (two 90-mm cannons with accessories from  Cockerill-Seraing on 14 May 1991 and 28 February 1992), Botswana  (some 7 tonnes of arms, components and bayonets from FN Herstal  on 19 September 1991), Taiwan (3 tonnes of arms and components  from FN Herstal on 14 January 1993, various shipments of rocket  motors from Forges de Zeebruges) and Indonesia (79 tonnes of  ball powder from PB Clermont on 13 December 1991).    Third-World countries were also massively supplied with  Belgian arms from Ostend and Zaventem airports.    To give a few examples: 945 kg of explosives, grenades, and  gas masks to Rwanda (6 January 1993), 14.9 tonnes of arms  components and ammunition to Dubai (28 April 1991), 144 kg of  arms to Singapore (29 July 1991), 325 kg of mortars to Zaire (4  December 1991), more than 5 tonnes of arms and accessories to  Jordan (25 March 1992), 425 kg of ammunition to Burkina Faso (23  April 1992), 320 kg of arms to Brazil (24 September 1992), and 9  tonnes of ammunition and 22 tonnes of explosive to Somalia (19  December 1992).</p>

Fedorov himself declined to give any information concerning  his own plans.    It's not clear whether Fedorov will join the number of the  new deputy premiers or remain as finance minister.    In the meantime Interfax learned from Russia's prominent  banking circles that for them Fedorov symbolizes reforms in  Russia, and that his withdrawal from the highest government  echelons may come to be viewed as a symptom of the possibility  that the direction of economic reforms in Russia might change.</p>

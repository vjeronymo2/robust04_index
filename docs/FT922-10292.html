			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Whitehall faces strike vote LEADERS of the NUCPS Civil Service union are to ballot their 110,000 members on industrial action, including strikes, over a proposed radical shake-up of Whitehall pay. The government has offered a 4.45 per cent cost-of-living award, plus performance-related pay and regrading said to be worth 0.3 per cent. Rules governing Civil Service pay involve a minimum settlement of 4.5 per cent this year. The Treasury yesterday improved its offer from 4.1 per cent after the NUCPS indicated it would reject it. Mr Leslie Christie, NUCPS general secretary, said: 'My national executive council is not prepared to sign an agreement which signals the end of national bargaining and removes the expectation of annual pay increments as of right.' The CPSA union, which represents 125,000 civil servants in clerical grades, is understood to be expecting a cost-of-living award of less than 4 per cent, plus performance pay. Earlier this year the two unions indicated that they would seek compensation for changes in pay bargaining structures that are demanded by the Treasury. The changes are aimed at extending performance-related pay and increasing the scope for government departments to opt out of centralised pay bargaining.</p>

In a free and easy  atmosphere, the minister briefed journalists about the problems  with which the personnel of Ukraine's Armed Forces are  confronted. Analyzing the past year, the minister listed, among  positive aspects, the fact that the Armed Forces have finally  received their Military Doctrine, specified their numerical  strength, and appointed Armed Forces Day -- 6 December. Over  the last year, the Supreme Council, president, and government  issued about 100 laws, decrees, edicts, and directive dealing  with the army. Temporary statutes for the troops were adopted.    Much has been done for the reduction of the Armed Forces.  While at the end of 1991, there were 726,000 military  formations, their number has now decreased by one-third. The  reduction will continue. By the end of 1995, the Armed Forces  will have 450,000 servicemen.    By now, 603 tanks, 630 infantry fighting vehicles [IFV] and  armored personnel carriers, as well as 750 helicopters and  aircraft have been scrapped. By the end of 1995, Ukraine will  have up to 4,080 tanks, 5,050 IFV, 4,040 units of artillery, and  1,090 aircraft.    Ukraine is fulfilling a peace-keeping mission in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Recently, the Supreme Council adopted a  decision to increase the numerical strength of the Ukrainian  battalion there to 1,220 persons. In this connection, yet  another battalion is being brought up to strength and contracts  are being concluded with servicemen. This means that  regular-service soldiers will not be enlisted for this  subdivision. The defense minister expressed surprise that  parents are asking their sons to be sent precisely to that  dangerous region.    "Perhaps, because their income is greater than yours,"  suggested one of the journalists.    The minister made a calculation: "If a soldier receives  between $500 and $600 a month, whereas the minister's salary is  $67, the reason for the enthusiasm may well be understood."    The army still has no single command system. When it is  created, and this will take place between 1995 and 1996, the  air-defense and air force troops will be unified.    At present, the army is in the process of introducing the  Ukrainian language. At any rate, the orderly officers in  subunits report in the state language, and the combat training  also proceeds with the help of the Ukrainian language. The  problem lies in assimilating the military terminology.    The minister fully supported the Ukrainian president's  concluding the tripartite agreement, because nuclear warheads  are deployed in our troops, but they are controlled and also  serviced outside Ukraine. Why should Ukraine need weapons,  which cannot help, but only create problems, which cannot be  resolved by us. Isn't it better to transfer them away from  Ukraine? All the more so since the state will receive  compensation for them.    At the same time, Ukraine remains a great space-missile  power. We have everything necessary for creating missiles, which  may be launched into space. We are capable of launching  artificial satellites for communication purposes, for  agricultural needs, and, it goes without saying, for resolving  military problems.    The minister also touched upon numerous questions of  military  building and answered journalists' questions.</p>

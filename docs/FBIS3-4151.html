"If I cannot  get my case handled in a proper way I will go to the Supreme  Court in Beijing," Dr Philip Cheng said yesterday in his first  public appearance since returning to the territory on Thursday  night. "I will fight to the end," he added.    Cheng, 64, remained optimistic he would win the civil  countersuit, launched against a Changsha court official and the  former general manager of a Hunan trade company. "I got my  passport back, so I think the court will do justice again," he  said. "I was involved in a business dispute so it should be  handled according to legal procedures."    Cheng yesterday gave further details of his seven-month  ordeal, in which he was first held in solitary confinement for  three days, then locked in a hotel for a week, after which he  was barred from leaving Changsha for a month and then in effect  prevented from leaving the country by having his United States  passport confiscated.    Eight local court officials detained Cheng in a Changsha  hotel last August after the Hunan Arts and Crafts Import and  Export Corporation accused him of breaking a contract to return  U.S.$165,000 (HK$1.27m) it had invested in his Zhuhai bicycle  helmet factory. According to Cheng, the Hunan company's former  general manager, Liu Xianyou, altered the date of the contract  to four months earlier and asked a local court official, Shen  Xiaoguan, to arrest him. "At five o'clock we signed the deal  and at six o'clock eight uniformed officers barged into the  hotel room saying I was being detained over a dispute regarding  the contract." he said. Hunan public security offcers were kept  out of the hotel by court officials when they came to  investigate the case, he said. "The court officials said:  `There's no one here.' And I was in a little room trying to  call for help," Cheng said.    Cheng said he hoped the suit would not be seen as a comment  on China's legal system or its reform policies. "The foreign  publicity helped me get out, but it can damage the reputation of  China and the Chinese people very much," said Cheng, a former  professor at the Chinese University who became a fulltime  businessman in 1991. "It is an isolated case perpetrated by a  small band of individuals who sought to bend the rules of  justice. What is most perplexing was the lack of influence even  senior officials in Beijing had over this little fiefdom ... We  need to examine why local Chinese officials are able to abuse  their powers to such an extent," he said.</p>

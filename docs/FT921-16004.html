			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / FT Law Report: Digest of Michaelmas Term cases SCALLY AND OTHERS v SOUTHERN HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES BOARD AND OTHERS (FT, October 30) The plaintiffs, who were medical practitioners employed in the Northern Ireland Health Service, were required to make contributions to a statutory superannuation scheme. To qualify for full pension, it was necessary to complete 40 years' service but they did have the right to purchase 'added years' - a right which was only exercisable within a stipulated period. The plaintiffs claimed damages from their employer for failure to bring that right to their notice.  Upholding the decision of the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal, the House of Lords stated that it was necessary to imply an obligation on the employer to bring to his employee's notice the entitlement and that such an obligation would be implied when: (1) the terms of the contract of employment had not been negotiated with the individual employee but resulted from negotiation with a representative body or were otherwise incorporated by reference; (2) a particular term gave the employee a valuable right contingent on him taking action to avail himself of its benefit; (3) the employee could not, in all the circumstances, reasonably be aware of the term unless drawn to his attention. PRICE WATERHOUSE v BCCI HOLDINGS (LUXEMBOURG) SA AND OTHERS (FT, November 1) Price Waterhouse were appointed members of an investigation committee to investigate problem loans made by companies in the BCCI group. The Serious Fraud Office served notice on Price Waterhouse for the production of specified documents under the Criminal Justice Act 1987 and the Banking Act. In declaring that Price Waterhouse were not precluded by legal professional privilege from complying with the notices, Mr Justice Millett stated that legal professional privilege only attached to documents brought into existence for the purpose of litigation if that was the dominant purpose. However, in the instant case, the dominant purpose of the investigation was to determine the extent to which the problem loans were recoverable which was quite independent of the possible need to take recovery proceedings. Moreover, there was an important public interest in the effective regulation of authorised banking institutions and the Bank of England's power under section 39 of the Banking Act 1987 to obtain information overrode legal professional privilege and banking confidentiality. THE MARE (FT, November 5) Smit Internationale NV, together with its interrelated companies had entered into a policy which included liability for loss or damage to any property in connection with its activities anywhere in the world. STOS was a joint venture in which Smit Tak, a subsidiary of Smit Internationale, owned a 49 per cent interest. STOS had removed the wreck of a vessel on order of the Dubai government and contended that the removal was a liability within the meaning of policy. Mr Justice Sheen held that STOS had not been under a legal liability to remove the wreck and, in dismissing an appeal from that decision, the Court of Appeal stated that the fact that it was called an umbrella policy and was plainly designed to scoop up liabilities not covered by the underlying hull, war risks, and P&amp;I policies, did not mean that it gave STOS protection against all misfortunes not insured elsewhere. RE BRITISH &amp; COMMONWEALTH HOLDINGS PLC (FT, November 6) B&amp;C acquired Atlantic Computers plc for Pounds 420m and then put in another Pounds 117m. B&amp;C went into administration and Atlantic's statement of affairs showed a deficiency of assets of Pounds 279m. The administrators applied for an order for production of documents to them under section 23(2)(c) and (3) of the Insolvency Act 1986 and Mr Registrar Scott ordered S&amp;O, who were Atlantic's auditors, to produce any 'books, papers or other records in their possession custody or control' having any connection with the 1987 and 1988 audits of Atlantic, and with the acquisition. Allowing S&amp;O's appeal, for an order to inspect the administrator's statement filed in support of the application, the Court of Appeal stated that the order was in very wide terms. If S&amp;O were not allowed to inspect the statement so that they could scrutinise the basis on which the order was made and see whether its width was justified, the court might well be unable fairly to dispose of their application to have it set aside. PAN ATLANTIC GROUP INC AND OTHERS v HASSNEH INSURANCE CO OF ISRAEL LTD (FT, November 8) A reinsurance contract provided that all disputes were to be submitted to arbitrators who were to be 'disinterested executive officials of insurance or reinsurance companies'. Hassneh appointed an arbitrator who was an executive official of Mercantile and General Insurance Co but he retired from his position thereafter. The plaintiffs contested the validity of the appointment on the ground of his retirement. In holding that he was still qualified to act, both the court of first instance and the Court of Appeal stated that the qualification requirement related only to date of appointment.  Otherwise not only would an arbitrator in a long arbitration be inhibited from voluntary retirement lest that should render the arbitration null and void, but he would also be placed in an impossible position should he, for example, reach compulsory retirement age under his employers' regulations, or be made redundant against his will. EVIA LUCK (FT, November 12) The International Transport Workers' Federation had boarded the vessel Evia Luck at a Swedish port and had informed the master she would be 'blacked' unless the owner entered into ITF employment contracts with the crew. The owners agreed to pay the sums demanded and to sign the required documents. The owners claimed declarations that they had lawfully avoided all the contracts on the ground of duress, and claimed restitution of payments. At first instance, the ITF succeeded in its contention that the relevant system of law was Swedish law as the law of the country where the pressure was exerted and, under which, such pressure was lawful. Upholding the Court of Appeal's decision in favour of the shipowners that the proper law was English under which a contract induced by duress was voidable, the House of Lords stated that if a person entered into such a contract, he had for most purposes to accept the regime of the proper law of the contract; and if under that regime a particular form of conduct constituted duress, rendering the contract voidable - wherever the conduct occurred - he had to accept the consequences. MERCURY PUBLICITY LTD v WOLFGANG LOERKE GMbH (FT, November 13) Mercury, an English company, claimed monies due under a contract for a commercial agency relationship between it and Loerke, a German company. At first instance, Mercury's action was struck out under Article 5(1) of the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments 1968 on the ground that the exceptional rule in Ivenel v Schwab (1981) ECR 1981 applied, namely that in a contract of employment in which one contracting party might be at a disadvantage to the other, the court would look at the whole contract and the place where it was substantially to be performed, so as to ensure that the employee's position was properly protected. Loerke successfully contended for a wider application of the Ivenel rule to extend to a 'trade representative'. The Court of Appeal stated that Mercury had established a case that (a) the contract had established an independent relationship wholly different from that of employer/employee; (b) the Ivenel principle in Community law was restricted to cases of a personal nature in the master/servant relationship; and (c) in the contract's context and purpose, as well as its execution, the law most closely connected with the performance of the contract was English law. RE ARROWS LTD (FT November 15) The issue concerned the Serious Fraud Office's right to information that the liquidators wanted from an insolvent company's officer under section 236 of the Insolvency Act 1986. The liquidators wanted the court to direct that the examination would not be disclosed to the SFO. The SFO objected. Finding for the liquidators, Mr Justice Hoffmann stated that (1) it seemed wrong that the SFO should in that way be able to circumvent the protection given to the accused by section 2(8) that a statement might not be used in evidence against the examinee except inter alia in a prosecution for knowingly giving false information; and (2) unless the direction was given, the probability was that the examination would produce no useful inf ormation for the liquidators or the SFO. The balance came down clearly in favour of the direction being given and the SFO had nothing to lose.</p>

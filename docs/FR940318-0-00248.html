There are currently 17 listed State or local government entities in the RMP program with 34 devices. This number represents approximately 4% of all listed participants in the RMP. There are currently 39 individuals who are State or local government agency employees in the RCP. This number represents about 4.5% of all listed participants in the RCP. There is a direct benefit of having these individuals and governments in the EPA proficiency programs in terms of quality assurance. The Agency does not believe that this level of participation by State or local governments is a threat to the industry or would pose a burden to the other participants in the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Small Business Impacts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of comments suggested that EPA's fees would impose a significant burden on small businesses and stifle competition between smaller and larger firms within the radon industry. They went on to suggest that the Agency should consider a lower fee for smaller businesses or fees based on the volume of radon tests conducted annually. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA acknowledges that a significant number of firms affected by this rule can be considered small businesses under most definitions used by the Small Business Administration. About 90% of radon service providers have fewer than 10 employees. The Agency is concerned about the effects that this rule might have on small businesses, particularly in the current economic climate. This concern led EPA to establish its user fees at a level that will only recover 30% of its operating costs in the first year. Based on its economic analysis, EPA believes that the fee schedule promulgated in this final rule will not place an undue burden on small businesses, or provide an unfair advantage to large businesses. The Agency's phased approach to recovering its operating costs of the proficiency programs will allow small businesses to adjust to incremental increases in the fees, rather than having to absorb a fee set at a level sufficient to recover the Agency's full costs. In addition, EPA is continually looking for ways to reduce its operating costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Device-Based Fees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of comments suggested that the Agency establish fees on the basis of measurement methods, rather than measurement devices. For example, several comments recommended that program participants pay only one fee for testing a variety of devices within the electret method categories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The intent of this rule is to recover Agency costs associated with operating its proficiency programs. The RMP program requires testing each specific type of measurement device, within particular method categories. Conducting these tests is the single largest component of the RMP program's operating costs. For this reason, the Agency has decided to collect fees from organizations on the basis of the number of specific types of devices tested and not on the number of measurement methods used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C. Economic Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments also expressed concerns about the Agency's analysis of the economic impacts of its proposed rule. Specific comments focused on the methodologies used to determine program costs and industry impacts; equity issues within the industry; and, the long term effects of the Agency's fees on the radon industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency has considered these comments in preparing its new economic analysis of the final rule. For further explanation on the development of EPA's economic analysis for this final rule, see section V, ``Economic Impacts,'' and Economic Impact Analysis of the Radon Proficiency Program User Fee Rule, U.S. EPA/Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, November 17, 1993. Specific comments are addressed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Inadequate Sample Size <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments suggested that the survey used to determine the impacts of the fee on the radon industry was too small to adequately characterize potential effects of the fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the time of the survey used in the proposed rule, it was estimated that there would be approximately 800 companies participating in the RMP program with about 1,200 primary device applications and an estimated 6,000 secondary firms in the RMP program in the first year of fee collection. As of October 1991, there are approximately 600 primary participants with about 1,200 primary devices and about 1,000 secondary firms participating in the EPA RMP program. Of those organizations and individuals surveyed in 1989, approximately 63% are still participating in the EPA proficiency programs. The Agency believes that this survey data is still relevant and can be applied to the industry as it is today. Since the time of the proposed rule, the Agency has developed several data bases from elements of the RMP program application's supplemental data and from the RCP program. These data were used to validate the assumptions of the proposed rule and to develop models of ``typical'' radon firms used to further analyze the impacts of various fee levels on participation and program cost recovery. EPA believes that the sample size used to develop the final rule was adequate to assess the potential economic impacts of the various options considered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

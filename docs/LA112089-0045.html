			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAPD ASKS UNION TALKS ON RANDOM DRUG TESTING;  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCEMENT: LEAGUE MEMBERS TO BE POLLED BEFORE MANDATORY POLICY THAT WOULD  INCLUDE TOP BRASS IS ACCEPTED. PRESIDENT DOESN'T OPPOSE MOVE.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Department may soon get what its chief has been seeking  for the last several years -- mandatory random drug testing for all sworn  police officers, including top brass.  </P> <P> In its latest bid to implement such a policy, the department has submitted a  formal proposal to begin discussions on the issue with the city's largest  police union, whose leader said this week that he does not oppose such a move.  </P> <P> Lt. George Aliano, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, said,  however, that he wants any testing policy to be negotiated between the  department and the union to ensure adequate controls. The union, he said, must  first poll its 7,800 members to see if they would oppose opening negotiations  on their contract with the city, more than two years before it expires. If the  policy is immediately implemented, officials said, the LAPD will be the first  major California police department and one of only a handful in the nation to  have mandatory random testing of all officers.  </P> <P> Aliano said he suspects that Los Angeles police officers will support the  testing in the union poll, which he expects to be conducted over the next six  weeks.  </P> <P> "They want to show that they are drug-free just like everybody else," he said.  But "if my members felt strongly against reopening the contract, then I would  resist" the immediate implementation of the policy.  </P> <P> It is unclear how the LAPD will proceed if resistance is mounted. But Cmdr.  William Booth, a department spokesman, said it "would not change" the goal of  Chief Daryl F. Gates and other police officials to put the policy in place. He  said, however, that the department wants to comply with state labor laws that  require police management to "meet and confer" in good faith with the union  before making significant changes in its members' work conditions.  </P> <P> Department officials became more confident that their proposed policy could  withstand legal challenge after the U.S. Supreme Court last Monday declined to  hear a union challenge to the Boston Police Department's 3-year-old mandatory  random testing program.  </P> <P> "We said hallelujah" after hearing the news of the Supreme Court's action on  Monday, Booth said, "but our program and meet-and-confer action have been  moving in that direction for some time."  </P> <P> Aliano said he received the department's latest proposal two weeks ago. Chief  Gates, however, has been pushing for mandatory drug testing for at least three  years. He has spoken out on the issue in editorials, speeches and in trade  magazines, arguing that citizens should have the assurance that the people who  respond to them in emergencies are drug-free.  </P> <P> Last year, Booth said, 10 LAPD officers, including two new hires who were still  on probation, either were fired or resigned because of drug-connected  administrative actions leveled against them. Aliano said his union has been  hesitant to endorse a random drug-testing policy in Los Angeles in the past  because the legality of such a policy had not been resolved by the courts.  </P> <P> Detta Roberts, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department,  said the Supreme Court ruling will prompt a review of that department's policy,  which presently does not require random drug testing.  </P> <P> "In light of the new developments," Roberts said, "we are giving the issue new  considerations."  </P> <P> Although some officials believe that the Supreme Court's ruling in the Boston  case has resolved the issue, others noted that the justices did not comment  directly on the program's constitutionality and could agree to hear a challenge  in a future case. Under existing policy, the only LAPD officers who can be  forced to undergo random testing are new hires during their first 18 months of  employment. Officers who are strongly suspected of drug use can be required to  take a test. If they refuse, they can be administratively charged with  insubordination.  </P> <P> Such policies as well as voluntary testing programs are typical of law  enforcement agencies in California and throughout the nation, observers say,  but that might change significantly in light of the Boston case.  </P> <P> Kevin McDermott, legal counsel for the Boston Police Department said last  Thursday that since the Supreme Court's action, queries about the Boston  program have poured in to him from departments around the country.  </P> <P> Al Cooper, a lobbyist for the Sacramento-based California Peace Officers Assn.,  said random drug testing for police officers has recently been gaining support  among the general public and in the courts and may be the wave of the future.  </P> <P> "I think you'll see quite a bit of it because the officers themselves want to  show people that they are drug-free," Cooper said.  </P></p>

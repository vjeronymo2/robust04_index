			<p>BFN     [Text] There have been some difficulties for a well known  member of the opposition in Zaire: Etienne Tshisekedi, head of  the radical opposition who was once prime minister and who  considers himself still to be so, was held for questioning for  several hours yesterday afternoon by soldiers of the Special  Presidential Division. Muriel Pomponne has the details:    [Pomponne] Yes, at about 1600 yesterday, Etienne Tshisekedi  was taken in for questioning by members of the Special  Presidential Division, when he was travelling by car with three  bodyguards and a driver on the N'Sele road, in the suburbs of  Kinshasa. According to the representative of the UDPS [Union  for Democracy and Social Progress], Etienne Tshisekedi's party,  the four men were kidnapped and taken to (Kibomongo) camp, 60 km  from Kinshasa.    The version given by Kibomongo camp's commander Colonel  (Nsang Kiti Kumingama) is different: He claims that Mr.  Tshisekedi was driving round inside the military area. He also  says that weapons were found inside the car: one Uzi, one  pistol, one grenade, and two cartridge clips are said to have  been seized.    To the supporters of Etienne Tshisekedi, it was all a plot.  In any case the former Zairean prime minister was questioned by  soldiers and released late in the evening. But the UDPS says  that the three people accompanying him are still being held.    Etienne Tshisekedi repeated to our AFP colleague that he had  been the victim of a plot, but refused to make any other  statement.    The affair happened the day before another test of strength  between the opposition and the presidential group, since the  presidential group intends to elect a new prime minister today.</p>

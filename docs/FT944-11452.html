			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: 'Beauty' is mocked and betrayed - Clement Crisp is appalled at the crassly wrong-headed new production of this great ballet at Covent Garden The Sleeping Beauty is the greatest of ballets. Its score is Tchaikovsky's masterpiece. Its choreography, responding to that score, is a summation of the ideals of the classic academic dance as it was brought to its zenith in Imperial St. Petersburg by Marius Petipa. It is a work of its time and place  -essentially, I suppose, the final and most nostalgic statement about the art of a dying empire. It is the product of a francophile culture, yet it reflects both the grandeur and the humanity of scale of its ravishing native city, and even of the theatre that gave it birth, the Mariinsky, so perfect in its architectural ordering. For ballet-goers, it enshrines every virtue that the word 'classic' can mean to dancing. Petipa's choreography as it has come down to us proclaims the merits of formal order, harmony, of movement serenely shaped in space, occupying space with both liveliness and decorum. The action of the ballet as it was first given in 1890 - and we have clear evidence of its text - was superb in balance, as grandly spacious as the imperial world and ideal to which it was a homage. Its score was no less beautiful in shape, each scene, each act, most carefully considered as musical architecture. Nothing in Beauty is distorted, extreme, vulgar, unreasoned. Ultimately, it proposes attitudes of moral distinction - Virgil Thomson called them 'twin privileges, freedom and responsibility' - which must guide classic creation and interpretation. The academic dance of Petipa insisted on this. The academic dance of our century, of Balanchine, Ashton, held it no less true, whatever developments in manner might supervene. Beauty must remain for performers, producers, audiences, an example of clarity, formal dignity, rule of order. On Thursday night the Royal Ballet unveiled its new Beauty at Covent Garden, the production having been first seen in America during the summer. Beauty has a special place in the company's history. With extraordinary prescience, Ninette de Valois gained a first staging in 1939 for her then immature company - it was just eight years old. The text was correct even if the forces (and the design) were not up to their task. By 1946, and the re-opening of Covent Garden after the war, de Valois could bring her company to glory and our grandest theatre. Beauty, splendidly designed by Oliver Messel, announced to the world - and to America in 1949 when the troupe made its New York debut - that Britain had a national ballet. The production honoured its text. It educated dancers in the greatest challenges of their art. It taught audiences to love classic ballet. Over succeeding years, other versions were presented, none so illuminatingly right as the 1946 version. That staging, with its Bibiena architecture and its sense of space, gave the dance and dramatic action room to breathe, to take proper and happiest shape. The new staging we now see is by Anthony Dowell, in his time the purest of classicists as Prince Florimund, with design by Maria Bjornson, who has worked in opera, musicals, drama. Dowell has preserved much of the old choreography on the immediate terms of step and pattern. Miss Bjornson has decorated it in a manner so crassly wrong-headed, so vulgar, that we no longer see The Sleeping Beauty, but a cross between a Folies Bergere show and a pantomime. The ballet has been degraded, mocked, destroyed. It is beyond understanding that Dowell should have countenanced design which is malignly determined to unbalance every harmony that shapes Beauty. Bjornson has contrived a permanent frame of vertiginous and skewed pillars which collapse towards a central oval, or lead to a dizzying perspective of an open gallery. Hectoring in visual terms, this disastrous scheme effectively pulls the eye away from the stage action. Costuming is fussy, garish, or winsomely pallid, fatuous in outline (the Queen comes on in the first act as Mistinguett), ill-judged in effect. Historical identity - Bjornson seems to have dipped into A girl's first book of baroque motifs with no great success  - and fairy-tale magic are equally unlovely in realisation. (Part of the fascination of Beauty lies in the mingling of the real - evoking the court of Louis XIV - with fairy magic, and the subliminal presence of the greater theme of beauty cursed to a winter sleep and then awakening to love and new life). Nothing is visually right about the staging. Not one moment has the power or the grace implicit in score or choreography, because everything is betrayed by Miss Bjornson's tasteless caprices. (Lest anyone think I am too severe, I would refer ballet-lovers to the video of the Kirov staging as performed by Irina Kolpakova: designs unemphatic but serenely right frame performances that breathe and flower in the stage space. Choreography, interpretation, style, have a common dignity and illuminating force.) At Covent Garden, the dance now battles against a vertiginous, maladroit setting, trapped in costuming either flimsy or clever-clever. Performances seem unsettled, unseated, by this decorative mayhem. The prologue is dominated by a vast table whose only justification is to allow Carabosse's creatures to scamper and riot on it, while a set of chairs shake, rattle and roll. That it encroaches upon the dancing space is an even greater flaw: the sublime patterns of the dance look cramped. The first act boasts a vast oval frame through which Aurora must gingerly enter - gone that colonnaded view of the young princess which has traditionally been one of ballet's most thrilling moments. The second act is a winter hunting scene having an air of austerity and acid, vehement colouring, with the court dances curtailed so that the prince may have an unnecessary solo, for which Tchaikovsky sounds oddly souped-up. (And the prince's tutor is dressed as Smike). The last act - the apotheosis of everything Beauty means - looks like a pretentious hairdresser's establishment with too few clients: the court is distinctly sparse in numbers. Dowell's production has, and with good cause, a harried and browbeaten air. The Prologue's formal splendour - it should be like a Le Notre garden - is defeated by its design and by performances fidgety rather than radiant. (And I here register a protest at the intermimable clatter of thunder played over Tchaikovsky's score to announce Carabosse's arrival: it is symptomatic of the staging that it does not trust the music. That Carabosse was played by Dowell himself as a captious drag-queen is another matter). Grace of means, that prerequisite of the academic dance, was rarely apparent in the first night performances. Viviana Durante made a pretty, delicate and capable Aurora, but - not surprisingly - her interpretation seemed over-shadowed by the surroundings and lacked nobility of scale. Her prince was Zoltan Solymosi, whose provincial manner and brash technique I do not admire in this ballet. The Lilac Fairy of Benazir Hussein was strong but singularly charmless. There were brightnesses amid the flurries of fabric and tinsel - the three jewel fairies of the last act seemed delightful - but casts are going to have a difficult time telling us about The Sleeping Beauty in this unreasoned, unreasoning caricature.

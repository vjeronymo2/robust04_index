			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Kuwait sees BNP stake as first move in French sell-off agenda KUWAIT may invest in future French privatisations following the announcement earlier this week that it plans to take a 2 per cent stake in Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the banking group which is the first candidate in the French government's share sales. The Kuwait stake - which is divided between the Kuwait Investment Authority and the Kuwait Public Institution for Social Security, each with 1 per cent  -is one of the noyau dur, or hard core, holdings in BNP that the French government has sold to provide a stable base of long-term shareholders for the bank. The Kuwait Investment Office, part of the KIA, said yesterday that Kuwait saw BNP as a good investment opportunity and regarded the stake as a medium- to long-term investment. It said Kuwait would scrutinise forthcoming French privatisations for attractive investments. A number of other foreign companies have taken noyau dur stakes in BNP, which is valued at FFr43bn (Dollars 7.4bn) by the FFr240 a share offer price. These include General Electric (GE), the US electronics group; BAT, the UK consumer products concern; Roche Holding, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company; and Dresdner, the German bank with which BNP has a partnership agreement. Noyaux durs were prominent in the earlier privatisation drive between 1986 and 1987. However, most of those investors were French concerns. This time the government is encouraging foreign shareholders to participate. Roche and GE, like Kuwait, plan to take noyaux durs holdings in BNP - of about 0.77 per cent and 0.76 per cent respectively - as financial investments. Roche said its investment was being made through its portfolio management division. GE will take its stake through three pension funds. Similarly, BAT is buying its proposed 0.5 per cent stake in BNP as an investment on behalf of its insurance operations and pension fund. It decided to participate as a noyau dur to ensure that it was guaranteed a stake in the bank even if, as expected, the issue was over-subscribed. However, the UK group, which has substantial tobacco interests, sees the BNP investment as a strategic step towards securing a stake in Seita, the French state tobacco monopoly which is scheduled for sale later in the privatisation programme. BAT said that its participation in the BNP issue was 'a sign of our commitment to France' that 'should help strengthen our relations with the French government', thereby improving its prospects of being accepted as a noyau dur in Seita. Dresdner Bank's decision to take a 1 per cent stake in BNP was driven by strategic reasons. The German bank, which has for some time operated a commercial partnership with BNP, recently negotiated a cross-shareholding agreement whereby each bank would take up to 10 per cent of the other's equity. That agreement is awaiting authorisation from the European Commission. Many of BNP's French noyaux durs are industrial groups in which the bank is already a minority investor, such as Saint-Gobain, Pechiney, Compagnie Generale des Eaux and Saint-Louis. Most of the other domestic noyaux durs are clients of the bank.  -----------------------------------     STABLE SHAREHOLDERS IN BNP*  -----------------------------------                                %  ----------------------------------- Elf-Aquitaine               2.07 Saint-Gobain                1.81 Fin. et Immobiliere Marcel Dassault             1.08 Rhone-Poulenc               1.08 Peugeot                     1.03 Renault                     1.03 Dresdner Bank               1.00 Kuwait Inv.

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Further 80 jobs are shed at Daf ADMINISTRATIVE receivers of the Leyland Daf truck and vans group yesterday made redundant 80 of the 270 Birmingham-based staff still assigned to the Excel project, a joint venture between Renault and Daf to create a new range of vans. The move was expected to be the first stage in winding up the Birmingham end of the project, with Renault expected soon to announce either that it plans to proceed alone or has found a new partner. The receivers said last night that negotiations over the exact future of the Excel facilities were continuing. Yesterday's redundancies came as employees from the Birmingham plant travelled to Dunstable, where they staged a protest outside an AC Delco components plant in an effort to persuade the General Motors subsidiary to resume supplies of wiper motors to the van plant.</p>

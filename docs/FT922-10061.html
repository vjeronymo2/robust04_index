			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Benn backs Scargill defiance MR TONY BENN yesterday joined Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, in calling on trade unionists to defy new laws planned by the government. Mr Benn, a member of Labour's national executive and MP for Chesterfield, ridiculed suggestions that the party could become electable only by severing its links with the union movement. He warned that such a course would result in it disappearing like the Social Democratic party. Mr Scargill, insisting that the Labour movement could not passively wait another five years for the end of Conservative rule, said: 'Workers have to defy Tory government legislation, and if that lands us in jail so be it.' Mr Scargill forecast that if union leaders did not give a positive response by opposing legislation to impose cooling-off periods and other measures to deter strikes, the workers themselves would 'take it into their own hands to take action'. He stressed that he would support 'anything and everything' to stop the coal industry being privatised. Mr Benn, who contended that Labour would have won the election if it had fully backed the campaign against poll tax, said he would support strikes in defence of rights entrenched in the United Nations charter through the International Labour Organisation. The revised statutory code of practice on picketing, which seeks to deter unions disciplining any of their members who cross a picket line, took effect yesterday.</p>

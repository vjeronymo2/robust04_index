			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / MP says DTI ignored Maxwell warning AN MP campaigning for the Maxwell pensioners has accused the Department of Trade and Industry of ignoring warnings from the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro) that it felt unable to carry out its duties adequately. Mr Richard Page, the Tory co-chairman of the cross-party group of 100 MPs who have taken up the pensioners' cause, has written to Mr William Reid, the parliamentary ombudsman. Mr Page argues that the DTI failed to respond to warnings from Imro about the difficulties of combining the Financial Services Act with trust law; and this failure contributed to the inadequacy of protection for Maxwell pensioners. MPs campaigning on behalf of the pensioners believe an investigation by the ombudsman would be critical to establishing the extent of government responsibility. Mr Page's letter says Imro expressed concern to the DTI as early as 1987 about the difficulties of combining the act and trust law, but that the DTI took no action. In September 1990, he says, Imro submitted to the DTI a paper on the same subject which the department also disregarded. The letter is in response to a statement by Mr Reid earlier this month that he might be able to consider any evidence that the DTI had ignored representations about the adequacy of regulations. Making clear the limits of his jurisdiction, Mr Reid had said he could not entertain complaints against the Securities and Investments Board or Imro. Although Mr Reid also said any evidence that the DTI's licensing of London &amp; Bishopsgate International Investment Management in 1988 led to losses by the pensioners could be considered, Mr Page's letter does not refer to this. Downing Street said earlier this week it was satisfied that the appropriate checks were made when the licence was granted: Robert Maxwell did not become a director of LBI until some weeks after it had received its original licence. Although the government disputed the findings, the 1989 report of Sir Anthony Barrowclough, then parliamentary ombudsman, led to aid for 18,000 investors who lost money when Barlow Clowes collapsed. Sir Anthony noted 'the lack of a sufficiently rigorous and inquiring approach' in the government and the inadequacy of regulatory machinery before April 1988 when the act was introduced.

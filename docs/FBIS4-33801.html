			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Herold Jean Francois] </F>   [Text] Port-au-Prince, 12 Jun (EFE) -- Emile Jonassaint,  the de facto president of Haiti, today declared a state of  emergency in the country and ordered coupist General Raoul  Cedras to take every possible measure to deal with whatever may  happen.    Jonassaint also called on the Haitian people to unite to  meet  an invasion. "If we have to die, we will die together,"  Jonassaint said in a message to the people aired at 0130 local  (0530 GMT) and in which he announced the measures taken.    In his message, he strongly criticized the international  community for the plan to restore democracy in the country and  the threats of a foreign invasion. Jonassaint said Haiti has  done nothing wrong to foreigners and that he cannot understand  the reason for a probable invasion. As for the restoration of  democracy, he asked: "What democracy are we talking about?  When did such a democracy exist in Haiti?"    Jonassaint accused Jean-Bertrand Aristide of squandering the  country's wealth by "giving it to the whites."    Referring to Aristide's return to Haiti, but without  mentioning the constitutional president by name, Jonassaint  said: "If he is that strong, why does he not come alone?"    In stating that the Haitians will never accept a return to  slavery, Jonassaint alluded to Haiti's Independence Act, which  proclaims "liberty or death."    The chief of the de facto government also made reference to  former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, who has been  imprisoned on charges of embezzlement and theft after having  been linked to the Haiti case. Jonassaint continued by  referring to foreign leaders involved in the search for a  solution to the Haitian crisis, saying: "Soon the others will  face the same fate." [sentence as received]    The Haitian Constitution does not envisage a state of  emergency, but it does cover conditions for a state of siege.  Political observers in the Haitian capital believe that the  declaration of the state of emergency is a disguise for  establishing a state of siege to restrict the citizens'  liberties. Because of the time at which Jonassaint's message  was broadcast, few people have been informed about the de facto  president's decision, and for this reason, it will be necessary  to wait until Monday to determine what the reaction will be.</p>

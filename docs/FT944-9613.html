			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Arts: Ashton celebrated - Clement Crisp reviews the Royal Ballet In the weeks leading up to Christmas, the Royal Ballet is offering two programmes of ballets by Sir Frederick Ashton, with the added seasonal pleasure of his Cinderella. This is a first and over-due celebration of the work of the man whose creations vitally shaped our national style of classic dance. Ashton was a genius. First Marie Rambert, then Ninette de Valois gave him his earliest chances, and de Valois - prescient as ever - entrusted him with the role of chief choreographer to her company in 1935. From that moment on he made ballets which can be seen as an ascending curve of imaginative brilliance, craft and poetic sensibility. I have been fortunate enough to see much of his work with its first casts. (Ashton was often indifferent to dancers who took over roles, and could make such devastating comments as 'She's not chic' - by which he meant wit in technique and manner). His maturity as a choreographer came after the war. For the next three decades he made ballets whose variety and felicity of means were central to the Royal Ballet's identity. He took on the mantle of Petipa and gave us Cinderella, the delicious and shamefully neglected Sylvia, the tragic Ondine, the sunburst of La Fille mal gardee, and the romance of The Two Pigeons. He explored Fonteyn's gifts in role after role. He could evoke Greek myth in the mysterious Persephone and Daphnis and Chloe, and extract the essence from a drama to make a work as emotionally succinct as Month in the Country. He could be hugely and subtly funny in A Wedding Bouquet, and very moving through no less subtle means in Lament of the Waves. He could make dance glitter - one of his own favourite works was the sublime theorem of Scenes de ballet - and make his dancers opulent, grand, in Birthday Offering. Above all, his creativity fed on music, and on qualities he sensed in his interpreters - hence his lack of much interest in their successors. His ballets remain the truest portrait of his company for much of its existence. So now, somewhat belatedly, the Royal Ballet makes an Ashton homage. A stage shared with opera precludes the celebrations that New York City Ballet gave in last spring's showing of 73 Balanchine works. But I made a tally of some 30 Ashton pieces which should be in the repertory. A national ballet owes this to its dancers and audiences: the Ashton heritage is no less important than, say, the works of Benjamin Britten, and Ashton must be accounted one of our greatest lyric poets. Thursday night's first programme brought a revival and re-decoration of Daphnis and Chloe, the return of La Valse and Symphonic Variations, and duets from Sylvia and Birthday Offering, works spanning 12 great Ashtonian years, 1946-58. The evening was the victim of injuries: four principals, among others, were replaced. It is for this reason that I am reluctant to say much about Symphonic Variations, which looked studied rather than spontaneous. Because this work has been elevated to the status of a sacred text, it is too often danced as if its cast were in church. Bruce Sansom in the leading male role was fine: the rest of the cast looked tentative. They might adopt some of the freedom and sense of giving themselves to the pulse of the music which made the opening La Valse look so handsome as Ravel's whirlwind bore its couples along. The two pas de deux made me long for the entire ballets from which they were extracted. Birthday Offering was, in 1956, a loving portrait of the company's seven ballerinas in the year of its silver jubilee. (I wish I thought that the present troupe could field seven such varied and fascinating artists). At the heart of it, of course, Margot Fonteyn and her cavalier, Michael Somes. On Thursday, Lesley Collier and Jonathan Cope gave the duet its proper grace. Collier has wit and the proper understanding of Ashtonian nuance, and Cope is a handsome partner: the piece was alive. The Sylvia duet - one of Ashton's most brilliant and demanding creations for Fonteyn and Somes - did not look happy with Viviana Durante and Irek Mukhamedov. Mukhamedov has the power the dance needs, though he makes it seem more Bolshoi-like than heretofore. Durante seemed flustered by intricacies that Fonteyn played with a delicious and understated amusement in what Ashton had set her to do. But the duet whets the appetite: we really must have the whole ballet restored to the stage with its ravishing designs by the Ironside brothers. Daphnis and Chloe has been long over-due for return. Now it is back, with new design by Martyn Bainbridge replacing John Craxton's original decoration. The initial impression of Bainbridge's work is excellent. His permanent set is of creamy stone walls with a distant landscape shimmering through horizontal lines which mask the backdrop. The costuming is timeless yet suitably archaic, in natural-coloured linen and wool for the villagers, rather more conventionally piratical for Bryaxis and his crew. I think it a miscalculation to use an obviously theatrical moon and tinselly stars for the pirate scene, and to make the last act sea like a dowager's sequinned bosom glittering all-too-brightly in the morning light. These seem trumpery when contrasted with the earlier aptness of the design. The Chloe of Trinidad Sevillano - a replacement for an injured Sarah Wildor  -was deliciously soft in outline and tender in manner, and the character lived. So did Stuart Cassidy's Daphnis, happily combining innocence and passion. Lykanion and Dorkon, who must tempt the young lovers, were given first sketches by Benazir Hussein and Adam Cooper, but the pirate Bryaxis needs a far weightier presence than Matthew Hart's physique can bring - the part cries out for Mukhamedov. This is, nonetheless, a welcome revival. Let it be the precursor of much more Ashton - and MacMillan - restored to the stage: their work is our national ballet's treasure, and identity.

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (1): The day of the lawyers has arrived - After decades of assaults by lobbyists, chemical companies' biggest headache is now the mass of laws curbing their operations Fear is an important factor in the chemicals industry's management of environmental matters. Industry leaders and their companies can face vast liability suits if there is an accident. Even everyday operations can become bad publicity. Some of these fears have begun to fade in the mid-1990s. In their place is the spectre of being overwhelmed by national and international legislation. Chemicals companies already employ thousands of people in the environmental monitoring and control of plant and processes. Yet the pace of introduction of new laws is undiminished. Executives are caught between the need to demonstrate that they are cleaning up their businesses and the desire to limit the administrative burden that this requires. A decade ago, the agenda was set by the lobby and pressure groups such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace. They dogged chemicals manufacturers, pointing an accusing finger at smokestacks, dumped by-products and river discharges. Although the industry was jolted, its solution was in the end simple: create a department whose job it was to fight back in the propaganda war. The result was a whole series of initiatives ranging from case studies of substances once dumped but now used productively, to the creation of the 'Responsible Care' movement - a voluntary programme covering health, safety and the environment - now embraced by virtually the entire European chemicals industry. 'We initially resented the obligation for publicity,' says Mr Michael LaGraff, general manager for health, safety and environment at BP Chemicals. 'But now we can demonstrate our progress.' The old publicity machine still requires oiling. But individual feel-good stories have become the environmental equivalent of motherhood and apple pie, and everyone has them. Most large companies can point to impressive track records in cutting emissions and recycling waste, and they publicise them in glossily produced reports. But today the departments devoted to generating a response to pressure groups have largely gone. The teams of specialists have been dispersed. Managing emissions has become an everyday part of general management. The pressure groups' legacy is the determination of politicians to legislate and regulate the industry. That means that chemicals companies are increasingly turning for help to lawyers and government affairs experts rather than public relations executives. At the top of the European list of priorities is a proposed directive from the European Commission largely based on the UK's 1990 Environment Protection Act (EPA). The UK is the model because the EPA introduced the concept of integrated pollution control, the notion that it is not enough to legislate for the reduction of emissions of one kind or another. If airborne emissions are cut but at the same time water discharges increase, the object of pollution control legislation is not achieved. The solution is to integrate the monitoring control of chemicals plants, rather than to look at each substance produced individually. Under UK law, 'you have to formalise your systems with regard to the environment,' says Mr Neil Budworth, safety officer at the UK operations of German chemicals company Bayer. 'You have to take into account all emissions, where they go, how they are controlled, what the management systems are and what the history of complaints is.' The company compiles a report that includes not only these details but carefully thought out proposals for controlling the emissions. The report is submitted to the UK government for the proposals to be approved, or otherwise. Once authorisation is secured, it must be followed by quarterly monitoring of the plant and the deposition of information for public inspection. The task is enormously complex, says Mr Lindsay Fortune, head of health, safety and the environment at chemicals company Courtaulds. 'You are right at the fringes of science. Sometimes the legislation requires you to do work that there is no science for.' He gives several examples of questions whose answers have yet to be clarified fully. How should emission limits relate to the quality of the environment? How should trigger points change with local population density? If discharges are to be made into rivers, how should limits vary according to the capacity of the river to carry the effluent away? In air emissions, how should limits vary according to the way hill and mountain ranges and climate conspire to concentrate or disperse materials? The industry's concerns about how such legislation works are not limited to the scientific. The costs involved are of increasing concern: chemicals companies already spend up to seven per cent of sales on health, safety and environmental matters. 'There are more than 300 environmental directives or laws already at the EU level alone. Between one and two per cent of the workforce in chemicals companies is concerned with the regulations now,' says Mr Louis Jourdan, director of technical affairs at the Brussels-based European industry organisation, Cefic. Rising costs are more than a matter of the quantity of laws enacted. In the UK, companies should control emissions using the 'best available technology not entailing excessive cost', says Ms Tamar Posner, executive director responsible for health, safety and the environment regulation at the UK Chemical Industries Association. But the proposed European directive does not specify that or say how costs should be considered, she says. 'This is the biggest issue in the European directive', says Courtaulds' Mr Fortune. Conforming to the rules in the UK is expensive enough. Even compiling a report for the UK government 'takes of the order of six man-months to prepare. Each site typically needs 10,' he says. Yet this concern over costs sits awkwardly with the chemicals industry's acknowledgement that laws are needed. 'These laws are not in principle a bad idea,' says the Chemical Industries Association's Ms Posner. 'But what's happening is too much. The laws are not wrong, undesirable or unnecessary. But they are coming at such a pace that it makes it difficult to regulate and implement them. In 1993 alone there were about 40 EU instruments being adopted or going through development.' This view is underlined at the European level. Mr Jourdan of Cefic says 'We like the (proposed) directive. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with it. But it is too detailed. There are provisions for the classification of substances produced in very small amounts for research and development - they are not going to be spread over fields and rivers.' The alternative, according to Cefic, is a voluntary scheme along the lines of the Responsible Care programme. 'Ninety per cent of actions in a chemical plant will remain unregulated anyway,' says Mr Jourdan. 'We want to replace, pilot or complement regulations with a voluntary agreement.' Nevertheless, the industry and its representative bodies know that they will probably not get their way. The laws are more likely to get tougher and more complicated than simpler. One of their greatest fears is that the European Commission will look favourably on the US systems of a Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), in which every company provides exhaustive details of substances released. Whatever ends up in the directive, the industry sees it as the start of yet more work. 'The next stage will be implementing the whole thing,' says Mr Fortune. The industry is determined to lobby Brussels in its attempt to limit or at least delay the impact of the next wave of regulation, but it is preparing for a sharp increase in its workload anyway. The lobbying will continue because companies face the need to allocate responsibilities, define practices, identify procedures and find the resources for implementing and maintaining environmental management, says Mr Jourdan. 'All of this needs a structure. We are asking for a pause in the production of legislation. Our job used to be easy, it was about emission limits. Now it is about standards and principles.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mufid 'Awwad: "Ghawshah Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: </F> No Agreements Between Hamas and Fatah; We Are Facing Pressures  in Jordan and Britain"]    [Text] Amman -- Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah, official  spokesman for the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), has  accused Fatah and Yasir 'Arafat's leadership in Tunis of  "launching a misleading information campaign about political  dialogues between the two movements with the aim of peddling the  autonomy agreement."    He denied any agreements or meetings with Fatah other than  the field agreement in the occupied Gaza Strip to prevent any  tension between the Fatah Hawks and and the 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam Battalions.    Ghawshah reaffirmed Hamas' rejection of autonomy and refusal  to participate in the elections but emphasized that it is very  much opposed to any Palestinian infighting. He denied the  arrest of any of its members in Jordan but admitted that the  movement is facing pressures in the Jordanian, British, and  American arenas.    This was in an interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, the first  by  Ghawshah or any Hamas official for over two weeks since they  stopped making statements after the pressures which followed  recent operations in the occupied territory.    On the claims about a meeting between Hamas and Fatah in  Cairo under the auspices of the Muslim Brotherhood there, he  said that these were fabricated, unfounded reports and that the  field meetings held in Rafah were for the purpose of tackling  the issue of mutual kidnapping by the military organizations of  the two movements to prevent the recurrence of such incidents  and prevent any provocations or clashes.    He added that, as a result of that and following the  large-scale arrest by Israel of Hamas members -- reaching 3,000  -- after the 'Afula and al-Khudayrah operations, and following  the pressure brought to bear on Hamas in several areas,  especially in Jordan, the PLO's leadership, Yasir 'Arafat's  leadership in Tunis, through its information organs, tried to  spread these reports about political dialogues and claims that  Hamas wants a place in the autonomy authority.    He said that Hamas has stopped its political dialogues with  'Arafat and the PLO leadership since 13 September 1993 when the  Oslo agreement was signed. He revealed that Hamas rejected Arab  mediation for the revival of dialogue between Hamas and 'Arafat  and his leadership. He reaffirmed that that is still the Hamas  position on that issue.    The Hamas spokesman urged the Palestinian police to play a  patriotic role by defending the Palestinian people against the  aggression of Israeli soldiers and settlers. He also said that  the release of the Palestinian detainees from enemy prisons is a  sensitive matter. He warned that the release of 5,000  supporters of the Oslo agreement and the failure to release  5,000 Hamas supporters and opponents of the agreement would  cause a major crack in the Palestinian society. He rejected  ideological discrimination as a basis for the release of  prisoners because that would be blackmail. He drew attention to  the "cunning Israeli link between the release of detainees and  full amnesty for those who collaborate with Israel." He said  that "the traitors must be punished."    Ghawshah said that his movement will maintain its  information  activity in Jordan on the grounds that Hamas' role [there] is  informational and political and has nothing to do with the jihad  military operations in Palestine because such operations are  fully planned and carried out internally. He said that the role  of the symbols and spokesmen of Hamas is to express daily  political and informational positions within the current laws of  any state they may be in.</p>

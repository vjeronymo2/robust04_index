			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kyoto University professor Nobuo Noda: "Repeated </F> Folly of Party Politics"]    [Excerpts] The political reform-related law was approved by  the Diet at the end of January and for the present a partial  settlement has been made of the political reform problem that  had been pending for many years. However, will Japanese politics  really be greatly improved by this? I think that it is best not  to expect too much. Far from the fact that we ought not expect  too much, I fear that if it goes poorly, this will be the  demarcation point where Japanese politics loses its dynamics,  slides into an endlessly fluid situation  and, as a result, we depart from party politics.  <H5>  Development Cannot Be Expected Just by Introduction of a </H5> System    There are people who advocate that party politics based on  policy will be carried out by this new electoral system with the  parallel system of a single-seat electoral district and  proportional representation system, and a two major party system  capable of alternating political power will be realized in Japan  also. That, however, will probably end up as an illusion. That  is to say, it is because a series of cultural and historical  conditions must be present for party politics to function well,  notwithstanding the contents of the electoral system.  Conversely, even if changes are seen just by introduction of the  system, the development of stable party politics should not be  expected when the proper base for that is meager. That is to  say, the more we are a nation with a shallow tradition of party  politics, the more it is necessary to be mindful of cautious,  gradual progress with sufficient consideration of the nation's  cultural and historical conditions. Just by viewing the  circumstances of their approval, I have to think that it is very  doubtful that the recent political reforms were formed on such  mature consideration.    When the cold war ended, "the end of history" was mentioned  in the sense of the final victory of the West European form of  democracy, and a dominant mood of optimism that the West  European form of democracy would probably quickly spread  throughout the world in the future. However, optimism had to  turn to pessimism before many years passed. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Clear Division in Western Camp </H5>   However, the end of the cold war made clear not just that it  would be difficult to introduce the West European form of  politics into Eastern Europe and the former Soviet nations.  Ironically, the end of the cold war exposed to the light of day  in a brutal form the division between the nations that have  really acquired the West European form of party politics and the  nations that have not within the Western camp which was supposed  to have gained victory in this war.    The politics of the various advanced nations of Western  Europe were greatly shocked by the end of the cold war, but if  observed closely, the way that they reacted to it differed  according to the nation. In the United States, the United  Kingdom, France, and Germany, the partial rise of a new  political force (at times, a radical force attacking the status  quo) was seen, but in general, so far it has not gone to the  point of fundamentally overturning the framework of existing  party politics. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Strange Coincidence Between Japan and Italy </H5>   Different from these West European nations, it has been none  other than Italy and Japan whose framework of existing party  politics was fundamentally overturned along with the end of the  cold war. Both these countries belonged to the Western camp in  the cold war era and adopted an apparent party politics form on  the surface, but once the cold war ended, they inevitably slid  into great political chaos upon receiving the full shock. These  two nations have shown a strange coincidence to the point of  political scandals exposed by prosecution authorities having  become the direct trigger for that. [passage omitted]    Even with just a brief glance like this at the recent trends  of domestic politics in various nations of the world, the  character of recent political reforms in Japan should become  visible.    At one time, the domestic politics of various nations in the  world was very shaky amidst the chaos brought by world panic  with 1929 as the starting point and, ultimately, the split into  two camps became decisive between the various democratic nations  of Western Europe, the United States, the United Kingdom, and  France, which maintained a framework of party politics in some  fashion, and the various axis nations of Japan, Germany, and  Italy, which departed from a party politics basis. As history  repeats itself to an uncanny extent in certain aspects, today in  the 1990's, after about 60 years have passed, within the  political and economic chaos of the post-cold war era, again it  seems that the domestic politics of the various advanced nations  are beginning to branch into two directions. In other words,  into nations that are trying to maintain at any cost the  continuity of party politics, such as the United States, the  United Kingdom, France, and Germany, and nations such as Japan  and Italy that are striving for "a reorganization of the  political world" by sweeping clean the existing framework of  party politics.  <H5>  Unfamiliar "Departure From Zero" in Party Politics </H5>   I want to remind you, speaking for myself, that Japan and  Italy do not appear to be proceeding directly to dictatorships  as they did between the two world wars. However, it appears at  first glance that the "political reform" or "reorganization of  the political world" which these two nations are attempting  right now should welcome the reform of all politics, but  actually that is not the case. The very idea of striving for a  completely fresh start once former political party relationships  have been swept clean is not familiar to party politics. The  reason is that party politics has the healthy character of, on  the one hand, continuing to adhere obstinately to the continuity  of history and, on the other hand, causing a blast of small  revolutionary changes in the form of alternating political  power. Starting everything over again from zero by simply  abandoning adherence to the history of parties themselves is an  idea far away from party politics.    Look at the United States or the United Kingdom. In the case  of these countries which have a long tradition of party  politics, people are wary about changing the framework of  parties to the extent that it can be called timidity. In the  United Kingdom, with World War I at the beginning of this  century as the demarcation point, a switch was seen from the two  major party system of the Conservative Party and Liberal Party  to the two major party system of the Conservative Party and  Labor Party. However, the switch in this party system was  achieved after a very long preparation process. Labor union  activities developed for a long time chiefly under the shadow of  the Liberal Party until the Labor Party came to shoulder one  pole of the two major party system, and moreover, even after the  Labor Party was born as an independent party, there was a  cooperative relationship period between the Liberal Party and  Labor Party that was known as "Lib equals Lab." Thus, the switch  in party political systems in the United Kingdom actually was  finally realized after patiently waiting for the maturation of  conditions.    This is probably not the exception even in a case where the  Labor Party might wane in the United Kingdom in the future and a  party comes to perform a role in the two major party system in  its place. More than anything else, that a political party in  this country that was born as the Tory Party in the 17th century  continues to exist as heir to that tradition today at the end of  the 20th century is a fact that makes us Japanese swoon. In both  the United Kingdom and the United States, this adherence to  history to the point of obstinacy is said to have caused the  continuation of party politics over many eras of history and not  been a hindrance.  <H5>  Consideration of Inheritance of History and Tradition </H5> Necessary    It follows from the foregoing that in the countries of Japan  and Italy where the tradition of party politics is shallow, it  is much more necessary to cultivate cautiously what seem to be  the buds of party politics that have rarely shown their face in  the past and to tend to the continuity of party politics.  Inherently, particularly in the case of Japan, there have been  scant differences in culture within society to be enough to  support the distinction of several parties. For that alone, it  is necessary to set great value on the history and tradition of  parties once there has been an attempt to create them in the  past, and on the other hand, even if political reform is carried  out, to give adequate care to the inheritance of history and  tradition. If that is not done, even the precious buds of party  politics that have tried with much effort to raise their heads  will inevitably be lost in a single stroke.    In the past, Japan had tried, little by little, to cultivate  something resembling party politics from the end of the Taisho  period [1912-1925] to the beginning of the Showa period  [1926-1988]. However, once dictatorships appeared in Italy and  Germany, we followed after them with loud cries about the  corruption of existing party politics and the need for "reform"  and, finally, the situation leaned rapidly in the direction of  "a new system" and "support politics." At that time also, it was  preached that everything existing was corrupt and liquidation  was necessary, but even in the recent political reform, the same  logic of eliminating essentially all that exists has gone  unchallenged. So, the adherence to the history of political  parties to the point of obstinacy which the people have shown in  various Anglo-Saxon countries, the birthplace of political  parties, can be called completely lacking. It has not been that  no criticism at all has been heard in the media about these  reforms, but I think that the view that preaches the necessity  of care about the continuity of history which I have pointed out  here has not appeared at all.    If you are a sharp reader, undoubtedly you have already  noticed a striking fact in reading my treatise so far. Although  Japan, Germany, and Italy advocated reform of politics and  similarly turned to the denial of existing politics between the  two world wars, this time only Japan and Italy are acting in  concert, and Germany has been very wary about changing the  framework of existing politics. Certainly, this fact has very  important significance in considering the character of recent  Japanese political reform.    In Japanese political reform, there was probably awareness  of  the West German or German system when it began to be discussed  several years ago. In the end, however, the Japanese electoral  system that is supposed to be introduced by the recent political  reform has settled into the form of a so-called coexisting  system, not a combination of a single-seat electoral district  system and proportional representation system as in Germany. In  other words, the new electoral system of Japan is not one that  gives substantial priority to a proportional representation  system like Germany, and has become something with an  incomplete, halfway character which is neither proportional  representation nor a single-seat electoral district system. (On  that point, Japanese political reform closely resembles the case  of Italy which introduced a single-seat electoral district for  three-fourths of the parliamentary seats and a proportional  representation system for the remaining one-fourth.) However, on  the point of providing assistance to political parties through  public funds, it can be said that Japan is close to the German  system to a certain extent. The reason is that public assistance  to political parties corresponding to the number of votes won in  the election has been offered in Germany since the era of West  Germany.  <H5>  No Study of Germany on Important Points </H5>   The problem, however, is that Japanese political reform,  while picking at the German system like this, has not tried to  study Germany on more important points like strengthening the  position of the prime minister, for example. I have introduced  it several times so far, but under the basic laws (Constitution)  of Germany, a system of so-called "constructive nonconfidence"  has been adopted concerning the chancellor and it has become a  mechanism whereby so long as a majority of parliament does not  agree on the next chancellor, the incumbent chancellor cannot be  made to resign by nonconfidence. This is the system that was  introduced by West Germany after World War II, in consideration  of the painful experience where successive administrations in  the Weimar era after World War I alternated, politics became  unstable, and ultimately invited seizure of power by the Nazis.    Thanks to this system, the regimes of West Germany, or  Germany since unification, have all been able to be  comparatively stable long-term regimes, and the evil of frequent  change of cabinets as in the Weimar era have been avoided. It  must not be forgotten that this system is behind the Kohl  administration that was born in 1982 and which overcame the  rough seas of the collapse of the "Berlin Wall" and unification  of Germany and has maintained its long life until today. The  incorporation of a German-style "constructive nonconfidence"  system instead of adopting an incomplete electoral system and  heading in the direction of destroying the framework of existing  political parties for Japanese political reform also probably  would have brought a much more desirable effect over the long  term.    Of course, regardless of various systematic devices under  the  Bonn basic laws, how long in the future German party politics  can continue to exist in peace is a question that is rather  difficult to foresee. At least up until now, however, German  party politics has succeeded in maintaining continuity without  experiencing a decisive interruption on the occasion of the  shift from the cold war period to the post-cold war period. That  probably merits admiration considering that the shock which this  nation sustained by the conclusion of the cold war was much more  enormous than for Japan. Therefore, the foolish, dangerous  matter of frivolous changing regimes and changing the framework  of party politics has been learned as a lesson from its own  history between the two world wars.    Japan, however, has not consulted this valuable example of  Germany and, along with Italy, is once agaom trying to follow  the track of its own history between the two world wars when it  simply got rid of the existing political framework. Just like  the respective splits which the Christian Democratic Party and  Socialist Party realized before the general election based on  the new electoral system in Italy, if a general election were  conducted under the new election system in Japan also, the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] would probably split and we would see the birth of  a series of new parties. However, would a party politics system  capable of stable change of power be generated after that?  <H5>  If Viewed With Detachment, It Is First Step Toward </H5> Dissolution    In the case of Italy, it is said that a power distribution  largely of a moderate coalition, leftwing coalition, and  rightwing coalition will appear after the collapse of the  existing political parties. However, it can be easily surmised  from outside observation that Italian party politics does not  seem to be stable based on this new power distribution. Similar  to that, even though the recent political reform of Japan seems  to have some hope for that result so long as it is viewed  domestically, if viewed from outside with a little detachment,  it actually can be perceived comparatively easily that it is the  first step directed to dissolution of party politics.    I previously stated that adherence to history was  indispensable for the development of party politics. However,  that does not mean that I want to advocate that we should  protect the so-called 1955 order of the cold war comprised of  the LDP and SDPJ. A change of power between political parties  based on this system has never occurred, and consequently, there  is no need to remind you again that this system is not a healthy  form of party politics. Moreover, since the SDPJ which shoulders  one pole in this system has a different constitution than the  socialist political parties of other West European nations, it  will be difficult for it to avoid losing its life force along  with the demise of the cold war.    However, it is again necessary to recall on this occasion  that the sham change of power between political parties in the  form of competition between factions within the LDP has just  barely been conducted under the 1955 order. That has been a  precious experience of political competition cultivated  spontaneously somehow or other within the Japanese political  climate of high conformity. Of course, the previous lively  competitive relationship between factions has been lost, such as  the creation of a general mainstream faction within the LDP at  the end of its regime and the creation of an inflexible  seniority system concerning minister posts. Consequently,  various reforms within the party will probably be necessary such  as, for example, expansion of a primary election system for  election of president or making the term of president at least  four years and strengthening that position. However, if  political reform is carried out, it should probably shift to  implementation in a form joining it in some way with the  experience of the LDP which has continued for many years in the  past. That is to say, as repeatedly stated, it is because the  more that one is a nation with a meager tradition of party  politics, the more necessary it is to hold dear the buds of past  party politics.    Indeed, if a general election is implemented under the new  electoral system, it is very likely that several significant new  political parties will probably be born. However, enough  differences in culture to support the opposition of permanent  political parties like in Europe and the United States do not  exist in Japanese society today. (Previously, the differences of  rural culture represented by Kakuei Tanaka and the urban culture  represented by Ryokichi Minobe existed to a certain extent.)  Nevertheless, under the situation today where ideology has waned  when there has been an attempt to establish distinctions in  political parties, even though difficult, in the platform, the  platforms of all parties will probably end up being  indistinguishably noncommittal.    If this happens, politicians will repeat the past,  nonchalantly crossing the fences between parties to seek the  position of prime minister or minister and, within several  years, the distinction between the new political parties will  probably lose its meaning. Not only will such degeneration occur  in central politics, but also a general ruling party surrounding  influential legislators who have won election from the various  single-seat electoral districts will undoubtedly be built at  local politics level. Seeing that a general ruling party system  centered on governors is today already being created in many  prefectures, it must be said that such a probability is very  high.    As a test, you should open a recent local newspaper and try  to gather what is occurring on the stage of local politics  today. In the central political world, Diet members are  separating into various parties such as the LDP, Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party], and the Japan New Party and are moving  around, but when it comes down to the level of prefectures or  municipalities, examples have been created here and there where  local legislators who previously belonged to the LDP have  mutually separated and dispersed into several parties, or one  legislator is sitting on the fence, belonging to both a  coalition ruling party and the LDP.    Why has this happened? Local politicians are trying to  prepare for any kind of change that may occur in the central  political world no matter how much tearful effort they put in.  Then, whatever form of regime appears centrally, they will  protect their own political careers as local legislators, and  moreover, they are eager not to interrupt derivative benefits  from the center to their own region. However, the recent reality  of such local politics, turned the other way, tells only that  the distinction of Japanese political parties on the grassroots  level is at most vague.  <H5>  Are New Parties Worthy of the Name Political Party? </H5>   Are the political parties Shinseito, Japan New Party, and  Sakigake [Harbinger] that were born one after the other because  of the change in government in the summer of last year really  worthy of the name political party? For example, the political  party Japan New Party could not have been formed apart from the  politician Morihiro Hosokawa and, if he loses his political  career, it will probably inevitably be headed for extinction in  almost no time. The same thing can be said about the  relationship of Sakigake and Masayoshi Takemura. The political  groups with this character are no more than political groups for  the purpose of putting one politician in the seat of prime  minister and are probably not worthy to be called political  parties at all. Shinseito, which was born last summer, is no  more than a group within a powerful faction of the LDP which  split, became independent, and is called a political party. When  you consider this, it must be said that the series of new  parties that appeared along with the change of government in the  summer of 1993 are actually not political parties and their  constitution has not left the realm of LDP faction.    Many advocates forecast that, if political reorganization  gradually proceeds with the introduction of the new electoral  system, many of the current political parties will be  consolidated in big blocs such as "conservative" or "liberal,"  and those blocs will respectively become genuine political  parties. However, I do not believe these kinds of predictions at  all. Even if such a political map should be maintained for a  while, neither "conservatives" or "liberals" will be able to  extricate themselves from the character of a faction coalition.  Then, factions within the various political parties will easily  cross over such political walls of "conservative" and "liberal"  to participate in an administration and will probably develop  complicated bargaining of alliances and confederations. After  inherently incompatible political parties like Shinseito and the  SDPJ joined hands under the Hosokawa coalition regime, the  creation of any combination of political forces except for the  Japan Communist Party would not be strange at all.  <H5>  No More Than Expanding Scope of Faction Struggles </H5>   As far as political reorganization which should be called  political reform is concerned, after all, the actual state of  Japanese politics in the future will essentially not change from  the struggles among factions surrounding the posts of prime  minister and minister which have unfolded within the LDP until  now. If there is something different from the past, it will be  no more than just an expansion of the scope of faction struggles  from just the LDP to include the SDPJ, Democratic Socialist  Party, and other political parties. Then, the bargaining among  factions will become more complicated than it was previously  just within the LDP in proportion to the expanded scope of  faction struggles. It will be saturated with a  behind-closed-doors character and then become something  difficult for the general public to understand. Indeed, viewing  the process up to approval of the recent political  reform-related bill, wasn't it more difficult to understand the  behind-closed-doors character than the previous process of  making up their minds within the LDP? That is believed to be an  omen that the principles and actual state of Japanese politics  under the new system will be more disparate than before.    Finally, I would like to point out that it is a fact that  recent political reform has progressed almost completely cut off  from foreign policy issues. In the inauguration of the Hosokawa  coalition regime, the realization of political reform was cited  as the task with the highest priority, and they inherited the  course of the LDP administration on foreign policy and security  policy. That is to say, the ruling coalition, which included  parties from Shinseito to the SDPJ, actually did nothing but put  off as much as possible important decisions concerning foreign  policy and security policy because they could agree only on the  task of promoting political reform.    As a result, other than approving in principle the  deregulation of rice in connection with the Uruguay Round  compromise, the Hosokawa regime spent its first six months  almost idle regarding foreign policy and security. This fact  will undoubtedly become a large point of contention on par with  the contents of political reform in later discussions on the  successes and faults of the Hosokawa regime. That is to say, it  is because the international political situation surrounding  Japan in this six-month period was decidedly not so calm that  the government could put off important decisions. Rather, it is  no exaggeration to say that a grim international situation,  requiring the most attention by Japan since the end of the cold  war and featuring the North Korean nuclear problem and economic  negotiations between Japan and the United States, appeared  during this period. If by chance the Japanese Government  neglected to devise appropriate measures concerning the North  Korean nuclear problem or U.S.-Japan economic relations in this  period, it may become most regrettable when looking back over it  later.    To begin with, the concept of "deal with domestic political  reform first and then international politics" indicates  inadequate awareness of international politics in the post-cold  war period which has been intensely fluid. In addition to having  already spent the last six months idle for the most part while  the international situation in Asia surrounding Japan has been  moving rapidly, if the next half year or year is spent on  political reorganization along with political reform, there is  probably even a danger of the international isolation of Japan  in that period. Moreover, if prospects are slim for domestic  political reform and political reorganization to be able to  produce enough clear-cut results worth that much of a sacrifice  in the foreign policy aspect, it is believed that an unlucky  turn in Japanese politics is not far off in the future.  <H5>  Danger of Dropping Out From Western Europe Camp </H5>   Many Japanese view as none of their business the condition  that Russia and the East European nations are suffering in the  move to a West European form of party politics after having been  freed from the control of communist regimes, and they are under  the false impression that their own nation is an advanced nation  concerning party politics. However, if Japanese party politics  cannot break loose at all from the confusion and, moreover, if  Japanese isolation in international politics becomes obvious  after this political reform, the dissolution of Japan's party  politics is probably a matter of time. Aren't the people,  exasperated by political reorganization that never makes much  progress, abandoning party politics that cannot deal with  international politics and beginning to look forward to  supraparty nationwide politics depending greatly on the  bureaucracy?    Although Japan is supposed to belong to the West European  democratic camp which triumphed in the cold war, there is a  great danger that we will drop out from this camp along with  Italy before we realize it. We must persist in remembering the  history of the first half of the 20th century when we drank a  bitter cup in that, while becoming a victor nation along with  the United States and the United Kingdom in World War I, we  ultimately were unable to cultivate party politics patiently and  turned to the anti-Western Europe camp in international politics  and the domestic political system.</p>

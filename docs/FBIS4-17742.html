			<p>BFN     [Text] The Democratic Russia Movement supports public  concord in Russia, however, suggests postponing the signing on  civic accord from April 28 for a later date.    In an open letter to President Boris Yeltsin, the movement's  leaders Lev Ponomarev and Gleb Yakunin motivate their suggestion  by the fact that on the threshold of the accord's signing the  newspaper IZVESTIYA carried an article with anti-constitutional  calls by the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia -- LDPR]  leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy.    Zhirinovskiy proposes that "sovereign republics be done away  with," "the sovereign presidents unwilling to transform into  governors be medically examined in Moscow," that former Soviet  republics reunite with Russia as provinces, and a crusade  southwards to the Indian Ocean be launched.    Ponomarev and Yakunin wonder for this reason "can the  presidents and leaders of the republic within the Russian  Federation put their signatures on the accord next to that of  Zhirinovskiy?"    They insist that Zhirinovskiy should either publicly  renounce  his anticonstitutional calls or be barred from signing the  document.</p>

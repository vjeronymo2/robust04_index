			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, May 23 (ANTARA) -- Foreign Minister Ali  Alatas stated here on Monday that the uncertainty of schedule  for the Moro talks should not be understood as implying that  Indonesia wished to stop the talks as this had happened merely  because each side had been held back with its own business.    "I have never stated that the talks would be stopped. What  causes a delay is the search for a suitable time for all sides,"  he said.    The planned talks between the Moro National Liberation Front  (MNLF) and the Philippine Government involving Indonesia as the  facilitator which has been scheduled on May 17 have been  postponed indefinitely.    Analysts said this must have to do with the planned holding  of a conference on "Asia Pacific Conference on East Timor" in  the Philippines on May 31-June 3.    "We are still seeking the right time. Besides preparations  at technical level also have not yet finished. That's why it is  postponed," he said.    Alatas however assured that the talks would be held this  year. Alatas would not give much comment regarding a  Muhammadiyah leader's idea to conduct a seminar on Moro similar  to that of the planned East Timor conference in the Philippines.  "That was Lukman Harun's idea," he said.    Alatas stated that it was not necessary for Indonesia to  send  people to the East Timor conference adding that no officials of  the Indonesian embassy in Manila were invited. He appreciated  President Ramos' decision to ban foreign participants and  speakers to take part in the conference.    "Now the conference is internal in nature, attended only by  the Philippine people. Now this is their own business and we  have no right to give our own judgement," he said.    Alatas reiterated that the conference was not merely a  conference in the Philippines, held with the Philippines but a  conference fully planned and engineered by Ramon Horta and his  associates. "I have the evidence," he added.    He said this conference would not talk in general about  human  rights but would be political, aimed at tarnishing the  Indonesian name leading to disrupting Indonesia's territorial  integrity.    Asked about a report, carried by Portugal daily LNSA, that  Indonesia plans to deport Fretilin leader Xanana Gusmao abroad.  Alatas said that "This is a clear disinformation to lead us into  a [word indistinct]."    "Our enemy is getting wilder, they see there have been the  Indonesia-Portugal Friendship Association, the Europe-Indonesia  Parliamentary Association. Room for maneuver for Ramon Horta  and his fellows is getting narrower and so they are getting  wilder," Alatas said.</p>

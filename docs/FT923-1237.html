			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Nuclear dumping A NEW international treaty on sea pollution, signed this week in Paris, was right to extend the present ban on dumping radioactive waste for 15 years. But it was also right to resist calls for a permanent ban. The treaty commits the 12 countries bordering the north-east Atlantic to reduce and eventually eliminate the dumping of a wide range of toxic materials. The most controversial point was that Britain and France insisted on retaining the right to dump low and medium-level radioactive waste in the sea. Alone among the north-east Atlantic countries, they have nuclear submarines and power stations that must be decommissioned in the next two decades. Under the compromise agreed, Britain and France will continue to weigh up land-based alternatives, reporting every two years to their co-signatories, and will fund expensive research into the impact if they consider dumping again after 2007. This is a sensible approach, though not because such studies will give a conclusive answer. It is impossible to prove that there will never be damage to marine life even when the waste is dumped in a three-mile deep trench 400 miles from shore, although Britain and France have many scientists on their side in arguing that the effects could be very small. But those studies will increase the currently inadequate levels of marine research and help focus attention on the dangers and costs of keeping the decaying hulks on land and the risks to the people who must dismantle and store them. In short, it will help achieve what Paris failed to do this week  -to set the risks of radioactive waste in the context of other kinds of pollution. Top of that list is the discharge of industrial waste into rivers and estuaries. Environmental groups have called steadily for better studies of the effects. The new treaty has also left unclear some of the obligations on countries and companies to publish information. The Ministry of Defence has claimed recently that under sovereign immunity it did not have to disclose its munitions dumping, and that clause persists in the new agreement. The treaty's fine print is open to interpretation on such points. It should always be interpreted in favour of full disclosure.</p>

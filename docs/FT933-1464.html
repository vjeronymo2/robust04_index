Representatives of the two companies, meeting in Tripoli for the second successive day, agreed on the types of aircraft and delivery dates, it said. Airbus might also take part in what Jana called 'a joint investment programme to set up maintenance hangars, auxiliary workshops and flight simulators as a technical service centre for this type of aircraft in North Africa and the Middle East'.

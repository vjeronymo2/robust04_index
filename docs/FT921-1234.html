			<p>920325 FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: AT&amp;T and American Express in card link AMERICAN Express and American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T), two corporate giants under pressure from nimble rivals, have joined forces in an attempt to woo the US small business community. They have announced that AT&amp;T's corporate calling card and the American Express corporate charge card would be jointly marketed to small businesses as a single entity. The system will allow small businesses that are American Express corporate card members to charge AT&amp;T telecommunications expenses along with other out-of-office expenses and get a single monthly statement. American Express is under pressure from the Visa and Mastercard credit card operations. American Express still dominates this sector, but over the past year some key US corporate customers have switched to its rivals. AT&amp;T, which has also had great success with a Visa card aimed at the consumer market, faces intense competition in the long-distance business communications market from rivals such as MCI and Sprint.</p>

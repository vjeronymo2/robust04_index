			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Commission comes under pressure over carbon tax BRUSSELS is coming under growing pressure, from outside and inside the EC, not to go it alone in proposing a new tax to penalise carbon dioxide pollution. Officials from the Gulf Co-operation Council, representing Saudi Arabia and five smaller Gulf oil producers, met the European Commission this week to express their concern at the EC executive's announced intention to propose a 'carbon tax' in advance of this summer's world environmental summit in Brazil. The GCC countries fear such a levy could hit their oil exports to the EC, with which it is negotiating eventual free trade. The GCC said they would prefer a global discussion, involving all energy producers and consumers, on the impact of energy use on the environment.</p>

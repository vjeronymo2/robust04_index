			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANAHEIM MAN SEES CHINESE TURMOIL FIRSTHAND;  </P> <P> BANNER YEAR ENDS FOR DOCTOR  </P> <P> A young Anaheim doctor's round-the-world medical mission proved more exciting  than he expected. It ended last week in Beijing, China -- right in the middle  of thousands of demonstrators.  </P> <P> There, Dr. Christopher Coad waded through throngs of banner-waving students. He  watched as peaceful demonstrators offered ice cream and water to guards from  the People's Liberation Army.  </P> <P> And at central Beijing's Tian An Men Square, he confessed to feeling a little  "unnerved" when he discovered that he was one of "maybe four" Westerners among  a million chanting people.  </P> <P> Sporting a black tie decorated with a fiery Chinese dragon, the 31-year-old  ophthalmologist was relaxing Thursday at his parents' Anaheim home after a  yearlong fellowship with Project Orbis, a traveling eye clinic that is based  inside a renovated DC-8.  </P> <P> As one of five eye doctors assigned to Orbis, Coad had spent the year  performing surgeries and training foreign doctors in India, Nepal, Thailand,  Bangladesh, New Guinea and the Philippines. Orbis' last stop was a 3-week stay  in Beijing.  </P> <P> But Coad, who was assigned to make final arrangements for that visit, arrived  ahead of the rest of the team, on April 23, the same week the protests began.  </P> <P> Coad said he spent his first days in Beijing uneventfully, laying plans for  medical lectures and eye surgeries. But on April 27, as he walked from his  hotel to Tian An Men Square for a meeting, "I was caught up in the largest  demonstration they had ever had."  </P> <P> The main street, Changan Boulevard, was blocked off, Coad recalled. "No buses  were moving. No pedicabs were moving. . . . It was just students marching with  their banners."  </P> <P> Trying not to become associated with the marchers, Coad worked his way to the  square by walking alongside the students, then "climbing through gardens, over  fences."  </P> <P> At first, Coad said, the students were demanding only greater press freedom and  their movement seemed to be pro-government. "It was a reformist movement, not a  revolutionary movement," he said.  </P> <P> But as the demonstrations continued, Coad said he watched the students begin to  denounce hard-line Premier Li Peng and demand changes in government leadership.  </P> <P> At first, Coad said workers seemed unsympathetic to the demonstrations as did  the Chinese doctors who worked with Orbis. "In the beginning, most people just  ignored it," he said.  </P> <P> But after several weeks, "the doctors were more supportive of the students.  They still apologized for the inconvenience the demonstrators were causing, but  they would start asking us what we thought of the democratic movement" in  China, Coad said.  </P> <P> As he worked with Chinese doctors, and in his spare time toured the city, Coad  said he found many more demonstrators. When he visited the Great Wall of China  about 40 miles outside of Beijing, he passed marchers on their way to Tian An  Men Square.  </P> <P> At ancient temples in Beijing and also in a section of the city called the  Forbidden City, there were students carrying banners.  </P> <P> Coad said he visited the square for the last time on May 18. By then, students  had begun a hunger strike and were finally receiving so much support, from  workers, professionals, everyone, that "the entire city was immobile," he said.  </P> <P> That day, as he walked through the square with another American from Project  Orbis, "We gave support to the demonstrators," Coad said. "We had seen a pro  Sino-American banner, and you just kind of cheer."  </P> <P> Coad left for Shanghai on May 19 -- "less than 24 hours before they declared  martial law" in Beijing, he said. But even in Shanghai, more than 600 miles  south of China's capital, there were demonstrators. They blocked the road from  the airport so that the doctor had to carry his luggage the half mile to his  hotel.  </P> <P> Demonstrations continued every day that he was in Shanghai, Coad said. But "it  wasn't a scary movement -- there was more of a festival atmosphere."  </P> <P> When he finally left for Hong Kong, he found demonstrators there too -- holding  a sympathy demonstration for Chinese on the mainland.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Coad's first day in Anaheim in a year, he said he was glad to be  back.  </P> <P> "It's very comforting to be home," he said, and added: "I'd rather watch the  movement from here."  </P> <P> Still, Coad said he is amazed by his China experience.  </P> <P> "I was expecting a nice medical exchange -- talking to doctors interested in  learning new microsurgical techniques. But it was remarkable to be there at  such a time," he said. "You felt history was being made and you were right  there."  </P></p>

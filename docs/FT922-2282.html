			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (4): The Germans are laughing - The upswing is set to continue THE PRESIDENT of the German building industry federation, HDB, tried hard to reflect the mood of gloomy caution prevailing in German business circles, but an uncontrollable smile kept breaking out and spoilt the effect. Mr Hermann Becker and his members have reasons to be cheerful. Reviewing the industry's prospects for the current year recently, he forecast falling volume sales, and groaned at the impact of government spending cuts, record interest rates, ballooning land prices and over-generous pay settlements. Business in the east was 'stuttering', he said. But on the bottom line, with expected real growth in west German construction this year of up to 3 per cent, and 17 per cent in the east, the sector is outperforming all other industries. And the upswing seems likely to continue. Overall 1992 economic growth in the west is forecast at just 1 per cent, and around 10 per cent in the east. With all-German investment of DM381bn planned for this year, the country will account for almost 30 per cent of total European Community investment in building. 'The overall weakness in business conditions has slowed the development in construction, but it cannot stop it,' Mr Becker said. The motor in the west is the pent-up and growing demand for housing. Back in 1987 the authorities were shocked to discover that west Germany needed 1m new homes. In 1990, after unification, they found they needed to refurbish or rebuild virtually the entire eastern housing stock. Later they were confronted with floods of ethnic Germans returning 'home' from eastern Europe. Orders for housing in the west alone rose 19 per cent in the first two months of this year. Completions in Bavaria rose almost 16 per cent in the first quarter. Overall, Mr Becker said, the industry would complete 350,000 houses and apartments this year, compared with 314,000 in 1991. Public sector orders, meanwhile, rose only 0.5 per cent in the first two months, and local authority building plans suggest a 2 per cent overall decline. The government is committed to limiting real public spending growth to 2.5 per cent a year, in effect a cap. But it is also pledged to giving east Germans living standards that are comparable with those in the west as quickly as possible. In practical terms, this means a crash programme to prevent impatient skilled and educated 'Ossi' workers from uprooting themselves, moving west, and wrecking Bonn's efforts to build a balanced, unified economy and society. In cash terms, according to the respected Ifo research institute in Munich, this means spending DM2,400bn by the year 2005. A study prepared for the HDB suggests 40 per cent of the total will be needed for housing, 22 per cent for the economic infrastructure - items such as energy supply - 15 per cent for road and rail links, and 6 per cent for drains, waterworks and other environmental projects. This presents the construction industry with a challenge - increasing output in the east by 15 per cent annually for 15 years - which many see as impossible. So far this year, as investors have registered the loss of the early 'unification dividends' and the cooling of the boom, German construction stocks have tended to be marked down or put on 'hold' in analysts' recommendations. But there are still a few companies in Germany this year where earnings per share are expected to grow at the rates forecast for builders such as Bilfinger &amp; Berger (24 per cent) or even Strabag, exposed to public spending cuts by its dependence on road construction and other public sector contracts, and still forecast to show a 14 per cent rise. And while the industry contemplates the daunting panorama of order prospects  -reaching far beyond the former GDR and into Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary and into the former Soviet Union - it also confronts the task of restructuring itself, the better to compete at international level. German industry is renowned for its plethora of small and medium-sized concerns which comprise the so-called Mittelstand, and construction is no exception. Of the 65,000 building companies registered in the west, only 11,000 employ more than 20 people. According to HDB, the advantages of scale show up in items like personnel costs - 35 per cent of the value of production in a company with more than 500 employees and 41 per cent in one with 20 to 50. Costs of materials to the larger operators are only two-thirds of those carried by the smaller groups. The trend towards concentration is gathering pace accordingly. In early May, for example, Walter Bau, led by Mr Ignaz Bau, a former apprentice bricklayer, wound up a rapid-fire series of acquisitions when it won control of Munich-based Dywidag. With an extra DM3.7bn in sales, the company was catapulted to a close second place in the German big league and its annual turnover came within DM500m of Phillip Holzmann's DM11bn.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Braving the heights The strength of the UK equity market continues to astonish. Since the election, the FT-SE is up by more than 300 points, or 13 per cent. At the time of the election result, the more bullish broking houses predicted 3,000 by the year end. The market is half way there already. It only needs another 150 points on the index for the return on equities to match that on cash between now and the end of the year. Even now, the ratio of gilt yields to equity yields is only just above two, which puts it at the low end of the historic range. Over the past 12 months, the UK market has risen only half as fast as Wall Street. Now that the UK economic recovery, like that of the US, is tentatively established, can the FT-SE match the Dow by pressing into record territory? Part of the difficulty in answering lies in gauging overseas demand. US buying was reportedly strong yesterday, presumably on the grounds that the combination of interest rate cuts and a right-of-centre government appeals to any US fund manager out to diversify away from a possibly overvalued domestic market. But US investors have proved fickle already this year in such modish sectors as pharmaceuticals. There is also the risk that UK finance directors will be lured by these heady levels into cash calls, which will fall mainly on the UK institutions. Given that the gilt market recovered only modestly yesterday and that the money market still seems sceptical about whether Tuesday's rate cut will hold, it may yet prove that the equity market is more bullish than sober reflection can justify.</p>

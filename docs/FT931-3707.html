			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Platon shareholders told to ignore offer from Wills PLATON International, the USM-quoted instrumentation group fighting a hostile Pounds 2.88m bid from Wills Group, has issued its formal defence document urging shareholders to ignore Willis' 27p-a-share paper offer. In its letter to shareholders the Platon board, led by Mr Robin Meyer, chairman, again describes the Wills offer as 'wholly inadequate,' and urges them to take no action on the bid. Wills, an industrial, electronic and automotive products company, acquired 30,000 Platon ordinary shares (0.03 per cent) at 26 1/2 p each 10 days ago and has received irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer from shareholders holding a further 15.7 per cent. The offer closes on Friday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 29 Apr -- An agreement on cooperation in  solving questions of the social protection of military  servicemen and the moral, spiritual, patriotic and aesthetic  education of servicemen and the members of their families was  signed on Thursday by the Russian Ministry of Defense and the  Independent Union of Military Servicemen.    An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at the union's central  committee today that this took place during the signing of the  Social Accord Treaty in the St. George's Hall of the Kremlin,  during the course of which the sides were able to work out  optimal approaches to resolving vital problems of the armed  forces.    The sides believe that one of the basic tasks facing the  state and society is the reshaping of the army and the navy, and  they pledge to carry out joint work in shaping the Russian armed  forces on a professional basis and in educating servicemen and  their families, and also to revive and publicize the ancient  spiritual and moral traditions of the Russian army and navy.    The Ministry of Defense and the independent servicemen's  union agreed to carry out joint work on the social adaptation of  citizens discharged from military service, on the construction  of housing, the opening of new enterprises based on converted  military facilities, the creation of new jobs and the retraining  of servicemen in civilian professions.    The agreement points out that the sides pledge "to prevent  the army and navy being dragged into political games, a  reduction in the level of defense capability, and a weakening in  the social protection of servicemen and citizens discharged to  the reserve or into retirement, and their families". Joint  preparations for the celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary  of the victory in the Great Patriotic War will also be carried  out.    The agreement was signed by Russian Defense Minister Army  General Pavel Grachev, and Mikhail Kolchev, chairman of the  Central Committee of the Independent Union of Military  Servicemen of the Russian Federation.</p>

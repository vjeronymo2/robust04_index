They operate under the  slogan "members only." Surprisingly, the use of this slogan has  damaged the "self-esteem" of many, leading them to ask  themselves the question: "Why am I left out?" As a consequence,  "pseudo-aristocrats" of every kind have emerged. As the name  implies, a "pseudo-aristocrat" is not a true aristocrat. Rather,  he is one who makes a grand entrance in those places frequented  by aristocrats. There are, roughly speaking, three kinds of  "pseudo-aristocrats."  The first kind is known as the "person with contacts." This  type is comprised of mainly executive department personnel who  use their official duties to inspect management operations and  maintain public order as a springboard to gain entry into the  establishments frequented by aristocrats. Or course, the  managers and owners of the establishments catering to  aristocrats cannot treat these people rudely, and so they give  them indefinite "entrance passes" which are "tickets" that would  otherwise cost several thousand yuan or even over ten thousand  yuan to buy. These persons with "contacts" are thereby allowed  to fully enjoy the perks of the aristocrat lifestyle. The second  kind is known as a "wanna-be." These persons cannot resist the  enormous lure of the "aristocrat lifestyle," and the burning  desires in their hearts lead them to gather up all of their  savings so that they may make loans to aristocrat establishments  and thereby enjoy the perks of the same. This type of  "pseudo-aristocrat" is the most dangerous. The third kind is  known as the "momentarily flush." This kind of person acts in a  fairly reasonable manner. When he is flush with money he goes  out and "lives it up," and when he is broke he will restrain  himself so that he does not get in over his head. This group is  made up of poor people who enthusiastically pursue wealth and a  quick improvement in lifestyle. Some say that the social  phenomenon of the "pseudo-aristocrat" will, like that of drug  use, be difficult to reverse once the people get a taste of what  they are craving. If drug use is harmful to the physical and  mental health of individuals, then "pseudo-aristocracy" is a  chronic spiritual disease that is tough to cure. It is not hard  to see that the ranks of the "pseudo-aristocrats" continue to  swell as people hanker after greater luxury and enjoyment. How  ought we regard this phenomenon of the "pseudo-aristocrat?"    One executive branch cadre with years of party experience  says that the "pseudo-aristocrat" phenomenon certainly does  exist among executive branch cadres. Once people take the bait,  party status and principles are pushed to the back of their  minds. As a result, certain high-class establishments emerge,  devoted to such things as illegal activities and sex services,  and this happens because law enforcement is lax. This seriously  disrupts the socio-economic order and should be a matter of  concern for our whole society. A propaganda cadre says  passionately that China's public opinion and propaganda organs  must take a certain amount of responsibility for the emergence  and spread of the "pseudo-aristocrat." In earlier days, the  public opinion organs went overboard against things like "big  money," "big operators," and "abnormal consumption," while  exercising very little tact. As a result, certain weak-willed  individuals reacted just the opposite and began joining the  ranks of the "pseudo-aristocrats." Conversely, it is clear that  not enough propaganda has been done about correct consumption,  and in the future, improvements must be made in our guidance of  public opinion. Without discussing how "abnormal consumption"  momentarily expands the ranks of the aristocrats, we can say  that the "pseudo-aristocrat" phenomenon has led certain law  enforcement personnel to fail in vigorously enforcing the law,  to abandon principles, and even to adopt criminal ways.</p>

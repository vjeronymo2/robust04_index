			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CREDIT;  </P> <P> BONDS PRICES DROP ON PROFIT TAKING, WAR TALK  </P> <P> Bond prices slipped Friday in light, volatile trading as participants took  profits and fears grew that war could erupt in the Middle East.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 11/32 of a point, or $3.44 per  $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, rose to 8.79% from  8.75% Thursday. The Treasury had sold new 30-year bonds on Thursday at an  average yield of 8.87%.  </P> <P> Traders said the market had little reaction to a report showing inflation  moderated last month. The government said wholesale prices in July edged down  0.1%.  </P> <P> Analysts said the report, which normally would be positive for the bond market,  was discounted because it occurred before the Middle East crisis sent oil  prices surging.  </P> <P> Instead, bond prices were sent lower by bondholders who sold issues to take  profits after the Treasury's quarterly refunding, which concluded Thursday,  said Gib Clark of Daiwa Securities.  </P> <P> In addition, investors concerned that the Iraqi situation could escalate were  unwilling to hold large amounts of bonds over the weekend, furthering the  selloff.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at 8%, unchanged from late Thursday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Dollar Closes Down in Light Trading  </P> <P> The dollar finished lower against most major currencies. Analysts said weakness  in the U.S. economy and the prospect of lower U.S. interest rates weighed on  the dollar. Trading was light.  </P> <P> The dollar rose to 150.40 yen in New York from 149.805 late Thursday. But it  slipped to 1.591 German marks from 1.596.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Mideast Tension Sends Gold Soaring  </P> <P> Gold prices raced to their highest levels in nearly five months Friday on fiery  rhetoric from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> On other markets, oil futures jumped; soybeans rallied; wheat futures plunged,  and livestock and meat futures were mixed.  </P> <P> Gold for current delivery climbed $11.10 an ounce to close at $396.90 on New  York's Commodity Exchange.  </P> <P> Silver futures settled at 11.1 to 12.7 cents higher, with August at $4.97, up  11.2 cents.  </P> <P> Tables begin on D5.  </P></p>

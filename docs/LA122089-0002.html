			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOGIC GETS A SKINNING WHEN 'FAUX' REPLACES FOX;  </P> <P> FASHION: IF YOU WOULDN'T WEAR THE SKIN OF A DEAD ANIMAL, WHY WEAR APPAREL THAT  PASSES FOR THE REAL THING?  </P> <P> Fake fur and animal prints are everywhere one looks this shopping season. From  the lingerie to the shoe departments, from home furnishings to automobile  accessories, merchandisers have decreed "faux" to be the real thing.  Animal-rights activists are claiming the lion's share of the credit for this  fashion trend, in which they see reflected a more humane, less human-centered  attitude.  </P> <P> Given the vicissitudes of fashion, the exact impact of the anti-fur forces is  hard to gauge. Whether fur sales are down, up or holding steady seems to depend  upon whose figures you read. But it is certainly conceivable that, after the  anti-fur onslaught of the past few years, some women and men, tired of being  bombarded with slogans like "Cruelty is never chic," would feel relieved to  hear that fake fur is fashionably, as well as politically, "correct" this  season.  </P> <P> Even if the animal-rights movement can claim victory in this trend toward the  artificial, though, one must wonder at the logic of fake fur as a political  statement. One of the movement's favorite slogans is "Real people wear fake  fur." Why? Do gun-control advocates display replicas of firearms in their  homes? Do anti-smokers give their children candy cigarettes? Why should "real  people," ostensibly those who have achieved a higher plane of ethical  consciousness, wear fake fur at all? And if they do, just what sort of message  are they sending?  </P> <P> For years, fake fur was a fashion untouchable; it was so obviously synthetic.  Now, reputable designers are using fake fur precisely because technology has  made it look real. In other words, it looks, and sometimes feels, like the skin  of an animal. As far as anyone knows, the person wearing the fake fur is  wearing the pelt of an animal trapped or farm-bred under conditions that the  animal-rights movement roundly condemns. Even more problematic is the fake that  appears to be the coat of a rare or endangered species. It is hard to see how,  exactly, one proclaims one's compassion for furred creatures by wearing what  appears to be the pelt of a jaguar or an ocelot or a tiger.  </P> <P> The fake-fur trend, as championed by the animal-rights movement, seems to  suggest a peculiar form of double-think. Given the behavior of some  animal-rights advocates, it is tempting to attribute this logical lapse to mere  muddle-headedness. What else could explain why Jane Wiedlin, a former member of  the Go-Gos, showed up in a leather-look jacket at last February's "Rock Against  Fur" concert in New York, sponsored by People for the Ethical Treatment of  Animals? Around the same time, various animal-rights voices were excoriating  "Animal Lovin' Barbie" for wearing animal prints, on the apparent assumption  that little girls might mistake hot-pink leopard spots for real fur.  </P> <P> Anti-fur protesters also demonstrate a curious ambivalence regarding the  treatment of real furs. The Animals' Agenda (one of the movement's more  influential publications) has repeatedly suggested that enlightened fur-owners  donate their furs to be used as "props" in anti-fur protests. One such prop  appeared on the evening news, dangling from a leg-hold trap. This hardly  conveys much "respect" for animals. Other animal-rights advocates have  asserted, with perhaps more ethical consistency, that the only legitimate way  to treat a fur is to give it a decent burial. (One cannot help but wonder  whether it is politically correct to wear a fake fur while doing so.)  </P> <P> Logical coherence is hardly a hallmark of the animal-rights movement. However,  the fake-fur fascination of the anti-fur lobby seems to betray a more deeply  rooted hypocrisy than it does a mere inability to think straight. Never mind  that this alternative is produced from environmentally polluting  petrochemicals. Never mind that anti-fur boycotts have had disastrous economic  effects on native human communities here and abroad.  </P> <P> Is it easier to oppose fur fashions now that almost-perfect fakes are  available? Do actions speak louder than words? If so, then all "real people"  (whether they are pro- or anti-fur) should agree that you cannot stand up for  animals' well-being by pretending to wear their coats.  </P></p>

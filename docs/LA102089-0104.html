			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'ZERO' DOESN'T ADD UP AS A THRILLER  </P> <P> The one thing you can say for "Apartment Zero" (at the Royal) is that they've  got that numeral in the title right: This overwrought and underdeveloped  psychological thriller with heavy-handed political implications adds up to  exactly nothing.  </P> <P> It's the kind of genre piece in which logic must be airtight, yet fledgling  film maker Martin Donovan would have us believe that you can fall down a  stairwell and emerge with only a cut over your eye, and that a shrewd serial  killer would leave incriminating photos in a dresser drawer.  </P> <P> Nothing, however, makes much sense right from the start. We soon learn that  Hart Bochner's handsome, insinuating Jack Carney has every reason to seek  privacy and security, yet he rents a room from Colin Firth's Adrian LeDuc, who  clearly spells trouble for him. A fussy, overattentive and intensely repressed  film buff with an incestuous passion for his crazy hospitalized mother, LeDuc  registers an instant attraction to Jack, who responds with a laid-back,  tantalizing seductiveness. Since there is no credibility in Jack accepting  Adrian as a landlord -- let alone toying with such an up-tight, obvious weirdo  -- there is really no credibility in all that follows.  </P> <P> Donovan seems to have overdosed on Losey's "The Servant," Polanski's "The  Tenant" and the Roeg-Cammell "Performance" -- just for starters. He strives to  establish Jack and Adrian as one of those calamitous but inevitable teams,  reminiscent of Chicago child-killers Leopold and Loeb, in which we're supposed  to perceive larger meanings. The setting of "Apartment Zero" is present-day  Buenos Aires, with Adrian as a native Argentine who insists on speaking English  after having been raised in Great Britain and Jack as an American ostensibly  there on some sort of corporate training program. Donovan and co-writer David  Koepp attempt, in their increasingly morbid horror-picture context, to comment  on the evil of the notorious death squads of Argentina's former military regime  and to suggest further that killing becomes addictive.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the long-winded "Apartment Zero" is awkward to the point of  ludicrousness. Firth has the determination and skill to make Adrian  consistently pathetic and believable, but Bochner is allowed to lapse into  striking attitudes and poses. British actresses Dora Bryan and Liz Smith play  the nosiest of Adrian and Jack's neighbors as caricatures. With its  tango-tinged score and moody lighting, "Apartment Zero" (Times-rated Mature)  looks and sounds far better than it is.  </P> <P> 'APARTMENT ZERO'  </P> <P> A Skouras Pictures release of a Summit Co. presentation from Academy  Entertainment.

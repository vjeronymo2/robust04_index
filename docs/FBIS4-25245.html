			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ching Chi (5427 2765): "Many Foreign Businessmen </F> Involved in Serious Tax Evasion Cases"]    [Text] Jin Xin, director of the State General  Administration of Taxation, said a few days ago that more  foreign-funded enterprises evade taxes in Shenzhen than in other  parts of the country. Some 60 percent of the foreign-funded  enterprises in Shenzhen were involved in tax evasion.    According to statistics provided by the World Bank, a total  of $27 billion was channeled into China in 1993, making China  the largest recipient of capital in the world. Though both  China and foreign businessmen benefit from the investment, the  evasion of taxes by foreign businessmen is surprising.    It is understood that foreign businessmen evade taxes mainly  through diverting their profits, which in fact is nothing  secret. Since foreign businessmen have purchasing and marketing  rights, they can make enormous profits by importing raw and  semi-finished materials at high prices and exporting their  products at low prices. The strange prevailing situation is that  although foreign-funded enterprises on the mainland only make  small profits or operate at a loss every year, they carry on  expanding at the same time.    Statistics released by the department concerned show the  above malpractice of foreign-funded enterprises costs the  mainland a loss of several billion U.S. dollars every year,  which accounts for about one-third of foreign enterprises' total  import-export volume in the same period.    Many foreign businessmen also falsely report the value of  their equipment. Investigations into foreign enterprises'  equipment carried out by a commodity inspection department  reveal that most foreign businessmen have falsely reported the  cost of their equipment. An appraisal by a certain commodity  inspection department of 150 batches of equipment provided by  foreign businessmen showed all the equipment had been converted  into capital at price 28.8 percent higher than the actual prices.    Facts have told the Chinese Government that if the  purchasing  and marketing rights of foreign-invested or joint venture  enterprises are in the hands of foreign businessmen, they would  be controlled by foreign businessmen.    The Chinese side in a joint venture enterprise in East China  producing sporting shoes for a famous U.S. brand was excited at  first by the injection of several hundred thousand U.S. dollars  by the foreign side, but the management announced six months  after the enterprise went into operation that the enterprise had  suffered a loss of 210,000 yuan incurred by exporting 100,000  pairs of shoes to the United States. The workers were stunned  by the news, but they finally discovered the secret. The  selling price for a pair of shoes fixed by the foreign  businessmen was $2.16, amounting to 11.23 yuan, but the  production cost was 13.4 yuan, so 100,000 pairs of shoes cost  the enterprise 210,000 yuan. However, the 100,000 pairs could  bring a profit of $1.3 million in the U.S. market.    The Chinese side could not but say with feeling: Our own  enterprises are not allowed to export products by ourselves, so  we have to exploit marketing channels provided by the foreign  side. An officer from the Foreign Affairs Taxation  Administration under the State Administration of Taxation  believes that it is necessary to set up a network providing  information on prices as soon as possible.    To encourage foreign investment, China has formulated  preferential policies. For example, foreign enterprises enjoy  tax reductions and exemptions for five years beginning from the  day they go into operation. A certain foreign-invested company  in Fuzhou turned its two workshops into independent companies so  that they could continue to enjoy tax reductions and exemptions  when its tax reductions and exemptions were about to expire.    Such examples are numerous. Many foreign businessmen also  falsely report their personal income to dodge tax. China's tax  departments have taken various measures to recover evaded taxes.  China's tax departments have reportedly individually examined  over the last two years foreign-invested companies and foreign  businessmen who have evaded taxes. In the Beijing region alone,  130 persons from 40 companies were required to pay overdue taxes  totaling six million yuan and arrears amounting to five million  yuan were also recovered.    A cadre in charge of the Foreign Affairs Taxation  Administration said that by straightening out taxation, the  situation regarding income tax payments by foreigners in Beijing  had greatly improved.</p>

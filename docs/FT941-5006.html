			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Balladur declares war on Franglais: A new law will lead the Gallic offensive against English and its bastard child Prime Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday declared himself ready to do battle on behalf of French. Inaugurating a new term of office for the 'Higher Council of the French Language', he told its 29 members that safeguarding French was 'a political priority' of his government. It is now quite clear that under Mr Balladur, a man whose love of subjunctives (used in expressions of hope or fear) perfectly expresses his nuance style of government, France will soon have a new language law, along the lines of the draft already prepared by Mr Jacques Toubon, the culture minister. Behind the government's Gallic counter-offensive, of course, lie both hope and fear. Its hope is to capitalise on its recent Gatt success in protecting France's system of subsidising and protecting its film industry, in a way that will prove politically popular in next year's presidential election. Mr Toubon happens to be the keenest supporter of Mr Jacques Chirac, Mr Balladur's rival for the Elysee. The government's fear is that if it does not act soon to stem the rising tide of English or its bastard child, Franglais, it will be too late. The storm clouds are gathering from the north, with the imminent arrival of English-prone Scandinavians into the European Union threatening to tilt the linguistic balance in Brussels decisively in favour of Shakespeare's tongue and against that of Racine. Mr Toubon's aides are quick to point out that their new bill is not like Quebec's controversial language law which banned the public use of any other language but French. Rather, they say, it is designed to ensure that French citizens, employees, and consumers get their information in French, though it may be accompanied by a foreign translation. The bill is aimed at beefing up the provisions of a 1975 language law, which has been widely flouted, say Mr Toubon's aides, partly because the penalties of FFr300 (Pounds 34) to FFr600 for breaking it are now only the equivalent of a Paris parking fine. Since 1975, some 100-200 individuals and companies a year have been fined, mainly for labelling products or advertising jobs in a language other than French. In addition to sharply raising the level of fines, the new bill would enable associations de defence de la langue francaise to take those who infringe the law directly to court. Mr Toubon's ministry has two particular targets in its sights. One is what it believes, apparently from employees' letters of complaints, is the growing tendency of French companies to issue instructions to their French staff in France in other languages. An unscientific check with some of France's biggest companies, such as the Alcatel group which does less than 30 per cent of its business inside France, is that some respond in English, either to boost their international image or to make their frequent foreign clients feel more at home. But issuing internal instructions in English to French staff - says Air Liquide, the industrial gas group, which is suspected by Mr Toubon's ministry of doing just that - would be mad 'because it makes good sense to communicate in a language that is understood'. The second and more substantive target of the Toubon bill is conferences, which would henceforth have to provide translation into French. This may pose problems for the French scientific community which increasingly works in English, the international lingua franca of exact science. France's Academy of Science came out formally in January against any attempt to legislate in this field. But Mr Michel Crozon, a physicist who also serves as director of communications for the CNRS, the body which funnels state money into French science, says real damage to French scientists' ability to communicate with their brethren abroad would only occur if the former were forced to publish in French. Paris's famous medical research body, the Institut Pasteur, caused a domestic rumpus in 1989 by switching the titles of its publications into English, in recognition of the fact that less than 10 per cent of the manuscripts it was receiving from abroad were in French. But it now also publishes a purely French journal as well as 'encouraging' Anglophone authors to provide French precis of their articles - as indeed does the Academy of Scienceas a matter of course in its publications. Imposing French, of course, begs the question of what is French. That is a matter for the Academie Francaise, set up in 1635 to guard the language, and, more recently for 'terminology committees' set up by each ministry. Both are having a struggle to keep up with the advance of other languages, chiefly English. The Academie Francaise has reached the letter 'F' in revising its dictionary, while the ministerial committees invent 200-300 new approved Gallicisms each year. But the new terms have an equal struggle entering popular usage; certainly the sports ministry's prescription of a 'corner' kick in football as a coup de pied du coin has not.</p>

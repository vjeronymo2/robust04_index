			<p>BFN     [Text] In a statement on the letter of intent the Peruvian  Government is to sign with the IMF, the National Confederation  of Businessmen [Conaco] charged that the government has become  dependent on the IMF.    Conaco contends that in light of its dependence, the  government has pushed its commitment to pay the foreign debt to  the limit, thus postponing every serious attempt at reactivating  the economy to improve the people's standard of living through a  massive program and fair salaries, as well as an equitable  distribution of wealth.    Conaco hopes that there may still be time "to replace these  evil intentions" with good ones that would meet the Peruvian  people's just aspirations for a better future.    The statement notes that Conaco has unsuccessfully  recommended that the government introduce a number of corrective  measures into its economic stabilization program.    Conaco adds that the letter of intent reveals that the  Minimum Income Tax will be maintained, that no new tax  stabilization contracts will be signed, that no new free trade  zones will be created, that the prices of fuels and public  utilities will be increased, that Sunat [National Tax  Administration Superintendency] will tighten its control of  taxpayers, and so forth.    The statement adds that the government is using only $250  million of its privatization proceeds in social investments, and  that part of these resources are instead being used to pay the  foreign debt.    Similarly, Conaco adds, the government will consolidate all  of its custom tariffs at 15 percent in 1995, and will further  increase its foreign debt by financing programs to restructure  the current debt.    Conaco states that the government insists on maintaining a  rigid concept in its economic stabilization program, which is  precisely the pivotal cause of the current recessive economic  process "that brings about extreme poverty and unemployment."    The statement notes that Conaco has requested the  elimination  of the Minimum Income Tax because this is an across the board  tax that affects 2 percent of company assets.    Conaco has also unsuccessfully demanded the reduction of the  General Sales Tax and the Selective Consumers Tax as major steps  toward reversing the shrinking of the market and boosting  domestic production.</p>

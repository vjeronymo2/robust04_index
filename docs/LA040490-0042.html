			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TANKS A LOT;  </P> <P> LUMBERING RELICS OF WAR -- AND 5 PUPPIES -- ARE ON VIEW AT MUSEUM  </P> <P> Don Michelson works every day at breathing new life into old weapons at his  military museum in South El Monte.  </P> <P> So he took special delight last week when five new "weapons" drew first breath  at the sprawling American Society of Military History park nine miles east of  downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> A stray dog had crept among the World War II tanks and armored personnel  carriers parked at the outdoor museum and given birth to a litter of squeaking  puppies.  </P> <P> "Call 'em watchdogs," said Michelson as he stood in the shadow of a 30-ton  Sherman tank and cradled one of the tiny, brown-faced pups in his hands. "We've  got five very vicious watchdogs here. Five watchdogs and one mommy."  </P> <P> Michelson tries to keep security tight at his unusual 7 1/2-acre display of  military hardware at the northern edge of the Whittier Narrows Recreation Area.  </P> <P> The huge guns that poke from the turrets of the drab-green tanks and aim  skyward from rusting 40-millimeter antiaircraft batteries have been welded shut  so they cannot fire.  </P> <P> But 15 of the aging tanks, troop carriers and self-propelled antitank guns have  been restored to running order by Michelson and his son, Craig, the museum's  operations manager. Some sport heavy steel treads that would rip Rosemead  Boulevard to shreds if sneaked outside for a joy ride.  </P> <P> Michelson, 73, started the museum in 1962 by collecting old uniforms and  insignias at the Los Angeles armory where he worked as post exchange manager  for the National Guard.  </P> <P> The collection expanded to include weapons and vehicles after Michelson, of  Westwood, bought a few surplus Army vehicles. He said his interest in rolling  stock stems from service as an Army quartermaster supply officer for desert  training in World War II.  </P> <P> The display now includes equipment from that war, the Korean conflict and the  Vietnam War. All but about 20 of 100 vehicles have been loaned to the nonprofit  society by the armed forces.  </P> <P> The equipment was moved to Whittier Narrows land leased from the Army Corps of  Engineers seven years ago.  </P> <P> Most of it is so old that it will never run again.  </P> <P> "They have very simple engines that are easy to fix. These engines are very  tough; they were built to last," said Craig Michelson, 32. "But there aren't  any parts."  </P> <P> Some prizes, such as an M-47 tank used in Korea, sit idle for that reason. It  needs six oil coolers that the Michelsons have been unable to find.  </P> <P> Unlike his father, Craig Michelson never served in the military. But he grew up  around the war machines and later earned a degree in mechanical engineering  from Cal State Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "There's the Army way to fix engines and the correct way," he said. "The Army  did R and R. They removed and replaced engines when something went wrong. I do  it the correct way. I repair."  </P> <P> The museum loans out its drivable tanks and trucks to the American Legion, the  VFW and Vietnam veterans groups to use in parades. Organizations are required  to have enough liability insurance to cover such things as damage to street  pavement before they can borrow them.  </P> <P> Liability problems keep the 200 or so people who visit the museum each week  from climbing aboard the old tanks and assault vehicles, Don Michelson said.  Exceptions are occasionally made for veterans who delightedly discover  equipment they used while in military service.  </P> <P> For the past four years, the Army camp-like museum has been open Saturday and  Sunday afternoons to the public for a $2 admission fee.  </P> <P> Some of the visitors volunteer to help refurbish their favorite piece of  equipment. About 230 have joined the society.  </P> <P> "One man has come out every Thursday afternoon to work on the same type of  landing craft he used in four Pacific invasions in World War II," Don Michelson  said. "He's sandblasting it down to the wood and metal and repainting it."  </P> <P> Along with land and equipment for the museum, the government also has donated  the fence that encircles it. Navy Seabees did the installation.  </P> <P> But it wasn't secure enough to keep the museum's old watchdog in. Or to keep  out the stray dog that the Michelsons have named "Momma."  </P> <P> The pups will be given away. But the Michelsons plan to keep "Momma."  </P> <P> Every Army unit needs a dogface.  </P></p>

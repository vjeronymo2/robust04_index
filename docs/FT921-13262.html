			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: The government weighs its pair of choice dates - Speculation over timing of the election APRIL 9 or May 7? Both are encircled still in pencil rather than ink in Mr John Major's diary. But as the general election campaign gathers momentum his pen is poised over the first. The message on the Whitehall networks is that, barring disasters, the prime minister will not delay. Senior ministers do not demur from their officials' judgment. One mandarin confessed this week he planned a holiday for late March. The campaign, he judged, would then be in full swing. Another had stepped up a detailed analysis of Labour's policies in case, as he put it: 'We get a Kinnock government sooner rather than later.' As the decks are cleared, Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, is drafting a series of notes on the responsibilities of civil servants once the election is under way. At the request of the Treasury, they may include an outline of the role of civil servants in the presentation of the Budget if Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, presents it after the election has been called. Some officials have been looking back to the precedent of 1955. In April that year, Mr 'Rab' Butler, then chancellor, gave his Budget four days after Sir Anthony Eden had announced the election date. Those with memories refreshed by a recent Whitehall minute recall that Mr Butler cut income tax from nine shillings to eight shillings and sixpence in the pound and raised the tax threshold for a married man from Pounds 210 to Pounds 240. Within months of the Conservative victory, however, Mr Butler paid for the income tax cuts by increasing purchase tax - the 1950s equivalent of VAT. By the end of the same year Mr Butler had been replaced as chancellor by Mr Harold Macmillan. A repeat of that chronology is highly unlikely. If the speculation in Whitehall proves correct, Mr Lamont will set March 10 as the Budget date. Mr Major would prefer March 3, but presumably would be loath to overrule the chancellor. The latter date would give him just enough time to go to the country on April 9. So he does not have to commit himself until then. He insists also that, if necessary, he will stay in Downing Street until the constitutional deadline of July 9 - in practice, late June. For its part, Conservative Central Office has long encouraged the view that May 7, the date of annual local elections, is the most likely choice. It has the advantage of tidiness and would allow more time for tangible evidence of the promised economic recovery to emerge. Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, are said to regard it as the best option. The view of the Treasury establishment is that the recovery might still be faltering during an April campaign but the light at the end of the tunnel would at least be brighter. Mr Patten, meanwhile, is said to have been weighing several factors, ranging from the better campaigning weather during late April to the dispersal of the Liberal Democrat campaign effort between local and general elections on May 7. He must also be worried that final poll tax bills will begin to fall through letter boxes in the last week of March, playing to one of Labour's strengths during an April 9 campaign. There are now clear signals, though, that Mr Major is keen to go anyway in April. Others in the cabinet - including Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary - are lining up behind that judgment. The arguments are both personal and practical. Although an instinctively cautious politician, Mr Major has become impatient with delay. As one insider puts it: 'He has become frustrated by all the agonising. He wants to get on with the job of being prime minister.' Nor does he want the embarrassment of 'standing down' party activists when he makes a keynote speech to the Conservative Central Council meeting in Torquay on March 14. That would evoke too many memories of the dithering of Mr James Callaghan in 1978. There are more practical considerations. The admission by the Treasury that the economic recovery has once again been delayed has added force to the argument that the best Mr Major can offer is the promise rather than the reality of an upturn. Nor does he any longer have the luxury of waiting for the three-month run of opinion poll leads which provided the trigger for the 1983 and 1987 elections. That said, the argument runs, nothing is likely to happen in the four weeks between April 9 and May 7 which would improve Conservative fortunes - and much might go wrong. More positively, an April poll would leave a tax-cutting Budget fresh in voters' minds. A reduction in the basic rate of income tax or a large increase in tax thresholds would crystallise the taxation issue which Mr Major hopes will dominate the campaign. And the Budget would provide the philosophical glue for an election manifesto that still lacks a striking central theme, or big idea. Not all are so upbeat. When told that the bookmakers were offering odds of 66:1 against a late June election, one minister said he would probably wager Pounds 100. Another senior minister advised: 'Put your money on April but leave yourself a small escape hatch.' Mr Major has done just that.</p>

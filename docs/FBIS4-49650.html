			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zou Aiguo (6760 1947 0948) and Feng Xiuju </F> (7458 4423 5468)]    [Text] Beijing, 6 May (XINHUA) -- State Council Premier Li  Peng today met in Beijing with all council members attending the  national council meeting of the Chinese People's Association for  Friendship With Foreign Countries [CPAFWFC].    On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and State Council, Li  Peng extended his warm congratulations to the 40th anniversary  of the founding of the CPAFWFC and to the opening of the meeting  of the CPAFWFC's new national council. He said: Since the  founding of the CPAFWFC 40 years ago, it has held high the  banner of peace and friendship, has set its eyes on the whole  world, has made friends all over the world, and has done a great  deal to win international support and sympathy for the country's  construction. Today, China's international status is the  highest it has ever been, and we have friends around the world  -- these are the result of the painstaking labor of the  proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation in promoting  people-to-people diplomatic work, and of the diligent work of  the large numbers of comrades engaging in people-to-people  diplomatic work.    Li Peng said: Diplomatic and domestic work are closely  related. Achievements in domestic work are the foundation for  diplomatic work, and achievements in diplomatic work boost the  development of domestic work. The underlying purpose of China's  independent foreign policy of peace is to create a good  international environment for the country's four modernizations  drive.    Li Peng added: The work of the CPAFWFC and other  nongovernment friendship organizations and groups shows that  people-to-people diplomatic work is an effective supplement to  official diplomatic efforts. Official diplomatic efforts should  be integrated with people-to-people diplomatic work, and the two  should be made mutually supporting; the prospects for  people-to-people diplomatic work are very broad.    Li Peng said: "During the session of the CPAFWFC's last  council meeting, I met with representatives attending a  conference on friendship cities work. I told the conference's  attendees that the spring of China's diplomatic work had  arrived. Judging from the current situation, our prediction  then has become a reality."    Speaking on the international situation and China's  diplomatic principle, Li Peng said: The international situation  currently is in a period in which the old setup is being  transformed into a new one; the multipolar trend has further  developed. Following Comrade Deng Xiaoping's guidelines, over  the last few years we have kept ourselves coolheaded and sober  in observing, analyzing, and judging the development of the  international situation, thus enabling us to continue to open up  new situations in diplomatic work. The international community  has widely applauded China's important proposals to establish a  fair and reasonable new international order based on the Five  Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, to respect the right of the  peoples of all countries to choose on their own their own path  of development, and to promote equal and mutually beneficial  international economic cooperation and trade exchanges.    Li Peng said: China adheres to the policy of maintaining  neighborly and friendly relations with its neighbors and of  developing friendly and cooperative relations with them. This  policy has played an increasingly important role in reinforcing  and developing the good environments around the country.  China's relations with the four Central Asian nations,  Mongolia, and other Asian countries fully attest this.    Li Peng expressed his hope that the CPAFWFC will attune its  work to the new situation. He said: All comrades engaging in  people-to-people diplomatic work should take advantage of the  current favorable international situation to make more friends  in order to create a new situation in promoting people-to-people  friendship. They should be familiar with the domestic situation  and situations outside the country, should have a good  understanding of the country's foreign policy, and should study  harder to further improve themselves. They should further unite  themselves, cooperate with each other, and truly work as veteran  comrades long engaged in promoting people-to-people friendship.  I hope they will make new contributions to promoting  people-to-people friendship in the new period.    Concluding his speech, Li Peng said that he hoped all  comrades attending the meeting, under the guidance of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and under the leadership of the party Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, will strive for  new development and progress to bring about more lasting peace  and friendship for China and the world, which will soon enter  the 21st century.    Li Lanqing, Wang Guangying, Luo Gan, and other comrades  attended the meeting.</p>

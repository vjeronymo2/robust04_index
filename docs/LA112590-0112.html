			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PLEASE, LEAVE LAGUNA CANYON IN PEACE  </P> <P> History, religion and philosophy have taught that the excessive acquisition of  wealth is damaging to human happiness.  </P> <P> The citizens of Laguna Beach have demonstrated their appreciation of this  received wisdom by voting to tax themselves for 20 years to preserve Laguna  Canyon.  </P> <P> We must convince our elected officials, developers and proponents of the San  Joaquin freeway of this universal truth.  </P> <P> Housing already built in southern Orange County is not selling. It is appalling  that such a massive intrusion in our coastal canyons is being contemplated for  dedicated, but unbuilt housing.  </P> <P> SIEGLINDE JOHNSON, Laguna Beach  </P></p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Flaws in rail privatisation proposal Sir, Your editorial, 'Case for rail privatisation' (October 15), is a brave attempt to find some value in a policy that is fundamentally flawed. If the infrastructure of track and signalling is separated out, and probably retained indefinitely in public ownership, the private sector train operators will find about two-thirds of their costs, and a major area of investment, completely outside their control. The proportion would be even higher if ancillary functions like station services and car parking are taken into account. It is this constraint, together with the fragmentation of the network into much smaller franchised units, which is both deterring the private sector and driving the most successful railway managers out of the industry. Railway track is not like gas pipes or electricity cables: modern technology means that it is part of an integral system with the vehicles. Its characteristics effectively govern speed, passenger comfort, service frequency and, not least, safety. Yet these are the factors which the management of a private railway would presumably want to promote. Railways have for many years been competing hard with other modes of transport, usually on a playing field which is far from level, and there is no sign that the new regime on Gatwick services will make the slightest difference to the volumes of passengers moving there by road. As for competition on rail, it has long been possible to choose a cheaper service than Gatwick Express, by boarding a Brighton-bound train and taking five minutes longer for the same trip. If we start by accepting that the losses suffered by railways almost everywhere will never make BR a saleable proposition in the style of other utilities, an alternative solution is required. BR could be converted to a mutual organisation, rather like a building society. This would subject it to the same business disciplines as a private company and would open the door to raising finance outside the public sector. Services producing surpluses would be reinvested, under a not-for-profit constitution - and we could have all the excitement of a public issue subscription, with attractive concessions for season-ticket holders and others who invest above a certain level.

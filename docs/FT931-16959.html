			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / 100 Years In The Pink: FT salmon livery synonymous with quality financial reporting ALTHOUGH there are pink sections in newspapers of a general and sporting nature the FT salmon livery has become synonymous with quality financial reporting, Raymond Snoddy writes. When Al Alam Al Youm, the Arab world's first financial daily was established, most of its pages were pink. The Economic Times, 'India's Business Newspaper' is not only pink but even looks a lot like the FT. It is not easy to find newsprint mills making pink paper. The New Delhi-based newspaper had to go to Tamil Nadu in the far south to find a supplier of the right quality of paper. The only English mill producing paper for the FT is Bridgewater's plant at Ellesmere Port although pink paper is also imported from Finland and Sweden. Pink paper is made from standard newspaper pulp. Samples of the pulp are chemically tested to determine the concentration of dye that is needed to achieve the right colour and an even consistancy. Monitored amounts of colouring are then pumped into the pulp. Adding pink to the newsprint for the FT costs about Pounds 25 extra a tonne out of a price of about Pounds 400 a tonne. Tinted papers seemed to be fading away but are now on the increase particularly to make special sections stand out. The pink legions also include the Finanza &amp; Mercato section of 24 ORE in Italy and Le Fig-Eco, the economic section of Le Figaro. Then there are papers in which the FT has an interest such as Expansion and Izvestia's new financial section.</p>

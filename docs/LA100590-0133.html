			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG U.S. FIRMS AGREE ON WAY TO CHANGE CHIP TRADE PACT  </P> <P> Ending a longstanding split over U.S. electronics trade policy, the major  American semiconductor and computer companies on Wednesday announced a joint  position on renewal of the controversial 1986 U.S.-Japan semiconductor trade  agreement, which expires next July.  </P> <P> The compromise proposal calls for elimination of key provisions in the trade  pact that effectively fix the price of widely used memory chips.  </P> <P> The computer industry has opposed those provisions, which establish so-called  fair market values for all imported memory chips, because they have  dramatically increased the prices companies must pay for such chips.  </P> <P> The new proposal instead simply calls for the Commerce Department to implement  a fast-track investigation if evidence emerges that Japanese companies are  illegally dumping memory chips on the U.S. market. Chip industry demands that  foreign firms gain a 20% share of the Japanese semiconductor market, which are  part of a "side letter" to the current trade agreement, have been retained.  </P> <P> The trade pact was signed in 1986 after years of complaints by U.S. chip  manufacturers that Japanese companies were dumping -- selling products below  cost -- to drive American producers out of the memory chip business. But the  agreement did not achieve the goal of enticing major American suppliers to  re-enter the market for the most widely used memory chips, called DRAMs. And  American companies still hold only an 11% share of the Japanese semiconductor  market.  </P> <P> Although the united front of computer and chip companies should improve the  chances of the compromise proposal being adopted as a negotiating position by  the Commerce Department, it still faces tough political sledding. Many  Administration officials are known to oppose any extension of the trade pact.  </P></p>

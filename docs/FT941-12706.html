			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Procter advances 13% to Dollars 653m Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group which last summer embarked on a plan to close 30 plants and shed 13,000 jobs, yesterday reported that strong sales growth at home and abroad had led to a 13 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 653m for its second quarter. The figures for the first half of its financial year were well ahead, with net earnings 12 per cent up at Dollars 1.32bn excluding accounting changes and restructuring provisions on the 1992 figures. Most of the costs of the reorganisation were taken the previous year. Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman and chief executive, said the group's US consumer business had continued to deliver strong volume gains, including record shipments in December. The international operations had achieved double-digit volume growth in spite of difficult economic conditions in many markets, with Asia Pacific, Latin America and eastern Europe doing particularly well. Mr Artzt said the US and international businesses had showed good earnings growth, 'due in part to our restructuring programme, which is just beginning to contribute to our earnings progress'. Sales in the quarter to December were slightly down to Dollars 7.79bn from Dollars 7.84bn. However, Procter &amp; Gamble said this reflected adverse shifts in dollar exchange rates. Without those shifts, sales would have been 3 per cent ahead. Earnings per share for the quarter rose 14 per cent to 92 cents from 81 cents. For the six months to December, turnover was 2.3 per cent down at Dollars 15.35bn, but earnings per share were 12 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.87.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed roundup: "Can the Fragments of a Bosnian </F> Settlement Be Put Back Together After NATO Air Strike?"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted]  <H5>  Russian Federation </H5> Defense Ministry's View    In a phone call to U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry,  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has expressed serious  concern over the NATO bombers' air raid against the Serb  positions near the Bosnian town of Gorazde. The "hot line"  conversation was at the American side's request. Pavel Grachev  stressed that the use of military force, particularly from the  air, is incapable of producing a positive result in resolving  the conflict in the region. The Russian minister advocated  sending additional peacekeeping ground forces to the  confrontation zone. And, Pavel Grachev noted, the warring  factions should retreat to their previous positions, which will  make it possible to create a demilitarized zone in the Balkans.  [passage omitted]    "At the request of Serbian President Milosevic, I am  currently heading for Pale, the Bosnian Serb capital, to attempt  to put back together [sobrat] the fragments of the Bosnian  settlement process," Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's  special representative and Russian Federation deputy foreign  minister, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent in Belgrade.    Following the NATO air strikes, he continued in the  interview, the Bosnian Serbs stated that they were ending all  cooperation with the UN forces. Nonetheless, during today's  meeting with President Milosevic we reached an understanding  that the process should not be allowed to drift, and that it is  necessary nonetheless to reach a cease-fire agreement -- which  has not proved possible in the past few days.    It is a question of a truce along the entire frontline,  ideally starting with Gorazde. Since in recent hours there had  again been alarming reports about the resumption of the shelling  of this town, the Russian diplomat noted, I put this question to  Milosevic, who contacted Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic, who  subsequently ordered that the shelling of Gorazde be stopped.    In my assessment, V. Churkin said, in the case of Gorazde  there is a strong element of uncontrolled military action on the  part of both the Serb and Muslim sides. It should not be  forgotten that it was the Muslims who initiated hostilities in  Gorazde, despite the fact that the region had been declared a  "protected area" by the United Nations.    But, on the whole, a very serious position has now come  about  and a qualitatively new element has arisen -- intervention in  the Bosnian conflict by the United Nations and the international  community. There is a tendency to slide into even greater  confrontation. This is what we are now making every effort to  avert, and we believe that the main way is to conclude a truce  agreement.    V. Churkin noted that nobody on the UN or NATO side  consulted  with Russian representatives before the air strikes, even though  there had been enough time to do so. Unfortunately, the  consultation mechanism failed to work. Admittedly, he added,  the Bosnian Serbs did not consult us either. When we asked and  warned about the dangerous development of the situation, they  replied that they had no plans in respect of Gorazde and that  the Russian side had no need to take any major action to  normalize the situation in Gorazde. All parties could have made  greater efforts to ensure that Russia provided mediation  assistance, but this was not done.    When asked about possible new NATO action against the Serb  side in Bosnia, the Russian diplomat replied that "no possible  action can now be ruled out."</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Cosmo to receive rights to Abu Dhabi oil field Cosmo Oil, a Japanese oil wholesaler and distributor, is on the verge of receiving exploration and development rights to a new oil field in Abu Dhabi. The Abu Dhabi authorities made the offer to Mr Yoshiro Nakayama, honorary chairman of Cosmo Oil, when he visited the United Arab Emirates in April, Cosmo said. Japan accounts for about half of Abu Dhabi's total crude oil exports. Negotiations are still underway, but if a deal is finalised it would help Cosmo to take its long-term goal of expanding its Middle Eastern production a step further. It has been producing oil at the Mubarraz concession in Abu Dhabi since 1973 through a joint venture company with Japan Energy. However, output at Mubarraz has been on the decline from a peak of 30,000 barrels per day in 1979 to about 15,000 b/d. An award of new exploration and development rights in Abu Dhabi could bolster Cosmo's financial performance. Exploration and production is where profits are to be made, although Japanese oil companies have concentrated on downstream operations, said Mr Nicholas Smith at Jardine Fleming. Oil companies and the Japanese government have been keen to win development rights in the Gulf to ensure a steady source of oil for the country, which has few energy resources of its own. Japan depends on the Middle East for 70 per cent of its oil imports. But Japanese equity in international oil reserves accounts for only only 13 per cent of the country's total imports. The Japanese government wants to raise this to about 30 per cent in the medium term.</p>

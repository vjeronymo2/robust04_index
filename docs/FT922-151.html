			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Heywood Williams shares dive Shares of Heywood Williams yesterday dived by 41p to 288p after the UK's largest glass distributor became the latest company to warn of lower profits due to the deepening recession in the building industry. The company said that as a result it would be unable to increase its interim dividend which would be held at 4.5p. Shares of other construction related companies fell following the announcement, as concern continued to mount over the extent of the downturn in UK construction markets. Mr Ralph Hincliffe, Heywood's chairman, said trading conditions in the UK building materials market had continued to deteriorate and profits for the second quarter would be well below those of last year. Pre-tax profits for the first six months would be in the region of Pounds 5m (Pounds 8.1m). See Lex</p>

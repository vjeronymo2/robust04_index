			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Application Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To apply for PAVE certification, eligible presort product developers would complete the order form shown as Exhibit A of this notice. Only one form would be necessary regardless of the number of presort categories being applied for. The completed form would be sent to the following address:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pave Certification Program,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Customer Support Center,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States Postal Service,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6060 Primacy Pky Ste 101,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Memphis, TN 38188&hyph;0001.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> PAVE Test Files  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PAVE test files would vary in record quantity and ZIP Code variety depending on the presort category being tested. However, all the address records in the files would consist of randomly selected primary street records appropriate for the ZIP Code, ZIP+4 code range, or delivery point code numerics used (the correction character numerics would not be included). This use of error-free addresses would eliminate problems arising from presort products that incorporate some address verification mechanisms prior to sortation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The test files would be configured in the following media:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Magnetic Tape:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _6250 BPI EBCDIC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _6250 BPI ASCII.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _1600 BPI EBCDIC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _1600 BPI ASCII.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Cartridge:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _IBM 3480 38K.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Diskette:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _3&hyph;1/2 <!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;, 1.44 Megabyte MS-DOS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _5&hyph;1/4 <!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;, 1.2 Megabyte MS-DOS. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Physical Test Deck (for OCR software/hardware developers only)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Standard  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 10 white window envelopes (4&hyph;1/8 <!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; x 9&hyph;1/2 <!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0134 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;) made of 24 pound basis weight paper stock with inserts preprinted with OCR-readable addresses and POSTNET barcodes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Processing Test Files and Providing Documentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Once received, the developer would sort the test file(s) at its location with its presort product according to the presort category being examined. The developer would generate hard copy documentation to support the accurate sortation and rate application of the addresses on the test file. This would include such information as the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Documentation required to accompany the mailing statement (if applicable).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Tray/package audit trails.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Tray, sack, label generation (samples of each type).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Summary reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Parameter reports (parameters used to run the test file).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the developer would generate (as an output of this test run) and submit for PAVE evaluation other forms of documentation available to users of the product, such as:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Mailing statement facsimiles (if mailing statement facsimiles are not generated by the software product, the manufacturer would have to provide rate qualification totals for PAVE certification).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Other postal forms facsimiles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At previous commenters' requests, the Postal Service considered the possibility of having developers send their products to the Postal Service for PAVE testing rather than providing test files to be processed at developers' locations. After initial review, this was felt to be inefficient or inappropriate for the following reasons:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Various operating platforms/systems might not be available for the Postal Service to run all the products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Postal Service examiners would likely require in-depth training on many products in order to evaluate their capabilities properly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Tests might become too subjective given examiner's varying knowledge of different products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Security and liability issues might arise given the receipt and usage of presort software programs not otherwise available to the general public or in advance of their commercial release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluating PAVE Tests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluating a returned test would consist of the Postal Service examining the required hard copy reports returned by the presort product developer and, for OCR evaluation, the physical test deck. This evaluation would focus primarily on proper sortation according to DMM standards but would also include an examination of the content and clarity of supporting documentation (required to accompany mailing statements), the content, format, and clarity of facsimile postal forms, as well as the accuracy of other computer-generated documentation submitted. To be PAVE-certified, the examination would have to conclude that the results were in complete accord with the DMM standards that were applicable at the time of the test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In many cases DMM presort standards allow for a range of correct answers to a specific sortation. As an example, the precise number of pieces to a tray or sack is not mandated by standard. Changing this parameter can create different mailings from the same address list and yet still satisfy DMM standards. For this reason, no one specific (or optimum) answer would be mandated under PAVE certification unless only one answer was correct on a specific issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> PAVE Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PAVE certification would be valid for 1 year or until the next PAVE cycle. For those choosing to test during the normal test cycle, PAVE certification would be valid from January to January. Upon successful test evaluation, developers would be contacted by the Postal Service in writing and issued a PAVE certificate noting the specific software tested, the categories tested, the date of certification, and the date of certification expiration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A list of all PAVE-certified presort product developers would be published in the Postal Bulletin or a similar publication/listing as is currently used for CASS/MASS-certified listings. This list would include the developers name, product name, version numbers, certified presort categories, and a company contact name and telephone number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PAVE certification would not remain valid if a presort product developer made significant changes to its product within the 12 months following certification. Developers initiating such product changes would need to apply for certification for this new, changed product. A significant change would be a key alteration of the product's basic sortation logic; a major change in the content, layout, format, or availability of computer generated documentation or facsimiles, or a modification that results in significant differences in software operator use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

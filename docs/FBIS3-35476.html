Consultations are currently taking place among the group's  leaders to choose one of the fugitive members to assume the post  in Egypt. The candidate who has the best chances is Rif'at  Zaydan, commander of the military wing in Asyut, who has been  leading the terrorist operations there and was Tharwat  al-Hajjaj's right-hand man in Asyut. He is considered the most  capable among the group's members to assume the post after  having managed to avoid being captured by the security forces in  the past two years and to carry out all the terrorist operations  with his group, which includes Ahmad Sanusi, 'Abd-al-Nabi  Husayn, and Jamal 'Abd-al-Hamid.    Rif'at Zaydan is from Dayrut. He assumed the command of the  military wing after Jamal Huraydi, commander of the Manshiyat  Nasir massacre, was arrested and after Ahmad Zaki al-Sharif was  killed in the Firyal Company incidents in Asyut.</p>

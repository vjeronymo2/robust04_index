			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Pay awards 'lifted by merit schemes' Employers who linked rises to merit increased their pay bill by 5 per cent last year compared with a 4.5 per cent increase for those giving general increases, a survey of 1,100 settlements by independent pay analyst Industrial Relations Services has found. Pay freezes and deferrals were less common among merit-pay employers, it said. IRS data showed average pay settlements for the three months to the end of February at a new low of 3 per cent, compared with 3.6 per cent at the end of December.</p>

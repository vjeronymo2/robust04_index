			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HUNDREDS FLEE FLOODS AS STORMS POUND NORTHWEST  </P> <P> Floodwaters up to 4 feet deep breached a dike today and combined with mudslides  to force hundreds from their homes in Washington. Oregon's governor declared  emergencies in two counties where roads were under 6 feet of water.  </P> <P> "The dike has been breached and they couldn't hold it back with sandbags," Fire  Chief Chuck Newbury said in Centralia, Wash., where the Skookumchuck River  overflowed.  </P> <P> In southern Washington, Interstate 5, the region's major north-south route, was  closed because of flooding brought on by the third Pacific storm in four days.  The main Amtrak and Burlington Northern railroad line was washed out.  </P> <P> Newbury said 400 people were evacuated in Centralia early today as water rose  to 3 to 4 feet deep in the town of 11,000 people, 80 miles southwest of  Seattle. National Guardsmen helped set up shelters at churches.  </P> <P> A firefighter, Tim Evans, said a line of sandbags was laid out late Tuesday by  a motel, "but the river blew it out." Firefighters were called to the motel  "and the water was just coming in like the tide," he said.  </P> <P> Bob Berg, Lewis County public works director, guessed that 1,000 people  countywide were out of their homes.  </P> <P> Flood warnings were in effect today in Seattle and other cities along Puget  Sound and eight major rivers in Washington. The National Weather Service  predicted major damage this afternoon along the Chehalis River in the  southwestern part of the state.  </P> <P> Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt declared an emergency in Clatsop and Tillamook  counties in the northwest corner of the state.  </P> <P> Flooding in the southern part of Clatsop County was the worst in decades, with  water 6 feet deep on some roads, said Sheriff John Raichl.  </P> <P> All rivers in Tillamook County were over their banks, said Paul Levesque, the  county's assistant director of emergency management.  </P></p>

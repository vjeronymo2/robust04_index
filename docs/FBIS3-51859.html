			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Bulletin No. 25 issued by the Mexican National Defense </F> Secretariat on 24 January; place not given; from the "24 Hours"  newscast]    [Text] The National Defense Secretariat [NDS] is still  receiving complaints from civilian residents of the war zone.  Among the latest complaints are those filed by members of the  board of directors of the Conasupo [National Company for Basic  Commodities] Southeastern Distribution Company, Inc., who said  that at 1130 on 20 January, on the Palenque-Benemerito de las  Americas highway in Chiapas, near the 200-km marker, Messrs. Ube  Tancheita, Fidel Mendoza Paredes and Roberto Sanchez Sanchez,  drivers of three Conasupo vehicles, were attacked by a group of  armed individuals who took their money.    Likewise, employees of the National Immigration Institute  announced that in that same area and on the same day Fernando  Sandoval Flores, Marcos Espinoza Aguilar, and Martin Au Rivera  were attacked by approximately 30 armed individuals who were  dressed in gray tops and dark pants and had their faces covered.  Their assailants robbed them of 850 new pesos.    Meanwhile, Jose Transito Burguete Najera reported on 22  January that on 30 December he left 80 head of cattle at his El  Jordan ranch in the municipality of Ocosingo and when he  returned for them on 18 January he was attacked in La Nueva  Estrella, a town in the same municipality, by 40 individuals who  had rifles and were dressed in brown uniforms with large  handkerchiefs around their necks. These men held Burguete  Najera for 24 hours, demanding payment of 5,000 new pesos and  four head of cattle. Since Burguete did not have the money they  took four heads of cattle and a 3-ton pick-up.    On that same day Armando Aguilar Castellanos, owner of the  El  Porvenir ranch in Ocosingo Municipality, reported that on 20  January approximately 40 armed transgressors appeared at his  home and stole his pick-up.    The perpetration of these types of crimes is becoming quite  frequent; this has been confirmed by Mr. Antonio Robelo, a  representative of the state cattle breeders' association, who  disclosed that up until yesterday in Las Margaritas Municipality  alone, over 1,500 head of cattle have been lost.    Robelo also disclosed that the transgressors have [shot]  several peasants in their backs for attempting to desert from  the armed groups.    The NDS has received a copy of communique No. 007/94 with  today's date, addressed to the president of the republic, signed  by the municipal president of Oxchuc, Chiapas and by the  following municipal representatives: secretary general of the  municipal committee of the National Peasant Confederation,  president of the Community Property Commission, and municipal  agents and education committees of the 48 communities that  comprise Oxchuc Municipality. The document requests that the  Mexican Army remain in Oxchuc to maintain its residents' peace  of mind and it denies the accusations leveled against our  Mexican Army, which has proven its loyalty by restoring social  order.</p>

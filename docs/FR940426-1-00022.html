This collection of securities are referred to as the ``covered securities'' in this release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 83 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The relationship between the securities to be distributed and those to be purchased may be based on their similar terms or on a mathematical relationship conferred, for example, by a right to convert or exchange one security for the other. Bids for or purchases of related securities may result in price changes that render them expensive relative to the security in distribution. The disparate prices may prompt arbitrage transactions by other market participants involving the sale of the related security and the purchase (and possible upward effect on the price) of the security in distribution. Purchases of a related security by distribution participants also may be used to induce unrelated market professionals to purchase the security in distribution as a hedge. For example, large purchases of standardized call options are likely to force options market makers (who have sold the options) to purchase the underlying common stock to hedge their risk. A price increase in a related security also may indicate to a potential investor that the security in distribution is under-priced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``same class and series'' language has been construed broadly to encompass securities that are sufficiently similar in their terms to the security in distribution to raise the possibility that bids for or purchases of the outstanding security might be utilized to facilitate the distribution, even though there is no inherent mathematical relationship between the prices of the securities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 84 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 84 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Same class and series'' questions have arisen most frequently with regard to debt securities. See Letter regarding Gamble Skogmo, Inc. (January 11, 1974) (available on LEXIS), in which the staff took a no-action position to permit bids for or purchases of the issuer's outstanding debt securities that varied by at least 1% in coupon interest rate and by at least ten years in maturity from those of the debt securities being distributed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transactions in nonconvertible debt securities or nonconvertible preferred securities where both the nonconvertible securities being distributed and those to be purchased have been rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization (``NRSRO'') are excepted from Rule 10b&hyph;6. Paragraph (a)(4)(xiii). The exception is premised on the fungibility of investment grade issues (i.e., that securities with similar terms will trade on rating and yield rather than issuer identification). Prices of high-yield debt securities, on the other hand, are presumed to be influenced by issuer-specific information as well as interest rates. Cf.

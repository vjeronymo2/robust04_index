			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hasbro turns up the heat in scrabble for Spear Hasbro yesterday turned up the heat in its battle for control of JW Spear, the games group, with a veiled threat of legal action against trustees controlling 24.9 per cent of the family-run group. The US toy maker said the trustees were still bound by agreements to sell the stake, in spite of an eleventh hour bid by Mattel, the rival toys group. Hasbro launched its Pounds 9 a share bid for Spear, maker of the word game Scrabble, 10 days ago, valuing the group at Pounds 47m. The trustees had agreed to sell their shares to Hasbro, as long as Spear did not publicly announce an alternative, higher bid in three working days. On the last day, at just five minutes to midnight, Mattel jumped in with a Pounds 10 a share offer valuing Spear at Pounds 52m. The announcement was lodged with the Stock Exchange, while the Takeover Panel and both sets of advisers were informed of the offer. Hasbro now claims this was not a public announcement and so the undertakings are valid. 'All the steps were taken of getting ready to make a public announcement, but no public announcement was ever made,' said Mr Francis Jackson of J Henry Schroder Wagg, its advisers and merchant bank. Hasbro said it was considering its options regarding legal action if the trustees did not adhere to the undertakings. No response had yet been received from the trustees. Spear rejected Hasbro's claim and said it had received professional advice that the Mattel offer had been validly announced. The board, with the exception of Mr Francis Spear, the chairman, was recommending Mattel's offer. Mr Spear originally backed Hasbro's offer, but has been silent since the Mattel bid. The regulatory authorities appear to be divided on the issue raised by Hasbro. Under Stock Exchange guidelines, a public announcement is made by notifying the Stock Exchange and at least two national newspapers and two news wires. However, Spear's advisers, the merchant bank Barings, are understood to have consulted the Takeover Panel on their interpretation of a public announcement. While the Panel would not comment on the contract signed by the trustees, it is believed to have defined a public announcement as notification to itself, the Stock Exchange, the company, Hasbro and both sets of advisers.</p>

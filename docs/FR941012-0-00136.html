			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA has addressed in the final rule the concerns raised by the commenter. As a general rule, OSHA believes that a diagonal retreat path is the safest location in the felling area. The ANSI standard, developed by persons experienced in the logging industry, recognized that same general safe work practice. OSHA recognizes that when the retreat path is planned prior to cutting, the employer may find that a diagonal retreat path poses greater hazards than an alternative path. For example, excessive slopes, rocks or other trees in the path of a diagonal retreat may create hazards that are not present in an alternative retreat path. In such cases, the final rule permits the employee to use an alternate retreat path.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  OSHA notes that the employer bears the burden of demonstrating that the diagonal retreat path poses a greater hazard. OSHA also notes that the exception is a case-by-case determination. That is, the general rule requiring a diagonal retreat path is to be applied in all manual felling activities. The exception only applies when the feller, in planning a particular retreat path, determines that a diagonal retreat poses a greater hazard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of the final rule requires that before each tree is felled, conditions shall be evaluated in the work area and precautions taken so a hazard is not created for an employee. Conditions that must be evaluated include, but are not limited to, snow and ice accumulation, wind, lean of the tree, dead limbs and location of other trees. This provision parallels the requirement contained in the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. Many commenters discussed the hazardous nature of working conditions in the logging industry, and noted that these conditions are constantly changing (Ex. 5&hyph;12, Tr. W1 76, 88). Because conditions can change with each tree that is being felled, it is important that the feller assess in advance the conditions and hazards that may be present. In order for fellers to understand what conditions and hazards may be present and must be appraised, it is important that the employer should include this discussion in training sessions and monthly safety and health meetings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of the final rule requires that each tree be checked for accumulations of snow or ice. This provision also requires that accumulations of snow and ice that may create a hazard for an employee must be removed before felling is started in the area or the area must be avoided. This provision parallels the requirement contained in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  One commenter said that this provision would require logging establishments to cease felling operations during winter months (Ex. 5&hyph;51). OSHA does not agree with the characterization that the commenters draw about the proposed rule. OSHA is aware that logging operations are carried out in many types of weather conditions. OSHA does not believe that this provision requires logging operations to close down during the winter. However, when accumulations of snow and ice may create a hazard for an employee, that hazard must be removed or avoided. The record shows that removing or avoiding hazardous accumulations of snow and ice is necessary to protect logging employees from injury. According to the WIR survey, six percent of employees injured said that weather conditions such as snow and ice had contributed to their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Paragraph (h)(2)(iv) of the final rule requires that when a spring pole or other tree is under stress, no employee other than the feller may be closer than two tree lengths when the stress is released. This provision was included in the proposed rule, however, the proposed rule did not require that employees be at least two tree lengths away. Rather, it required that employees be in the clear when the stress is released.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Various commenters recommended that OSHA establish a uniform minimum safe distance for all work areas (Ex. 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;63, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92; Tr. W2 163, 197). OSHA agrees with these commenters and has included a minimum two tree-length distance in this provision. The record shows that this distance is necessary to protect employees from being injured or killed by trees under stress. According to the WIR survey, 11 percent of employees who reported injuries said that wood being under tension had contributed to their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The OSHA FCI report indicated that four employees were killed when they were struck by propelled or whiplashing tree limbs (Ex. 4&hyph;61).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> CRYSTAL MAIL IS LATEST FORM OF FANTASY;  </P> <P> MICHAEL SCHMIDT DRAWS INSPIRATION FROM JEWELRY DESIGNS  </P> <P> Most people who know his name think of Michael Schmidt as the man who designed  the chain-mail clothes that Cher wore in those health spa ads. Now Schmidt is  making a few additional items for her wardrobe. This time he's using a  technique he calls "New Age knitting."  </P> <P> He weaves crystals, connected by tiny metal links, into a delicate latticework  fabric he refers to as crystal chain mail. He is working the unusual fabric  into minidresses, T-shirts and motorcycle jacket trims for Cher, hoping she  will bring the clothes to widespread attention when she wears them to  premieres, award ceremonies and for the occasional Holiday Health Spa ad.  (Schmidt designed the chain-mail top she wore in last year's high-profile ad  campaign.)  </P> <P> "I'd like to see her take it and run with it, the way she has with other  designs of mine," Schmidt says of his crystal clothing collection.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Uses Past Experience  </P> <P> These new styles, like his earlier, all-metal chain-mail outfits worn by  celebrities Diana Ross, Elton John and the rocker Ozzy Osbourne, are inspired  by jewelry more than by fashion, he says. "I used to do crystal jewelry a long  time ago, and as a result of working with crystals, I came up with this  concept."  </P> <P> At that point in his fledgling career he didn't have the cash to produce his  crystal-mail fashion fantasies. The materials were too expensive for his  limited budget, and he couldn't afford to hire the specialized workers he  needed. "It's more fine art than fashion," he says about the hand-done  technique. "You'd think it wouldn't work for clothes but it does."  </P> <P> Schmidt's new knits have an appeal based on contrasts. "They're incredibly  refined and also have an aggressive, hard quality," he says. "Adapting harsh  material to the softness of the human body makes the clothes interesting."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Celebrity Client  </P> <P> Cher is the designer's celebrity client of choice. "Cher's the perfect  spokeswoman and model for my work because she embodies glamour and street  credibility," he says. But others can also find his styles at the Maxfield  boutique.  </P> <P> His future fashion-design plans reinforce his way of combining two optional  elements of style: flashiness and originality. Upcoming are motorcycle jackets  constructed of crocodile skin (Schmidt's homage to Yves Saint Laurent, who did  a version of the look in the mid-'60s). He is also working on T-shirts, dresses  and jackets made of gossamer strands of metal that he calls "stainless-steel  chiffon."  </P></p>

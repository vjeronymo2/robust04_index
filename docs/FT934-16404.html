			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Seiko Epson reduces PC production SEIKO Epson, the Japanese electronics maker, is to stop manufacturing PCs for overseas markets as a result of severe price competition. Seiko said that it is halting production of IBM-compatible PCs at its US and Singapore facilities and will meet overseas demand through OEM purchases from PC makers in Taiwan. In an OEM purchase a company buys a product from an outside manufacturer which it sells under its own brand name. Price competition in the world PC market has hurt Seiko badly and the company saw production in the US fall to less than a third of its peak of 600,000 in 1989. Seiko's US facility has been transformed into a base for the production of printers, and the number of employees there has been halved to about 500. A facility in Singapore where the company manufactures PCs will now make PC peripherals. Seiko said that fierce price competition was the main factor behind its decision which will allow it to reduce fixed costs substantially.</p>

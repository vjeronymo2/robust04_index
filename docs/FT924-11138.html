			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / BNF denies link in cancer test cases BRITISH Nuclear Fuels was accused in a civil lawsuit yesterday of causing or contributing to the cancer that affected two children whose fathers worked at the Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria. The High Court test case, on which up to 40 other claims may depend, includes allegations that nuclear radiation damaged the fathers' sperm or the mothers' eggs and resulted in genetic injury. BNF is contesting the hearing, which is expected to last between six months and a year. In the first case, Mrs Elizabeth Reay of Hensingham, Cumbria, is claiming damages over the death of her daughter Dorothy of leukaemia in 1962, aged 10 months. Subject to a final ruling on liability, her damages have been agreed at Pounds 150,000. That includes compensation for loss of her daughter and for anguish suffered by her and her husband George, who died of cancer in the 1980s. The second claimant is Miss Vivien Hope, 27, who was successfully treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma - re-lated to leukaemia - but was left partly disabled and infertile. Personal injury damages have been agreed at Pounds 125,000. BNF denies any link between the levels of radioactivity at Sellafield - formerly Windscale - and the incidences of childhood leukaemia.</p>

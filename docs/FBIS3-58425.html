The  prime minister will go to the Quirinale [presidency of the  republic] tomorrow morning, and most probably, the head of state  will dissolve the chambers after a very brief round of talks.  We shall go to the polls in little more than two months.  [passage omitted]    Let us start with this report from the Chamber of Deputies:    [Begin Ciampi recording] [passage omitted] This government  cannot be linked to any of the groupings that are emerging in  this changing political landscape. That applies first and  foremost to me personally. This is a natural passage, which we  had forecast; it is not an abrupt change. The path is a  difficult one but it is clearly traced. Some things have become  irreversible. [end recording]    [Correspondent Francesco Pionati] This was Ciampi's  statement. After his speech, the situation changed very much.  There are two important new facts. First, the Socialist group  clearly split in two. Some people say that it is a real  division. The majority of Socialist deputies, including Craxi,  elected a new parliamentary leader, Franco Piro. However, this  election was not accepted by Ottaviano Del Turco. For the  secretary of the Socialist Party the leader of the parliamentary  group is still Nicola Capria. The division was caused by  political reasons. On one side are those who want the  legislature to continue and who look to the Center: this is the  group that elected Piro. On the other side are those who look  to the Left. They want this legislature to end right now: this  is the group supporting Capria. The second important fact of  the day was sparked by the Socialist split. The parties of the  coalition in power prepared and presented a majority motion in  which they confirmed their confidence in the government and in  which they asked that some particularly urgent bills be  approved. If this motion is approved, it will clearly be more  difficult for Scalfaro to dissolve the chambers. As everyone  can understand, the situation is tense and quite confused. The  debate itself was full of contradictions. Some -- like the  Christian Democrats -- want the legislature to continue. Some  others -- the Democratic Party of the Left and the Northern  League -- want the immediate end of the legislature. As for  Pannella, he alone called for a new government to be formed.  [passage omitted] Let us now listen to the reactions of the  main political leaders, starting with their comments on the  majority motion:    [Sacco] This is the document motion you presented. You want  to give a confidence vote to Ciampi. What do you want and who  signed the motion?    [Ferri] We Social Democrats signed it, but also the  Christian  Democrats with Gerardo Bianco, leader of the Christian  Democratic parliamentary group, and Savino Melillo, leader of  the Liberal group. We are waiting for the signature of the  Socialists. The new leader, Piro, agreed with us on the main  points. However, he will hold a meeting of his group, which is  the right thing to do. There are also some members of the  Republican Party.    [Sacco] What does that document say?    [Ferri] It says, first of all, that the government has  created the conditions to continue his political and  institutional work on some crucial points, as the vote of  Italians abroad and the electoral reform for the European  elections.    [Correspondent] Mr. Bianco, the Christian Democrats say that  the Ciampi government could and should carry on, but until when?    [Bianco] I repeat that we think that the most logical thing  to do is to vote in June at the same time as the Europan  elections, and I think that other political forces agree with  us. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] There are rumors that there will also be a  confidence motion presented by some or by all groups of the  majority coalition.    [Bianco] Many colleagues already withdrew their signatures  from Pannella's no-confidence motion, which somehow prompted  this debate.    [Bossi] No, not the League. The League wants elections. All  this is not wise at all. The Christian Democrats are buying  time. They hope that some miracle may save them, that the  elections may be avoided.    [Fini] Ciampi was honest. I hope he goes to see the  president to resign and that the president of the republic  allows Ciampi -- after his resignation but still in charge of  the government for the ordinary administration -- to lead Italy  to elections as soon as possible.    [Correspondent] Do you think that the prime minister will  resign or not?    [Occhetto] I think -- having listened to his speech, in  which  he quite rightly focused on the real problem, not the relation  between parliament and the government, as Pannella thinks, but  the relation between parliament and the country -- that in fact  he has called for the end of this legislature. He put himself  above parties, the government can guarantee a safe and peaceful  passage to a new era in the life of the country. This can be  done only if he goes immediately to see the president of the  republic, if conclusions are reached and if elections are called.    [Studio Announcer Frajese] What will happen tomorrow? What  is the institutional procedure? Fabrizio Ferragni reports from  the Quirinale:    [Ferragni] The next moves are now clearer, even though  nothing is certain. Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi will  probably come here to the Quirinale late tomorrow morning to  inform Scalfaro about what happened. He will also put his  mandate at the disposal of Scalfaro. The day after, 14 January,  the president of the republic may hold talks separately with  Giovanni Spadolini, speaker of the Senate, and with Giorgio  Napolitano, speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. This is what  Article 88 of the Constitution, which deals with the dissolving  of the chambers, says. After a pause on 15 January, the head of  state may sign the decree dissolving the chambers. The cabinet  would then have to decide on the date of the elections. It is  almost certain that they will be held on Sunday, 27 March.  [passage omitted]</p>

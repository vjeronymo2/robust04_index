			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Sinking in a sea of opposition - Volvo is losing the battle against shareholders A week ago, Volvo saw the tide turning in its struggle to win shareholder approval for the proposed merger of its car and truck operations with France's Renault. However, a flood of opposition has now engulfed the beleaguered group, threatening the deal anew. Little has gone right since the Fourth Fund state pension fund, the second biggest Volvo shareholder after Renault, and the Folksam insurance group announced last Thursday they would support the merger. Since then, the number of Swedish institutional shareholders opposed to the deal has grown to seven, with none joining the Fourth Fund and Folksam in the 'yes' camp. Moreover, opponents made much of the narrow 8-6 majority within the board of the Fourth Fund, which undermined its symbolic importance as the 'swing vote' in the merger affair. The determination of those opposed to the deal has been hardened by the fact that the Fourth Fund vote was carried largely because of the support of the blue-collar trade unions, government officials, and the fund's chief executive who, it turned out, sits on the board of Volvo's group finance unit. These forces beat off the opposition of representatives from private industry. The parade of senior business figures to line up against Volvo over the past few days has been impressive. The objections they have aired against the merger agreement have also shown that the Swedish opposition runs much deeper than worries about the privatisation of Renault and terms of a subsequent state golden share. The deal's essential feature - that Volvo would sell its vehicle-making operations to Renault in exchange for a 35 per cent stake in the merged company - has, at best, been seen by critics as a too-vague valuation of Volvo and, at worst, as the unacceptable sell-out of Sweden's industrial crown jewels. A powerful voice in the 'no' camp is Mr Gunnar Johansson, a former Volvo chief executive and member of the Fourth Fund board. 'The merger,' he declared, 'transforms Volvo from a vehicle-manufacturer to an investment company. That cannot be right for a company whose name means 'I roll''. Others have weighed into the public debate, notably Mr Bjorn Wolrath, chief executive of Skandia, the insurance company, and Mr Marcus Storch, chief executive of Aga, the industrial gas group. 'French interests will dominate the new (merged) company at all levels,' said Mr Wolrath. 'Volvo's engagement in the automotive industry will be limited to three executive posts on the board of (the merged holding company),' said Mr Storch. 'For shareholders . . . the Volvo parent will be valued as an investment company, with a discount.' At the same time, Volvo's case has been weakened by internal developments. Both Skandia and the S-E Banken Funds, which announced its opposition yesterday, cited a growing hostility to the merger among Volvo employees, led chiefly by the engineers and white-collar workers. 'We are very concerned about the doubts among Volvo's personnel, especially the engineers,' said Mr Peter Thelin, chief executive of the S-E Banken Funds. 'If you don't have your employees with you going into a merger like this it will be very damaging.' Ironically, Volvo has also been a victim of its own recent success. Figures leaked this week showed the company made an operating profit of SKr460m (Dollars 54.3m) in October, more than it showed in the whole first nine months. This has been fuel on the fire for those arguing that Volvo cars and trucks could survive without the merger, especially given the recent trend of falling profits at Renault.</p>

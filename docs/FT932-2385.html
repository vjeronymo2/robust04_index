			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (2): The facts, the figures and the feedback - How the industry is trying to get across the message of its improvement in environmental performance TO REPAIR its damaged reputation, the chemical industry must not only improve its environmental performance; it must also communicate that improve- ment in a credible manner. The issue of credibility is the key. It depends foremost on the quality of environmental reporting. However, the sector is still at sixes and sevens about the issue. While some groups, such as BP Chemicals, have taken to publishing all their emissions, others, such as Ciba and Rhone-Poulenc, prefer to publish indices. Yet others refuse to publish group figures. 'Providing group emission statistics does not help the communication process,' argues Mr Jean-Jacques Salzmann, senior vice-president of corporate safety and environment at Sandoz, whose board is debating the merits of whether to provide such figures. Sandoz's group sulphur dioxide figures are distorted by a plant in Pakistan which uses local oil high in sulphur. The company would like to use imported low-sulphur oil, but that is not permitted. Giving overall figures would show the company in a unjustifiably poor light, it believes. At Sandoz, Mr Salzmann argues naked figures are difficult to understand, and that the important thing is the trend. 'You have to explain the context if misint- erpretation is to be prevented,' he argues. 'Many groups have been frustrated, publishing raw figures and getting no feedback,' he says. The company argues that information should be provided locally according to individual communities' demands. 'Neighbourhoods are not interested in group trends. They want site figures,' says Mr Salzmann. However, Mr Hans Kunzi, director of corporate safety and environmental protection at Roche, argues it is important not to patronise the public. 'Rather than publish ecotrends, we will report group figures. We're working on that at the moment and should release the figures this summer. All of the subsidiary companies will report and each division or major site will have its own page. Energy consumption, environmental spending, emissions to air and water and landfill, and safety records will all be given. So, too, will the financial performance. It's a pain to do, but it's important,' says Mr Kunzi. At Monsanto, Mr Nicholas Reding, vice-chairman, admits he had worries when the company started publishing its entire emission figures because they might provide ammunition for environmental groups. 'In fact, the external reaction has generally been pretty good, even if we have a long way to go to reduce our emissions,' he says. Any figures have to be linked to production. Closing a factory can be a highly effective way of improving environmental figures, but gives little indication of how the group is performing. Not all companies publish production figures. Most groups remain anxious that their environmental performance should not be compared with that of other groups. Different chemical concerns have different product mixes which makes comparisons tricky, they claim. Mr Kunzi at Roche explains: 'It's very difficult to relate one company's performance with another. If you are manufacturing 100,000 tonnes of ethylene, then 0.1 per cent waste is a hell of a lot of waste. 'A pharmaceutical product can require 50 to 60 steps for manufacture and generate 80 per cent waste - that's a really dirty product but it might be only a few kilos a year. One is a bulk commodity and one a highly complex molecule. You can't compare them kilo by kilo. You can compare polyethylene against polyethylene, of course. You could measure added value per kilo, but whatever measure you use is problematic. The important thing is to compare the company's results with previous years. The important measure is relative rather than absolute.' Few groups are likely to lie about their emissions. 'Communication of performance is not a public relations exercise. You have to be honest and open, giving the warts and all,' says Mr Mike LaGraff, BP Chemicals' manager for health, safety and the environment. If anything, there is a tendency for companies to exaggerate their environmental impact. In France, Mr Pierre Siefridt, from the Le Havre office of the direction regionale de l'industrie, de la recherche et de d'environnement, says that on occasions companies have a tendency to exaggerate emissions. This gives them a high pollution base to work with and allows them to appear to improve much more quickly. Another difficult issue is that of measuring spending on environment. Mr Joe Draper, health, safety and environment manager at Shell Chemicals, argues that it is almost impossible to separate expenditure between safety, health and environment. 'We used to make estimates or guesses, but there is no way of consistently assessing the number,' he explains. 'Although you can allocate an end of pipeline investment to the environment, what are you supposed to do with integrated pollution control in a new plant?' he asks. At Ciba, Mr Kasper Eigenmann, head of corporate unit safety and environment, believes it is right only to count investment in end of pipe technology, otherwise the figures become meaningless. Other companies have far wider definitions of environmental spending. Mr Draper argues that issues of definition create huge inexactitudes, and make comparisons between different groups invidious. Target audiences for environmental communication are both external and internal. 'Young employees no longer accept a change of mind-set between work and home. They want to be able to justify what the company is doing. We have to convince them that we are acting responsibly,' says Dr Hans Kindler, Ciba's executive committee member for the environment. 'We ask our employees to carry out propaganda for us,' says Mr Francis Bazile, director in charge of environment at Elf-Atochem. Similarly, at Ciba's Basle plants, retired employees help put across the company's message. Externally, most companies are now opening their doors to the surrounding communities. Visits from schools and local media, as well as local government representatives and communities have become widespread. Pressure groups are also increasingly asked for their views. In the US and elsewhere, community advisory panels have been set to help rebuild the relationship between sites and the nearby population. Admittedly, open days are not always a success. Mr Reding at Monsanto says that after the Bhophal tragedy, the company set up some open days, but nobody turned up. Each Monsanto plant now has a specially-tailored community plan. Mr LaGraff at BP Chemicals says there is no point targeting everybody in the local community. 'About 20 per cent will always be positive, and 10 per cent always hostile, no matter what your performance. The important audience is the undecided 70 per cent.' At a corporate level, chemical companies are trying to convince legislators, environmental pressure groups, customers and internal management about their performance. Shareholders are also an important constituency, given they are likely to want to know why so much money is being spent on environmental projects. Such individual projects may bear some fruit, but the overall impact on the reputation of the industry as a whole can be limited. 'National opinion polls and local ones show it's almost impossible to differentiate an individual company from the industry,' says Mr Kunzi at Roche. The answer is to explain the benefits as well as risks of chemicals to society, argues Mr Bazile at Atochem. 'There's still a belief that chemicals are intrinsically dangerous. There's no difference between natural and synthetic chemicals,' he says. The efforts by some sections of the industry may be beginning to pay off. Mr Reding at Monsanto tells the story of a member of a community advisory panel who complained about the company's deep-well policy. When she was given the option of using deep-well or cutting jobs, she said Monsanto was too good a company to offer only two options.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CHEMICAL INDUSTRY'S ENVIRONMENTAL SPENDING  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Operating        Capital           Total Company                 Costs          Costs           Costs  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hoechst             DM1.632bn          DM594m       DM2.226bn BASF*               DM1.104bn          DM215m       DM1.319bn Bayer                 DM1.3bn          DM400m         DM1.7bn ICI               Pounds 195m     Pounds 170m     Pounds 365m Dow              Dollars 400m    Dollars 200m    Dollars 600m Rhone-Poulenc       FFr1.15bn         FFr650m        FFr1.8bn Du Pont          Dollars 900m    Dollars 300m   Dollars 1.2bn Ciba                  SFr357m         SFr235m         SFr592m Akzo (HSE)            Fl 500m         Fl 200m         Fl 700m Sandoz                SFr360m         SFr189m         SFr550m Roche                 SFr148m         SFr153m         SFr301m Solvay              BFr12.7bn        BFr6.3bn       BFr19.7bn Huls                 DM386.4m          DM124m        DM510.4m BP Chemicals      Dollars 87m     Dollars 85m    Dollars 172m DSM                   Fl 150m         Fl 150m         Fl 300m Exxon (HSE)               N/A             N/A    Dollars 100m** Monsanto         Dollars 264m    Dollars 123m    Dollars 433m Union Carbide    Dollars 150m     Dollars 82m    Dollars 232m Elf Atochem          FFr1.8bn         FFr600m        FFr2.4bn Enichem                   N/A             N/A             N/A Royal Dutch Shell         N/A             N/A             N/A  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             As % of                           Turnover         turnover  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hoechst                  DM48.87bn             4.4% BASF*                    DM18.56bn             7.1% Bayer                     DM41.2bn             4.1% ICI                 Pounds 12.08bn              3% Dow               Dollars 18.971bn             3.1% Rhone-Poulenc            FFr81.7bn             2.2% Du Pont           Dollars 38.352bn             3.1% Ciba                   SFr22.204bn             2.7% Akzo (HSE)              Fl 16.85bn             4.1% Sandoz                 SFr14.416bn             3.8% Roche                  SFr12.953bn             2.3% Solvay                  BFr254.5bn             7.7% Huls                     DM10.27bn             4.9% BP Chemicals       Dollars 5.243bn             3.2% DSM                     Fl 8.907bn             3.3% Exxon (HSE)         Dollars 10.7bn             0.9% Monsanto           Dollars 7.763bn             5.5% Union Carbide      Dollars 4.872bn              5% Elf Atochem              FFr45.7bn             5.2% Enichem                  L11.155bn             N/A Royal Dutch Shell   Dollars 5963bn             N/A  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * BASF AG only. **Estimate for 1993.

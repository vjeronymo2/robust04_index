			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / The Rail Dispute: Variety of views from the Railway Tavern - Peter Marsh on a propaganda war which the signal workers are winning As the rail dispute enters a new phase victory in the propaganda battle over who is to blame is inching towards the signal workers' union. Mr Bob Worcester, chairman of the MORI opinion poll company, said: 'The days when strikes are automatically blamed on the trade unions are long gone. The public perception is that the government and Railtrack have not handled well their side of the dispute.' This view is backed by an analysis of leading articles in national newspapers since the strikes started. Of 30 editorials in London-based daily papers, only six have singled out the RMT union for blame, with 10 neutral and 14 apportioning most responsibility either to the government or Railtrack. In a highly unscientific poll by the Financial Times of the managers of 15 pubs around Britain, all called the Railway Tavern, only five said the union was unambiguously to blame. Five put the responsibility on the other side and five said they did not have a view either way. Ms June Charles, landlady of the Railway Tavern in Mile End, east London, accused the government of 'mismanaging' the dispute. Mr Sid Hogarth of the Railway Tavern in Langley Mill, Derbyshire, said: 'The government has been trying to prove it's the boss. If it hadn't intervened, the dispute would be over.' Mr Michael Burrell, managing director of Westminster Strategy, a lobbying group, said: 'So far surprisingly little blame has come the way of the union. A lot of people seem to think Railtrack has been a bit incompetent.' According to Mr Greg Parston, director of the Office of Public Management, a consultancy specialising in public-sector issues, the union's 'brilliant' handling of the dispute had helped to build up public support. Mr Parston also believes the tactic of one strike a week underlines the importance of the dispute and keeps it in the public eye, while reducing the chances of a backlash against the union by directly affecting only relatively few people. The degree of sympathy for the rail union in the FT poll of pubs was skewed by region and type of customers. Publicans in the commuter belt of south-east England, in particular, were more likely to blame the rail union. Ms Debbie Spiers, landlady of the Railway Tavern in Staplehurst, Kent, said her views were influenced by her customers, many of whom had been greatly inconvenienced by the signal workers. Mr Peter Kelly of the Railway Tavern in Andover, Hampshire, said: 'The government has my support. Anyone who goes on strike should be sacked.'</p>

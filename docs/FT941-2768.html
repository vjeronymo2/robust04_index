			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Scotland (7): North Sea learns to live with low tide - Aberdeen North-east Scotland has learned to live with the oil industry, which has set it apart from the rest of the UK economy, producing local booms in times of national recession and local recession when the good times are rolling elsewhere. Now the UK economy is struggling out of recession as the North Sea suffers another employment downturn, but there is cautious optimism in the area (Aberdonians are unfamiliar with reckless optimism) that the north-east is not about to head off in the other direction again. Professor Alec Kemp, of Aberdeen University's economics department, says North Sea employment probably peaked in 1991 and is falling slowly. The combination of the current very low oil price and a high production cost per barrel because of lower production levels from oilfields developed in the 1970s has, he said, pushed companies to look for ways to economise. Many new fields are smaller and require fewer people. Exploration drilling has slowed since last year's petroleum revenue tax changes. Mr Tom Snowling, economic research officer with Grampian regional council, agrees that the oil companies, learning from the mistakes of the 1970s and 1980s, are much more cost conscious - a far cry from the industry's free-spending days, when oil companies paid top rates for the skilled people on whom traditional fishing and farming, paper and textiles industries had relied. Technology has helped. New drilling techniques mean fewer platforms are needed to get the oil out, and smaller crews are needed for the platforms. For example, Total's Dunbar jacket and topside is designed for a crew of 16, a fraction of what would have been needed 10 years ago. Hook-ups of platforms are now done with a few hundred people (a legend of the 1980s is of 3,000 people on one platform, where there was standing room only). But it is thought that only about a third of the 27,500 offshore workforce live in the area: most live in central Scotland, north-east England and further afield. Prof Kemp says the effect on the local economy of the offshore slowdown will be offset by continuing relocation of high-skill, high-wage personnel. Intense local lobbying helped push the Department of Trade and Industry last year to relocate to Aberdeen part of its petroleum exploration directorate. That, says Professor Kemp, will have a knock-on effect in relocation of oil company personnel who have to deal with the DTI on new field development and field abandonment. There is also, he says, a continuing movement of oil-related companies to the north-east simply because it is still cheaper than south-east England and more cost-effective to be nearer the activity. One change in the industry which could have long-term implications is the trend, among oil producers, away from engaging a large number of specialist contractors, towards partnership agreements with a small number of prime contractors. The bigger service companies are now signing long-term arrangements with operators where, says Sir Ian Wood, chairman of John Wood Group, Scotland's largest private company, 'they are helping an operator drive his business. We sit down with the operator and try to understand what he wants to achieve and work with him in ways in which we share in his risk.' Five years ago his company would have sought a straightforward maintenance contract on one platform. Now it will negotiate, with an operator and five or six specialist subcontractors, a design, construction and maintenance programme on a number of platforms. This, he says, has cut costs. In the longer term, such companies could diversify into other areas, such as power generation, and should have the size and expertise needed to operate in the international oil marketplace. Sir Ian talks of consolidating a 'mini-Houston' in north-east Scotland. Sir Ian, who is also chairman of the government-backed economic development body Grampian Enterprise, acknowledges that an economy based on a wasting resource has to look to its other industries. The Aberdeen area, he says, 'has become an uncomfortably unbalanced environment'. A generation has grown up in Aberdeen that has not known a time without oil. Traditional industries have had to cope with a higher cost base than anywhere else in Scotland. Both he and Mr Derek Marnoch, chief executive of Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce, believe oil has helped the area's other industries by making the business climate more competitive, risk-aware and generally sharper. Mr Marnoch talks of an economy working on two levels, with those outside the oil industry struggling in an area where oil drives housing and other costs  -but he believes there are probably more second earners than there are elsewhere in Scotland. As a high-wage area, the way to survive has been to work at the quality end of the market - always the case for an area whose distance from the main marketplaces means high transport costs. For example, the area's four paper mills produce about 600,000 tonnes of paper and board a year, about 10 per cent of UK output. But 400,000 tonnes is high-value printing and writing stationery, about 20 per cent of the UK total. Although they are in the same industry, the four mills are not direct competitors, which allows them to co-operate in areas such as training. Mr Ed Gillespie, general manager at Arjo Wiggins's paper mill on the outskirts of Aberdeen, acknowledges conflict with oil in the labour market, especially in the early 1980s. But now the oil industry is training more of its own people, while both industries have cut labour demand through technological change. He has noticed that men in their 30s and 40s, tired of the rigours of the North Sea and anxious to spend more time with friends and family, are coming back to onshore industry. His recent move from five-and-a-half to seven-day working created 70 jobs, for which 1,500 applied - although he did not advertise the vacancies. Mike Stephen, group managing director of Grampian Country Food Group, a large-scale pork and chicken producer, says oil took away 'a lot of young lads who would have worked on the farm or driven trucks,' but agrees that 'it's not every married man with a family who wants two weeks on and two weeks off'. But difficulties in getting process labour are pushing his company harder to find technological improvements. although much of his process labour is female, for which there is less competition. His company is an example of how food production, that most traditional of all industries, is becoming concentrated in a small number of large companies - driven, he says, by hygiene regulations. Turnover is up from Pounds 1m in 1980 to about Pounds 180m last year and, like other dominant food processing companies in the area, it is under local ownership. The area is strong in locally-owned premium food brands, such as Baxters of Speyside and Walkers of Aberlour. But behind the big, successful food companies there are also small traditional farms whose finances have recently been fragile. And it is those family farms which underpin the economies of small towns and villages throughout the area, where the eventual loss of oil industry commuters can be expected to hit very hard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------            Unemployment by travel-to-work area (December 1993)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                 Males     Females     Total     % rate    Change since                                                    4.6        November  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Grampian       10,438       3,466    13,904        4.6           +478 Scotland      184,070      52,444   236,514        9.3         +2,364 UK          2,146,045     636,651 2,782,696        9.9        +13,258  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Economic Development &amp; Planning Department, Grampian Regional Council  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Vardon pays Pounds 10m for eight marine centres VARDON, the leisure attractions group which owns the London and York Dungeons, has agreed to buy Sea Life Centres for Pounds 9.9m in cash and stock, and plans a share placement, and Stock Exchange listing, to help fund the acquisition. Sea Life owns and operates eight marine life centres around Britain and operates the Blackpool Centre, in which it has a 50 per cent stake with First Leisure. Vardon acquired the Dungeons in March for Pounds 5.6m from Kunick after Mr David Hudd, chairman, and Mr Nickolas Irens, chief executive and former finance director of First Leisure joined the board of Winchmore, restructured the company and changed its name. Yesterday the group reported interim pre-tax profit of Pounds 337,000 on turnover of Pounds 639,000 for the 27 weeks to July 5 and an interim dividend of 0.25p. Vardon is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.3m, earnings per share of 4p, and a final dividend of 0.5p per share for the year. Under the terms of the deal the Pounds 9.9m purchase price will be satisfied by Pounds 2.5m cash and the issue of 16.36m Vardon shares, of which 11.9m will be placed on behalf of the vendors at 45p per share. The cash element of the purchase, together with about Pounds 1.3m of working capital for the group, will be provided through the placement of a further 11m shares in Vardon at the same price.</p>

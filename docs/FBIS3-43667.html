A statement issued today by USP representatives in Cairo  notes that the USP and a number of Somali forces have pressed  for such a move for more than two years. The statement says  that the move will help curb the power of certain irresponsible  groups that made financial gains and got media attention due to  their blackmail of UN organizations.    In their statement, Somali forces express support for the UN  decision to deploy about 16,000 soldiers to protect public  facilities, convoys, and refugees. The decision, chosen from  among three options submitted by UN Secretary General Dr. Buturs  Ghali to the UN Security Council, is reasonable and correct, the  statement says.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Cabinet plans watchdog for secret services THE intelligence services are to be subjected to parliamentary scrutiny for the first time as part of Mr John Major's drive for more open government. Senior Whitehall officials confirmed yesterday that the cabinet committee charged with oversight of MI5 and MI6 had agreed in principle to set up a parliamentary watchdog to oversee the services' activities. The watchdog - likely to have members from all three main parties - would have authority to review the domestic and overseas intelligence policies, including the electronics eavesdropping operations of GCHQ. It might also be given the right to investigate particular intelligence operations. Officials expect its membership to be drawn from the substantial number of privy councillors on the Commons back benches and in the House of Lords. Its deliberations would remain secret, but it might publish general policy recommendations. Mr Major, who chaired the ministerial meeting that last week approved the system, has already said he intends to legislate to put MI6 - the overseas intelligence service - on the same statutory basis as MI5, its domestic counterpart. Last month the prime minister confirmed formally, for the first time, the existence of MI6 and named its chief as Sir Colin McColl. MI5 was put on a statutory basis in 1989 but is only accountable to parliament through ministers. Both services would be treated in the same way under the new system, with a complaints procedure for MI6 similar to that for MI5. Complaints by members of the public or by employees against MI5 are examined by a commissioner appointed by the government. The Whitehall officials said a number of further ministerial meetings would be needed to work out the details but the government expects to pass the necessary legislation within a year.</p>

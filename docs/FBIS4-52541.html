			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Raps Kim Yong-sam's Separatist Outcry" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam  recently at a party in "Chongwadae" contended that the  reunification of the country is "fantasy," "unification concept  must be discarded."    Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says no one but a  separatist dead set against reunification can make such remarks.    The news analyst says:    It is crystal-clear that the traitor Kim Yong-sam wants a  permanent division of the country and fratricidal war, not  reunification and peace.    It is a never-to-be-condoned crime for him to block  reunification desired by the nation and drive the chariot of  permanent division for the sake of his personal ease and power.    The South Korean people have concluded once again that the  reunification of the country is impossible as long as the  traitor Kim Yong-sam is left alone.    For the reunification of the country, the supreme desire of  the nation, the Kim Yong-sam group of separatists must be  removed as early as possible.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam must look straight at the trend of  the nation toward reunification, give up the anti-reunification,  separatist moves, step down and face judgement by history as  demanded by all people.</p>

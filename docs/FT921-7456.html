			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Man in the News: Political gambler raises the stakes - F W de Klerk Mr F W de Klerk, the South African president, is asking his white countrymen to do what voters everywhere hate doing: face reality. He is counting on them to show - through a referendum held within the next three weeks - that they reject the apartheid fantasies of the past and accept the inevitability of black rule. But for a people fed with deluded notions of racial superiority for hundreds of years, the prospect of a multi-racial future is terrifying. Mr de Klerk is gambling that reason will triumph over fear in white hearts. If he is right, South Africa will have taken another huge leap towards a democratic and peaceful future. If he is wrong, the consequences could not be more dire; the white supremacist Conservative party would take power, the African National Congress (ANC) would do its best to launch a revolution, and South Africa would descend again into chaos. It is a gamble to take one's breath away, and just the sort of bold move which so delights the president. He could easily have avoided such a showdown. With a huge majority in parliament, Mr de Klerk's National party could have dismissed its loss in this week's Potchefstroom by-election as no more than an embarrassment. Mr de Klerk could have blamed the result on the dismal state of the economy. But that is not his style. He argued in Cabinet for immediate action to staunch the flow of white voters to the Conservatives, who have won a steady series of by-elections since the 1989 general election. Some ministers argued against a referendum now. With constitutional negotiations only just under way, there is no outline yet of a power-sharing deal to calm white fears. With the economy in a three-year recession, crime and violence occupying every white mind, and the added misfortune of drought, this is hardly the time to ask for a vote of confidence in Nationalist rule. But Mr de Klerk believes he has the nation's confidence. He trusts his abilities as a leader, his vision of a future where blacks rule but do not dominate, his commitment to the Afrikaner nation from which he springs. He vowed to demonstrate it through a referendum, rather than tolerate the daily jeers of Conservative members of parliament, who claim he no longer represents most whites. It was a political decision to call the Conservatives' bluff on the issue of white support. Without firm white backing, he cannot negotiate from strength on a new constitution. And if he can trounce the Conservatives in a referendum, he will cut the political ground from beneath their feet, and help defuse the threat of right-wing terrorism. But it was also, as Mr de Klerk said, 'a question of honour'. For this is a broedertwis, or family feud among Afrikaners. Right-wing Afrikaners often taunt Mr de Klerk with the charge that he has betrayed his nation by dismantling the superstructure of apartheid, created to protect the language and identity of the Afrikaner as a island in a sea of black cultures. For his part, Mr de Klerk argues that the Afrikaners' only hope lies in accepting change before it is forced on them through revolution. If the Afrikaner cedes power now, he will still be left with enough influence to protect Afrikanerdom in perpetuity. He is convinced that apartheid, which remains the platform of the Conservative party, could never survive the force of numbers ranged against it: 28m blacks, 5m whites. He acknowledges that most whites still prefer apartheid; they want to live with their own kind in a culture which reflects white values. But, as the president told the voters of Potchefstroom last week, apartheid is no longer an option. The grand strategists of apartheid - former prime ministers such as Hendrik Verwoerd and John Vorster - demonstrably could not make it work; Mr de Klerk asked voters to judge whether Mr Andries Treurnicht, the rather insipid leader of the Conservative party, could do any better. Mr de Klerk has not renounced apartheid out of the goodness of his heart; he is haunted by an apocalyptic vision of the consequences of pursuing it. He believes it would make race war inevitable. As he told senior policemen two years ago, 'if this Armageddon takes place and blood flows ankle deep in the streets and four or five million people lie dead - the problem will remain exactly the same as before the shooting started.' That explains his conversion to multi-racialism: the alternative was too ghastly to contemplate. Last week the president urged the voters of Potchefstroom to put aside their preference for racial purity and vote for the policy they thought would work. It was surprisingly honest counsel from a politician - and hardly the stuff to win him many accolades. Now he will put the same choice to the national electorate. The referendum question has yet to be written, but it will certainly be formulated to guarantee maximum positive response. Voters will probably be asked whether they support peacefully negotiated change - the Conservative party currently refuses to negotiate with black groups - and may be asked for a vote of confidence in the president himself. Either way, the Nationalists are confident they will win, perhaps by a substantial margin. They were also confident about Potchefstroom. But a referendum is not a by-election: the Nationalists can manipulate the referendum question; and Mr de Klerk's promise to resign if he loses will concentrate the minds of voters on the consequences of a 'no' vote. Many will shy away from the prospect of a Conservative government; they may prefer an uncertain future under the Nationalists to the certainty of race war. Recent opinion polls also give Mr de Klerk cause for optimism. Last week's Sunday newspapers carried a poll showing 63 per cent support for the president among whites, against 15 per cent for Mr Treurnicht. And the Conservatives' election pitch is hardly alluring: they offer racial purity, but at a price. 'We must make a choice between the survival of the Afrikaner volk and two cars in the garage. If sacrifices are required of us we will make them,' a party spokesman vowed recently. With luck, Mr de Klerk's gamble will pay off. He will have proved that he is not prone to the Gorbachev malaise: a leader estranged from his people, more popular abroad than at home. But if the Gorbachev parallel is correct, and Mr de Klerk is ousted from power, South Africa will retreat into a feudal past where violence prompts repression, engendering more violence. For most South Africans, that is the stuff of which nightmares are made.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Loophole on rents to be closed - Inland Revenue THE Inland Revenue will gain an additional Pounds 230m in the 1992-94 tax years by closing a loophole which allows companies to defer tax payments on rents. There was speculation in the City that large companies including Hanson, British Aerospace and Burton would incur substantial additional tax charges in the next two financial years as a result of the change. The budget proposal would prevent the practice from today of permitting one company to claim tax relief on rent paid in arrears, while a connected company receiving this rental income pays tax on it in the year it is received. Since the late 1970s it has become common for a company to transfer all the properties from its trading businesses into the control of a specially-created property investment company, according to Mr Derek Jenkins, a partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. It then grants each trading company leases on their properties, with rents payable at the start of the new tax year. Until now the trading companies have been able to claim tax relief on the rents in one year, and pay corporation tax against the rental income the following year. Most of the gains come in the first year of the creation of the property company.</p>

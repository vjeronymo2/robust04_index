			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Andrew Holmes - insight into world of energy Sir, I am writing on behalf of all of Andrew Holmes's friends and admirers, both inside and outside of parliament, who benefited so enormously from his unrivalled insight and breadth of knowledge of the world of electricity, politics and commerce. Not once, even during his busiest moments, did Andrew deny any of us access to information and intelligence central to our understanding of the enormous changes being witnessed over the past decade in the energy industries. He reinforced our trust in and affection for the FT's specialist energy publications. His death (Obituary: 'Trenchant analyst of energy', September 14) at the age of 36 is a cruel blow, not only to his wife Claire and to his children, Lottie and Jack, but to all who counted him as a friend, an adviser and, quite simply, as one hell of a good bloke. Kim Howells, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

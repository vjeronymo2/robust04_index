			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Courses offered to 30,000 jobless - Full-time education This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. OPPORTUNITIES for 30,000 unemployed people to pursue relevant full-time courses of education for up to a year, with fees paid and an allowance equivalent to their benefit entitlement, were announced. The scheme, Learning for Work, will be administered by Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) and Local Enterprise Councils which will contract with further education colleges or other course providers. Community Action will provide 60,000 opportunities for people to do voluntary work on a part-time basis at the same time as looking for work. They will receive an allowance equivalent to their benefit plus Pounds 10. The programme will be delivered by the Employment Service, contracting with the voluntary sector and other providers. Projects might include caring or environmental activity. The scheme will start in the summer. A total of 10,000 more places will be funded on the Business Start Up scheme. The Department of Employment said this should mean at least 50,000 unemployed people can start their own businesses with the support of training and counselling, and a weekly allowance for up to 15 months. Tecs will bid competitively for money from a Pounds 25m fund to develop new ways to help unemployed people into work and create jobs. Projects will be chosen on the basis of the degree of innovation, the effect on unemployment, the degree of involvement of the private sector and the ability to deliver practical projects quickly. There will be four pilots in different parts of the country to test how effective it is to encourage the recruitment of long-term unemployed people by paying a temporary subsidy to employers. Different approaches will be tried out in the different pilot areas. Employers who take on people who have been unemployed either for more than two years or more than four years, depending on the pilot areas, will be paid a subsidy related to average benefits. The pilots, two run by Tecs and two by the Employment Service, will start in the summer. The new package will cost about Pounds 230m - about Pounds 125m once the estimated saving in benefits has been taken into account.</p>

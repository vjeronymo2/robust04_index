			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOW CONGRESS IS THE PEACE OBSTACLE  </P> <P> There is an energy in Nicaragua and a confidence -- unsupported by any evidence  -- that something will turn up, which has kept that battered land running on  empty well beyond what seems reasonable. Time and again, the energy and  confidence have produced results that analysts denied were possible. Free  elections were, indeed, held in February, and a coalition of parties hostile to  the ruling Sandinista party did, indeed, win.  </P> <P> After repeated false starts, the soldiers who make up what's left of the  American-sponsored Contras have agreed to stop roaming the countryside and hand  over their weapons to a United Nations peacekeeping force. That has not  happened yet, but Contra leaders and Sandinista Defense Minister Humberto  Ortega, the hard-line brother of President Daniel Ortega, have signed on. That  would mean a peaceful transfer of government to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,  the president-elect, on Wednesday -- another once-improbable event.  </P> <P> But nature has now imposed a rigid deadline on one crucial aspect of  Nicaragua's reconstruction, which means that if Congress isn't careful, it  could wind up derailing the very recovery it says it wants for that  long-ravaged country. Washington has lifted its trade embargo, putting  Nicaragua in a position to resume exporting bananas, beef, coffee and other  products that can earn dollars in the United States. With the spring planting  season already upon them, farmers have to make decisions about crops. They need  money to draw down some of Nicaragua's debts so that they can borrow for seed  and new farm equipment. Yet Congress is sitting on President Bush's request for  $300 million, money that would let them get that fresh start.  </P> <P> Keeping the peace and forging a real government from a coalition of 14  fractious groups of supporters that include conservatives and Communists are  challenges enough for Chamorro. But no matter how smoothly she might manage  those tasks, Nicaragua's economy is the key to the future of the nation and to  its fragile new democracy. Unemployment runs about 30%. If not uncountable, the  inflation rate is unthinkable. Nicaragua can miss spring planting this year and  still get back on its feet. But that might well take some of the edge off its  sense of confidence. Congress must not let that happen.  </P></p>

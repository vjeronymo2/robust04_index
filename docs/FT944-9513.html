			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japanese developers hit by lower rental rates Japan's leading property developers were hit by declining office rental rates and a fall in interest income in the first six months of the fiscal year. Mitsui Fudosan saw a 50 per cent plunge in recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - to Y4.7bn (Dollars 48.2m) due to a sharp narrowing of profit margins because of a cut in office rents and a rise in expenses stemming from sales of luxury houses. Sales fell 0.3 per cent to Y342.5bn and after-tax profits dropped 43.6 per cent to Y4.2bn. Product related costs were equivalent to 87.7 per cent of income. In the second half, the company expects to post extraordinary losses of Y80bn related to aid to its finance subsidiary, but it added that the losses would be covered by profits from shareholdings. For the full year to March, recurring profits are expected to fall 26.8 per cent to Y12bn on an 8.2 per cent decline in sales to Y730bn. Mitsubishi Estate said interim recurring profits fell 4.3 per cent to Y29.6bn while sales rose 12.3 per cent to Y229.5bn due to its new buildings in Tokyo and Yokohama. After-tax profits rose 18.3 per cent to Y21.5bn. For the full year to March, the company expects recurring profits to decline 26.2 per cent to Y35bn on a 4.6 per cent fall in sales to Y420bn.</p>

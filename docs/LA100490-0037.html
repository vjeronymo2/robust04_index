			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: FAIRFAX DISTRICT;  </P> <P> HEARING ON PARK LABREA FEE  </P> <P> A hearing has been set on an appeal of the city's rejection of a Park Labrea  proposal to charge tenants for the more than $3-million cost of fencing and  gating the 10,000-resident apartment complex.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Rent Stabilization Division of the Los Angeles Community  Development Department said the hearing, previously scheduled for Sept. 28, was  postponed at the request of the Park Labrea management.  </P> <P> The hearing will be held Nov. 16 at 9 a.m. in the Rent Adjustment Commission's  eighth-floor hearing room, at 215 W. 6th St.  </P> <P> In its decision, which was handed down in May, the Rent Stabilization Division  found that Forest City Management Co. did not provide enough information to  justify the proposed rent increases and found that the fencing and gating  system was not yet operating when the application was filed.  </P> <P> Forest City, which operates Park Labrea and also owns a half-interest in the  4,200-unit complex, submitted its application for a rent increase on Sept. 25  of last year, hoping to be allowed to charge tenants $12.09 a month in  perpetuity to defray the cost of the $3,054,588 security system.  </P> <P> Revised rules that went into effect Oct. 1 would allow an increase of $6.05 a  month over a six-year period.  </P></p>

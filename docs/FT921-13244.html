			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Observer: Codswallop at Lloyd's AT THE centre of every great institutional row, you will usually find an organisation chart. It is not surprising, therefore, that some of the noisiest debate about last week's report on the future of Lloyd's, the insurance market, should centre on its final chapter, which discusses how the market should be led and supervised. The report argues that Lloyd's problems are essentially commercial, and sets out ways to make the market more competitive and profitable. It concludes with proposals to reorganise Lloyd's leadership, to give it more of a business emphasis. Mr David Rowland, chairman of the task force that produced the report, believes that this reorganisation is essential to bring about the wider changes he recommends. He might have expected at least a polite hearing for these views. Instead, he has been blown a raspberry. To understand why, look at the present management of Lloyd's. Currently, the 28-member Lloyd's council is responsible both for the strict new regulatory regime introduced after the scandals of the 1970s, and for the market's support services. The task force argues that this does not work. There is no clear focus of responsibility for the development of Lloyd's as a business. And, says the report, the independence and distance required for the council's regulatory functions 'are not helpful in developing and supporting Lloyd's collective business performance; rather they are obstacles to the total commitment of all concerned to Lloyd's competitive success'. Consequently, there should be a clear split between a market board responsible for running the business of Lloyd's and a regulatory council responsible for policing it. Raspberry-blowing That was where the raspberry-blowing started. Lloyd's council welcomed the report as a whole, but singled out this proposal, alone among the task force's 65, for immediate rejection. It argued that the market needs a unified leadership, handling both regulation and business issues. Mr Rowland expressed his regret, in moderate terms, that the council had not seen fit to accept his advice. Lloyd's chairman Mr David Coleridge replied, in somewhat less moderate language, that some of the task force's thinking was 'codswallop'. That must not be his final word. There is an underlying agreement between the two sides of the debate: that Lloyd's commercial crisis is the central issue. The question, therefore, is how best to ensure the business leadership that the market badly needs. Clearer approach Mr Rowland's approach, with its organisation charts and call for a new Lloyd's act of parliament, may not be the best solution. But it is clearer and more comprehensible than the council's counter-offer: a review of its own structure 'closely attentive to the need to maintain a strong business orientation in decision taking in the market'. What makes the council's rejection of the report's final chapter particularly unfortunate is that it contains within it the foundations of a workable compromise, described as a transitional structure. This would require no legal changes, but achieve most of the desired aims. It is a useful starting point for discussion. The debate is the more important because of the other contentious issue that remains unresolved in the wake of the task force's report. Among those directly affected, there has been great dismay that the report has found no solution to the problems faced by those Names exposed to the worst losses of the late 1980s, and no easy way out for those trapped in 'open years' where liabilities cannot yet be estimated. That was predictable: no report produced by consensus was ever likely to resolve these difficult issues. The bitterness they create will continue to eat away at the heart of the market, however; it has given a fresh edge to the debate on governance. Rightly or wrongly, the council's response to the task force's organisational proposals has been seen as the protective reaction of the Lloyd's establishment, and a poor omen for the prospects of the rest of the report. The council must think again.</p>

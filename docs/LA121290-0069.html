			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAM UPDATE;  </P> <P> PLAYOFF OBLIVION HAS BECOME AS SIMPLE AS 1 + 1  </P> <P> A loss to San Francisco Monday night at Anaheim Stadium combined with a victory  by either Green Bay, Minnesota or Dallas Sunday would mathematically eliminate  the Rams from a chance at the playoffs.  </P> <P> Even if they beat the 49ers, however, their postseason chances are slim because  of disadvantages in the tiebreaking system.  </P> <P> The Rams have lost to both the Packers and the Cowboys, and the Vikings have  the advantage in games against common opponents.  </P> <P> "The loss (to the Saints) takes us out of any realistic playoff hopes, I  think," Coach John Robinson said. "I think the focus we'll put on the (49er)  game is the same, with or without the loss, but it would have been more  exciting going in with a three-game win streak."  </P> <P> The Rams used every defensive look they could think of against the 49ers during  their 28-17 victory at Candlestick Park on Nov. 25, and quarterback Joe Montana  acknowledged after the game that the 49ers had been confused.  </P> <P> The Rams played a lot of nickel defense, daring the 49ers to run the ball. The  New York Giants and the Cincinnati Bengals have since employed similar  strategies, and both lost close games. But Robinson said the 49ers are starting  their usual "December rush."  </P> <P> "I think they are looking forward to establishing their running game now, much  the same as they did last year," he said.

			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS OK RECYCLING POLICY  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously approved a policy to encourage  employees to participate in a paper recycling program and use white paper  whenever possible because colored paper cannot be recycled.  </P> <P> The new policy, proposed by Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, also asks county  vendors to submit bids on white recycled paper.  </P> <P> The county sends out about 7,500 bid notices a year, said county purchasing  manager Michael Kolodisner.  </P> <P> For each notice, the county receives an average of three bids. From now on,  each bid notice will carry a recycling message.  </P> <P> "I'm sure if the county says it would like to see the bids on recycled paper,  the bidders would comply," Kolodisner said.  </P> <P> Determined to save more trees and lighten the load in the county land dumps,  Vasquez said in his proposal that the county can set an example for other major  employers in the county by adopting a recycling program.  </P> <P> "As a major paper purchaser, county government can make a difference in the  market by developing a policy of purchasing white recycled paper for the  majority of its needs," Vasquez said.  </P> <P> The county already operates a pilot desktop recycling program, which encourages  employees to dump white paper in recycling bins rather than in the  wastebasket.LILY ENG  </P></p>

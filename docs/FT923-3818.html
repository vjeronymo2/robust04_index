			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Captain leads from below deck: Germany's ruling coalition is beset by political indecision and economic malaise It is hard these days to find anyone in Bonn, or in the rest of Germany for that matter, with a good word to say about Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The Unification Chancellor, barely three weeks away from celebrating his 10th anniversary in office, not to mention 19 years as leader of his Christian Democratic Union (CDU), seems to be under attack as never before - from inside the ranks of his own party, and from outside. He is accused of indecision and lack of leadership. Normally supportive conservative newspapers such as the Frankfurter Allgemeine (FAZ) and Bonn's General-Anzeiger talk of alarm and confusion in government ranks. There are rumours on all sides of a Grand Coalition - an alliance of the CDU on the right and the Social Democrats (SPD) on the left - to preside over the painful process of uniting Germany. It is a coalition that Mr Kohl has stated flatly he will never lead. Bild Zeitung, the country's one genuinely popular and influential newspaper, with a circulation of more than 4m, is convinced there is a conspiracy afoot. It accuses none other than Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the chancellor's right-hand man and the CDU leader in parliament, of seeking to overthrow his mentor. True or not, the reports and rumours are indications of a malaise in the ranks of the German ruling coalition, and in Mr Kohl's own CDU, of troubles that the summer holiday has clearly failed to dispel, but rather caused to flourish. Is it the beginning of the end for the chancellor, or merely a large hiccup in the uneasy life of a German coalition government facing an unprecedented array of political, economic and external problems? On Sunday night, the chancellor hosted an emergency meeting of coalition leaders to resolve their differences. It focused on a very public disagreement over how to finance the growing costs of subsidising the east German economy. Mr Schauble and a large part of the parliamentary CDU, especially from the east, wanted a compulsory bond or levy to finance future unity costs, to be paid by high-income earners. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the Christian Social Union, wanted no more than a voluntary German bond, tax-free, but low interest-bearing. Mr Otto Lambsdorff and the Free Democrats appeared to want nothing at all but stricter savings measures, and allowing market forces to take their course. They failed to agree on any new initiative at all, and slunk away into the night after midnight through a side-door in the chancellor's office  - well away from the waiting eyes and ears of the press. On Monday, Mr Kohl produced an idea of his own or, at least, a revived idea from somebody else - to summon a round table of employers, trade unions, local government, his own coalition and the opposition. They should sit down and hammer out a consensus on financing unification, he declared - a solidarity pact in which everyone would agree to make sacrifices. The idea was first proposed almost a year ago by Germany's five leading economic institutes, and rejected primarily by Chancellor Kohl, although the trade unions themselves were also unwilling to bind themselves into a wage-restraining pact. The chancellor's advisers argue that now everyone is aware of the need to make sacrifices, and particularly to restrain wage rises in the east. The most recent figures put eastern productivity at the end of last year at 32 per cent of the western level, while wages stood at 52.7 per cent. At least Mr Kohl's invitation was enough to buy time, to face down the dissenters in his party ranks, and gather his strength. All his fair-weather friends, including a chastened Mr Schauble, pledged continuing support. It was clear there was no alternative in sight. Yesterday the chancellor was back at the rostrum in the Bundestag, his same old belligerent, truculent self. Mr Kohl mocked his detractors, saying he had been promised an anniversary present of a collage of newspaper headlines predicting his imminent demise over the past decade. He planned to hang it on his office wall. He warned his own dissidents to stay in line, and failed yet again to give any clear signal of leadership or direction. It was a classic, unhelpful, even deliberately confusing, performance from one of German politics' great survivors. Mr Kohl's message seemed to be: 'Steady as she goes', even if others regard the direction as decidedly unsteady. Mr Bjorn Engholm, an increasingly self-confident leader of the SPD, accused him of deserting the bridge on a rudderless ship of state in a gathering gale. The question is whether Mr Kohl's imperturbable insistence on leading from below decks is going to be enough to cope with the complex of reefs and shallows now surrounding the German vessel. The immediate problems are fourfold. The greatest is the cost of rebuilding the east German economy, and of cushioning the bitter blow of unemployment for a very large proportion of its inhabitants. The second is the challenge of reviving the west German economy, now teetering on the edge of a recession, without any prospect of a recovery in exports to pull it back. At the same time, the instability of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union is compounding the problems, both economic and political. Almost all traditional exports from eastern Germany to its eastern neighbours have dried up, removing the one small hope from eastern industry. Orders from abroad in the east were down 28 per cent in May and June combined. That instability is also the prime cause of an upsurge in immigrants claiming political asylum. The total is likely to exceed 400,000 this year, compared with 256,000 last year. They are the excuse for the current rash of racist attacks by young skinheads on foreigners. Finally, the traditional sheet-anchor of German external policy, commitment to integration of the European Community, is being called into question - not in Bonn, but in the country at large. The Danish vote against the Maastricht treaty unleashed a welter of pent-up concerns, above all at the prospective loss of the D-Mark in a single European currency. Chancellor Kohl can no longer reliably fall back on the European theme as the one great national unifier. It is the sudden awareness of the daunting costs of unification that has brought the crisis in the coalition to a head. A rebellion by the eastern MPs in the CDU - aware both of a disastrous loss in their political support at home and the catastrophic financial position of their own state and local governments - demanded a big new injection of cash from Bonn: an extra DM30bn (Pounds 10.7bn), on top of the DM92bn promised in next year's budget. The CDU won the last election thanks to its support in the east, itself a vote for Mr Kohl's promise of relatively painless unification. In the latest opinion poll published by the FAZ yesterday, CDU support in the former GDR is down to 22.5 per cent, against an election-night total of 41.8 per cent. Mr Schauble, for reasons still unclear, was persuaded to back the dissidents, and proposed the blunt instrument of a 'compulsory bond' to be foisted on the better-paid. He has acute political instincts, and he knows that the popularity of the coalition is at a low point across the country. (The CDU is now trailing the SPD in the west as well, by 34.8 to 37.3 per cent.) If he has been manoeuvring towards a Grand Coalition (he denies it) then one incentive would be to share the pain of a very difficult period ahead. The need to find further funds for the east has also been driven by the belated admission in government ranks of the size of the black hole in public spending which looms around 1995. That is the year in which the exchequer must take responsibility for the German unity fund, the Treuhand privatisation fund and former East German government debts. Between the three, that means an estimated extra DM440bn to be added to the debt of the federal and state governments. Overall, public sector debt is expected almost to have doubled between 1990 and 1996 from DM1,225bn to DM2,386bn, according to Deutsche Bank calculations. The economy is in danger of getting locked into a cycle of slow growth and high interest rates, dragged down by the burden of borrowing for the east. The economic collapse of eastern Germany and the bleak job prospects for its school-leavers have caused profound alienation among young people - and they are the very ones now attacking asylum-seekers' hostels. Chancellor Kohl stands accused of having failed to react swiftly or firmly enough to the rash of violence against foreigners. His emphasis throughout has been on providing a reason for the attacks, rather than in condemning any violence. Until now, the government has refused to see asylum-seeking as part of a basic immigration problem, insisting that Germany is 'not an immigration country', although it has traditionally used large numbers of migrant workers from Turkey and the former Yugoslavia. It is a matter of distinguishing genuine asylum-seekers (estimated at no more than 3 or 4 per cent of the total) from job-seekers who must be deported, the government says. The failure to deal with the issue has failed to discourage the racist violence, and a steady rise in support for the extreme right-wing parties, such as the Republicans. In the latest poll they have 8.0 per cent support in the west, and 4.4 per cent in the east. After a gloomy assessment of the problems on all fronts, Mr Kohl yesterday fell back on Europe and the need for a whole-hearted commitment to political as well as economic union in the EC as his rallying cry for unity. Yet even that has a hollow echo. Germans are very much aware that the other EC member states are no longer so enthusiastic about European union. If France votes in a half-hearted way for Maastricht, even if it does not vote No, it would encourage the doubters in Germany. Mr Kohl is not going to call a referendum. It would have no constitutional basis, and anyway he knows the decision would probably come down to the D-Mark. The answer would be No. So he will rely on the Bundestag to swallow its reservations, and ratify the treaty by the end of the year. It will hardly be an enthusiastic endorsement. The same could be said for the coalition's support of the chancellor: hardly an enthusiastic endorsement. But for the time being, a captain who lingers below the decks and hopes for a fairer wind seems better than no captain at all.</p>

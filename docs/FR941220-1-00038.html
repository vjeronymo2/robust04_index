			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As detailed below in the section on costs, EPA finds that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative Water approach would result in an annual national cost of $86  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million annually, as compared to an annual cost for central treatment by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all affected systems of $147 million. The $86 million estimate would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially lower except that EPA assumed conservatively that about 25%  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of affected systems would choose central treatment or regionalization even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with Option 1 available to them. Of the $86 million, $7 million would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cost to the 1,500 systems choosing the public notification/Alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water method of compliance, and $71 million would be the cost to the 500  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems choosing central treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To understand how the logistics of the option would work, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency chose two system sizes: A PWS serving a town of 500 people, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another serving a town of 3,300 people. As very few systems (approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40) serving 3,300 people or more are expected to exceed the sulfate MCL,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this system size was chosen to illustrate that it would be more cost- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective for a system of that size to centrally treat. Costs were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated by using national averages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a population of 500, the Agency assumed (based on analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Census Bureau and Current Population Reports data) that there would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eight households (500 times 1.68%) with infants and 30 households with new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents (500 times 16.4% divided by 2.6 persons per household) at any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given time. (EPA assumed that an average household contains 2.6 people.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New residents and infants would require Alternative Water for 6 weeks and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20 weeks, respectively. A system serving this population of 500 would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to deliver a maximum of approximately 8,800 liters of bottled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water annually, or 24 liters per day, as illustrated by the calculations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 30 households&times;2.6 persons&times;2 liters&times;42 days=6,552 liters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8 infants&times;2 liters&times;140 days=2,240 liters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Total Annual Bottled Water Needs=8,792 liters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Average Daily Bottled Water Needs 8,792/365 days=24 liters  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The above calculation is given as an example only, and the 24- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liter figure is a high estimate. The required mixing of tap water with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bottled water over time for infants and new residents would reduce their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption of bottled water. The cost analysis in the RIA for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking assumes that bottled water will represent, on average, half the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water consumption for infants and new residents, and that customers will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exercise their option to have less than 2 liters per day delivered over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entire period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although it is up to the water system to decide how to deliver the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water, the Agency finds that the system could contract the delivery service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out to a bottled water supplier or could procure and distribute bottled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water itself. For the sake of simplifying the model, EPA assumed that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> town with a population of 500 would not have to install any POUs or POEs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and would rely entirely on bottled water for the target population. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency recognizes that, in actuality, some percentage of such towns may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a restaurant and/or gas station, and could use a POU/POE device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, these towns would be few in number, and the simplified model is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retained for costing purposes only. If such a town had very few travelers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passing through, for example, a restaurant or gas station might find it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more cost-effective to use permanent signs and have bottled water available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for those few travelers. EPA assumes that systems which rarely serve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> target population would comply by posting signs and having bottled water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for visitors, rather than install POE/POU devices. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solicits comment on the types of Alternative Water that PWSs would choose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a town with a population of 3300, the logistics become more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complicated. The estimated number of households with infants increases from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8 to 55. The number of households with new residents becomes 210, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of liters of bottled water to be delivered per day is approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 170. It is also estimated that there will be 3 POU units per town. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency thinks that few PWSs serving populations this large will choose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Option 1, and will choose instead to centrally treat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are several disadvantages to Option 1. First, it requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons to learn about sulfate and take action to protect themselves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, because high-sulfate water is still available at the tap, Option 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not guarantee that all target audiences will be protected. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comment on the feasibility, equity, enforceability, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attractiveness of the option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although EPA believes that allowing compliance with the MCL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the use of POUs, POEs, and bottled water is acceptable in the case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of sulfate, the Agency continues to believe that it should not be allowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the case of other drinking water contaminants, for which the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibitions in 40 CFR 141.100 and 141.101 still would apply. Option 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to override the prohibition in these sections against using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bottled water and POU devices as a means of compliance with the sulfate MCL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of its unique characteristics. The susceptible population is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited, and the health effects are short-lived, so the logistics of Option  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1 are feasible for smaller systems. The effects are immediate, so the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause/effect relationship of drinking water containing high levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfate can be easily demonstrated, and the affected population can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> readily convinced of the need for precautions. EPA is unaware of any other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drinking water contaminant having these unique features. Therefore, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considers Alternative Water and public notification/education to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable means for compliance with the MCL for sulfate, but not for other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminants, given current information on health risk and treatment costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the burden of administering Alternative Water in larger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems, noncompliance and the difficulties of enforcement become larger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns. Therefore, EPA considered, but decided against, limiting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability of Option 1 to smaller systems (e.g., systems serving fewer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 3,300 persons). Such a limitation would be unlikely to have any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practical effect since, for cost efficiency reasons, systems above this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> size would probably choose central treatment. Also, EPA's occurrence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projections indicate that few if any systems above 3,300 are likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceed a sulfate MCL of 500 mg/L.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

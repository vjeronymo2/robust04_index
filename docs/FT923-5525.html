			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Building materials Yesterday's big falls in the shares of Meyer, Heywood Williams and Hepworth suggest the script of that much hyped recovery story at the 'light' end of the building materials sector can now be ripped up. July's 6 per cent fall in the turnover of builders' merchants certainly seemed to have convinced the market that Meyer, for one, will be unable to maintain its dividend this year. As at the heavier end of the sector  - bricks, tiles and aggregates as opposed to glass, pipes and boilers - the problem is as much one of collapsing prices as it is of falling demand. Volumes in aggregates, bricks and rooftiles, indeed, are so far holding up surprisingly well thanks to the road programme and flat housebuilding activity. If the industry's overcapacity could be sorted out, the long-term prospects at the heavy end of the building material industry might be relatively more attractive.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov has sent a letter  to European Union [EU] President Jacques Delors warning that  during recent weeks Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] has been left to face the Greek economic  embargo and the hermetically closed borders with Greece alone.  Gligorov stresses that this could result in a dramatic economic  destabilization of Macedonia, and consequently of the overall  situation in the region. The Macedonian president goes on to  say that the EU must find a solution to this problem, and notes  the EU's slowness, lack of determination and unequal treatment  of the two sides. At the end of his letter to Jacques Delors,  Gligorov stresses that if the problem with Athens is not solved,  Macedonia will have to initiate a discussion of the Greek  embargo in the Security Council.</p>

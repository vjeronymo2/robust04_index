			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Holmes &amp; Marchant in the red Holmes &amp; Marchant, the marketing consultancy group, announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 160,000 for the year to September 30. There were profits of Pounds 2.1m last time. The loss was after an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.29m (Pounds 564,000) relating to reorganisation, empty property costs and provision against property values. Mr John Holmes, the chairman, said the losses at CCD in Spain, referred to in the interim report, had continued into the second half. As no upturn was expected for the current year the group's 75 per cent interest had been sold to its president. Losses relating to the disposal are shown as an extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.87m. Mr Holmes said that cost benefits from the recent reorganisation would continue in the first half of the current year. Turnover fell to Pounds 37.4m (Pounds 46.2m). Losses per share amounted to 1p (7.3p earnings) and again there is no final dividend.</p>

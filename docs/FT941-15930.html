			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK potato board moves to head off revolt Britain's Potato Marketing Board moved yesterday to head off a revolt by growers who want its 60-year-old marketing scheme wound up immediately rather than waiting for abolition by the government in 1997. Some producers, particularly in Scotland, are angry that the board has accepted government proposals for a slimmed-down role for the next three years. They want the board to hold a poll of producers on its future, arguing that it has already abandoned its main function by ending intervention buying of surplus potatoes and making production quotas more flexible. 'There may be growers who don't like the changes and who call for a poll to revoke the scheme,' said Mr Alasdair Fairbairn, the board's chief executive. 'The danger is that the baby might be thrown out with the bathwater.' Unveiling proposals for a cut in the levy on growers from Pounds 86 a hectare to Pounds 48, or Pounds 1 a tonne, he argued that funding for the board's remaining activities of research, promotion and providing market information was vital to the industry. As an example, research on nitrogen application could save growers Pounds 600,000 immediately and up to Pounds 2m a year in the longer term through lower fertiliser costs. Work on irrigation could bring Pounds 1.4m in annual savings through more efficient use of water, while developments in the control of powdery scab disease could save growers Pounds 500,000 a year. 'If the board is spending Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2m of growers' money a year, the government are spending about Pounds 4m on potato and related research,' he said. 'If the industry is not prepared to fund research itself, the government will look very seriously at its funding. There's a lot at risk.' Mr Fairbairn said the board also had to promote consumption of fresh potatoes. The rise in potato consumption of 5-6 per cent in Britain last year was fuelled by growth in the processed market. If potato consumption in the UK fell to the levels in the US, 'we'd need only 100,000 hectares instead of the present 150,000 hectares to meet what the market requires', said Mr Fairbairn. 'There's a real interest for growers to invest to keep potatoes competitive against the social trend towards other forms of food, particularly imported rice and pasta.' The board today embarks on a series of 14 meetings with growers around the country to explain how the modified marketing scheme will operate. Growers will be able to plant up to 5 per cent more or fewer potatoes than their quota limit without penalty, only producers with 1 hectare or more of potatoes will need to register, licensing of potato merchants will end and the size of the board will be reduced from 23 members to 15. The board's staff is being cut from 280 to 160. The government plans to review the scheme before its intended abolition in 1997. Mr John Heading, the board's chairman, said a survey last summer showed three-quarters of growers wanted the potato scheme to continue. He aimed to ensure 'that in three years' time the minister of agriculture looks at us in a favourable light'. Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, is asking the European Commission to allow farmers hit by flooding more time to harvest sugar beet and potatoes on land that is due to enter set-aside on January 15. Under current rules, no harvesting can take place on set-aside land and farmers would have to abandon their crops.</p>

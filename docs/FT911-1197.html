			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Letter: Glimmer of hope in trade talks Sir, Several of the features which you ran in the issues of April 26 and the weekend of April 27/28 illustrate admirably some of the risks associated with a failure of the Uruguay Round. In particular were the reports that Japan faces trade sanctions by the US; the Korean declaration that it would maintain an import ban on rice; and the continued discussions surrounding a North American free trade area. The first of these takes forward Super 301 action to new territory; the second is no doubt action which has been promoted by the Japanese rice ban, and the third - as some commentators have noted - raises the prospect of the US becoming even more concerned with regional trade liberalisation than global trade liberalisation. These developments really do highlight the need for a resumption of serious negotiations in Geneva. One glimmer of hope came through another of your features on April 26, which indicated that the 15 negotiating groups are being slimmed down to eight negotiating areas. This actually gives some cause for optimism given the difficulties which were associated with linkage across negotiating groups and the stimulus that this gave to what Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, referred to as 'hide and seek tactics'. The fact that the new negotiating areas actually embrace cognate issues ought to make the cutting of deals easier. We must hope now that the major protagonists actually take advantage of the opportunities provided by this slimmed-down framework. Strong gestures from the US in the form of fast-track approval; from the EC on agriculture; and from Japan on rice could clear the way for a serious resumption of negotiations. The new framework raises a little the probability that these negotiations could yet reach a satisfactory conclusion. David Greenaway, Department of Economics, University of Nottingham</p>

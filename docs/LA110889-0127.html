			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> TIME FOR COMPASSION, NOT FEAR  </P> <P> It is easy to feel bad about the homeless -- there are an estimated 10,000  without shelter, many of them children, in Orange County alone -- and simply  leave it at that. But a group of Orange County churches has decided to go  beyond thinking about the homeless to actually providing shelter and food for  the winter months to some who are homeless.  </P> <P> The program is modeled after a successful shelter effort in San Diego. It will  provide a warm bed or cot, showers and meals for up to 24 people who will be  divided into two groups and be housed at churches for rotating two-week  periods. Other churches -- 25 of them are involved -- will provide volunteers,  food and other support services. Initially, at least, the focus will be on  single people who are employable so that they can also be helped to find work.  This supplements a county program in which the Santa Ana and Fullerton  armoriesare opened to as many as 250 people a night when temperatures drop  below 40 degrees or when there is a 50% chance of rain.  </P> <P> While the numbers involved in the church program are very small compared to the  need, it must be remembered that behind the overwhelming statistics are  individuals who would spend the night in a car or under a bench were it not for  the beds these churches are providing. The program will also promote  understanding. As one of the organizers of the San Diego program said: "One of  the most valuable things this program does is break down stereotypes."  </P> <P> The program represents an especially courageous attempt in the face of the  NIMBY (not-in-my-back-yard) mentality that recently has pervaded some  neighborhoods where services for the poor have been provided. It should evoke  compassion and not fear in the communities these churches serve.  </P></p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: CS/Swiss Volksbank CS Holding's offer for Swiss Volksbank has echoes of Lloyds Bank's ill-fated bid for Midland. The difference is that CS has the support of the national authorities, but the principle is the same - that rich pickings should accrue to those who can rationalise a domestic retail network in an overbanked market. Since CS is likely to carry off Volksbank at a discount of nearly 30 per cent to stated book value, it seems on to an extraordinarily good thing. The doubts begin with uncertainty about the quality of Volksbank's loan book. Volksbank was not only caught out unexpectedly last year with a Dollars 73m exposure to the Maxwell empire. It is also heavily exposed to small and medium-sized companies which have been particularly hit by recession. If the bank is cheap, that may be because of substantial provisions to come. Besides, the rationalisation could be slow, expensive and painful in a country facing high unemployment for the first time in generations. The acquisition could thus be heavily dilutive, although the additional Swiss assets may help offset the impact of the rising dollar on CS capital ratios. In the longer term the benefits of eliminating a large player in the local market will also accrue to the other two top banks which will not have faced any of the costs.</p>

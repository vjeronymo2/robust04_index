The existence of an independent Ukraine is of a strategic  dimension to Poland and is an important factor conducive to its  independence, just like the existence of an independent Poland  is of a strategic dimension to Ukraine.    2. On the basis of the assumption of irreversibility of the  changes that took place in Europe, the Polish Republic and  Ukraine express their conviction that a practical implementation  of the idea of a close Polish-Ukrainian partnership will  contribute to the establishment of an effective, all-European  security system.    3. Active measures by the Polish Republic and Ukraine for  the  sake of establishing an all-European security system should  prevent the emergence of new divisions, the rebirth of  tendencies of a hegemonisitc nature, and the creation of spheres  of influence.    Particular importance will be attached to cooperation of the  two countries within the Framework Document of the "Partnership  for Peace" program, and also within the United Nations, the  CSCE, and NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council].    4. Concerted counteraction against potential dangers to  stabilization in Central and East Europe, of both a military and  a nonmilitary nature, will require a widening and a  strengthening of cooperation based on the principles of equality  between the Polish Republic and Ukraine and all of the countries  of the region.    5. While appreciating the significance of economic factors  in the shaping of contemporary Europe and the world, the Polish  Republic and Ukraine will intensify the close and mutually  beneficial economic cooperation and also the exchange of  experiences in the area of implementing processes of economic  transformations; they will also undertake multifaceted measures  conducive to their efficient implementation.    6. While affirming their attachment to democratic principles  and values and regarding their observance as determining the  future of the Polish Republic and Ukraine, both countries will  be guided by principles according to which observance of  fundamental human rights and freedoms, including the rights of  national minorities, is an indispensable condition for  strengthening peace and security in Europe.    7. The Polish Republic and Ukraine affirm their attachment  to common values of the European civilization, which they will  use as guidelines in cooperation both between themselves and  with other countries of our continent.    8. The Polish Republic and Ukraine will facilitate the  widest possible inclusion of voivodships, districts,  enterprises, organizations, and citizens of both countries in  economic, humanitarian, and cultural cooperation, including the  "Karpaty" Euroregion.    The declaration was written in Warsaw on 21 March 1994, in  two copies--that is, in Polish and Ukrainian--with both texts  being authentic.    [signed] Foreign Minister of the Polish Republic, Andrzej  Olechowski    [signed] Foreign Minister of Ukraine, Anatoliy Zlenko</p>

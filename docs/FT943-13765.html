			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / International Company News: Full branch in Beirut for ING Internationale Nederlanden Bank (ING), based in Amsterdam, has won authorisation from Lebanon's central bank to establish a full branch in Beirut - the first such approval granted in 25 years and a sign of Lebanon's desire to revive the country's lost role as a banking and financial centre. ING promises to be only the first of several new international arrivals in Beirut, with a number of French and British groups also pursuing licences to open either representative offices or branches in Lebanon. Mr Riad Salame, the central bank governor, described the decision to accord authorisation to ING as a 'major change in our policy'. Foreign banks were previously told they must buy a local institution to participate fully in the domestic market. But in a drive to attract new foreign institutions, the central bank is now permitting banks to open a branch in the country, provided they meet a capital requirement of Dollars 5m and re-invest 30 per cent of locally-collected deposits domestically. Foreign newcomers will be restricted to a single branch, but otherwise will have no conditions on their operations. ING's authorisation is the first granted since well before Lebanon's crippling 17-year civil war and was made despite strong opposition from its 50 domestic commercial banks, which believe they should be given time to recover from the war's ravages before new entrants are allowed into the local market. ING Bank will join 15 or so foreign banks long established in Beirut, including Citibank, American Express Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank. A spokesman for ING in Amsterdam said he expected the branch to begin operations within a couple of months. It will become ING's sole Middle East branch and would concentrate on international payment transfers, corporate banking and trade finance, the spokesman said. Lebanon's central bank this week also authorised UBAF, the London-based group owned by Arab and French banks, to set up a representative office in Beirut. In addition, Banque Paribas, the French merchant bank, has submitted a request to open a branch of its London-based Paribas Capital Markets unit in Beirut, which the bank says will seek a seat on Lebanon's renascent stock market. This is presently limited to trading in Treasury bills and shares of Solidere, the property development company created to rebuild central Beirut  -itself part of the government's ambitious plan to regenerate Lebanon as a financial centre. Robert Fleming, the British investment bank, is also applying for a licence to open a Beirut representative office. The bank says it is looking to establish a regional base in Lebanon eventually to serve also Jordan and Syria, but with a more immediate eye on the development of Lebanon's stock market, the creation of local mutual funds and corporate finance. Robert Fleming says that it hopes a Beirut operation would complement its 10-year-old branch in Bahrain, which the bank says is the sole British merchant banking branch in the Gulf.</p>

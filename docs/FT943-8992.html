			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Fashion:The Lady loves to shock - Jane Mulvagh asks Lady Powell about her choice of clothes and gets a surprising answer / Me and My Wardrobe Forget propriety. Carla, Lady Powell, was wearing skin-tight, black, cashmere leggings and a smile as bright as a Cadillac chrome fender. As she greets you at the door, she exudes ebullient, recession-proof chutzpah. Married at 19, Lady Powell, the 51-year-old Italian wife of the erstwhile diplomat and Number 10 adviser, has spent the last 30 years escorting her sage plenipotentiary through the corridors of power. Ask her about her style and she answers with winning directness. 'Oh, it's short and tarty, like Crystal in 'Dynasty'.' What joy she must bring to all crusty mandarins - or 'old goats' as she affectionately calls them - for she loves to shock in Atlantic-deep decolletes, Kilimanjaro-high minis and dresses slashed from here to eternity. 'I love big shoulders, low necks, tight waists and high heels.' Whether she is hosting a private dinner for visiting dignitaries or attending a Washington banquet, her dress teeters on the borders of a diplomatic incident. Lady Powell is a devotee of high-heeled court shoes. 'I'm tiny, a midget, so I need heels, and then I feel, well . . .' she completes the picture with Monroe-like gestures. Those heels are lined up like lethal weapons along 12 shelves, each bearing half a dozen pairs of 3in-high stilettoes but there does not seem to be a single walking shoe or plimsoll among them nor even a black, brown or navy court shoe with sensible heels. Instead . . . puce, pea-green, lacquer-red, lambent patents, glittering lurex and crushed velvets. And there, on the top shelf, standing alone, the pride of her armoury, awaiting coquettish deployment, is another pair, 6in-heeled Vivienne Westwood platforms. Some of this is a bit deceptive: Paul Johnson, the writer and her daily walking companion, later tells me that she is a keen hill walker and rock climber and three very professional-looking pairs of climbing boots lurk somewhere in the house. Lady Powell is a master of the Wildean art of how to flirt. 'I can get away with it because of self-control,' she begins somewhat disarmingly. 'I'm very earthy and I shock sometimes, but never too much. It's like drinking; you have to know what you can get away with and you have to understand the occasions when you can.' Her style is carefully gauged to contrast her own ebullient personality with her husband's academic and outwardly austere demeanour. She feels that 'by marrying me he thinks it's this exotic thing that he can't control. The rest of his life is so in control. You see he comes from a military family - neat, tidy, organised - he even makes his own bed in the morning. He's totally amused by the way I dress.' State, and now private sector, matters prevent them from dressing for dinner together and so Sir Charles never knows what his wife will turn up in next. She loves to sail close to the wind, just to see her husband's face and recalls her first invitation to a formal dinner at Number 10 Downing Street. 'Charles was really scared about that first dinner, what I'd wear. I was advised by Robin Butler (head of the civil service) that I should dress down. To Carla Powell that was as good as a challenge. 'I had the most stunning dress you can imagine from Victor Edelstein. White, shoulders out to here, very Dynasty, and totally proper in the front. I walked up to Mrs Thatcher with Charles standing behind her, all proper. 'Then I turned and boom] It was backless down to There: I looked back over my shoulder and, Oh] Charles's look was too wonderful] You see, what men don't understand is that Mrs Thatcher, being a woman, would have loved all that]' Mary Henderson, wife of Sir Nicholas, guided the Powells through their early years in the diplomatic service. Superficially the two women seem poles apart; in fact they are close friends. Lady Henderson seems to look on Lady Powell almost as a secret weapon. 'When she was on our staff in Germany,' Mary Henderson recalls, 'whenever we had a difficult dinner we'd always ask Carla. She'd sit cross-legged at the feet of our important guest and he'd be completely bowled over by her and everything went well. She dresses in a very sexy way and is full of vitality. And being in the foreign service she's had to do it all on a very tight budget.' Lady Powell subscribes, out of necessity, to that long British tradition, which makes the average Italian shudder, of 'make-do and mend'. Ripping the black Chantilly lace from an old ball gown, she can turn it into a mini pencil-skirt by adding elastic to the waist and then popping it over a shiny, tar-black, Norma Komali body. When her husband saw it he exclaimed, 'Oh God] How could you] It's transparent]' But now he loves it, she says. Lady Powell heartily defends the diplomatic wives, so often ridiculed for their dowdy, home-made dresses. 'They have to dress for all sorts of occasions with very little money and you should hear some of the tricks we used.' 'You know about the Embassy Dress, of course? The black one with spots on it  -very simple.' This grand couture evening dress from Dior was made for Marina Berry in the 1960s. It was passed on to her sister-in-law, Harriet Berry, and eventually on to Carla. It is still in circulation. 'We all had our best times in that dress,' Lady Powell beams, 'and whoever had it we'd all ring up and ask if we could borrow the dress for the night.' While working for Hambros, Lady Powell was expected to look efficient and business-like. But, instead of buying a navy suit at Jaeger, she stopped over in Hong Kong and bought metres of washed silk in fuchsia, marrowfat green and midnight blue. In China she bought floral-patterned cashmere, lining it with matching silk: 'So much more glamorous than a winter coat, don't you agree?' Three suits, three shawls, all for the price of one Armani jacket. Other tricks include Pounds 50 crochet dresses from Roman boutiques, old ball dresses chopped into thigh-high minis and, her one extravagant buy, a minuscule petrol-blue and black lace dress from a Saint Laurent sale in the south of France. And although her financial circumstances have changed, thanks to Sir Charles's post at Jardine Matheson, she still prefers to shop in boutiques and second-hand markets, although she admits to a weakness for Anouska Hempel and Dior. One cannot see Lady Powell submitting to middle age or sobriety no matter what her husband's station. He may be proper in his grey flannels but she continues to teeter alongside him cajoling, teasing and flirting in Chantilly lace and impossible heels. 'We're complete opposites,' she beams. Last year the couple were announced by a master of ceremonies at a dinner. He pronounced his name poshly, like Disraeli's slippery pole; she pronounced it with the wide-mouthed 'o'. The MC pronounced both and the room roared with laughter.</p>

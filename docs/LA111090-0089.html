			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SAN FERNANDO OVERCOMES TURNOVERS, KENNEDY  </P> <P> It is always interesting when San Fernando High takes to the football field  this season.  </P> <P> One never knows if the Tigers will carve up the opponent with the precision of  a Dr. Jekyll, or if their alter ego, Mr. Hyde, will appear and put on an ugly,  monstrous demonstration of football.  </P> <P> Friday night at San Fernando, the Tigers showed a little of both personalities  as they survived six turnovers in defeating Kennedy, 28-24, in a North Valley  League game.  </P> <P> It was the 18th meeting between the teams, and San Fernando (5-4, 3-3 in league  play) leads the series, 11-7.  </P> <P> The Tigers, who have fumbled 11 fumbles in the past two games, came from behind  to win, driving 67 yards in 19 plays in the fourth period. The winning  touchdown came on a 13-yard fourth-down pass from quarterback Cruz Trevino to  running back Leonice Brown with 2 minutes 19 seconds to play.  </P> <P> Kennedy (5-4, 2-4) drove to the San Fernando three-yard line in the final  seconds, but Ontiwaun Carter fumbled on fourth down.  </P> <P> Carter finished with 136 yards in 29 carries and scored on runs of 12 and five  yards.  </P> <P> Brown led all rushers with 149 yards in 21 carries and scored on a 69-yard run  in the third period.  </P> <P> Kennedy had 135 yards in penalties to five yards for San Fernando.  </P> <P> It was all Kennedy in the first period; the Golden Cougars spent almost the  entire 12 minutes in San Fernando territory thanks to two Tiger fumbles and an  interception.  </P> <P> Kennedy scored first on a 53-yard wind-aided field goal by Keith West and added  a 12-yard touchdown run by Carter later in the period.  </P> <P> San Fernando controlled the second period, helped by a pair of Carter fumbles  that gave the Tigers excellent field position. William Taylor's 41-yard  touchdown run cut the Kennedy lead to 10-6, but the snap on the conversion  attempt bounced to holder David Rojas, who was smothered.  </P> <P> Taylor scored again on an eight-yard run with 6:18 left in the first half, but  Brown fumbled on the two-point conversion attempt and San Fernando settled for  a 12-10 lead at intermission.  </P></p>

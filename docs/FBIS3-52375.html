Mikhail Gorbachev, the last president of the Soviet Union,  signed a contract to sell Iran three diesel-powered "Kilo" class  submarines. After the collapse of the Soviet Union the Russian  Government announced that it would honor the contract, and  indeed delivered two submarines to Iran.    Russian sources yesterday pointed out that the decision to  cancel the sale of the third submarine to Iran is justifiable,  because it concerns an optional sale agreement, not a pledge to  sell, as was the case with the two other submarines.    Russia decided early this month to cancel the sale of two  nuclear-powered stations to Iran because of the latter's  inability to pay their costs, as was reported. Tehran accused  Moscow of "submitting to Washington's pressures."    The U.S. Administration spoke to more than 20 states,  including Russia, in a bid to persuade them not to sell advanced  weapons to Iran.    While Russia emphasized the decision not to sell the third  submarine to Iran, Ukraine tried to win part of the Iranian arms  market. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrey Zlenko said that his  government has decided to supply Iran with spare parts for the  Soviet-made weapons in the Iranian arsenal. He pointed out that  Kiev has rejected the "improper pressure" exercised by  Washington and is determined to strengthen its relations with  Tehran.    Borys Tarasyuk, senior Ukrainian arms exports expert,  announced that Iran is not one of the states to which Ukrainian  arms exports are banned. He pointed out that only Serbia,  Libya, Cuba, North Korea, and South Africa are subject to this  ban. Tarasyuk pointed out that Iran is offering Ukraine oil at  "very tempting prices" in return for spare parts and military  technologies.</p>

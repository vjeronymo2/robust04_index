			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mitsuhiro Uezumi, political commentator: "Loud </F> Laughter of Party Movers To Further Left Heard"]    [Text] Tomiichi Murayama has been elected as the new  chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. What  was surprising was that the "views" of both candidates Murayama  and Ito were drafted by the ultraleft wing.    The characteristic of the recent election of the SDPJ  chairman was the fact that the direction of the executive branch  shifted from the moderate/ultraleft wing faction of Makoto  Tanabe (Japan Postal Workers' Union centrist faction), Sadao  Yamahana (ditto moderate left-wing faction) and Wataru Kubo  (Nikkyoso [Japan Teachers' Union] moderate right-wing faction)  to the left-/ultraleft-wing faction, which is backed by the  Jichiro [All-Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union].    It means that the struggle between the centrist faction and  the left-wing faction over the political direction within the  Kankoro [National Council of Government and Public Workers'  Unions], which forms the core of the SDPJ-Sohyo [General Council  of Trade Unions of Japan] alignment, has ended in victory for  the left-wing faction.    Under the Murayama aegis, the SDPJ will ostensibly maintain  party solidarity while placing itself within the coalition  government in the area of domestic politics, but in reality will  shift to control by the left wing.    This is illustrated by the withdrawal from the candidacy for  party chairman by Wataru Kubo, who represents the moderate left  wing, followed by the candidacy of Masatoshi Ito of the extreme  left and Tomiichi Murayama of the left wing and also by the  victory process by Murayama as chairman. In order to quickly  understand this, let us look at the backgrounds of the  candidates.    Masatoshi Ito (upper house proportional representative,  elected once) is an anti-U.S. base activist and a member of the  "National Network To Revitalize the Pro-Constitution SDPJ" [the  "Network"]. His electorate consists of the Tokenkyo [National  Liaison Council for the Study of Party Construction], a party  organization of local activists, and the "Network," an  extraparty citizens' organization. Both organizations are  controlled by the party's extreme left-wing faction, which is  oriented toward a united SDPJ-Communist front and forms the  Heiwa Senryaku Ken [Peace Strategy Study Group] led by Akira  Iwai (former Sohyo chairman).    The Tokenkyo was formed in late 1980 with the Zenrokyo  [National Council of Trade Unions]--the national center of the  ultraleft opposition to the Rengo [National Confederation of  Trade Unions]--as its base. On 4 Sepember [1993] at the general  meeting held at the Jichiro Kaikan Building in Tokyo, it  submitted a request to Sukio Iwatare (affiliated with the Peace  Strategy Study Group) to run for party chairman, and Torao  Takasawa and Tetsu Ueda were among those who called for a  signature movement in support of the request. (If Takasawa had  won in the previous general election, he probably would have  been asked to run for chairman.)  <H5>  Ito Candidacy a Display of Power by the Ultraleft </H5>   The policies set forth at the general election were as  follows:    1. In order to revitalize the pro-Constitution party, to  make  all-out efforts for the victory of a candidate for chairman who  opposes the continued single-seat constituencies with a  proportional representation system.    2. To reaffirm the importance of preventing a single-seat  constituency proportional system rather than remain as a  minister in the Hosokawa cabinet.    3. To reaffirm the maintenance of the party's key policies  concerning the security treaty, the Self-Defense Forces, and  nuclear power development. To formulate conditions for the  recovery of Diet seats in order to realize the party's policies  in the coalition government.    4. To create a citizens' movement through the party's  subsidiary structure and the "Network" toward revitalization of  the pro-Constitution party.    The "Network" may be viewed as a reorganized version of the  existent "Group To Protect the Constitution" generally known for  its extreme-left nature and was formed to seek further  expansion. Although such "lone-wolf politicians" as Shizuo Wada  (party vice chairman), Tetsu Wada, and Kazuo Saito of the former  Ota Society and the Labor-Farmer Party make up the core that  stands out in front, the matrix is formed by the Tokenkyo and  the Peace Strategy Study Group led by Akira Iwai and Iwatare. In  the recent election, Tetsu Wada served as Ito's chief secretary  for election policy.    Immediately prior to the 9 September [1993] deadline for  chairman candidacy, Ito replaced Iwatare as a candidate. Iwatare  withdrew his candidacy on condition that Murayam accept the  Tokenkyo's policy. Murayama promised that he will "study it and  do his best."    Ito's purpose was to consolidate the "Network" organization  through the election, expand it, gather as many votes as  possible to manifest the power of the "ultraleft" and to apply  pressure on future party operations.    Tomiichi Murayama (lower house, Oita 1st district, seven  election wins) -- His colorful electorate ranges from the Peace  Strategy Study Group to the centrist "Social Democratic Forum"  and a portion of the Suiyokai, in addition to a united  SDPJ-Communist front-oriented ideological group, the anti-Tanabe  faction and the anti-single seat constituency faction.    The Peace Strategy Study Group consists of members of the  party secretariat affiliated with the group, centering on Yutaka  Shitoma, Osamu Yatabe, and Sukio Iwatare. Although it was not  generally known, they controlled the nuclei of the election  policy headquarters of both Murayama and Ito and drafted the  "views" of both candidates.  <H5>  Secretariat Cold-Shoulders Yamahana </H5>   Next is the "Society To Promote True Political Reform"  [Shino  seiji kaikaku o susumeru kai] ("Promotion Society") formed by  members of the anti-Tanabe and anti-single seat constituency  factions. The principal members are: the Suiyokai (Tsuruo  Yamaguchi, Toshi Oide, and Tadatoshi Akiba); former and present  members of the Social Democratic Forum (Koken Nosaka, Sekisuke  Nakanishi, Seiko Kitasawa, Mankichi Kato); the "Creative  Society" [Tsukuru kai] (Yamahana faction) (Reijiro Sawafuji);  the former Ishibashi-Hori faction (Hideyuki Maeshima, Masaru  Hayakawa); and the Sangatsukai "March Society," ultraleft  faction (Yasuo Yamashita). In particular, Yamashita, former  secretary to Tetsu Ueda, actively assisted Murayama's  preparations for the recent election.    The "Promotion Society" requested Chairman Yamahana to 1)  immediately stop corporate contributions, 2) lower party  subsidies to 250 yen per constituent, and 3) prevent a  conservative two-party system and maintain the SDPJ's identity  through a multiparty system. Its strategy was not to display its  opposition to the single-seat constituency system, but to push  for "an immediate stop to corporate contributions" and to  conform with the Communist Party's contentions and  simultaneously crush the single-seat constituency system. In  addition to Mankichi Kato who formally switched from the "Social  Democratic Forum" to the "Promotion Society," the majority in  the "forum" supported Murayama. It was based mainly on  anti-Tanabe sentiment.    In the "Creative Society" also, half of the Diet members  including Yuzuru Shimasaki are Murayama supporters. As for the  party secretariat, the members refused to act in support of  Yamahana's election even after his announcemnt to run.    Backed thus by the the extreme left and left wing as well as  a portion of the centrist faction, Murayama followers  constituted a majority, and it turned into a de facto defeat for  the Tanabe-Yamahana line--i.e. the pro-coalition,  pro-political-structuring faction. In form, because Murayama  accepted the coalition administration and upheld the single-seat  constituency system, Kubo withdraw his candidacy, but the  reality was quite different.    The Murayama clique follows the tradition of the  Narita-Asukata-Ishibashi-Doi line. In other words, while  ostensibly setting up a chairman from of an independent  left-wing faction, in reality the intraparty left wing--in  particular, the extreme left wing--holds the cards, and is bent  on "purifying" the SDPJ into a scientific socialist  (Marxist-Leninist) party.  <H5>  Rush Toward Obstructing the Coalition Administration </H5>   The party right wing, including the Zendentsu [All-Japan  Telecommunications Workers' Union] has already become little  more than a name since the chairmanship election, while the  Kankoro moderate right wing centering on Tanabe and the Zentei  [Japan Postal Workers' Union] is already rapidly weakening.    The group's future fate will depend on whether Wataru Kubo  is  able at the party convention on 25 Sepember to place Masao  Sakon, a member of the Suiyokai's right wing and the faction  behind the coalition administration, to the post of secretary  general. If he should fail, the SDPJ will eventually rush  toward opposition against the coalition administration and  defeat of the single-seat constituency system under a complete  left-wing leadership, and no one will be able to stop it.    In any case, under the Murayama organization, the alienation  between the SDPJ and the coalition government, and between the  Rengo, will inevitably widen. Particularly the Rengo's new  direction, pushed by the eight left-wing independent industrial  unions, will solidify along the Jinnosuke Ashida (chairman of  Zensen Domei [Japanese Federation of Textile, Garment, Chemical,  Distributive &amp; Allied Industry Workers' Unions] and Etsuya  Washio (chairman of Tekko Roren [Japanese Federation of Iron  &amp;  Steel Workers' Unions] line. If present Chairman Yamagishi  should retire, the trend would further accelerate, and there is  the danger that, while the Kankoro faction within the Rengo will  approach closer to the Zenrokyo [National Council of Trade  Unions], the Rengo mainstream's detachment from politics will  increase.    For the time being, the focus will be on attitude of the  some  20 members of the "Promotion Society" and the members of the  Peace Strategy Study Group regarding the single-seat  constituency system under the Murayama reign.</p>

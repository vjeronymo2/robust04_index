			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUNLEAVY'S CLUB FINALLY GETS GOING;  </P> <P> LAKERS: NEW COACH, OLD PLAYERS BEGIN THEIR GETTING-TO-KNOW-YOU PROCESS IN  HAWAII.  </P> <P> Mike Dunleavy became an NBA coach Friday as the Lakers opened camp under a new  boss for the first time in eight seasons.  </P> <P> Dunleavy, the former Milwaukee Buck assistant who succeeded Pat Riley, said he  was happy to begin at last and enjoyed his debut at practice.  </P> <P> "The only thing different, I've never coached this level of talent," Dunleavy  said. "They had a terrific attitude. It's what I'd heard about this team and  it's very true."  </P> <P> The players seemed to welcome Dunleavy, strange though it was to have a new man  with a new system running the team.  </P> <P> "Felt like a fresh start," Mychal Thompson said, "and that's no knock against  Riley. Every family has problems. You have fights with your brothers and  sisters. Me, I like everybody pretty much except Saddam Hussein."  </P> <P> Said Magic Johnson: "I think it's comfortable, but I think also we're  definitely checking each other out. I think he (Dunleavy) is feeling his way.  We're feeling our way."  </P> <P> The Lakers have 18 players here. Ten are solid -- the starters (Johnson, James  Worthy, Vlade Divac, Byron Scott and A.C. Green) plus Thompson, Sam Perkins,  Terry Teagle, Larry Drew and rookie Elden Campbell.  </P> <P> Rookie guard Tony Smith, the No. 2 draft choice from Marquette who was  impressive in the summer league, has the inside track for the 11th spot. If he  wins it, 6-foot-6 swingman Tony Brown, a former New Jersey Net and Buck, is  considered the leading contender for the last spot.  </P> <P> A darkhorse: Phillip Holmes, a 6-foot-5, 210-pound guard from Western Michigan,  is given a chance to make it tough on Tony Smith.  </P> <P> Longshots: returning guard Steve Bucknall; rookies Keith Smith of California  and Ken Redfield of Michigan State and journeyman Michael Young.  </P> <P> If the Lakers were in a funk at midsummer, after other NBA Western Conference  contenders geared up and they couldn't close a deal for Hot Rod Williams, it's  over. The Teagle deal ended it.  </P> <P> Said Johnson: "It's going to work. It'll work great. Our second five will be  potent. We used to have role guys (coming off the bench). That won't be the  case anymore. We've got guys who can light up the scoreboard. That'll be a  difference since I've been here, since Bob (McAdoo).  </P> <P> "We've got two guys coming off our bench who used to be starters on two other  teams, who legitimately can score. I mean, they're used to shooting the ball  and used to putting it in. We don't have to make them scorers. Now we add  Mychal Thompson and Larry Drew. That's four guys coming in. You need three-four  guys that can score. That's how Detroit has won championships."  </P> <P> "I'm leaving out a guy because he's going to be a sleeper," Johnson said, "and  that's Elden (Campbell).  </P> <P> "He's got some talent. If he can give us half of what you see he can do, he  could be the difference. I mean, he can block shots, jump. Today he was  running, oh man . . . "  </P> <P> Campbell, the 6-10 forward from Inglewood's Morningside High School and  Clemson, carries a college reputation of getting up for big games and down for  little ones. General Manager Jerry West got him with the next-to-last pick in  the first round, but he has been impressive, reportedly tearing up Danny Ferry  in a summer league game.  </P> <P> Gone from a year ago are Riley, Michael Cooper and Orlando Woolridge.  </P> <P> "It's strange to look around and not see Riles' slicked-back hairdo," Thompson  said. "And not see the thin man, Michael Cooper. It was weird. And not hear  Orlando's boisterous laughter. And seeing Orlando hunched over in the corner  gasping for breath after a few running drills."  </P> <P> Said Johnson: "The thing I'll miss the most -- I had a guy who was on my butt  when I wasn't doing things right. Coop was that guy. When he said, 'OK, take  the game over Buck, it's winnin' time,' then I would go into my thing. . . . He  was the guy I always talked to about different things, whether it was about the  team or not."  </P></p>

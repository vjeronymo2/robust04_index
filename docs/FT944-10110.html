			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Suicide bomber kills 3 Israelis Moslem fundamentalists struck another blow against the Israeli-Palestinian peace process yesterday when a suicide bomber killed three Israeli soldiers and wounded four others at a roadblock in the Gaza Strip. Six Palestinians, including a policeman, were wounded. Two wounded Israelis were last night reported to be in critical condition. The Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility and warned that bombing was a 'first' act of revenge for the assassination 10 days ago of the Jihad strategist and newspaper publisher Hani Abed. It also threatened to attack Palestinian police taking part in joint patrols with the Israelis, who have remained in Gaza to protect 16 Jewish settlements. Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, last night condemned the bombing and promised to take all necessary measures. The Israeli Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General Ehud Barak, insisted that the Palestinian security police must act more rigorously to control the violence.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, June 18 (BTA) -- Forty-two minutes after  midnight the 440-MW Unit One of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant  was switched off because of a turbogenerator failure, Ms  Yordanka Stoyanova, head of the Public Relations Department told  BTA. It was a short circuit in the conventional equipment and  has nothing to do with the reactor's safety. No radiation  changes have been registered. The unit was switched on again  about noon. It will work at about 50 per cent of its capacity  until the turbogenerator is repaired. Three of the six units of  the plant are currently in operation. Their capacity totals  about 1,600 MW. Units Four and Five are undergoing routine  repairs.</p>

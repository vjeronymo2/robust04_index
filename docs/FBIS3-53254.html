He stated that he has decided to cooperate with the Sudanese  opposition to topple President 'Umar al-Bashir's regime.    Clashes have broken out once again in the south between  government forces and the Sudanese People's Liberation Army,  while the statements made by Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, secretary  general of the Popular Arab and Islamic Conference [and leader  of the National Islamic Front], about a dialogue being conducted  between the authorities and the parties inside and outside the  country has provoked violent reactions from the government.    At a news conference in London, Ajo said that he had applied  for political asylum in Britain. He stated that he left  Khartoum for Cairo on 1 December on 30-day leave with his  family, them moved on 15 December to London, where he decided to  announce his resignation and seek asylum. He declined to say  whether he had decided on his resignation and escape from Sudan  before or after his visit to London.    He stressed that he had agreed to join the government after  the successful military coup led by Lieutenant General 'Umar  al-Bashir four years ago in the hope of influencing the  government's policy "in order to eliminate the tension between  north and south and to establish peace in the south. But I was  wrong, as this government does not want peace."    He added that he had decided to cooperate with the Sudanese  opposition in all its tendencies and groups, stressing that  "only force is capable of removing the Sudanese regime, which is  not concerned about citizens' death." He attacked the regime's  unseriousness in solving the south problem and establishing  party pluralism. He also spoke about "the regime's scheme to  Islamize the south." He cited constitutional decree No. 7  endorsed by the Revolutionary Command Council for National  Salvation on the eve of its dissolution.    He went on: "The regime's supporters gather southern  children from the refugee camps to which they fled in Khartoum,  southern Darfur, southern Kordofan, and southern towns like Juba  and Malakal, which are all under government control. They take  the children to secret camps, where they force them to join  religious schools and military training centers in north Sudan  to prepare them to fight against the south." "I believe that a  true and lasting peace is possible if the the people of the  south are allowed to exercise their right to self-determination  through a referendum to determine their political future."    Meanwhile, al-Turabi's statements about a dialogue being  conducted with the Sudanese parties inside and outside the  country have provoked violent reactions from the government.    Official sources emphasized to AL-HAYAH yesterday that the  government, which dissolved the parties, cannot conduct a  reconciliation with them. "But if contacts take place, they  will be with figures in isolation from their parties." [passage  omitted]</p>

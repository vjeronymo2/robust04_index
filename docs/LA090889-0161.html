			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRITISH HOSTAGE IS DEAD, WIFE TOLD;  </P> <P> REPORTS RECEIVING 'BAD NEWS' IN CALL, MEETING IN BEIRUT  </P> <P> The wife of missing Briton Jack Mann, a World War II fighter pilot, said today  she had been told he died and that she believed the report to be true.  </P> <P> Mann, 75, disappeared May 12 as he drove to a bank in Syrian-policed Muslim  West Beirut.  </P> <P> None of Lebanon's kidnap groups has specifically identified him as a hostage.  But a previously unknown faction, the Cells of Armed Struggle, claimed that it  kidnaped an unidentified Briton in Beirut the day Mann disappeared.  </P> <P> It demanded the release of Arabs jailed in Britain for the 1987 killing of  Palestinian cartoonist Ali Naji al-Adhami. But Scotland Yard said no arrests  had been made in that slaying.  </P> <P> There had been no word since then about Mann's whereabouts.  </P> <P> His wife, Sunny, said she received a telephone call Monday from an unidentified  man who told her: "I have bad news about your husband."  </P> <P> She said she later met the man at a shop in West Beirut's Hamra commercial  thoroughfare and "he told me that Jack is dead."  </P> <P> "I waited, but there was no news about Jack on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday,"  Mann told reporters at her West Beirut apartment.  </P> <P> "I don't know. There's no proof that he's dead at the moment," she said. But  she noted that the report of her husband's alleged death "seems correct."  </P> <P> The Manns lived in Beirut for 43 years. He worked as a pilot with Lebanon's  national airline, Middle East Airlines, for more than 20 years before retiring  to manage a bar in Beirut.  </P> <P> He was one of 16 Westerners missing in Lebanon. Most are held hostage by  pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim militants. The other Westerners are eight Americans,  three Britons, two West Germans, an Italian and an Irishman.  </P></p>

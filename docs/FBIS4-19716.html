			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, April 21 (AFP) -- Ukraine Thursday [21  April] ruled out the immediate closure of the Chernobyl nuclear  power station despite safety fears, at the start of an  international conference on the eighth anniversary of the  world's biggest nuclear accident.    "There are no plans for the immediate closure of the two  units" still functioning at Chernobyl, Urainian Deputy Prime  Minister Valeriy Shmarov said, according to a spokesman of the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which is hosting the  two-day meeting in the Austrian capital.    This could happen only "when new stations have come on  stream  and when the efficiency of conventional stations has been  improved" and this needed "money and some years," spokesman  David Kyd quoted him as saying.    The IAEA has declared one of the units unsafe to operate and  the United States has demanded the plant's closure.    Ukraine is currently building eight new VVER 1,000-watt  nuclear stations, of the same design as Chernobyl, which are  expected to be in operation between 1994 and 1999.    The meeting, including experts from 16 countries and  representatives from the European Union and European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), was called after a report  by IAEA experts complained about security standards.    Fears were compounded further this week when two minor  accidents took place within two days at the plant, north of the  Ukrainian capital Kiev.    Chernobyl was the site of the world's worst civilian nuclear  accident on April 23, 1986, when the number four reactor  exploded, releasing a huge radioactive cloud.    Last year there were 36 incidents there, four of which led  to  a reactor being shut down. Twenty of the incidents caused a  reduction in power.    In 1990, the Ukrainian parliament decided it would close  down  Chernobyl for good at the end of 1993, but in October 1993  deputies voted to keep the plant open in order to reduce  dependence on Russian energy supplies.    On Thursday, Shmarov judged the level of risk to be  "acceptable" and said the two units produced the equivalent of  4.7 million tonnes of oil per year, about seven percent of the  country's total energy production.    At the EBRD's annual congress in Saint Petersburg Tuesday,  Ukrainian Finance Minister Hryhoriy Pyatachenko called for a  special fund to be set up to finance the shutdown of Chernobyl  and asked that some money from an existing fund be used to  improve security at the plant.    The IAEA's director general Hans Blix said Thursday's  conference aimed to give a full picture of the situation at  Chernobyl and Ukraine's energy needs. The Agency also hoped to  identify when the plant was no longer vital to the Ukrainian  economy and help identity constructive options.    The IAEA is worried about standards in the face of an exodus  of 20 percent of all qualified staff. "A taxi driver in Kiev  earns more than a qualified worker at Chernobyl," said Kyd.    Repair work recommended by the Agency has not been carried  out and fire protection standards are low, it says.    The concrete casing around reactor four, scene of the 1986  accident, is also seriously damaged, threatening neighbouring  reactors and posing the danger of radioactive leaks.</p>

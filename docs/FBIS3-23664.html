			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA correspondent Lieutenant-Colonel </F> Ihor Koshel: "The Ministers Liked More Than Just the Lviv  Weather"]    [Text] A press conference was held at the headquarters of  the Carpathian Military District by Minister of Defense of  Ukraine General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy and  Minister of Defense of Belarus Colonel-General Pavlo Kozlovskyy.  The leaders of the military departments, before answering the  questions of journalists, briefly related the essence of the  meeting. General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy  indicated in particular that "I had a planned working meeting  today with the Minister of Defense of Belarus. We are very  thankful that the Lviv area has received us with pleasant, sunny  weather. That fostered a good discussion. We discussed questions  of the building development of our armed forces, how technical  and medical support will be organized and how the `Partnership  for Peace' will be implemented. We also touched on questions of  regional security. We have many common personnel problems. It is  well known that many Ukrainians are serving in Belarus, and many  Belarusians in Ukraine. Some of them want to return home, and we  must devise mechanisms to solve that problem. A series of  proposals were thus put forward, and our experts will study  these problems and prepare certain documents. We will meet again  in April and make concrete decisions."    Colonel-General Pavlo Kozlovskyy also expressed his  impressions of the meeting: "The Lviv weather really did seem to  incline us toward the fruitful resolution of everything that was  discussed in today's conversations. We are working today on the  creation of national armies, and we see that without each  other's help we will not be able to manage it.  Military-technical issues are simply not resolved without  outside help. We agreed on close collaboration back in  Ashkhabad, and now have met here with our colleagues. I would  like to add that we do not have sufficient funds in our state  for the normal development of our armed forces. We want to  collaborate with our neighbors, with you, in order to ease this  problem. The concept of barter exists. We have many military  repair enterprises in Belarus that are of interest to the  Ukrainian armed forces. You, on the other hand, have things of  interest to our specialists. We can and should agree to  advantageous collaboration on the basis of fair transactions."    The leaders of the military agencies answered the questions  of journalists.    Question: A representative of the military  department of Russia, Colonel-General Samsonov, was recently  saying that combined armed forces of the CIS will possibly be  appearing before long. Do you share that assertion?    The Minister of Defense of Ukraine answered that question:  "Colonel-General Samsonov can think whatever he likes. It is a  matter for us to agree with him or not. We cannot take part in  any military blocs whatsoever, in accordance with our Military  Doctrine. Much has been written about this in the press. If the  decision is made by the Supreme Soviet or the President of  Ukraine on some other type of relations with the armies of other  countries, we the military will submit to such a decision. We  still have close collaboration with the armies of our neighbors,  both near and far. Collaboration such as with Belarus."    Colonel-General Pavlo Kozlovskyy added to what was said by  the Minister of Defense of Ukraine: "I asked General Samsonov  where he got the grounds to make such a statement. The idea of  combined armed forces was not very promising from the very  beginning, in my opinion. So another idea has appeared--the  creation of a staff to coordinate military collaboration, if  only to assist each other in building national armed forces and  ease as much as possible the performance of that task.    Question: New, Temporary Regulations and other  official documents are already being developed and taking effect  in the Ukrainian armed forces. Is anything of the sort being  planned in the army of Belarus?    "I have seen your Temporary Regulations," said  Colonel-General Pavlo Kozlovskyy. "We have also developed our  own and submitted them for the consideration of the Council of  Ministers of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. I think that  they will take effect very soon and be translated into the  Belarusian language."    Question: Could you elaborate more concretely on  the collaboration of our two ministries and armies?    "We have a series of projects that have been proposed by the  Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and our specialists," indicated  the Minister of Defense of Belarus. "There is, for example, a  draft program for the training of cadets at higher military  educational institutions. I think that we will be able to speak  more concretely about bringing that plan to life in April. We  also have agreements on the exchange of attendees at military  educational institutions with Poland, with the military-medicine  academy in particular.    Question: How do you regard the agreement on the  withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, and what stage is  that process in?    "I think," said Colonel-General Pavlo Kozlovskyy, "that the  decision on how and when to withdraw nuclear weapons from  Ukraine is an internal matter for the country's leaders. I  cannot comment on that. We are accomplishing analogous tasks  ourselves today. Frankly speaking, General of the Army of  Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy and I did not touch on that problem."    "This is my second meeting now with Pavlo Kozlovskyy," added  the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, "and I would like to say  that I have never asked what Belarus is doing with regard to  nuclear weapons, and he in turn has not inquired into what  Ukraine is doing.    "What stage do I think this problem is at? If we want to  become a non-nuclear state, then everything that is being done  now is a normal and natural process. And it is being done in  accordance with an existing document. There is a schedule,  agreed on with Russia, and we are fulfilling it. It cannot be  stated concretely yet when the withdrawal of nuclear weapons  will begin and when it will end. One must understand that it is  not just simple freight being shipped. The utmost assurance of  safety is required here, and that requires painstaking  preparations of transport, railroad tracks, the appropriate  documents and the like. The work is proceeding, however."</p>

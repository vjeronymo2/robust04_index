			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Industrial investment falls 10.5% in Japan INVESTMENT in Japanese manufacturing is tumbling under the weight of the recession, according an extensive survey of investment intentions published yesterday by the Japan Development Bank. The survey of 2,326 large manufacturing companies found that planned investment for the next six months would be 10.5 per cent down on last year and 3.2 per cent lower than the first half of this year. The bank forecast investment falls next year of a further 11.9 per cent as manufacturers retreat from the ambitious spending plans of the late 1980s. The economy's weak state, with manufacturing inventories rising despite falling output and investment, will be confirmed today by figures for the August money supply. The consensus among Tokyo analysts is that the broad money measure M2 is likely to grow by only 0.2 per cent. However, a minority of economists are predicting the first-ever negative money supply growth. Meanwhile, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association yesterday followed the lead of the electronics industry by significantly downgrading estimates of demand this year. Mr Yutaka Kume, Nissan chairman and the association's president, said demand for new cars would fall well below earlier growth forecasts of 1.1 per cent. The fall raises prospects of the car industry joining electronics and steel in calling for government subsidies. Investment in the two industries is falling fast, according to the Japan Development Bank survey, which found capital spending in electronics likely to be 23.7 per cent down in the next six months, with investment in the car industry likely to fall 13.6 per cent.</p>

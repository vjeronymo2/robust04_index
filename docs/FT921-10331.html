			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Arts: Caesar and Cleopatra - Greenwich Theatre George Bernard Shaw wrote Caesar and Cleopatra for the actor Johnston Forbes-Robertson in 1898, aiming to illustrate through the character of Caesar his views about the common humanity of even the most exalted heroes, while chronicling a corner of Roman history that languishes in the shadow of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra. His Caesar, finely realised by Alec McCowen, is a wry, kindly philistine, by his own admission 'part brute, part woman and part god', whose laurels conceal a balding head, and whose good nature hides a cunning - and finally ruthless - political brain. We see him first apostrophising beside the monumental claw of a black marble sphinx, enchanted by the frightened young queen who finds him there. Having convinced her that Romans do not in fact eat Egyptians, he proceeds to amuse himself by making an empress of her. With feet dangling six inches off the ground, Amanda Root's minxish Cleopatra settles into her throne, tearing into her domineering governess (a sinister Sheila Ballantine), squabbling with her brother, while creating merry mayhem with the protocol of both Roman and Egyptian courts. Matthew Francis's production gleefully captures the mischief of these early scenes. The design (Julian McGowan), of ornate statuary dotted around marble halls, is subverted by the frock-coats and laurels of the Romans. Britannus, Shaw's send-up of the British character, is played by Michael Cronin with bowler hat and poker face, making the maximum comic mileage out of the undignified dive into the waters of the Nile of the entire Roman court, carrying a protesting Egyptian queen who, minutes earlier, had smuggled herself over to Alexandria in a carpet. The fun and games of the first three acts are abruptly halted in a second half which changes gear into an essay on political methods. Cleopatra, cleverly transformed by Root into a rather charmless sophisticate, is now dangerously confident; Caesar, still making a show of being the genial Dutch uncle, is put on his mettle by the murder of the scheming Egyptian Pothinus, and the resulting uprising by his followers. In a superbly engineered scene of confrontation between morals and expediency, the ruthlessness is revealed of a colonialist whose 'hands-off' liberalism is merely a strategy for allowing his minions to sort themselves out. Having failed to prevent Cleopatra's henchwoman Ftatateeta from killing Pothinus, Caesar lets Rufius - the new governor of Egypt - murder her, before turning his back on the lot of them in a devastating display of political indifference. Feigning the forgetfulness of an old man, he slights Cleopatra by neglecting to take proper leave of her; the unspoken insult is left frozen in the air between them. Judicious cutting and exemplary central performances have excavated a chilling political parable from a rambling Shavian chronicle about a king and a kitten.</p>

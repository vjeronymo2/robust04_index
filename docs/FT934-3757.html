			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Ukraine halts all bank loans The Ukraine government and central bank have banned bank loans until January to fight hyperinflation, but bankers have said the move could ruin the banking system, Reuter reports from Kiev. A joint statement from the government and central bank said the ban, which took effect late last week, affected both central bank affiliates and commercial banks. 'Issuing loans in Ukraine is banned until the end of the year because of the country's very difficult financial situation. Bankers who violate the new rules could face criminal charges,' the statement said. It gave no details. Leading Ukrainian bankers condemned the decision and accused the government and central bank of trying to take control of commercial banks. The move follows the government's suspension of transactions on Ukraine's sole currency exchange last month in an attempt to contain the collapse of the financial system.</p>

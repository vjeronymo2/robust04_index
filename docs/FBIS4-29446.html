			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Siti Hatija Yusof] </F>   [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, 3 May -- As many as 220 Shi'ite  Muslims led by a prominent local intellectual have been  identified as a religious group actively propagating their faith  to people living in urban areas.    Disclosing details of the group's activities, Zainal Abidin  Abdul Kadir, chief of the Islamic Affairs Division of the Prime  Minister's Office, said the group has made a Petaling Jaya  housing estate its headquarters from which to launch its  activities. He said the group is carrying out its activities by  conducting lectures in private houses, giving sermons in  mosques, and distributing brochures about their faith to the  public.    "One of the campaigns the Shi'ite group waged called on  members to practice contract marriages. They stressed that this  type of marriage is justified in Islam because it was practiced  during the time of the Prophet Muhammad.    "This group has also used the Prophet's name to attract  followers because they know that devout Muslims who worship  their Prophet will follow their teachings," he said to an UTUSAN  MALAYSIA correspondent during an interview in his office today.    UTUSAN MALAYSIA today also disclosed remarks by Dr. Abdul  Hamid Othman, deputy minister in the Prime Minister's  Department, on the Shi'ite Muslim group's activities. These  activities had earlier been limited to institutions of higher  learning, but they have now begun to propagate their teachings  to the general public in urban areas. Dr. Hamid noted the  group's activities may split Muslims in Malaysia if left  unchecked. [passage omitted]</p>

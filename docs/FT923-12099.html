			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Security Council to consult over Iraq THE United Nations Security Council last night decided to hold further consultations on a proposed Iraqi compromise over the team of UN weapons inspectors that has been keeping an increasingly tense vigil outside a Baghdad ministry, from which it has been barred, writes Mark Nicholson, Middle East Correspondent. The council had been expected to fire a further warning at Iraq that it is in material breach of the Gulf war ceasefire resolution 687, amid deepening concern over a growing list of Iraqi snubs to the UN. The council had before it an Iraqi proposal to have 'neutral' inspectors enter the agriculture ministry building, to which UN inspectors have been denied access since July 5. The UN team suspects that the building contains documents central to Iraq's missile programme - an allegation denied with increasing belligerence by Iraqi authorities. Thousands of demonstrators, chanting 'Saddam is staying forever', marched past the UN inspectors outside the building yesterday, in the biggest protest yet against the team. The council met last night to consider the report of Mr Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the special commission on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, after his weekend trip to Baghdad. It was also considering the news that a booby-trapped car exploded yesterday outside UN offices in northern Iraq, wounding two guards.</p>

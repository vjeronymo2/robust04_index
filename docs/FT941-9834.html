			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / MPs support ban on tobacco advertising Legislation to ban tobacco advertising crossed a tough hurdle yesterday after a private member's bill gained the support in the Commons of more than a third of MPs. The tobacco advertising bill, proposed by Mr Kevin Barron, backbench Labour MP for Rother Valley, passed its second reading in spite of strong opposition from a number of government ministers. The bill will now be debated by a parliamentary committee at which ministerial opposition will almost certainly be stepped up. The scale of support for the legislation on both sides of the house took the government by surprise. In a free vote, a motion to close the day's debate and push the bill to its next stage was passed by 227 votes to 17, a majority of 210. Under Commons rules, the Friday debate on a private member's bill must be formally closed by the early afternoon if it is to make any more progress. It must also be supported by more than 100 MPs - difficult to muster on a Friday afternoon when members tend to be in their constituencies. Mr Barron claimed yesterday that it was almost unprecedented for the division on a Friday debate to be so well attended. 'It shows the concern (MPs) have over the influence tobacco advertising has on the health of children in the UK,' he said. In recent months, the legislation appears to have gained support from influential circles - overcoming opposition from the powerful tobacco industry. A leaked cabinet memorandum recently showed that three ministers - including Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary - urged in November that the ban should be supported. They opposed Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, who told the cabinet that she backed extending the limitations on advertising, including adverts on posters, shop-fronts and women's magazines.</p>

Khan, Prime Minister Ms. Benazir  Bhutto's special envoy, met Iranian Foreign Minister `Ali Akbar  Velayati, in Tehran yesterday. He stressed the need for  continuing international pressure on India to stop the  atrocities on Kashmiris. He said that Pakistan, through  bilateral dialogue, had tried to persuade India to adopt an  appropriate posture on the Kashmir issue. Pakistan, however,  felt that it is India's strategy to take time to suppress the  legitimate demands of the Kashmiri people. He said that Prime  Minister Benazir Bhutto has decided to present a resolution at  the current session of the Human Right Commission meeting in  Geneva. He expressed the hope that the world community will  raise its voice against the Indian atrocities in Kashmir. The  Iranian foreign minister assured the envoy of continued support  to Pakistan's efforts to stop the human rights violations being  committed by India and improve the human rights situation in  Kashmir.</p>

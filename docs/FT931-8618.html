			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Emap buys 14 Thomson titles for Pounds 20m THOMSON Corporation, the Can-adian-controlled travel and publishing group, has sold 14 business magazines, three directories and some related exhibition interests for Pounds 20.65m to Emap, the rapidly growing UK publishing group. The sale includes such titles as Drapers Record and CTN, which is read by newsagents. It comes a day after Thomson in Canada said it would be substantially slimming down its 70-strong free newspaper business in the UK through sale or merger. Mr Robert Kiernan, managing director of Thomson Information Services Ltd, said Emap had made an offer which had 'prompted a strategic review'. 'While still recognising that these were a strong portfolio of major brands, we acknowledged that the business had moved away from TISL's core development area,' Mr Kiernan said. On the business side, the sale leaves Thomson with a handful of titles, including Construction News and International Financing Review, as well as a large number of professional tax and legal publications. For Emap, the acquisition represents a further consolidation of its position as one of the UK's most substantial business publishers. With 65 titles, after acquisition, Emap's business publication sales will rise to about Pounds 70m, about Pounds 30m short of the market leader, Reed International. This represents a doubling of Emap's business publications business in the past 18 months. Emap said the titles it has acquired complemented its existing magazines, it was not interested in the pursuit of size for the sake of it. Emap bought 26 of its titles from Maxwell Business Communications last March for Pounds 21.5m. Four of the magazines - TV World, Screen International, Communications International and International Broadcasting, with combined sales of Pounds 4.75m - have continental European circulation and advertising revenue. The titles acquired had sales of Pounds 18.9m in the year to December 1992 and were loss making. Emap will be funding the acquisitions from the Pounds 78m proceeds of its rights issue last June. Mr Colin Morrison, chairman of Emap Business Publishing, said that the deal with Thomson had been done 'very quickly in the last couple of weeks - most of the work was done in the last three days'.</p>

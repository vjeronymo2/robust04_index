			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> OCEAN VIEW'S OFFENSE TAKES TO THE AIR, DEFEATS SADDLEBACK  </P> <P> It was hard to imagine Ocean View High School's offense struggling to average  12.3 points per game last year after watching the Seahawks amass 336 yards in a  24-7 victory over Saddleback on Saturday night in Santa Ana Stadium.  </P> <P> Ocean View got offensive in its season opener with junior quarterback Randy  Karliner passing for 222 yards and two touchdowns. Karliner completed 14 of 24  passes, including touchdowns of 44 and 76 yards.  </P> <P> Saddleback quarterback Paul Delgado also went to the air often, with the teams  attempting 51 passes combined. Delgado completed six of his opening seven  passes, including one for a six-yard touchdown to wide receiver Robert Reyes  that put Saddleback ahead, 7-0.  </P> <P> But Saddleback had problems generating much offense after the first quarter,  turning over the ball four times on two fumbles and a pair of interceptions.  Ocean View linebacker Mitch Dallas recovered both fumbles, and Scott Caringella  and Greg Johnson each had an interception.  </P> <P> Ocean View tied the score, 7-7, early in the second quarter when Karliner  teamed with fullback Quincy Bennett on a short screen pass that Bennett turned  into a 44-yard touchdown play.  </P> <P> Four minutes later, Ocean View increased its lead to 14-7 when Karliner threw  another short pass to slotback Ben Cesar that resulted in a 76-yard touchdown  play. Cesar, the Sunset League's 100-meter sprint champion as a junior, outran  three defenders to the end zone.  </P> <P> Karliner had 181 yards passing by halftime but 140 yards came on two plays in  which he didn't throw the ball more than 10 yards to either Bennett or Cesar.  </P> <P> Ocean View put the game out of reach in the third quarter. John Arnold kicked a  30-yard field goal for a 17-7 lead and then reserve running back Jason Merkel  scored on a four-yard run after Dallas' second fumble recovery.  </P> <P> Saddleback gained only 16 yards rushing and 69 yards passing in the second half  as the Roadrunners' traditionally strong ground attack never materialized.  Tailback Tony Colthirst led Saddleback rushers with 36 yards on six carries.  </P> <P> Delgado, making his varsity debut, completed 11 of 27 passes for 120 yards but  connected on only four passes in the second half. Orange Lutheran 26, Pater  Noster 12 -- Gil Greene rushed for 263 yards on 18 carries and scored three  touchdowns to lead host Orange Lutheran.  </P> <P> Greene, who also had an interception, scored on touchdown runs of nine, 59 and  60 yards.  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran (1-0)) controlled the game from the second quarter, when Roger  Pagani's four-yard touchdown run capped a nine-play, 76-yard drive. After a  short punt, Greene quickly made it 13-0 with his nine-yard score.  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran had 314 yards rushing to 58 for Pater Noster.  </P> <P> Laguna Hills 17, Santiago 14 -- Marc Broadbeck's 31-yard field goal with 4:44  left gave Laguna Hills the victory at Mission Viejo. Darrin Chapman and Mark  Mitchell scored Laguna Hills' touchdowns. Kevin Gillian scored twice for  Santiago.  </P></p>

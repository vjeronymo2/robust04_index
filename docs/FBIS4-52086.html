			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The U.S. House of Representatives has voted for  Vietnam. From this issue, our radio editor has this to say:    On 20 April, after considering reports by the U.S. Senate  and  House on the appropriation bill for activities of the State  Department and other agencies in the 1994-95 fiscal year, the  House of Representatives voted against the proposal of  Representative [name indistinct] opposing the Senate's (?praise)  of the Vietnamese Government's good cooperation in the  settlement of the MIA issue and the U.S. President's lifting of  the embargo against Vietnam. Before voting, Representative  [name indistinct] asked the representatives of the committee not  to agree with the Senate's assessment. However, some  representatives rejected [name indistinct] statement, saying  that the President's decision to lift the embargo was correct.    Representative Peterson, Democrat from Florida, held that it  is unacceptable to think of retaliation now. He said it is high  time to seek solutions. Finally, with 209 votes against, [name  indistinct] proposal has been rejected. Most of the  representatives voted for the U.S. Senate's assessment on  Vietnam's good cooperation in the MIA issue and affirmed the  support to President Clinton's decision to lift the embargo on  Vietnam.    This was the first time that U.S. House of Representatives  voted for Vietnam issue following the Senate voting asking for  the President to lift the embargo on Vietnam on 27 January 1994.  This event expressed the current common trend of development in  the United States -- advancing toward normalization of relations  with Vietnam in the interests of both the United States and  Vietnam and the common trend in the world for peace,  cooperation, and development.    In fact, following the U.S. decision to lift the embargo on  Vietnam, both sides exchanged views on the setting up of liaison  offices and other issues of common concern.    In an interview with the Paper TUOI TRE [Youth], Vietnamese  Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said: Recent talks at  different levels between Vietnam and the United States produced  good results. In the near future, the United States and Vietnam  will set up liaison offices in Hanoi and in Washington.  Moreover, American companies which have arrived in Vietnam to  sign contracts prior to the lifting of the embargo now start to  implement their projects. Besides, more and more American  companies wish to invest in Vietnam for its economic  development. The Vietnamese diplomat said he believes that both  the countries will sooner or later set up diplomatic relations  at ambassadorial level.</p>

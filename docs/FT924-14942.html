			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / An open commitment: A call for more transparency in British monetary management The crisis of confidence which has undermined sterling in the past few days is mainly due to uncertainty about government policy. Yet in countries where monetary policy is not under political control, political difficulties do not normally turn into financial crises. This has led to proposals that the Bank of England should be made independent. We doubt whether this would, of itself, solve the British problem, which is not due only to political interference. The monetary regime has changed frequently and radically over many years, with little success. Monetary targets have regularly been missed. Decisions are made in secret, and are seldom explained, so market doubts go unanswered. Monetary targets will now take the place of exchange rate discipline; but the same forces which have driven Britain out of the ERM will make monetary control more difficult. International flows distort the monetary aggregates in ways which are not yet fully understood, and floating exchange rates have proved very hard to stabilise. The government further proposes that targets should include not only the exchange rate, but also broad and narrow measures of money, and housing and other asset prices. These indicators look well chosen, and would have alerted the authorities to many recent problems. But though the approach is described as new, it is essentially the traditional British system, and revives an old problem. It is impossible to keep multiple targets always in the sights of a single weapon, the interest rate regime. Something on the list will always look out of line; and sometimes objectives will be incompatible, as they are now. Policy cannot both support the exchange rate, and reduce real interest rates so as to relieve debtors and restore the growth of credit and money. Policy must be a compromise. Market acceptance will, therefore, depend on restoring confidence in official judgment. That is the aim of our proposal: to enable the markets to monitor the reasoning behind policy decisions, and to strengthen the policy process by bringing in well-regarded outsiders. Proposal: the UK should set up an Open Market Committee (OMC), similar to the FOMC of the US Federal Reserve. This would have full executive responsibility for monetary policy. At the moment the chancellor is nominally responsible, but the Bank and Number 10 Downing Street make their own inputs. When any policy fails, the buck passes rapidly round this triangle; this may be intended to protect reputations, but further undermines confidence. An OMC could not disown its decisions in this way; Publication: honest differences of opinion will always arise in matters of policy. The market is likely to have more confidence in decisions - even those which prove mistaken - if it knows what facts and interpretations were involved in reaching them. The minutes of the OMC should, therefore, be published after a minimum delay, as are those of the FOMC (six weeks in arrears). They should report the sometimes dissenting views expressed in reaching a decision, and should also include the committee's assessment of each of the indicators for policy, with full explanation if any is judged misleading at the time. We believe that disclosure on these lines would increase market confidence, partly by reducing uncertainty; Outside directors: British monetary policy is managed by a committee of Bank and Treasury officials. It usually maintains an outside appearance of unanimity and confidence. This has never been fully convincing; at a time when policy has gone off the rails, and leaks tell of furious internal arguments (as after every British crisis), the pretence simply undermines confidence further. Compared with this, the federal structure of the US and German central banks has important advantages. The heads of the Fed districts and the Landesbanks have their own power base, their own local information, and they often hold strongly independent views which are widely known. This assures markets that policy decisions are fully informed and largely politician-proof. It would be hard to imitate such a structure in the UK; but some of the same advantages could be secured by including outside directors or advisers in the OMC. These 'non-executive directors' should not be officials either of the Bank or of the Treasury. As 'insiders', they could not be active in the City during their time on the OMC. They would have a threefold role: to ensure that policy-making is fully informed about private-sector views and problems; to ensure that the OMC minutes convey meaningful information about policy decisions; and to act as potential whistle-blowers if they strongly disagree with the OMC consensus. They should be encouraged to propound and debate policy in public, as do the directors of the Fed and the Bundesbank; Execution: the OMC would steer policy, and answer for it; but day-to-day execution would remain in the hands of the Bank. We believe this structure would improve the operations of an independent Bank of England. It would be even more important if the Bank is not made formally independent.

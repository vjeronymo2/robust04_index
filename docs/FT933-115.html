			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Dollars 640m US placement for Smurfit JEFFERSON Smurfit Group, the Dublin-based paper and packaging company, has announced a private placement of Dollars 640m (Pounds 416m) in senior loan notes with US investors, to refinance existing debt. In what is thought to be one of the largest placements in this sector of the US corporate securities market by a non-US group, 28 US institutions participated in the issue, led by the Prudential Insurance Company of America and the Annuity Association of America, which subscribed Dollars 104m each for the loan notes. The notes have been issued in four tranches of 7,10,12 and 15 years, with an average life of 10.1 years. The issue has been split between the group's main international holding company and its US arm.</p>

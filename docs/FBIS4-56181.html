			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ruben Cortes] </F>   [Text] Guatemala City, 26 Apr (PL) -- Guatemala's defense  minister, General Mario Enriquez, admitted here today that after  30 years of war it is impossible to defeat the guerrillas  militarily.    In an exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA, Enriquez said  that, although the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity  [URNG] forces barely number 900 men, it is difficult for the  Armed Forces to thwart the guerrillas' mobility.    In view of a virtual impasse in the nation's armed conflict,  Enriquez thinks the peace talks with the rebels are the ideal  method to put an end to the ordeal that the confrontation has  imposed on Guatemalan society.    Enriquez, a former member of the government team during the  peace talks (1991-92), points to a certain ambiguousness in the  rebels' political willingness in the negotiations, although he  admitted there had been some changes. He also noted that a  general agreement on human rights was signed in March and a  schedule of 11 topics was included in the agenda for the talks.    The minister did not conceal what he described as excesses  against individual rights perpetrated by the Army over the past  three decades. He reported that the cases are in the courts and  that the guilty parties will be punished.    According to the Guatemalan Catholic Church, in 1993, the  Armed Forces were responsible for 248 summary executions and 245  cases of forced disappearances for political reasons, all of  which were blamed on paramilitary Civil Self-Defense patrols.    Enriquez accused the URNG of serious human rights  violations,  both of individuals and groups, as noted in resolutions issued  by the Guatemalan Human Rights Ombudsman's Office.    Enriquez criticized the URNG's acts of sabotage against the  nation's urban power grid and the intentional spilling of  400,000 gallons of oil into the Maya preserve, one of the  world's largest ecological preserves.    According to the minister, the Armed Forces have not  received  U.S. military aid since 1977. "Not one single cent. Washington  even suspended several higher learning scholarships that had  been provided at one time. While El Salvador has as many as 100  helicopters, Guatemala does not have as many as two. We have  had to develop our own infrastructure to conduct the war against  the URNG."    Meanwhile, he noted that the URNG still receives some  assistance from abroad, although this aid has diminished  somewhat, judging from higher war taxes the guerrillas are  exacting from residents within the conflict zones.    Finally, Enriquez denied that an eventual cease-fire will  necessarily entail a reduction in the number of men in the Armed  Forces because, he said, the Armed Forces contribute to the  development of society and protect the nation's borders.  Enriquez also spoke about the likely reorganization of the Army  and the need to replace quantity with quality.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / US seeks Dollars 58bn cut in deficit: Clinton presents budget calling for sharp reductions in spending US president Bill Clinton yesterday presented a budget proposing sharp spending cuts and a reduction in next year's deficit from Dollars 234.8bn (Pounds 156bn) to Dollars 176.1bn. More than 300 individual programmes will see funding cut below 1994 levels, including more than 115 which will be cancelled outright, if Congress agrees with Mr Clinton's proposals. While the overall federal budget will rise by 2.3 per cent to Dollars 1,520bn, the increase comes entirely in mandatory programmes such as Medicare and social security, which now make up almost half the federal budget, and in interest payments on the national debt, which will eat up Dollars 213bn. Discretionary spending, which the administration and the Congress must assign in budget laws each year, will decline from Dollars 550.1bn this year to Dollars 542.4bn in the 1995 fiscal year, which starts on October 1. The administration said that, if Mr Clinton's healthcare reform bill was enacted, the 1995 deficit would be even lower, at Dollars 165.1bn. The political battle is unlikely to be as fierce as last year, when Mr Clinton needed the casting vote of vice-president Al Gore to pass his first budget, particularly as the only tax increase proposed is a rise in the cigarette tax from 24 cents to 99 cents a packet, already announced to contribute to the cost of healthcare reform. But the administration still faces tough fights in Congress before the budget becomes law in the shape of a framework budget resolution - which theoretically should pass by April 15 - and 13 separate appropriation bills defining spending in 13 categories, which must pass before the end of the 1994 fiscal year on September 30. The budget drew immediate criticism from Republicans such as Senator Pete Domenici, who complained that the money saved from spending cuts would go to increased spending on other programmes rather than to reducing the deficit, and Senator John McCain, who was worried about the depth of the reduction in military spending. The fiercest resistance, however, may come from Mr Clinton's own Democratic party, where many are anxious about cuts in some low-income housing and welfare programmes. Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, said the administration had had to find Dollars 24bn of cuts to keep within the budget caps imposed by last year's budget law, which froze discretionary spending for the next five years at 1993's level. Of that total, Dollars 8bn was to cover the cost of higher spending on Mr Clinton's investment priorities, such as pre-school education and job training, crime prevention, scientific research and road construction.

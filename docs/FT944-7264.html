			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Confidence despite deficit Sir, Mark Nicholson has a journalist's right to report on Saudi Arabia ('Saudi budget may have to reflect some harsh realities', November 18) as he saw it during his recent visit. However, allow me to express an additional view as I and 51 British companies saw it during the British Aerospace/ Arab-British Chamber of Commerce joint venture mission which met 329 Saudi companies in the kingdom earlier this month. There was no denial in any quarter that there is a budget deficit. But there is annoyance in private sector circles that this is being played up in the west as if Saudi Arabia was unique in this respect - Germany, the UK and the US are not exactly paragons of budgetary virtue. This is especially so in the case of the US, which has been transformed from the world's largest creditor to the largest debtor nation. Despite current short-term problems our mission members, in serious business discussions with Saudi counterparts, found large areas of the private sector buoyant, liquid, and confident about the future. These were not naive people we met, but hard-bitten, experienced Saudi businessmen investing in technology and the expansion of their country's manufacturing sector. The British companies were not fools either, and the fact that three of them are at the stage of agreeing to joint ventures, 17 are now actively engaged in further discussions with Saudi counterparts, and seven more expect to achieve licence agreements - out of 51 on the mission - attests to the truth of what I write.

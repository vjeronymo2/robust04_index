			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Outdoors: A glorious evening of sedge frenzy - Fishing Readers with retentive memories may recall an account I gave last summer of a week-long trip to Ireland which was attended by bad weather on an almost biblical scale. The experience of having my campaign against salmon and trout reduced to grim farce by flood and tempest compelled a reassessment. Last year's weakness might have been an excess of planning. This time, I kept my options open until word reached me that the summer salmon were running in the Blackwater. A glance over the bridge at Mallow gave the first hint that the tactics might be flawed. Twelve months before, the Blackwater had been in foaming flood. Now it was a gentle and suspiciously shrunken stream. Where, I demanded of Frank, who guards and cherishes the fishing at Killavullen - was the water? And the salmon? His sorrowful face told the whole wretched story of the damnable lottery that is salmon fishing. It was now Monday. The previous Tuesday a steady rise in the water had brought the fish up in numbers. Frank had six one day, seven the next. By Friday the level was dropping and the salmon had speeded upstream. By the time we - my Irish companion, Niall, and I - arrived, the situation was hopeless. It was Frank's opinion, offered to the accompaniment of violent profanity, that there was not a single salmon resident on the fishery. We decided to hold a high-level pow-wow, concentrating on the kernel of the problem. This, as ever, was the weather, which was glorious. The sun was beating down, and the Blackwater seemed to be evaporating before our eyes. Our thoughts turned from the unreliable salmon to the trout of Ireland's finest trout river, the Suir, no more than an hour's drive away. Next morning found us in the pleasing town of Cahir, across in County Tipperary. We were in a little shop up the hill from the famous Norman castle, buying flies at a furious rate from a woman called Alice Comba. She is quite the most artistic dresser of flies I have come across in many a year, and her premises in Old Church Street are well worth a visit, if you have the good fortune to be in that lovely part of the world. We knew that our best chance would be during the evening. By 8.30pm we had feasted in a smart new restaurant in the town square, and were tackling up beside the broad, well-loved waters at Swiss Cottage, just downstream from Cahir. It and 15 miles of the Suir are controlled by the Cahir Anglers, a day ticket from Miss Comba costs Pounds 8, a season's permit just Pounds 13. I waded across the stream, went down a couple of fields, and fished up a long, deep pool towards a weir. The air was balmy and, as the sun sank in an amber sky, the trout began to pick at a hatch of olives. But they were as fastidious as ever, and as I neared the top of the pool, I still had not managed to fool one. Then I saw a clumsy, fluttering movement at the surface, and an eager pounce from a fish. It was a sedge, and within minutes, multitudes of these unprepossessing insects were appearing all over the river, and the trout were going mad. There is nothing in trout fishing to beat the excitement of an evening sedge hatch, and it was years since I had experienced one. Something about the motion of the creature as it careers across the top in its efforts to gain flight induces abandon in even the most selective fish. The rises are slashing and savage and the river that velvet June night boiled with the feeding frenzy. Normally, in such circumstances, I lose my head and fall in, or lose my flies, or break my cast. This time I remained comparatively calm, and one of Miss Comba's sedge patterns did the rest. By the time I bumped into Niall, I had caught seven. None was vast, but they fought like demons. He, a much more accomplished fisher than I, had simply lost count of his battles. On the bank, witnessing our endeavours, was a curious little Cahir man. He rebuked me sternly after I had waded back, telling me that I could have fallen into a hole and been swept away. A friend of his, he said, had a narrow escape a couple of nights before. I asked him what had happened. It seemed that this friend had borrowed the reins off my informant's horse, saying he wanted to pull a tree out of the water. He had tied a grappling hook to one end of the rope, and the other end to his leg. Throwing the hook around the tree, he had attempted to walk the tree out of the water, fallen headlong, and been 'near drownded'. Unable to see the relevance of this incident to my own case, we bade farewell to the little man and left the river, exhilarated. It had been a memorable night.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Survey of Kyushu (7): Drawn by clean air / Profile of Baxter International WHEN Baxter International, the US medical products group, was seeking a site for a factory in Japan, its consultant identified 1,500 possible locations. A hillside outside Miyazaki city in south-eastern Kyushu was not among them. Yet that is where Baxter ended up three years ago. The still expanding operation, which now employs 130, is one of the island's smaller foreign manufacturing enterprises. But it bears testimony to the determination of regional authorities to land their chosen overseas investment catch. The prefectural government, hearing of Baxter's search, obtained biographies of the executives involved. Discovering that Mr Komatsu Kazutoyo, the head of Japan Baxter, was a marine college graduate, officials put out feelers until they found someone from the same academy who could arrange an introduction. Through this circuitous route they were able to convince the US company's directors to pay Miyazaki a visit. For their part, aside from standard criteria such as labour availability and infrastructure, Baxter executives had other, less tangible requirements. A city with a good quality of life was one factor, even though the group was not shipping out expatriates to run the plant. And it wanted to be the flagship foreign enterprise in its area - a site elsewhere, neighbouring another American plant, was rejected for that reason. Miyazaki's ardour did not go unrequited. Board members who arrived at what was being turned into a gleaming new airport and toured the estuary city of some 290,000 people declared: 'This is a Baxter town,' according to Mr Tokoyo Imai, a former Johnson and Johnson official who is now manufacturing director at the Baxter Miyazaki site. This July, Baxter added a second production line at the plant, which supplies peritoneal dialysis bags to kidney patients. It saw a growth opportunity in Japan where barely 5 per cent of such patients use the system, which averts the need for thrice-weekly hospital visits and is employed by a fifth of US and a third of British sufferers. The company now claims 92 per cent of the Japanese peritoneal dialysis market. Miyazaki, home to the first of 26 sites in Japan designated as a 'technopolis', saw its education and research facilities as a selling point. Baxter now sends selected employees on six-month secondments to work with doctors at the local medical university, from whose graduate output it also recruits. The prefecture says it cannot compete as an investment location primarily through financial inducements. Incentives 'are not so high - they are average, the government here is not so rich', acknowledges Mr Masayuki Nakano, director general of its commerce, industry and labour department. The main private sector employer has for decades been Asahi Chemical, but its fibres plant has not expanded in recent years and the prefecture remains anxious for new industries. The arrival in Kyushu of the big Japanese automotive groups has brought several medium-sized components suppliers to Miyazaki, 'but we want assembly lines', says Mr Nakano. Baxter decided to live with the area's high transport costs for the sake of the good labour and clean water and air its clinical product requires. But the positive attitude of the regional authority was crucial. The facility was up and running in the space of six months, with local officials helping secure the necessary ministerial approvals. Staff were hired by combing a prefectural 'human resource bank', a hit-list of local graduates who had gone to work in other parts of Japan. They were among the modest annual trail of 'U-turners' forsaking higher metropolitan salaries and drawn, like their employer, to Kyushu's environmental benefits.</p>

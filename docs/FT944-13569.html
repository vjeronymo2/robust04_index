			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Portillo predicts high-wage future The government's policy is to turn Britain into a 'high-wage, not a low-wage economy', Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, said yesterday. Britain cannot hope to compete in the global economy 'by driving down its wage levels', he told the Institute of Personnel and Development's conference in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. He said: 'We have to increase the value that people add to their business through education and training. The aim must be a highly motivated workforce where the individual is rewarded for skill and productivity.' In his first big speech outlining his employment policy, Mr Portillo was keen to dispel any suggestion that he wanted to turn Britain into a sweat shop in order to compete with the emerging economies of Asia and South America. He said: 'For the moment, those emerging economies have the competitive advantages of low wages and even lower non-wage costs. But for the moment, the developed world, including Britain, retains an advantage in terms of the skills and knowledge of its workforce.' But he warned that the competition was not standing still and that the Asian competitors, in particular, were laying 'heavy emphasis on the education of their people'. Mr Portillo said Britain and the rest of Europe had to 'keep costs firmly under control' and 'raise the knowledge and skill-base of its workforce'. While dismissing the idea of a statutory minimum wage and more social regulation from the European Union, Mr Portillo said Britain should increase its competitive edge by creating products which owed 'more to human knowledge than to human muscle'. He added: 'Our future lies in providing goods and services which have high added-value because of their technology, design or innovation. They are likely to be the basis of our prosperity in an increasingly competitive world.'</p>

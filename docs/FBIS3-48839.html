The  decision will be effective as of 1 March 1994. At present,  foreigners must pay $20 for an entry visa at Pochentong Airport.    Concerning agricultural development for the period of  1994-95, the meeting decided to impose a ban on the export of  logs and timber, but it still authorizes the exploitation of  wood for local needs.    With regard to rubber exploitation, the government has  decided in principle to privatize rubber production.

The government has also adopted [number indistinct] May as  Water Policy Day. On that day, all citizens should participate  in work to construct irrigation systems. They should work on  these projects for 15 days per year.</p>

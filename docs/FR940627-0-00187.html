			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) When such disparate additive products are for the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose-in-use and are not ordinarily used in the fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simultaneously, the fuel manufacturer shall be responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing (or participating in the group testing of) a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulation for each such additive product. Testing related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each additive product shall be performed on a mixture of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive in the applicable base fuel, as described in paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)(1) of this section, or by participation in the costs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing the designated representative of the fuel/additive group  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to which each separate atypical additive product belongs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When the disparate additive products are not for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same purpose-in-use, the fuel manufacturer shall nevertheless be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for testing a separate formulation for each such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive product, as described in paragraph (g)(1) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, if these additives are not ordinarily blended together  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the same commercial formulation of the fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) When the disparate additive products are ordinarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blended together in the same commercial formulation of the fuel,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then the fuel manufacturer shall be responsible for the testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a single test formulation containing all such simultaneously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used atypical additive products. Alternatively, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility can be satisfied by enrolling such fuel product in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a group which includes other fuel or additive products with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same total combination of atypical elements as that occurring in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fuel product in question. If the basic registration data for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the subject fuel includes any alternative additives which contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> atypical elements not represented in the test formulation, then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fuel manufacturer is also responsible for testing a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulation for each such additional disparate additive product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Emission Control System Testing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If any information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted in accordance with this subpart or any other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information available to EPA shows that a fuel or fuel additive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may have a deleterious effect on the performance of any emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control system or device currently in use or which has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed to a point where in a reasonable time it would be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general use were such effect avoided, EPA may, in its judgment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require testing to determine whether such effects in fact exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such testing will be required in accordance with such protocols  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and schedules as the Administrator shall reasonably require and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be paid for by the fuel or fuel additive manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;79.52  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Tier 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General Specifications.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Tier 1 requires manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of designated fuels or fuel additives (or groups of manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to &sect;79.56) to supply to the Administrator: the identity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and concentration of certain emission products of such fuels or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additives; an analysis of potential emissions exposures; and any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available information regarding the health and welfare effects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the whole and speciated emissions. In addition to any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information required under &sect;79.59 and in conformance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting requirements thereof, manufacturers shall provide,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to the timing provisions of &sect;79.51(c), the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Emissions Characterization.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Manufacturers must provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a characterization of the emission products which are generated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by evaporation (if required pursuant to &sect;79.58(b)) and by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in a motor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle. For this purpose, manufacturers may perform the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterization procedures described in this section or may rely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on existing emission characterization data. To be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate in lieu of performing new emission characterization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, the data must be the result of tests using the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product in question or using a fuel or additive/base fuel mixture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the same grouping criteria as the product in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the emissions must be generated in a manner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably similar to those described in &sect;79.57, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterization procedures must be adequately performed and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documented and must give results reasonably comparable to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which would be obtained by performing the procedures described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> herein. Reports of previous tests must be sufficiently detailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to allow EPA to judge the adequacy of protocols, techniques, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusions. After the manufacturer's submittal of such data, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA finds that the manufacturer has relied upon inadequate test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data, then the manufacturer will not be considered to be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance until the corresponding tests have been conducted and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the results submitted to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General Provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The emissions to be characterized shall be generated,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collected, and stored according to the processes described in &sect;79.57. Characterization of combustion and evaporative emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be performed separately on each emission sample collected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the applicable emission generation procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) As provided in &sect;79.57(d), if the emission generation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle/engine is ordinarily equipped with an emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aftertreatment device, then all requirements in this section for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the characterization of combustion emissions must be completed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both with and without the aftertreatment device in a functional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state. The emissions shall be generated three times (on three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different days) without a functional aftertreatment device and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if applicable, three times (on three different days) with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functional aftertreatment device, and each such time shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzed according to the remaining provisions in this paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Measurement of background emissions. It is required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that ambient/dilution air be analyzed for levels of background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical species present at the time of emission sampling (for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both combustion and evaporative emissions) and that background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical species profiles be reported with emissions speciation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data. Background chemical species measurement/analysis during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FTP is specified in &sect;&sect;86.109&hyph;94(c)(5) and 86.135&hyph;94 of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

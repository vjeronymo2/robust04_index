A few days before his appointment by the  expanded Higher Council of the Republic (HCR, the transitional  parliament), this remark is important, coming from Monsignor  Monsengwo, the president of the institution. What is he doing  in Brussels while in Kinshasa the HCR is putting the finishing  touches to the transitional constitution and is preparing to  choose the prime minister - - a bone of contention? But does  Monsignor really want to be on the spot at the time of the  choice, which is due to be made "in around 10 days?" This  appointment "does not concern me...I do not want to wear the  hat" of a politician or have the responsibility for the actions  of a politician.  <H5>  Right To Examine </H5>   "The agreement relates to the appointment of the prime  minister by the opposition. If the opposition is to elect the  prime minister, the other camp must not have the right of veto,  at most a right to examine, since we are acting by consensus.  This right to examine may be purely negative in the sense that  we could say -- as in the 20 December agreement -- that the  Political Forces of the Conclave (Mobutuists -- LA LIBRE  BELGIQUE editor's note) acknowledge their choice provided the  person elected, whoever he might be, can respect the agreements  in the formation of his government and in the administration of  the state. That being so, it is not obvious that there should  be a vote. These are the agreements and I am anxious that they  should be respected."    So, what is the point of the candidates put forward in the  past few days? "Many people want to be prime minister. There  is even reason to be surprised at that in a situation as complex  as that of Zaire today."  <H5>  Reviewing the Timetable </H5>   According to Monsignor Monsengwo, the election timetable  "will have to be reviewed." Indeed, four months have passed  since the adoption of the protocol which set the beginning of  the Third Republic for 1 January 1985. According to the  prelate, the stages of this will be "the constitutional  referendum, then the presidential and parliamentary elections at  the same time, then the regional and local elections. This can  only happen when the institutions are in place, in other words,  not just the transitional government, but the government, and  the National Elections Commission," which will monitor the  elections.    Will they be reliable? "All the necessary measures must be  taken to ensure that they are: Access for all to the media,  installation of a minimum of telecommunications to enable the  people in the interior of the country to be able to follow the  election campaign. That could be done in six months with help.  Finally, we need national and foreign observers to monitor the  process."</p>

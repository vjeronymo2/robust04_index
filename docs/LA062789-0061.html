			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL OKS BUDGET; TRAUMA AID INCREASED  </P> <P> A two-house conference committee reached agreement on a nearly $50-billion  proposed state budget Monday after approving an extra $100 million from  Proposition 99 tobacco tax money for trauma centers and emergency medical  services.  </P> <P> The agreement on extra money for trauma centers and emergency services, pushed  by Los Angeles legislators, came just hours before the conference committee  voted 6 to 0 on the nearly $50-billion budget for the 1989-90 fiscal year that  will begin July 1. The budget now will go back to the Assembly and Senate for  final votes by the two houses.  </P> <P> Typically, the conference committee spending recommendations are adopted by  both houses and forwarded on to the governor as the Legislature's official  budget. This year, however, conference committee agreement is only one element  of the complicated budget puzzle.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders are still negotiating on several  major issues that must be resolved to pave the way for adoption of a budget.  </P> <P> The issues are:  </P> <P> * How to modify the voter-approved limit on government spending, so that the  state will be free to spend a $2.5-billion tax windfall.  </P> <P> * How to distribute $1.5 billion in new money for public schools and community  colleges that has been reserved for education under terms of Proposition 98,  which was passed by voters last year.  </P> <P> Earlier, the governor and legislative leaders reached tentative agreement on a  10-year, $18.5-billion transportation plan, but that proposal will not be  submitted to the Legislature for approval until all issues under negotiation  have been resolved.  </P> <P> If the spending limit is not changed, Deukmejian or the Legislature will have  to cut at least $900 million from the committee-approved budget because the  state would lack legal authority to spend the money.  </P> <P> Even though key roadblocks remain, Monday's agreement by the six-member  conference committee on the trauma-care funding proposal will help pave the way  for budget passage. Two Los Angeles Democratic legislators on the committee --  Assemblywoman Maxine Waters and Sen. Alan Robbins -- led the fight for the  extra money for the state's financially troubled trauma-center and  emergency-care network.  </P> <P> It comes from a pot of $545 million that will be distributed to a variety of  medical, research and education programs as a result of voter approval last  year of Proposition 99, which raised the tax on cigarettes by 25-cents a pack  and made comparable increases in taxes on other tobacco products.  </P> <P> The exact formula for dividing up the tobacco tax money will be worked out in  separate legislation.  </P> <P> However, under an amendment worked out by Waters, if the separate legislation  is not approved by Oct. 1, then the money automatically will be divided up by  California's counties. Los Angeles County, because of its size and extensive  trauma-care network, is expected to reap a significant windfall either way. The  closing of trauma centers in the Los Angeles area because of budget  difficulties has been one of the county's more pressing public health problems.  </P> <P> "We've been suffering in Los Angeles because of the closing down of trauma-care  centers. We felt we needed to take a little extra step here so we could expand  the level of care for trauma and ensure that people who are in accidents are  taken care of," Waters said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rumors Circulating  </P> <P> Waters' success may be short-lived. Rumors circulating around the conference  committee were that Deukmejian may veto the money from the budget because of  opposition from within the Administration to the use of tobacco tax money to  support trauma centers.  </P> <P> Moments before the main budget was approved, the conference committee struggled  to come up with $110 million in proposed reductions in order to boost the  reserve for fiscal emergencies to about $870 million, a figure well below the  target set by the governor.  </P> <P> Deukmejian, reasoning that this year's reserve was whittled down to nearly zero  by unexpected demands for state money that developed during the year, has told  the budget writers that he wants a reserve of $1.2 billion, in addition to a  separate reserve for education programs of $250 million.  </P> <P> Programs cut by the committee included a reduction of $30 million in Medi-Cal  expenditures to hospitals, $50 million in extra funds for health programs for  the working poor, $5 million from a pilot health program for children, $8  million to hire additional Workers' Compensation Court judges and $17 million  in tax relief given to farmers who agree not to sell agricultural land to  commercial and residential developers.  </P> <P> Several major spending priorities were set even before the conference committee  began its deliberations.  </P> <P> For instance, pay raises for state employees, a potentially divisive matter,  was not an issue this year because lawmakers agreed last year on a two-year pay  package. State employees got a 6% pay raise June 1 and will receive another 4%  raise Jan. 1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Allowances Hiked  </P> <P> In addition, both houses of the Legislature had agreed before the conference  committee was convened that welfare recipients would receive 4.6% increases in  their monthly allowances.  </P> <P> Deukmejian also defused much of the tension building up over this year's budget  when he announced June 1 that he was agreeing to substantial increases in  budgets for mental health, youth camps, health services for the poor and  nursing programs for the elderly.  </P> <P> His announcement was based on the assumption that he and legislative leaders  will be able to agree on legislation that will allow them to spend the  $2.5-billion windfall, which resulted from unexpectedly high personal income  tax collections. In January, when the budget picture looked much bleaker,  Deukmejian had proposed deep cuts in the same programs.  </P> <P> HEALTH PLAN VOTE: The Assembly passes legislation to provide catastrophic  health insurance to Californians whose medical histories make it difficult for  them to obtain coverage.

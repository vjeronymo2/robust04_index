			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A static auction year - A recession-hit time in the saleroom from September last year to this July - reflected the continuing recession and varied little from the previous 12 months. Without the buyers' premium (10 per cent) Christie's turnover in its King Street sales totalled Pounds 4.49m (Pounds 4.35m); and Sotheby's sold Pounds 2.10m (Pounds 2.07). In addition Christie's took another Pounds 1.02m (1.09m) in other UK sales and Pounds 3.29m (2.82m) in overseas auctions. These have principally been in the US, where, surprisingly, after more than 20 years, they have now given up auctioning wine. Sotheby's does not sell wine outside London and does not issue detailed figures, but it has increased sales. A problem for both houses has been lack of stock for, unless pressed for cash, many owners of fine bottles are not eager to sell when prices are low. Also a growing number of brokers are selling for their clients wines that otherwise would have been sent to the saleroom. The wine most sold there is claret, because the finer growths are the most collected, often with some expectation of later profit. However, as the accompanying tables for the first-growths and other prominent classed-growths show, at least in recent years recession and inflation have greatly reduced prospects of the latter. The peak year for ex-cellar en primeur prices was the highly praised 1989. In spring 1990 the first growths generally opened at FFr230 a bottle and leading seconds at FFr115 to FFr125. These meant a duty-paid, delivered cost to retail buyers of about Pounds 590 a case, or Pounds 49 a bottle, for the firsts and Pounds 320 a case, or Pounds 25.50 a bottle, for the others. Yet, three years later, Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester, Essex, is listing Latour '89 at Pounds 54 a bottle and Ducru-Beaucaillou at Pounds 27.25. Faced with the beginning of the recession opening prices of the 1990 clarets were around 10 per cent lower. But in the auction room 1990 has marked the summit for earlier vintages. The accompanying tables show the highest average prices for six first-growth and eight prominent other classed-growths in 1990; in the depth of recession last year and in the current year to the end of July. (Petrus has been omitted as its saleroom prices are on such a high level as to distort the annual averages, but its trend is similar to the rest). In terms of value and drinkability, the '83s and '85s are undervalued in the saleroom. The other 'investment' wine, bought when first available after the year has been declared by the shippers, is vintage port. Cheap in the saleroom for years, the table shows that it too has declined since 1990. The '63s and '77s are real bargains for vintage port drinkers, but there are now fewer of them outside the institutions. Since early this year Christie's sales have displayed an upward trend: not so much in individual prices, but in the percentage of value terms of the lots sold: from 81.55 per cent in January to July last year to 91.45 per cent this year. Sterling devaluation has encouraged foreign buyers, particularly from the Far East, and if the economy improves so should turnover increase in both salerooms in the coming season.  -----------------------------------------              VINTAGE PORT  ----------------------------------------- Vintage       1990     1992     1993  ----------------------------------------- 1963           493      397      411 1970           256      244      242 1977           244      211      217 1983           143      124      116 1985           157      138      119  ----------------------------------------- Cockburn, Croft, Dow, Fonseca, Graham, Noval, Taylor, Warre.

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Observer: Food for thought The London Business School has responded to Observer's appeal for names of suitable guests to be invited to tonight's private dinner in Blackpool for Lady Thatcher. It has just published the results of a poll of its latest intake of MBA students, which asked the budding business brains which three people they would most like to wine and dine. The exercise - part of the admissions procedure - is not entirely frivolous; it's designed to reveal something about the character and interests of the candidates themselves. Two of the three 'winning guests' - Richard Branson and Mikhail Gorbachev - might be appropriate dinner companions at tonight's bash. The other one, Leonardo da Vinci, is unfortunately unavailable. Also popular were Jesus Christ, Einstein and Margaret Thatcher herself. At the other end of the scale were Hitler, Rommel and Jeffrey Archer.</p>

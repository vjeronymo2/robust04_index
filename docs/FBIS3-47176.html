Sihanouk, in a statement released by state news agency AKP  Saturday, said that apart from Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, the only  anti-Vietnamese pogroms took place after the then Prince  Sihanouk was ousted in a 1970 US-backed coup d'etat led by  General Lon Nol.    "The non-Khmer Rouges patriotic Cambodians only struggled  against the Vietnamese agressors but never allowed the human  rights of civilian Vietnamese men and women to be violated,"  Sihanouk, who is undergoing surgery for cancer in Beijing, said.  [passage omitted]    Sihanouk said an "Australian personality" made the  accusation  during an interview with BBC television.    Sihanouk turned the accusation around, asking: "Were the  white Australians themselves perfectly irreproachable in their  policies and acts towards the (non-white) ethnic minority who  were the original owners of Australia?". [passage omitted]    Some 20,000 ethnic Vietnamese fishing people fled Cambodia  in  the run-up to last May's U.N.-supervised elections to escape a  Khmer Rouge campaign of ethnic cleansing. [passage omitted]    Although many of the families could speak Khmer and had  fished the waters of the Tonle Sap, Cambodia's great lake, for  generations and others were married to Cambodians, they found  themselves stranded as the government would not let them return.    Sensitive to the effectiveness of Khmer Rouge propaganda,  the  government said it first needed to draft an immigration law.    But months later, Minister of Information Ieng Mouli said no  decision had been made on whether the boat people could return  as the law had yet to be discussed.</p>

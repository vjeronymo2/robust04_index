			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Craxi to help in scandal inquiry MR Bettino Craxi, the former Italian Socialist leader, has suddenly changed tactics in defending himself against a string of corruption charges. He now appears willing to collaborate with the magistrates. On his own initiative he arranged a meeting in Rome on Saturday with Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the Milan magistrate whom he has castigated since the corruption scandals first broke in early 1992. The meeting marks a turning point in the long investigations into political corruption and illicit party financing. Until now, no senior politician in any of the previous administrations has sought to co-operate with the inquiries. Instead, they have hidden behind the protection of parliamentary immunity until forced by public opinion to waive it. Mr Craxi has never ceased to protest his innocence and in March fought hard to avoid losing his immunity. He has been told he is under investigation for numerous other corruption offences. However, the magistrates cannot question him unless he consents. As one of the most powerful figures in Italy from 1980 until his enforced resignation from the Socialist party this February - and prime minister 1983-1987 - he may be in a position to tell a lot of secrets.</p>

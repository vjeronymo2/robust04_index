			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW PRESIDENT NAMED AT RICOH ELECTRONICS  </P> <P> Ricoh Electronics Inc. has named a new president, Katsumi Yoshida, to succeed  Koichi Endo, who has been reassigned to the Tokyo parent company.  </P> <P> Yoshida, who formerly headed parent Ricoh Co. Ltd.'s overseas production  division in Tokyo, will oversee Ricoh Electronics' three Orange County  manufacturing sites, where more than 90% of the unit's 1,300 employees are  based.  </P> <P> The Tustin-based unit is opening a fourth manufacturing plant today in Gwinnett  County, Ga., to supply Ricoh customers east of the Mississippi River.  </P> <P> Yoshida comes to his post as Ricoh Electronics' sales are declining. Its sales  in 1989 were $216 million, down 9% from $236.4 million in 1988.  </P> <P> A company spokesman declined to say whether Endo's transfer was related to the  sales decline.  </P> <P> Endo has been named general manager of the parent firm's office copier  components division in Tokyo, the company said.  </P> <P> Kerry Regan, a company spokesman in New York, said Yoshida's expertise is in  production for overseas markets. Yoshida will head the company's plans to  expand U.S. sales of its products, which include office copiers, toners and fax  machines.  </P> <P> Ricoh ranks as the fifth-largest supplier of office copiers, after Canon,  Xerox, Sharp and Mita.  </P> <P> Yoshida is no stranger to Orange County. He started Ricoh's operations in 1973  and headed the local division through 1978.  </P> <P> Yoshida was in Georgia and unavailable for comment.  </P></p>

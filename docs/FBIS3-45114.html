During the talks, Meles told the Chinese guest that Ethiopia  pursues a policy of good-neighborliness.    Qian expressed appreciation of the efforts Ethiopia has made  for the settlement of the Somali crisis and the maintenance of  regional peace and stability.    He said the Chinese Government is greatly concerned over the  Somali problem and holds its final settlement is up to the  Somali people.    Africa is facing a complex situation, the Chinese  vice-premier said, adding two tendencies -- neglect Africa or  interfere in Africa's internal affairs -- should be prevented.    The international community should show concern over Africa,  help Africa, he stressed, saying if the political situation in  Africa is unstable and its economy continues worsening, peace  and development in the world cannot be truly achieved.    Qian said China has always been attaching an importance to  strengthening its relations with african countries.    "China is a developing country with a limited strength, but  we always cherish a stand on Africa. That is not to neglect the  problems appearing in Africa and at the same time respect the  will of the African people," he added.    The two leaders also discussed the way of further  strengthening and developing bilateral relations, with Meles  saying Ethiopia welcomes Chinese businessmen to invest and  create enterprises in Ethiopia.    Qian promised the Chinese Government will encourage Chinese  businessmen to enhance exchange of contacts and cooperation with  their Ethiopian counterparts.    On the same occasion, Qian conveyed the greetings of Chinese  president Jiang Zemin to Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi.    The Chinese vice-premier and foreign minister arrived here  on  Tuesday morning for a two-day visit to Ethiopia.</p>

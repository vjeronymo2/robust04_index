			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 15 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa on Tuesday [15 February] admitted that he sounded out  the Social Democratic Party (SDP) on a cabinet reshuffle. But  earlier in the day, Hosokawa told reporters that he is neutral  on whether he should reshuffle his six-month-old cabinet within  Tuesday.    Hosokawa said Monday he was considering an early cabinet  reshuffle, which many political sources said may affect Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura.    Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the SDP, the largest bloc  in the seven-party coalition, on Monday denied there would be an  early reshuffle.    Speculation surfaced Monday that Hosokawa might make changes  in his cabinet after Tuesday's adoption by the government of a  73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994, starting April 1.    The SANKEI SHIMBUN newspaper, quoting sources close to  Hosokawa, reported earlier Monday that Hosokawa is resolved to  reshape the cabinet as early as Tuesday.</p>

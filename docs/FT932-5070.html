			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: New BES launched - At a glance MMI this week launched Homemaker, a Business Expansion Scheme company which will buy residential properties in the midlands and north of England, to be let as assured tenancies. It offers investors a covenanted return after five years of Pounds 1.23 for each Pounds 1 invested, equivalent to a net annual return for higher rate taxpayers of 14.1 per cent. For basic rate taxpayers it equates to 9.9 per cent. The return is covenanted by Davenham Group, and is supported by cash deposits to meet 100 per cent of its obligations. Investors will receive 50 per cent of any excess in the value of the properties when they are sold. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, and the issue is limited to Pounds 3.5m. Britannia claims to have found a way round a proposed amendment to the finance bill which would cause investors in loan-back BES companies to lose tax relief on loans taken up after June 30. Britannia has written to investors in schemes launched in March offering them the opportunity to complete a loan before June 30. Loans could not previously be taken up until six months into the scheme.</p>

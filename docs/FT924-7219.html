			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Westinghouse forced to consider sale of businesses WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the embattled US conglomerate, warned yesterday it was considering more rapid and comprehensive solutions to the troubles of its financial services business which might mean further substantial reserves and force Westinghouse to sell off one or more of its businesses. Westinghouse, with interests ranging from broadcasting to power generation, has been plagued for more than two years by the problems of Westinghouse Financial Services, which has a heavy exposure to poor investments in the depressed US property market. Westinghouse took a pre-tax Dollars 1.68bn provision in the third quarter of last year, mainly for property problems, on top of a Dollars 975m charge to sort out the financial services unit at the start of 1991. The company said yesterday it had been pursuing a strategy of reducing the financial service unit's portfolios over five years. However, it was now conducting a comprehensive review of alternative strategies, due to be completed in the fourth quarter or shortly afterwards, in the light of factors such as continuing adverse economic conditions and declining margins and yields in the Westinghouse portfolio. The review might lead to the sale or liquidation as soon as possible of some or all of the portfolios, involving another substantial reserve. That in turn would require the sale of one or more of the group's businesses. Mr Paul Lego, Westinghouse's chairman, said that despite clamour for a quick remedy, the group would not be stampeded into premature decisions. If businesses were sold, it would try to optimise its return and find strategic buyers who would serve the interests of employees and customers.</p>

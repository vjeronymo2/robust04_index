			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Decline in demand hits Kone result KONE, the Finnish maker of elevators and cranes, said profits before taxes and allocations declined in the first four months, to FM69m (Dollars 12.7m), from FM78m at the same stage last year. It blamed the decline on falling demand in Europe. Kone said although it saw no signs of revival in demand in the rest of 1993, it expected an improvement later in the year to produce a full-year profit at 'nearly the same level' as 1992's FM479m. Sales at Kone Elevators, which represent 73 per cent of group turnover, grew 16 per cent in the first four months, lifting overall sales to FM3.6bn, a 15 per cent improvement over last time. However, some two thirds of the growth in sales were attributed to the near 20 per cent decline in the value of the Finnish markka following its flotation.</p>

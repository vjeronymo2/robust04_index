			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / International Company News: Curtain lifts on MGM's new era - Martin Dickson on the studio's attempt to restore its reputation A pyrotechnically impressive series of explosions booms through the quiet Santa Monica office suite of Mr Frank Mancuso as the new chairman of troubled Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer shows a trailer for one of the film studio's biggest 1994 box office hopes. The film, called Blown Away, is an action adventure, featuring rugged stars Jeff Bridges and Tommy Lee Jones, which pits the leader of a US big city bomb squad against an ingenious bomber. It is one of a group of new releases which both Mr Mancuso and MGM's French owner, the Credit Lyonnais banking group, are relying on to restore the tarnished reputation of the loss-making studio. 'We now have a release schedule I'm getting real happy with, starting in May of 1994,' says Mr Mancuso, who was appointed chairman by Credit Lyonnais last July as part of a broad plan to restore MGM to profit and then sell the studio. The bank found itself the embarrassed owner of MGM in 1992 after foreclosing on loans it had made to Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier. Credit Lyonnais has to sell MGM by 1997, because under US law a foreign bank which takes control of a US company must divest it within five years. It could, however, retain a minority stake. Advised by Mr Michael Ovitz, head of the talent brokerage Creative Artists Agency (CAA) and one of the most influential figures in Hollywood, the bank decided against a quick asset fire-sale. Instead, it is re-building MGM in the belief that a healthy studio will allow it to recoup much more of its investment in the company, which tops Dollars 2bn. That judgment is already looking shrewd: the estimated value of Hollywood studios has risen sharply over the past three months. As cable television and telecommunications companies jostle for position in preparation for an age of inter-active, multi-media television, they are trying to snatch up film companies to ensure themselves a reliable supply of entertainment 'software' to fill their many TV channels. MGM is a shadow of its former self. However, as one of Hollywood's traditional big seven studios it retains a powerful brand name and an important, though neglected, US film distribution network. It also owns a one third share in United International Pictures, the London-based international distributor, and its film library still contains over 1,500 titles, ranging from the 16 James Bond movies to the hit comedy Thelma and Louise. In short, MGM could make an attractive meal for a software-hungry communications group, provided Mr Mancuso can start turning out a steady stream of shows which perform well at the box office - and make money. Mr Mancuso, 60, is a well-connected member of the Hollywood establishment, having spent 30 years with one of the industry leaders, Paramount Pictures, where he was chairman for seven years. He quit in 1991 after a row with the studio's parent, Paramount Communications. He says the company's problems stem from the unsettling environment of a succession of owners and 'tremendous neglect for many years' before the bank took control. This finally 'led to a perception in the community (Hollywood) that it wasn't safe to make a movie at MGM'. Credit Lyonnais has acted to restore financial faith in the business by increasing its credit line to Dollars 400m to support expanded production; and by removing some Dollars 820m of bank debt from its balance sheet, giving it a healthy debt to equity ratio of 1 to 2. Mr Mancuso, for his part, has shaken up senior production management, appointing Mr Michael Marcus, a ex-CAA executive, as president of MGM Pictures and Mr John Calley, a former Warner Brothers executive, as head of United Artists, a famous but defunct studio owned by MGM which the company is reviving as a second source of films. Mr Marcus is likely to produce films with a mass-market entertainment appeal, while Mr Calley will tend towards more cutting edge material. The group aims to increase its output of films to between 15 and 20 a year, and that, together with deals with producers Polygram and Carolco Pictures, will give it some 25-28 films a year to push through its distribution network, compared to 9 or 10 in recent years. It is too soon to say whether the burst of activity will produce a run of hits, but on paper the studio has several promising titles for 1994. Still, in an important display of confidence in MGM's creative abilities, cable television's Showtime Networks, a film channel, recently signed a seven-year deal for exclusive premium television rights to 150 new MGM movies. MGM reckons the deal could be worth Dollars 1bn. 'Its a huge additional element of distribution,' says Mr Mancuso. 'Its as good a deal as anyone has in the business.' True or not, its a long time since MGM has had the confidence to compare itself with the best in Hollywood.</p>

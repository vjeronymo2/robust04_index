			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Quadrant loses Pounds 4.83m as shipping deal turns sour QUADRANT, the photographic and video equipment company, yesterday announced heavy interim losses stemming from a shipping investment designed to shelter capital gains liabilities but which turned sour. In the six months to August 31 pre-tax losses were Pounds 4.83m after exceptional charges of Pounds 3.61m, a downturn from a profit of Pounds 940,000. No dividend is declared, against 1.65p, after losses per share of 16.85p (earnings 2.04p). The shares fell 2p to 20p. The company's problems started with the purchase last year of two liquid petroleum gas carriers from Beckworth, which is controlled by Mr Robert Brothers, a Hong Kong businessman. It wanted to shelter Pounds 6.2m of capital gains liability due on the sale of a telecommunications subsidiary in 1989. In part consideration for the purchase of the carriers, Beckworth took a 16 per cent stake in Quadrant, which has since risen to 18.46 per cent. But the carriers lost money because of a downturn in the LPG transport market. Beckworth had guaranteed to make good any shortfall in revenues from the carriers but ran into financial difficulty, failed to meet its obligations and now owes Quadrant over Pounds 1m. Quadrant has agreed to buy back and cancel Beckworth's shareholding at 23 3/4 p a share, the mid-market price last Monday, to raise Pounds 1.15m. It will then sell the carriers, complete with Pounds 3.7m of sheltered capital gains liability, to Andreas Shipping, a Greek ship management company, for Pounds 1. If the ships operate profitably, Quadrant is entitled to further payments of up to Dollars 1.75m (Pounds 1m). The transactions depend on shareholders' approval and Beckworth's banks lifting certain charges now in place over the Quadrant shareholding. Mr Andrew Douglas, chief executive of Quadrant, said the transactions would remove Pounds 4.2m of capital gains liability and leave Quadrant with only Pounds 700,000 of unsheltered liabilities. This charge was provided for as an extraordinary item in the interim results, along with losses of Pounds 7.5m on the write down in value of the ships. As a result, loss attributable to shareholders came to Pounds 13m (profit Pounds 556,000).</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PENNSYLVANIA OKS RESTRICTIVE BILL  </P> <P> Gov. Robert P. Casey on Friday signed a bill giving Pennsylvania the most  restrictive abortion law in the country.  </P> <P> The action makes Pennsylvania the first state to take advantage of a U.S.  Supreme Court ruling in July that gave states more leeway in making their own  abortion laws.  </P> <P> Casey said he believes that the bill, which takes effect in 60 days, is  constitutional and will not provide a test case to challenge the Supreme  Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling, which gave women the constitutional right to  an abortion.  </P> <P> The state House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 143 to 58; the  Senate approved it 33 to 17.  </P> <P> The law bans abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy, except to save the  life of the mother or prevent "substantial and irreversible" harm; prohibits  abortions based on the fetus' sex; requires women to inform their husbands if  they plan to get an abortion; regulates the medical use of tissue from aborted  fetuses and mandates that women wait 24 hours to get an abortion.  </P> <P> Also under the law, doctors will have to inform women about the procedure  before performing an abortion and tell them the likely age of the fetus, as  well as explain risks and alternatives.  </P> <P> The law carries stiff penalties for doctors who violate the regulations. A  conviction under the sex-selection ban or 24-week provision could mean up to  seven years in prison and $15,000 in fines.  </P></p>

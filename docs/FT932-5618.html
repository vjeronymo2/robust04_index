			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Fears of renewed unrest in Bombay FEARS of renewed inter-religious unrest resurfaced in Bombay, India's commercial capital, yesterday after violence broke out at the funeral of a murdered leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the militant Hindu party. Over 3,000 soldiers and police were deployed on the streets to prevent any repetition of the riots which hit Bombay in the winter after Hindu militants stormed a mosque in the holy town of Ayodhya and set off nation-wide inter-religious violence. Yesterday's incident was the most serious threat to public order since the terrorist bombs which rocked Bombay in early March. Fighting broke out when police tried to stop mourners stoning a mosque on the funeral route. The police fired tear-gas shells at the crowd. The mourners were marking the death of Mr Premkumar Sharma, a member of the Maharashtra state assembly, who was shot dead outside his home on Tuesday. Mr Premkumar was killed just days after the assassination of another militant Hindu politician - Mr Ramesh More, a member of Shiv Sena, the radical Bombay Hindu grouping. There was widespread concern that militant Hindus might seek to avenge the two deaths by attacking Moslems. The city has been calm since March because BJP and Shiv Sena leaders have urged their supporters to avoid violence, even though Moslems are widely blamed for the bombings. The police suspect the blasts were organised by Moslem-led criminal gangs, possibly with help from Pakistan or another Islamic country. The two brothers whom police regard as the principal organisers of the attack - Yakub and Ishaq Memon - fled to Dubai and were later thought to have gone to Pakistan. The 70 or so people arrested in Bombay are all Moslems. However, the militant Hindu leaders' patience may be cracking under pressure from radical supporters. Mr Bal Thackeray, chief of Shiv Sena, has warned that he would not tolerate attacks on his friends such as Mr More. The police investigation into the blasts has also disclosed tensions amongst different criminal gangs and among politicians, some of whom have been connected to the protection of gangs. Mr A S Samra, the Bombay police chief, last night assigned police guards to all Bombay politicians. He said that there might be a criminal conspiracy behind the killings of the two politicians, but no firm link had been established. Mr More was involved in trade unions linked to Shiv Sena which have been spreading through Bombay, in some cases attempting to force companies to stop hiring Moslems. Mr Sharma, a well-liked politician, helped the police in their investigations of the blasts by providing information about the business activities of criminal gangs in his constituency. The police suspect this may have been a reason why he was singled out for attack.</p>

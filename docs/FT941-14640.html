			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: US banks cast off 1980s debt problems Fourth-quarter figures yesterday from a batch of the US's biggest commercial banks carried a clear message: the industry has moved faster than expected in putting the bad-debt problems of the late-1980s behind it. Net income at seven big banks which reported results yesterday either met or beat analysts' most optimistic forecasts, with Citicorp and Chase Manhattan producing the biggest earnings surprises. Less clear, though, is the answer to a question which continues to overhang bank share prices: how can the banks hope to grow their earnings in future? According to yesterday's figures, most banks hardly expanded their loan books last year, and lending margins came under pressure in some cases. The record profits from trading in foreign exchange and other financial markets in the middle of last year were not repeated, although trading income still remains at high. Citicorp experienced the most marked improvement in asset quality, reporting a Dollars 571m provision in the fourth quarter, down from Dollars 980m in the same period of 1992 and taking total provisions for the year to Dollars 2.6bn. This was a big factor in lifting net income in the fourth quarter to Dollars 575m, or Dollars 1.06 a share, after previously announced one-off items, which included a restructuring charge of Dollars 445m. Citicorp's results, broad details of which had been released last week, also benefited from stronger than expected earnings growth, particularly from its operations in developing countries. The consumer banking business in the developing countries reported net income of Dollars 150m in the fourth quarter, up from Dollars 109m the year before, while in the developed markets it rose to Dollars 228m from Dollars 154m. Net income from wholesale banking, through the global finance division, jumped to Dollars 247m from Dollars 117m in the developing countries, and to Dollars 275m from Dollars 189m in developed markets. Trading profits slipped during the period, as foreign exchange income fell to Dollars 158m from Dollars 264m the corresponding period. Citicorp's strong earnings rebound, which took its profits for the year to a record Dollars 1.92bn (Dollars 2.2bn after accounting changes), also boosted its Tier 1 capital ratio to 6.5 per cent, up from 4.9 per cent a year ago. The results prompted Moody's, the credit rating agency, to announce that it may upgrade the bank, whose long-term debt is rated A2. The review will concentrate on the bank's long-term earnings potential. Chase Manhattan also comfortably exceeded expectations, as fourth-quarter figures were lifted by profits on disposals of distressed assets. Chase reported net income for the period of Dollars 313m, or Dollars 1.53 a share, up from Dollars 169m, or 87 cents, the year before. Provisions for the year as a whole rose, due to a special Dollars 566m charge taken early in 1993 against loans held for accelerated sale. These charges proved over-cautious: the bank made net gains of Dollars 215m in the fourth quarter of the year from asset sales, which was included as 'other revenue'. Income from trading activities rose to Dollars 167m from Dollars 114m in the same period of 1992, though it remained below the Dollars 186m of the third quarter. The bank reported that trading in emerging markets securities had bolstered income in the latest period. Chase made greater headway during the year than other big banks in strengthening its net interest margin, though this was in part due to profits from the sale of Brazilian and Argentine bonds which others reported as non-interest items. The margin, at 4.33 per cent, would have been 4.15 per cent had it not been for this factor. The net interest margin was likely to decline in the coming year as short-term US interest rates rise, the bank said. Chemical Banking reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 347m, or Dollars 1.23 a share, up from Dollars 197m, or 64 cents, the year before, putting it ahead of expectations. The advance was largely due to a rise in non-interest income, due to gains on Argentine and Brazilian debt and profits on venture capital investments. These items boosted 'other non-interest income' for the period to Dollars 236m from Dollars 9m, and for the year as a whole to Dollars 710m from Dollars 190m. On the other hand, the bank's net interest margin slipped in the fourth quarter to 3.65 per cent, from 4.01 per cent a year before. This reflected a higher level of lower-yielding liquid assets, and lower returns on securities holdings, the bank said. NationsBank reported net income for the fourth quarter of Dollars 373m, or Dollars 1.37 a share, up from Dollars 234m, or 92 cents, the year before. However, its net interest margin came under pressure during the period, sliding to 3.77 per cent from 4.23 per cent in the previous period and confirming expectations that lending margins for all banks, which remain at historically high levels, are likely to fall as competition to lend picks up. NationsBank reported loan growth of 10 per cent before acquisitions, pushing total loans for the year up 16 per cent to Dollars 79bn. As lending margins declined, return on capital for the year as a whole slipped slightly, to 15 per cent. BancOne also reported growing loan demand, and that lending margins had begun to decline somewhat. Mr John McCoy, head of the Ohio-based bank, said consumer lending had increased 24 per cent during the year, while commercial lending was up 4 per cent. For the year as a whole, lending margins rose to 6.29 per cent, from 5.98 per cent the year before. During the latest quarter, though, the margin fell to 6.07 per cent, from 6.22 per cent in the third quarter of 1993. Without the bank's activities in the swaps markets, the margin would have been 5.38 per cent. Net income for the fourth quarter was Dollars 286m, or 82 cents a share, compared with Dollars 206m, or 59 cents, a year before.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  US BANKS: THE PICTURE AT YEAR-END  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank                 Assets        Net income* )  Return on capital (Dollars bn)      (Dollars m)      (Dollars M)        (Percent)                    Dec 31 93       1993  1992       1993     1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Citicorp              216.6      1,919    722       17.7      6.5 NationsBank           157.7      1,301  1,145       15.0     15.8 Chemical              149.9      1,569  1,086       16.7     12.4 Chase Manhattan       102.1        466    639    ***14.6     11.1 BancOne                79.9      1,121  **877       17.81  **15.2 Wells Fargo            52.5        591    283    ***16.7      7.9 First Interstate       51.5        561    282       17.3      9.6  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Net interest      Provision for    Tier 1 capital                      margin percent    credit losses    ration (percent) Bank                                    (Dollars m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      1993    1992      1993    1992     1993     1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Citicorp             3.88    3.76     2,600   4,146      6.5      4.9 NationsBank          3.96    4.10       430     715      7.4      7.5 Chemical             3.73    3.82     1,259   1,365      8.0      7.3 Chase Manhattan      4.33    4.09     1,561   1,220      8.4      6.8 BancOne              6.29    5.98       369     604     10.5     10.0 Wells Fargo          5.74    5.70       550   1,215     10.5      8.2 First Interstate     4.91    4.89       112     314     10.0      9.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Before accounting changes ***after accounting changes **restated  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: company reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

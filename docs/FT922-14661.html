			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Double visions of the UK economy: Britain's political parties are still divided on markets and taxes For Mr John Smith, it was a glimpse of a better future. The shadow chancellor's eyes lit up as he watched 39-year-old Kathleen Jennings operate her computer-controlled milling machine in the engineering workshop at the Midland Oak Skills and Technology Centre in Brierley Hill near Birmingham. 'Making goods and providing services that people round the world want, that's what Britain should be about,' he said. By contrast, chancellor Mr Norman Lamont's campaigning in the Birmingham area the day before took him to a one-man cake business to emphasise the government's support for individual enterprise. Understandably for a country mired in recession, the election campaign at the national level has focused on the main parties' respective claims to manage the UK economy more successfully. But the campaigning in the West Midlands neatly captured the fundamental differences in attitude that exist between the main parties over individual responsibility and the power of the state to control market forces in the economy. The possibility of a Labour government or a hung parliament makes this election the most important for Britain's consumers and businesses since 1979. Overarching divergences on economic philosophy between the Tories on the one hand and Labour and the Liberal Democrats on the other could result in Britain having a very different economy if the government changes and if the next parliament runs its full course. In spite of a retreat from radicalism by both main parties, Labour retains a belief that the state should influence how individual lives are arranged and that society is best served by a distribution of wealth from 'rich' to 'poor'. The Conservatives, although they have expressed it poorly, want to vest more responsibility in the individual and promote ownership, and are more interested in the creation than allocation of wealth. These differences have been exaggerated by the parties' regional biases. Mr Neil Kinnock's new model Labour party is staffed by northerners and Scots from the UK's lower-cost, lower-paid manufacturing regions. As a result, it has little reason to sympathise with the conspicuous consumption of 'Essex man' and his cousins in the south-east of England which was fostered during the boom of the 1980s. However, what really differentiates the parties is their attitude to the market. The Conservatives work from the presumption that market mechanisms and incentives should be allowed to do their job except in cases of manifest market failure or where a service - the most obvious being defence - is clearly for the public good. Both Labour and Liberal Democrats wish to influence the market. The Liberal Democrats say that 'the market should be our servant, not our master', while Labour claims that modern government has a 'strategic role to ensure that the market works properly'. Labour has therefore reserved the right to interfere in broad sectors of the economy, usually with the aim of guiding and supporting producer interests. The Tories, in spite of drifting under Mr John Major away from the more rigorous free market precepts of Mrs Thatcher's governments, want the consumer to be king and call the shots. That Labour has no instinctive affinity for the market economy has been demonstrated by politicians on the stump and in its policy papers. On an election phone-in programme this week, Mr John Smith was uncharacteristically lost for words when asked how he would resist the temptation to alter interest rates on the grounds of political expediency. A politician steeped in the laws of the market would have answered that in a world of unhindered capital movements, such imprudent action would swiftly be penalised by financial market pressures. The Labour manifesto is full of interventionist pledges of varying merit. It promises action to help industry as a top priority for lifting Britain out of recession; 'an investment decade' and 'a coherent national training policy' to rebuild the UK's manufacturing strength. It includes plans for a minimum wage in spite of evidence from independent economic research institutes that there are better ways to alleviate poverty. Labour would also 'manage credit sensibly' and 'stop excessive price rises in water, electricity, telephones, transport and National Health Service prescriptions'. The rival tax proposals of Mr Lamont and Mr Smith underline the two leading parties' differing perceptions on incentives and how best to strengthen the supply side of the economy. Mr Smith has never wavered in his belief that Labour's plans to increase significantly the tax burden of people earning more than Pounds 22,000 will have no effect on economic efficiency or that his proposed Pounds 1.1bn recovery programme for industry will spur investment and growth. Mr Lamont's theme since his March 10 Budget has been that increases in top tax rates make no sense at this stage of the economic cycle. On the other hand, the length and depth of the Tories' second recession show that market forces can be a cruel and crude taskmaster for a government that fails to master the challenges of deregulation and liberalisation. Britain's crumbling infrastructure and the lack of coherent government in London are also examples of how too narrow a definition of the public good has allowed problems to emerge that are damaging Britain's ability to be economically competitive. Despite their fundamental differences, no single party is likely to make much difference to the key indicators of Britain's economic health over the next five years. The scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre is limited. High government borrowings restrict the room for fiscal stimulus. Britain's ability to alter interest rates is constrained by sterling's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. As the chart shows, James Capel, the London stockbroker, expects growth to be solid rather than spectacular whichever policy is adopted. Capel's projections and those of other forecasters indicate that inflation over the next five years would be unlikely to fall below 3 per cent under a Labour or Liberal Democrat government while fluctuating around 2.5 per cent under the Tories. Although the National Institute of Economic and Social Research expects unemployment to be 300,000 lower under Labour in 1993, other forecasters expect no such improvement. Where policies will make a difference, however, is in the experience of regions, sectors and individuals. For all three, Mr Smith's tax policies represent a step into the unknown. His income tax proposals will hit the high-earning south-east, where, according to the Reward Group of consultants, incomes need to be up to 25 per cent higher than the national average to ensure an average standard of living. This region, accounting for 35 per cent of UK gross domestic product, has been worst affected by the recession. On average, Labour's Budget will cost families with incomes of more than Pounds 52,000 a year more than Pounds 105 a week. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies calculates that annual total disposable income will fall by Pounds 1.5bn in the south (comprising London, the south-east and south-west) under a Labour government. For most industrialists, the prospect of such a radical redistribution of income has more than offset any satisfaction over Labour's plans to boost investment. Sir John Banham, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, has warned that Labour's tax plans could turn the recession into a slump. Lord Weir, chairman of the Glasgow-based Weir Group of engineering companies, would expect 'a much slower recovery under Labour'. Sir Eric Parker, chief executive of the Trafalgar House construction and shipping conglomerate, believes that the extension of the 9 per cent employees' National Insurance contribution to earnings of more than Pounds 21,060 a year in particular would increase pressure for higher wages among middle managers and damage the UK's 'sickly' housing market. However, the Tories' hands-off attitude towards industry has also been unwelcome. Mr Philip Hughes, the founder and former chairman of Logica, the software company, believes Labour's more interventionist approach would benefit UK industry in foreign markets. Mr Hughes also backs the minimum wage as a step towards making Britain a high-wage, high-productivity nation. By contrast, a change of government would mean 'all sorts of problems for people dependent on fee-based income in the City', according to Mr Keith Skeoch, James Capel's chief UK economist. Mergers and acquisitions, in particular, would be subject to tighter controls and Mr Skeoch expresses some concern for the banking industry if the economy in the south-east is depressed further. Retailing would also be less likely to prosper under Labour, because the higher earners tend to be the higher spenders, although stores selling basic goods, might profit from increased incomes for the poor. In the longer term, the choice of government could have more profound effects on the economy. Labour's interventionist leanings could have a more significant impact on policy if its economic recovery plan ran into trouble. The redistributive tax policies of both Labour and the Liberal Democrats could influence the career choices of entrants into the job market, affecting the long-term competitiveness of the country by reducing the attractions for young people of arduous wealth-creating jobs in industry and commerce. Companies may also be tempted to step up investment abroad. To many outsiders, the policies of Mr Smith and his colleagues have an uncanny resemblance to those of Germany in the 1970s, but with the significant addition of promoting modern computer-controlled technology. That German model worked well in a difficult international environment. But it finally foundered on an excess of public spending, leaving West Germany as a slow-growth nation until unification.</p>

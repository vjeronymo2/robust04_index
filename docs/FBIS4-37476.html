			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Kuwait, 18 Jun (KUNA) -- Admiral Jacques  Lanxade, the French chief of general staff said today that his  meetings with Kuwaiti officials focused on looking into means of  bilateral military cooperation and reviewing the overall  situation in the Gulf region.    In a statement to the Kuwaiti news agency he said: Military  cooperation between France and Kuwait goes a long time back, we  now have teams working on helicopters and aircraft. We are also  in the process of discussing joint projects in connection with  other aspects of the armed forces.    He added that he had discussed with Kuwaiti officials a  project on patrol boats. These boats are being manufactured by  a French company that supplies the French Armed Forces with  boats. Oman also has purchased a number of boats from this  company.    The French admiral, who is on a two-day visit to Kuwait said  that France is concerned with the security of the Gulf region.  Admiral Lanxade said: France clearly supports the need for  Iraq to implement all the UN Security Council resolutions and  recognize Kuwait's sovereignty.    He went on to say that he had told Kuwaiti officials France  could supply Kuwait with radar equipment and air defense  rockets. France is making considerable efforts in the field of  defense because we realize that the world is currently unstable  and we have a role to play as a permanent member of the UN  Security Council, he said.    Admiral Lanxade added: We have elements working now in Saudi  Arabia and Turkey to follow up the monitoring of Iraqi air space  and we took part in the embargo on the Jordanian port of  al-'Aqabah.    He said that the current exercises between the Kuwaitis and  the French are aimed at stressing that there is military  cooperation between the two countries.    Admiral Lanxade said: These exercises are a message to the  neighborhood and are a means of developing the operational  aspects of relations between our forces. They are also a means  that would enable us to work together if the need rises.  [passage omitted]    Lanxade stressed: The importance of the military deals  between France and Kuwait are not of mere commercial importance.  In fact the existence of a joint project between the Armed  Forces of the two countries provides a real opportunity for  joint operations, an element that is more important than the  commercial interests.    Regarding the situation in Yemen he said: We believe the  situation is serious in Yemen and wish for the hostilities to be  stopped.    He added that the French naval forces had evacuated a number  of people out of Yemen including foreign nationals more than  French citizens. The Yemeni issue is serious because it affects  the security of the Arab peninsular, he said.    Lanxade said that France had 10 warships opposite Djibouti,  about 4,000 French troops stationed there, forces in the south  of the Indian Ocean, and 150 soldiers of the French Air Force in  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>

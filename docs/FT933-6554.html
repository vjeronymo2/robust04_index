			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Global warming pact progresses THE INTERNATIONAL global warming treaty signed at the United Nations 'Earth Summit' in June last year looks set to come into force ahead of expectations early in 1994, according to UN officials. However, two weeks of negotiations in Geneva on the detailed implementation of the pact are due to end today without agreement on key issues such as finance and 'joint implementation' - under which rich countries would gain credit for financing projects in poor states. The framework treaty, signed by more than 160 nations, commits governments to curbing emissions of greenhouse gases which warm the earth's atmosphere. It has now been ratified by 31 nations, against 50 required for entry into force, and another 34 have said they will ratify this year. The pact will not, however, be fully operational until final decisions on its functioning are taken by a conference of member states tentatively scheduled for early 1995. The most contentious issue for the 146-nation Geneva negotiations, intended to pave the way for the 1995 conference, has been the criteria for 'joint implementation'. The idea is disliked by environmentalists who fear it will weaken the resolve of industrialised countries, the biggest producers of warming gases, to curb their own emissions. Supporters argue that it makes sense to start reducing global emissions where this can be done most cheaply and easily, which will often be in developing countries with low environmental standards. On financing, developing countries are unhappy about the potentially dominant role of the Global Environment Facility run by the World Bank and the UN, which they see as an extension of western and World Bank interests. Negotiators in Geneva, who will meet again next February, have also not yet agreed which countries will be eligible for financial help and which projects should qualify.</p>

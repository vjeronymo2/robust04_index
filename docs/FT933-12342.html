			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares firm as political tensions ease THE UK government's success in winning a vote of confidence in the House of Commons was no surprise for a London stock market which, after recovering from an initial, nervous, mark-down in share prices, was in steadier form yesterday. While political uncertainty is expected to remain an unsettling investment factor, the stock market hopes that the impending parliamentary recess will reduce such pressures. Much of the session was spent mulling over Thursday night's dramatic parliamentary developments and awaiting the outcome of yesterday's vote. With sterling easier, export worries slackened. Government bonds steadied following the result of the confidence debate, closing with minor losses as growth of 0.5 per cent in second quarter gross domestic product suggested that the UK economy was gathering momentum. Long-dated bonds shed about  1/4 of a point while near-dates, closely linked to interest rate expectations, closed un-changed. Index-linked gilts, the prime anti-inflation hedge, shaded lower. Early deals saw the FT-SE Index down to 2,801.2, a fall of nearly 19 points as marketmakers took avoiding action while waiting for the political fog to clear. There was little selling, however, and the 2,800 area again proved a secure base. Helped by favourable comment from market strategists, share prices quickly turned higher. At best, the Footsie was a net 11.9 up before settling back to await the news from Westminster. Few traders appeared willing to act decisively ahead of the weekend, and the final reading of 2,827.7 showed the FT-SE Index 7.6 ahead. The first week of the equity account has seen the Footsie ease by 5.3 as the Maastricht debate in the UK overshadowed an already uncertain stock market. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 2.4 to 3,202.9 yesterday and has shed 14.6 over the week. Seaq volume slipped to 531.6m shares from 582.4m on Thursday when retail business was worth Pounds 1.29bn. At Nomura Securities, Mr Nick Knight suggested that political issues may be irrelevant and that current market levels could be the last chance to 'get on board' at around Footsie 2,800. But Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull disagreed, warning that political, risk will remain 'an important brake' on equities in the short term.</p>

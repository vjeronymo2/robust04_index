			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Management: The trouble with independence - The privatisation of Pro Ned, the body that puts non-executive directors on the board The British non-executive director came of age this week. On Tuesday the Bank of England sold Pro Ned, the body that for a decade has championed the cause of the non-executive, to the sharp end of the private sector. When Pro Ned was set up in 1982, only 50 per cent of listed companies had non-executive directors. Of those only 20 per cent were independent. More than 11 years later there is barely a quoted company that does not have at least one non-executive director on the board. The word has been spread and companies have listened. Yet the credit does not lie altogether with Pro Ned. The recession, the growing power of institutional investors and the recommendations of the Cadbury Committee have all put pressure on companies to get independent members on to their boards. Even companies like Amstrad, which long held out against the idea, have recently given up the fight. Morrison Supermarkets, the Bradford-based food retailer, now stands out as a rare example of a substantial company that refuses to let any non-executives into its boardroom. Small and medium-sized companies are also warming to the theme. 3i, the venture capital organisation, has a list of possible non-executive directors and supplies about 100 a year. Partnerships such as solicitors, engineers and mutual insurance firms are also starting to hire non-executives. During Pro Ned's lifetime, its role has changed from talking to doing. No longer is it mainly a proselytising body pushing a minority interest, but a reasonably efficient and reasonably prosperous employment agency for non-executives. Altogether it has found jobs for more than 600 directors. The Bank of England, doubtless feeling it did not belong in the headhunting business, has placed Pro Ned under new and more suitable ownership: a joint venture between Egon Zehnder, the executive search consultancy, and Pro Ned's own management. 'Our first objective of raising awareness has been fulfilled,' says Bruce Rhodes, a director of Pro Ned. 'But we still have a campaigning role, about how to make appointments, and to find a professional way of getting the right people on to boards.' While non-execs are on the way in, the title 'non-executive' is on the way out. These days the protagonists, including Sir Adrian Cadbury himself, are making a point of calling them independent directors. Explains John Brill of headhunters Hanson Green: ''Non-executive' has the connotation of not doing very much.' Even though companies are hiring more non-executives, that does not mean they are making the best use of them. According to David Clutterbuck, author of The Independent Board Director, it is misleading to take any comfort from the fact that most companies have at least one non-executive. He argues that on most boards executives still outnumber non-execs, while the audit and remuneration committees often still have a strong executive presence. He also complains that many non-executives do not know what to expect from the company when they join, whereas most companies are similarly in the dark about what to expect from their independent directors. 'Most people expect the non-execs to waltz in like John Harvey Jones. But that is not their role,' he says. Clutterbuck is considering establishing a club for 100 companies and individuals to share best practice and discuss matters such as training of non-executives. He argues that more careful selection of non-execs will solve some of the problems. Headhunters are only too happy to fill this role: recruiting non-execs is turning into a profitable little business for them. Ian Butcher of Whitehead Mann reckons that non-executive recruitment business has tripled in three years. Not only has the number of non-executives increased - there are at least 8,000 in the UK - but the proportion of companies seeking outside help with recruitment has also increased. According to Pro Ned, a year ago two-thirds of listed companies used the old-boy network to fill vacancies. Now it estimates that the proportion has fallen to less than half. This year there will be about 2,000 non-executive appointments to companies of a decent size. That means a great deal of business for headhunters which charge between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 30,000 for each appointment. Yet for all the work it has done, Pro Ned does not enter the private sector covered in glory. Many people who have failed to get on to its select list of 900 eligible candidates for non-executive positions argue that its criteria are too narrow - that many of the people on the list are too old and too obvious. Others who have managed to get on to the list but who years later have still not had a single sniff of a job are also restive. The headhunters argue that Pro Ned's way of selecting clients from a list is too passive (they put less emphasis on the fact it has also been some Pounds 10,000 cheaper). They argue that only by conducting a search can the perfect person be found. Under the new ownership Pro Ned is likely to change, becoming more expensive as well as more active, going out to find business rather than responding to companies which have asked.</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: CHOLESTEROL FORMS JUST ONE PIECE OF A MUCH LARGER HEALTH  PICTURE  </P> <P> Over the last 20 years cholesterol has become a household word. So much so, in  fact, that manufacturers use it (or more correctly, the absence of it) to  promote not only vegetable oils and peanut butter but such nutritionally  questionable items as potato chips and deep-fried corn curls.  </P> <P> The "cholesterol-free" claim used so liberally is accurate. What the  manufacturers don't bother to say is that whether you buy the cheapest cooking  oil or the most expensive brand on the shelf, it will contain no cholesterol,  which is found only in animal foods.  </P> <P> But when it comes to keeping blood cholesterol in check, dietary cholesterol  forms just one piece of a picture that even after years of research is still  not in full focus. A true understanding of the diet serum-cholesterol link  requires knowledge of several key terms used to describe components of both  food and blood cholesterol.  </P> <P> The logical place to start is with cholesterol itself, a waxy substance  manufactured by our bodies at a rate of about 200 milligrams a day. We need  cholesterol; it performs central functions in the body. A member of the lipid  family, which also includes fats, it forms Vitamin D in the skin in the  presence of ultraviolet light. It is a precursor of essential hormones, and a  vital part of bile acids.  </P> <P> Cholesterol and fat travel in the blood in different protein-coated packages.  Two types are especially important when it comes to the risk of heart disease.  Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which have a thin protein coating and large  amounts of cholesterol, have come to be known as "bad cholesterol." They carry  most of the cholesterol and, if not cleared from the blood, cholesterol and fat  can deposit in the arteries, contributing to atherosclerosis.  </P> <P> High-density lipoproteins (HDLs), which have a thicker protein packaging, carry  cholesterol back to the liver for processing or for removal from the body. They  are commonly referred to as "good cholesterol." Several factors within our  control can affect HDL levels. Quitting smoking, losing weight and increasing  physical activity all may raise our concentration of HDLs.  </P> <P> When we turn to the task of lowering LDLs, however, the emphasis falls squarely  on diet. And again, losing weight (if necessary) is helpful. But beyond that,  the foods we choose are critical. Cholesterol is manufacturered by all animals,  and that is why we get it from animal foods. Organ meats and egg yolks contain  the highest amounts. High-fat dairy products, meat and poultry all have  cholesterol. Shellfish vary in the amount they contain, and fish generally has  less.  </P> <P> When the diet supplies large amounts of cholesterol, the body obligingly cuts  back on production, but not enough to compensate. The result: cholesterol  overload, with rising levels in the blood.  </P> <P> But here is where the emphasis on "cholesterol-free" products is misleading.  For while dietary cholesterol does influence serum cholesterol, saturated fats  play a greater role. In fact, they are the most powerful dietary influence on  serum cholesterol. Besides, making a frontal attack on the saturated fat in  your diet will, in all likelihood, reduce the amount of cholesterol it  provides. Saturated fats are found mainly in meat, whole milk, dairy products,  coconut, palm and palm kernel oils, and lard. Poultry, fish and shellfish also  contain saturated fat, but generally less than meat.  </P> <P> Finally, there are the unsaturated vegetable oils, including safflower,  sunflower, corn, soybean, olive and canola oils. Replacing some of the  saturated fat with these unsaturated fats will help lower your serum  cholesterol. But remember that even if unsaturated, fats are potent sources of  calories, packed with more than twice as much as in the same amount of  carbohydrates or proteins.  </P> <P> How can making these changes help you? Some studies have shown that in adults  with "high" cholesterol levels (that is, 240 milligrams or over) every 1%  reduction leads to a 2% reduction in risk of heart attack. Thus, lowering serum  cholesterol by 15% would reduce risk by as much as 30%.  </P></p>

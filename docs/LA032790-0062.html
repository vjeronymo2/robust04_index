			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NBA;  </P> <P> SLUMPING TRAIL BLAZERS STILL CONFIDENT  </P> <P> Rick Adelman's preferred scenario would have had his Portland Trail Blazers  storming into tonight's game against the Lakers on a 13-game winning streak and  only a game or two behind.  </P> <P> Instead, the Trail Blazers have lost two of three -- including a five-point  loss at home to the Minnesota Timberwolves Sunday night -- and trail the Lakers  by four games in the loss column. Their recent 10-game winning streak seems  ancient history.  </P> <P> Now, what the Portland coach had figured would be a two-game showdown against  the Lakers this week has become a salvage operation. Adelman calls tonight's  home game against the Lakers and Friday's rematch at the Forum the most  important games of the season.  </P> <P> "We have to put that game behind us," Adelman said. "We can't let (the  Minnesota loss) affect us. It's a big game coming up, and we have to be ready  if we're going to have any chance to catch them.  </P> <P> "We've been trying to stay close all season, and this is our time to make the  move. It's been our goal all season to get to the point where we're playing  well going into April."  </P> <P> Until Sunday, the Trail Blazers were headed that way. But Adelman, ever  optimistic, still likes his team's chances. The Trail Blazers used to think  they could beat the Lakers; now, they know they can.  </P> <P> That confidence boost came on Feb. 14 at the Forum, when the Trail Blazers  repelled several Laker threats and emerged with a 132-128 double-overtime  victory. It was the first time in 10 meetings that Portland had beaten the  Lakers.  </P> <P> In fact, had guard Terry Porter not missed a free throw with less than a second  left in regulation, the Lakers would have lost a week earlier in Portland.  Instead, they pulled out a 121-119 overtime victory.  </P> <P> "I don't know if we sent a message to the Lakers by winning that game," Adelman  said. "I think we sent a message to ourselves. We lost that tough game up here  (in Portland), then a week later we go down there (to the Forum), and that win  told you what kind of character we had.  </P> <P> "That win was a big turning point. It made us realize we could beat anybody  anywhere. Our confidence soared after that."  </P> <P> The Lakers, winners of eight consecutive Pacific Division titles, have taken  the Trail Blazers seriously all season, and the double-overtime loss did  nothing to change that.  </P> <P> In fact, the Lakers might be disheartened to know that Adelman believes the  Trail Blazers are a better team now, despite their recent slump.  </P> <P> "I think we definitely are," Adelman said. "Our younger people are more  consistent. We're better on the road. Our bench had been up and down. Lately,  it's been more consistent.  </P> <P> "During that 10-game winning streak, we played as well as any team. A couple of  those games, we weren't at the top of our game, but we took control in the  fourth quarter. That's what good teams do. You can't always play your best, but  you've got to take control."  </P> <P> James and Diane Perkison have Laker season tickets in Section 31, Row 8 of the  colonnade seating at the Forum. Are these seats each worth $14.50 a game?  </P> <P> Sure.  </P> <P> Is each worth $60 a game?  </P> <P> "We don't think so," Diane Perkison said. "Maybe corporations can afford to pay  that, but not the individual fan."  </P> <P> As reported last week, Forum officials are once again changing some  season-ticket seats into Senate seats. The Senate program entitles the seat  holder to attend all Forum events -- Lakers, Kings and most concerts -- for a  total of $8,150 a year.  </P> <P> For next season, 455 colonnade seats and 190 loge seats are being converted to  Senate seats. Laker season ticket-holders were informed of the change in a  March 6 letter. The Perkisons and others in colonnade seating were told they  could keep their seats by paying $60 a game -- a $45.50 increase. One  alternative is relocation to seats farther away, for either $22.50 or $11.50 a  seat. Another alternative is to purchase Senate seats for $8,150. The final  alternative is to drop the season tickets.  </P> <P> Disgruntled King fans had their say last week. Now, Laker fans are speaking up.  Charles L. Kreindler, a season ticket-holder, recently wrote in a letter to The  Times' sports editor: "Jerry Buss . . . has essentially ensured that only the  'elite' people of L.A. will be able to see the Lakers (and the Kings) live."  </P> <P> Bob Steiner, a spokesman for Buss, said Senate seating is an important  revenue-producer. But Steiner also said the Lakers do not make a profit merely  from gate receipts.  </P> <P> "For 11 years, Jerry Buss' revenue from ticket income and his payroll for the  front office and players has been a wash," Steiner said. "It has not been a  haphazard increase. The Lakers clearly have the highest payroll in the league,  and many people don't realize what it costs to operate a highly expensive  franchise.  </P> <P> "Forty-five percent of (Laker) seats will have no increase next season. Forty  percent of those seats still cost $11.50 or cheaper. Of the seats that have had  a price increase, 21% of those seats had an increase of $5 or less. So, the  only people really heavily hit are the 455 in the colonnade. We can understand  the unhappiness of those people."  </P> <P> The Perkisons said a petition was recently passed around Section 31 of the  colonnade. But they say they realize it will not prevent the increase.  </P> <P> "As for me," Kreindler wrote in his letter, "Sports Arena, here I come."  </P> <P> NBA Notes  </P> <P> After several games in which he had fewer than two assists, rookie center David  Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs was criticized by Coach Larry Brown for his  stinginess in passing. "He gets tangled up with double-teams and sometimes  triple-teams and forces the ball up," Brown told a San Antonio reporter. After  Robinson totaled 11 assists in two games last week, Robinson reportedly  approached Brown on the bus heading to the team's hotel in Seattle. "All  right," Robinson said, jokingly, "now what more do I have to do to get rid of  that black-hole nickname?"  </P> <P> Atlanta Hawk Coach Mike Fratello, whose contract expires after this season, has  long been rumored on his way out. But Stan Kasten, the Hawks' president, said  he has yet to decide Fratello's fate. "I can tell you categorically that there  is only one man who will make the decision on whether Mike Fratello is offered  a new contract, and I am that man," Kasten told the Atlanta  Journal-Constitution. "If (owner) Ted Turner wants to know if Mike will be  back, he will hear it from me. Anyone who tells you that Mike is gone is a  liar. I make the decision and I haven't decided what I'm going to do."  </P> <P> Near the end of the first half of last Wednesday's game between the New Jersey  Nets and the Washington Bullets, Net Coach Bill Fitch summoned forward Chris  Morris to the sideline. According to the New York Daily News, Morris let loose  with a string of invectives directed toward Fitch and team management. At  halftime, in the privacy of the locker room, Fitch reportedly asked Morris to  repeat what he said, then yanked Morris' jersey and suspended him for two  games.  </P> <P> Indiana Pacer forward Chuck Person, upset with his team's Central Division  collapse, recently chartered a deep-sea boat in Miami, where the Pacers had  three days off. Person called a team meeting at sea and, according to the  Indianapolis News, the Pacers returned with two barracuda and a new attitude.  Chartering the boat cost Person $2,000. It was money well spent, apparently.  The Pacers have won three consecutive games.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, flying into Seoul  despite South Korean people's strong opposition and rejection,  is holding a series of war conferences [chonjaeng moui] with the  Kim Yong-sam ring.    On 20 April, Perry held a conference with traitor Kim  Yong-sam and discussed measures to jointly deal with the North's  so-called nuclear issue and the issue of building up the  U.S.-South Korean combined forces. The nation-selling traitor  Kim Yong-sam, raving that a close joint cooperation system and  arms buildup posture are essential to the solution of the  North's nuclear problem, begged his U.S. master to sell more  weapons to South Korea.    Perry and the Kim Yong-sam ring demanded again our acceding  to the additional inspection [chuga sachal] by the International  Atomic Energy Agency, the unjustness of which has already been  clearly proven, and decided to push ahead with the UN Security  Council's sanctions on the North, according to a report.    In the conference, the two of them agreed that the South  Korean puppets will introduce a mobile ultra-modern radar  equipment from the United States soon and that the United States  will predeploy heavy weaponry for brigade-scale rapid deployment  forces to South Korea.    On the same day, Perry held a secretive conference with the  puppet defense minister as well. The two of them, raving about  the North's fictitious nuclear issue, agreed to maintain a joint  cooperation system, to build up arms, and to conduct the  criminal Team Spirit war exercise, according to a report. In  the conference, Perry explained a U.S. plan to build up the  combat capability of the combined forces, including the  additional deployment of heavy weaponry to South Korea, and the  modernization plan of the U.S. Forces in South Korea.    In the talks between Perry and the puppet foreign minister  held on the same day, the two of them discussed joint measures  for the phase of tension [kinjang kungmyon] and agreed to grope  for various measures, including economic sanctions against us,  according to a report.    On 20 April, while the very dangerous war fever for  northward  invasion was actively inspired, Perry did not hesitate to make a  violent remark threatening someone that the military situation  on the Korean peninsula should not be miscalculated.    In the meantime, a deputy spokesman for the U.S. Defense  Department disclosed that the Patriot missiles deployed in South  Korea will soon be positioned for actual combat deployment.    The war conference between the U.S. secretary of defense and  the Kim Yong-sam ring reveals how recklessly the U.S.  imperialists and the South Korean puppets are going wild to  accelerate at the final practical stage the preparations for a  nuclear war of northward invasion to crush [apsal] us under the  pretext of the fictitious North Korean nuclear issue.    Because of the frenzied war provocation commotions of the  U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets, the situation on  the Korean peninsula is dashing minute by minute to a dangerous  brink of war. The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean  puppets should be aware of what dire consequences their war  frenzy will bring them, refrain from rash acts, and act with  discretion.</p>

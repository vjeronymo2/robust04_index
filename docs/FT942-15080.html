			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: Triumph of Architecture Exhibition in Venice Venice has always offered some of the most brilliant architectural experiences in Europe. This year it is also possible to experience the whole history of Italian Renaissance architecture in one Venetian palazzo. The exhibition, organised by Fiat's cultural institute at the Palazzo Grassi, is a total triumph. No one with any interest in the architectural and cultural history of Europe can afford to miss it. The story goes that on a visit with the Pope to see the revelatory restoration of Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, asked if the Vatican, 'had any more great surprises ..' 'Well' came the reply, 'we do have the legendary Renaissance model of St Peter's - perhaps the greatest architectural model in the world  -but it is in desperate need of repair and no one ever sees it.' From this conversation was born the idea of the exhibition. Fiat has brought together the architectural work of Michelangelo, Raphael, Bramante, Leonardo, Peruzzi, Sangallo and many other masters. Antonio da Sangallo produced his final design for the greatest church in Christendom in the 1530s. It took seven years to build the model, between 1539 and 1546, and the designer tragically died before it was completed. Sangallo's plan for St Peter's was a major adaptation of Bramante's design, but it was never executed and the model we see was succeeded by Michelangelo's dynamic plan. For 450 years Sangallo's St Peter's was stored in the Vatican and inevitably became the victim of slow decay. Today, the restored model - four and a half metres high - stands at the heart of the exhibition at the Palazzo Grassi. It is possible to walk under its dome and see the detail and finishes of the interior. Because it stands in the great central court of the palazzo it is also possible to have a bird's eye view from above. Once you have had the extraordinary experience of walking through the model, you are confronted by the second wonder of the show; Michelangelo's sublime model of his dome for St. Peter's. This is brilliantly shown suspended above the main staircase. It would not be fair to say that the contrast makes Sangallo's work look unsettled but the serenity of Michelangelo's design explains why his scheme for the basilica was preferred. The sub-title of the exhibition is 'the representation of architecture' and it is a challenging theme for an exhibition that has to be both scholarly and accessible. Architectural exhibitions are notoriously difficult to stage but I have no doubt that this is the best one I have ever seen. I recall the brilliant Palladio exhibition, that also depended for its success upon architectural models, at the Royal Academy. But no one has ever before put together the whole range of Italian Renaissance models in a way that makes them moving objects in themselves and telling demonstrations of the progress of architectural history. A great deal of the credit for the success of the exhibition belongs to Mario Bellini who designed it. His task was to tell the story of how Renaissance architecture developed and how it succeeded in replacing the Gothic style. There are 31 surviving 15th and 16th century models, each one providing a high point in the story. They are supported by documents, drawings, paintings and manuscripts which provide the intellectual foundations for the buildings. The setting is one of low light and grey walls, but there are literally magic moments of high illumination which bring visual drama and excitement to the complex story. There is a particular moment of clarity when you reach the 'Ideal City' painting from Urbino which is shown at the end of a sloping perspective, brilliantly lit in a darkened room. Paintings are used throughout to show that people and architecture belong together. Architecture is often used in paintings as a stage setting, framing crucial political events or scenes of spiritual progress. Stage design and architecture meet here to create the new world of great Renaissance palaces or churches. This exhibition utilises the same disciplines of display and drama to expose the story of Renaissance architectural creativity. This great exhibition needs to be visited more than once. It brings the third dimension to life making the buildings of the Renaissance both comprehensible and amazing in the scale of their achievement. The catalogue is 700 pages long but do not be daunted - the glory of the architectural models and the soaring triumph of the great Sangallo basilica will always remain in your mind. Renaissance - from Brunelleschi to Michelangelo: the Representation of Architecture: Palazzo Grassi, Venice, until November 6 (closed for mid-show conservation July 18-August 18): sponsored by Fiat, with Alitalia.</p>

The revolutionary monument "You, the land thriving under the  rays of the great rural theses hand down the feats through  generations" is an immortal monument which will convey down  through generations the tireless efforts and leadership feats of  the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il in unfolding a grand plan of rural  construction and carrying the socialist rural theses into effect.    Visiting Sinmi village there on February 12, 1946, President  Kim Il-song met the villagers and showed them deep trust and  inspired them with a new hope, saying that the farmers were the  master of the land now that the country was liberated and they  should build a prosperous country by reaping rich crops.    Comrade Kim Chong-il called at the Haksan cooperative farm  in  early January 1964 and took a meticulous care of all the affairs  of the farm, walking through snow-covered fields and going round  farmers' houses and the shop in order to realize the great  leader's plan of rural construction, and afterwards,  energetically guided the farm in the implementation of the rural  theses.    Present at a ceremony for unveiling the monument Wednesday  were Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of  Korea So Kwan-hui and officials concerned.</p>

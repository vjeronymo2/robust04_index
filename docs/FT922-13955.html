			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Business Law: Streamlining agreed offers The agreed bid by Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation for City-vision plc, which went unconditional on January 22 1992, was a breakthrough in cross-border acquisitions involving US and UK companies. For the first time, a US company was permitted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer its shares to the US shareholders of a UK target on the basis of a UK-style offer document, supplemented with the most important information required by SEC rules. Complex legal and commercial issues arise when a US company wishes to offer its shares in exchange for those of a UK company. On the UK side, two requirements impose significant constraints on the conduct of the offer. First, if the acquirer wishes to make use of the streamlined procedures of section 428 of the Companies Act 1985 in order to squeeze out any minority shareholders remaining after the offer is completed, the same consideration must be offered to all, not differentiating between US and UK shareholders. Second, the formal offer document must be mailed not more than 28 days after the offer is announced, and, under both US and UK disclosure rules, the timing of the announcement itself depends on when an agreement to proceed with the offer is reached. On the US side, the most important constraint is imposed by the requirement that a registration statement be filed and declared effective by the SEC before the formal offer document is mailed. SEC rules require that, if the acquisition is material, (as defined by rules measuring financial impact) the bidder's registration statement must contain audited financial statements of the target company, including balance sheets for its two most recent financial years, income statements for the three most recent years and corresponding cash-flow statements (which differ from UK-style source and application of funds statements). In addition, certain audited financial information - the main balance sheet and income statement items - must be provided for the target's five most recent financial years. While the financial statements and information may be presented on the basis of UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), audited numerical reconciliations to US GAAP of the principal balance sheet and income statement item must be provided for each of the five years for which information is given. Moreover, pro forma financial information showing the accounting effect of the combination must be provided for the most recent 12 months. The target's management must provide a detailed discussion and analysis (MD&amp;A) of the target's financial results and condition for at least the three years covered by the audited financial statements. In the Blockbuster/Cityvision offer it was essential that Blockbuster should be able to use the streamlined squeeze-out procedures provided by the Companies Act. Blockbuster was advised that this would be permitted, in an offer that included both a cash and a share alternative, only if both were made available to City-vision's UK and US shareholders, the latter representing about 8 per cent of the total when the offer was announced on November 22 1991. Since a share alternative was desirable as a business matter, the US registration requirements had to be confronted. A private placement of Blockbuster shares to Cityvision's US shareholders could have been made pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements, but the procedures and restrictions that such a placement would entail were not practicable given the size and quality of Cityvision's US shareholder base. The offer and sale might also have been made entirely outside the US, pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements provided by Regulation S. However, since Blockbuster shares were listed only on the New York Stock Exchange, the risk of immediate 'flow-back' of the shares into the US was too great for Blockbuster prudently to rely on that exemption. Indeed, this concern would have required a 'flow-back' registration statement to be filed and declared effective by the time the offer went unconditional even if Cityvision had no US shareholders or if its US shareholders had been offered shares in an exempt private placement, or cashed out. As a result, either the offer had to be registered with the SEC or the share alternative for both US and UK shareholders had to be abandoned. And since an agreement had been reached to proceed with the offer, and the offer had been announced, before detailed discussions could be held with the staff of the SEC, there were only 28 days in which to resolve all the issues raised by the requirement to register. Cityvision's financial statements and other information required by the SEC's rules could not be prepared in time either to register the initial offering in the US or, if Regulation S were to be relied on, to register the flow-back in the US of Blockbuster shares initially offered and sold abroad. In preliminary discussions, the SEC staff had said no relaxation of the disclosure requirements would be contemplated in the context of an offer in which US shareholders were not treated equally, but were cashed out. It was then proposed to the staff that the offer be made to Cityvision's US shareholders on the same basis as to its UK shareholders, provided that disclosure requirements that could not be met before the formal offer document had to be mailed under UK rules would be waived. In making this proposal, it was emphasised to the SEC staff that the effect of not granting the required waivers would be to eliminate the share alternative, which was neither in the interest of Cityvision's US shareholders nor a fair result for its UK shareholders given their predominance. The SEC staff agreed to permit the offer to proceed in the US even though the registration statement did not meet some formal requirements: the reconciliations to US GAAP of Cityvision's financial statements and information were not audited, nor did they cover the full five-year period; UK-style source and application of funds statements were provided instead of cash-flow statements; Cityvision's financial information for the year ended November 30 1991 consisted of estimated results rather than audited financial statements; the MD&amp;A for Cityvision covered only the year ended November 30 1991 instead of the full three-year period; and Blockbuster presented pro forma financial information based on Cityvision's estimated results. In addition, the financial advisers to Blockbuster and Cityvision, Merrill Lynch and Schroders, respectively, were not required to consent to the references to them in the registration statement and thus did not face a stricter standard of liability under US law than that which already applied to them under English law. Finally, the SEC staff agreed that the registration statement could consist substantially of the UK offer document, the information required by US rules being contained in additional appendices. The flexibility shown by the SEC to the Blockbuster/City-vision offer is evidence of the strength of its commitment to integrate the US capital markets more fully with those of the rest of the world and to ensure its rules do not unnecessarily deprive US investors of the benefits of owning shares in foreign companies. The adoption of Rule 144A and Regulation S in the Spring of 1990 were significant steps in this direction, and in the summer of 1991 the SEC proposed rules that would permit US holders of shares in foreign companies to participate in rights offerings and exchange offers in certain circumstances on the basis of foreign offer documents without regard to US requirements (but subject nevertheless to US standards of liability). Although these proposed rules have yet to be adopted, the policies underlying them, and their thoughtful implementation by the SEC staff, made the Blockbuster/Cityvision exchange offer possible.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Work for Russian Nuclear </F> Experts"]    [Text] Three thousand Russian nuclear experts, previously  working on nuclear weapons, could soon be employed at an  institute for scientific and technological research in Moscow,  paid for by the West and Japan. They would thus be switching to  projects for the peaceful use of nuclear power and better  protection for Russia's nuclear power stations.    Yesterday evening the European Parliament in Strasbourg gave  the go-ahead for the founding of such an institute, by  unanimously voting for a provisional protocol. This was  required because the Russian Parliament, the Douma, was not able  to ratify the agreement with the European Union, the United  States, and Japan as a result of the stormy political events in  Moscow.    During a debate in Strasbourg yesterday, the Dutch member of  Parliament Jessica Larive (VVD [People's Party for Freedom and  democracy]), European Parliament rapporteur on founding the new  center in Moscow, referred to an urgent need to stop the  braindrain from Russia of nuclear scientists who were all  employed under the Soviet system on the production and  maintenance of nuclear weapons. So far 500 have already left,  possibly to suspected countries such as Iraq, Libya and Iran,  plus the nuclear power China.    Between 1971 and 1993 some 700,000 people lived in the 10  secret nuclear towns. Larive believes most of them are still  there. But they no longer enjoy the former privileges such as  high wages, free housing and education, and there are problems  with food supplies. There is no other employment for the nuclear  technicians, as they are bound to secrecy by the Russian  Government. The hard core of 500 scientists with knowledge of  the Soviet system for chemical, biological and nuclear weapons  can now be employed on peaceful projects in Moscow. The  European Union, the United States, and Japan have so far set  aside some 126 million guilders for the center. Russia has even  made a Moscow building available.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Purchasing index lifts hopes of recovery in US HOPES that the US economy is moving decisively out of recession were lifted yesterday by the second sharp monthly increase in the purchasing managers' index, a closely watched gauge of US industrial conditions. Led by a surge in new orders, the index rose to 54.1 per cent in March, compared with 52.4 per cent in February and only 47.4 per cent in December and January. A reading above 50 per cent indicates expansion of the manufacturing economy. Mr Robert Bretz, a senior official at the National Association of Purchasing Managers, said growth of new orders appeared stronger than in last year's aborted economic recovery. He was thus hoping for sustained production. Proliferating signs of recovery have led to disputes about the timing of the recession's end. Mr Bretz said the index, which hit a low of 40.4 per cent in March last year, indicated the recession probably ended last spring. In a circular to clients, Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities in New York, said the official indices of leading and coincident indicators indicated the recession had persisted until this February. The purchasing managers' new orders index - a component of the overall index  -rose from 57.5 per cent to 62.4 per cent, the highest level since June 1988. The association said this indicated economic growth would continue for at least the next few months. The component measuring production rose from 58.6 per cent to 60.1 per cent, the highest level since last October. Data on prices pointed to little inflationary pressure in the early stages of recovery.</p>

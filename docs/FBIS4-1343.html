			<p>BFN     [Text] ANC leader Nelson Mandela's niece, Mrs. Nomaza  Paintin, has become the first black person to vote in a South  African general election. She cast her ballot in Wellington,  New Zealand, several hours ahead of the people in South Africa,  as a result of New Zealand's time zone. New Zealand Prime  Minister Jim Bolger, a friend of Mrs. Paintin, watched her vote.  People in foreign countries can cast their ballots at about 200  polling stations in 80 countries.    An IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] commissioner, Mrs.  Helen Suzman, said there was unprecedented enthusiasm in foreign  countries for the election. Another commissioner, Mr. Zack  Yacoob, said the IEC estimated that between 25 and 30 percent of  the total percentage poll would comprise special votes. Special  votes close at 7:00 PM tonight.    The election in South Africa itself began a short while ago  when people began casting special votes. Local special votes  include patients in hospitals and maternity homes, residents at  homes for the elderly and infirm, and members of the security  forces who'll be on duty on the two official voting days.    Prisoners who are entitled to vote will also cast special  votes. Criminals who have been found guilty of serious crimes  will not be permitted to vote in the election. This applies to  prisoners convicted of murder, rape, and robbery with  aggravating circumstances, and who have been sentenced to  imprisonment without the option of a fine.    Home Affairs Minister Danie Schutte said after a cabinet  meeting in Cape Town that the government was not prepared to  depart from the principle contained in the existing Electoral  Act. He said the negotiating council had been a party to the  act, and accordingly had been agreed to by all the parties at  the time. Mr. Schutte pointed out that such a restriction on  voting rights to prisoners was in accordance with  internationally accepted norms.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> FOR ART MUSEUM, NO MONDAVI MONEY TILL ALL WINE IS SOLD  </P> <P> "Ninety-nine bottles of wine on the wall. . . ."  </P> <P> Actually, about 7,200 bottles -- 600 cases -- of wine remain to be sold in a  partnership venture between the Newport Harbor Art Museum and the Robert  Mondavi winery in Oakville, Calif.  </P> <P> One dollar from every sale of "Museum Chardonnay" (actually the winery's 1984  Chardonnay as specially labeled for sale in coastal Orange County) will be  donated to the museum for its building fund and operating budget. But the  museum will only receive the money after every bottle is sold.  </P> <P> The program started in December with 1,200 cases of wine, about half of which  remain on retailers' shelves. Each bottle costs about $10. A green, orange and  purple neckband on each bottle reads in part: " . . . as you appreciate the  subtle beauty of Robert Mondavi Museum Chardonnay, you'll also support the  visual arts in Orange County. . . ."  </P> <P> Newport Harbor is the only museum in the country to which Mondavi is donating a  portion of wine sales. Why would a Napa Valley winery care about supporting the  visual arts in Orange County? Because, according to a Mondavi spokesman,  Southern California is a major consumer of wines -- and because the Robert  Mondavi Wine and Cultural Center will open in Gateway Center in Costa Mesa in  August.  </P> <P> The 1,100-square-foot center, with a walled garden, will be open only to  corporations and professional associations, to whom it will offer concerts and  food festivals along with other cultural and wine-related activities. Founder  Mondavi explains in a written statement that his winery views "wine as an  integral part of our culture, heritage and the gracious way of life."  </P></p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Noises on and noises off: Jurek Martin reflects from the serenity of Sanibel, deep down Florida's Gulf coast, on this week's ructions in Washington WASHINGTON is the best of towns and it is the worst of towns. No town contains a greater distillation of political sophistication and no town can be as divorced from political reality. This week demonstrated the ultimate contrast. All the noises in Washington are of men at war and jumping ship. If, as is still more likely than not, the effective administration of President George Bush has only 2 1/2 more weeks to run, its final days are not exactly filled with sweetness and light. But, here in the hinterland, if the questions posed by Joe and Mary Public to Messrs Bush, Clinton and Perot in Richmond, Virginia, on Thursday are any guide, these noises might as well be on Mars. That does not make them less sonorous, or less important, but it does put them into perspective. The Washington ear is tuned into the fascinating fact that the Justice Department is investigating the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is in turn investigating the Justice Department, of which the FBI is institutionally a part. The Central Intelligence Agency is also trading allegations with the Justice Department. All the fusillades have their origins in the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) affair. Similarly, Budget Director Richard Darman has done his best to blame Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Mr Michael Boskin, chairman of the council of economic advisers, for making a mess of the president's tax policies, They have been a bit too polite to respond, but all has been revealed in exquisite detail by Bob Woodward in the Washington Post. Over at the State Department, now free of the hegemony of Mr James Baker, who is occupied with running President Bush's re-election campaign, officials are speaking with delicious indiscretion over the circumstances of the departmental investigation of presidential challenger Bill Clinton's private life. That the investigation should have been overseen by an unpopular political appointee named to her post at the behest of Mr John Sununu, the former White House chief of staff whom all Washington loves to hate now that he is out, is merely an explanation. Nobody, it seems, had the will to restore order. Not Mr Baker, whose long-awaited speech - either on the economy or on why he thinks Mr Bush should be re-elected - remained undelivered. Not Mr William Sessions, director of the FBI, now under fire for having dodged taxes, billing the government for private phone calls and other hanging offences. Not CIA chief Robert Gates, who is in Russia, presumably looking for evidence that the KGB planted a transmitter in Mr Clinton's lower lip 23 years ago in Moscow. Nor - apart from Arabs buying US, not British, tanks as if they were going out of style - was there much evidence of foreigners jumping on board Mr Bush's ship. Most German chancellors, including socialists, endorse Republican presidents but, consumed by Eurodramas and a few local difficulties, Helmut Kohl has said not a word. Nor has British Prime Minister John Major displayed any public gratitude for the wholescale lifting by the Republicans of last spring's Tory campaign. Even the Japanese, who tend to respond automatically to requests from the White House, have been quiet, privately concentrating on working out what Mr Clinton's trade policies really are. French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas stands alone in his endorsement, and that was delivered months ago. The curious thing is that, throughout all this, Mr Bush has remained almost serene. He has a pit bull terrier for vice-president and assorted rottweilers called Matalin, Fitzwater and Dornan, but the president himself often seems as passive as his family dog, Millie. Mr Bush does get rattled occasionally and still misspeaks himself but, mostly, he stands on the dignity of being president. He applauded Mr Quayle for the savagery of his debate onslaught this week, but having been set up by Mr Quayle for the Thursday round, he barely raised his voice. Though Mr Quayle would have taken any opportunity to impugn Mr Clinton, Mr Bush did not. He answered the questions put to him, less well than Mr Clinton and less entertainingly than Mr Perot, but he answered them. Only once in 90 minutes were there even allusions to Vietnam, Moscow, trust, character or all the other things that Washington thinks he must make stick in order to retain the presidency. On the other side, yet again the names of Iran and Iraq, let alone a certain subsidiary of an Italian bank, never crossed a questioner's lips. The Washington conclusion is there is no iron in Mr Bush's soul. The country may well also be about to vote him out, but not because he lacks iron or any other vitamin that might transform him into the Man Who Eats Democrats For Breakfast. It is because he has run out of ideas on the real problems of real people. He ought to be here; at least the tide comes in and out.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 26 (BTA) -- At noon today, Prime  Minister Lyuben Berov asked parliament to take a vote of  confidence in his government. The decision was made this  morning at a regular cabinet meeting, said Government Spokesman  Raycho Raykov. Unlike yesterday's decision to make the  confidence motion contingent on a possible framework agreement  between the government and the political forces, today's  decision is only related to the government's programme for the  highlights of its performance until early September.    "There are contradictions between the positions of the  different political forces, the trade unions and the workforces,  opposing views clash on crucial matters: privatization, the  possible closure of separate money-losing branches or  state-owned enterprises, the reform of health care and  agriculture, demands for compensations for the shock price rises  in April, and the level of pay in the public sector," the  government says in its reasoning which was read to reporters by  Mr. Raykov. According to the cabinet, "these contradictions  escalate social tensions and hold back progress, eliminating the  possibility of achieving durable public concord on most  disputes. The prevailing view in society is that these  contradictions virtually block socio-political life and they can  only be reconciled on the basis of early parliamentary elections  as soon as possible," the reasoning reads.    "A change of government at this point (...) may push the  country into one degree or another of social and economic  chaos," the cabinet believes. According to the government, one  reasonable way out of the situation is transition to a targeted  government, limited in its life and assignments, which should  ensure social peace as a prerequisite for normal elections.  This government, while preserving its non-partisan and expert  character, undertakes to tackle, along with its current  business, the country's urgent tasks, to provide reasonable  compensation to the socially disadvantaged strata who have been  affected by the price shock, to carry on the land reform and  privatization, to counter further speculative price rises, and  to complete the settlement of the country's foreign debt  problem. The government guarantees that in the months remaining  until the elections it will not give campaign advantages to any  party or movement.    The leadership of the parliamentary group of the Bulgarian  Socialist Party alone came to a meeting to which Prime Minister  Lyuben Berov invited the parliamentary forces supporting his  government. The idea of the meeting was to consider the  framework political agreement and the programme for the  cabinet's performance highlights until the beginning of  September. The meeting was attended, in an observer capacity,  by Mr. Vedat Sakalu MP of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights  and Freedoms (DPS), on whose mandate the incumbent cabinet was  formed. Mr. Sakalu confirmed the position which the movement  announced yesterday that it will join the agreement only if it  is supported by at least four parliamentary groups, it emerged  after the meeting. DPS leader Ahmed Dogan said on national  radio today that there is no framework agreement. For the time  being, the BSP alone remains firmly committed to its support for  the cabinet. The Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) will vote  against when the confidence motion is put to the vote. SDS  leader Filip Dimitrov today said that for six days now the  government has "usurped" power, after last week parliament voted  down a set of structural and personnel cabinet changes proposed  by the prime minister. It is not clear how the New Union for  Democracy and the independents will vote, as their MP's are  divided over the issue.</p>

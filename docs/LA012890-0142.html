			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY BEATS MOORPARK, CLINGS TO 1ST  </P> <P> This game could have been played by plastic surgeons -- it was nip and tuck all  the way.  </P> <P> Valley College held on to first place by defeating visiting Moorpark College,  83-80, in a Western State Conference game Saturday night in which the lead  changed hands 15 times. The score also was tied more times, 10, than Michael  Jackson has had nose jobs.  </P> <P> "That was a good game," Moorpark Coach Al Nordquist said. "Both teams played  well. They hit some shots at the end, and that was key."  </P> <P> With less than a half-minute remaining and Valley leading, 77-73, Valley's Rick  Garrick broke free for a dunk.  </P> <P> "They got that break there, and that made a big difference," Nordquist said.  </P> <P> Moorpark's Bruce Watson came back with a three-point basket to make the score  79-76, but Garrick made four free throws in the last 16 seconds to protect  Valley's margin.  </P> <P> "I knew it was going to be a hard game," Valley Coach Jim Stephens said.  </P> <P> "The one thing that surprised me, that I didn't anticipate, was Sam (Crawford)  being able to shoot outside on us."  </P> <P> Crawford, Moorpark's point guard, made a 35-foot, three-point heave at the  final buzzer to finish with 25 points and five three-point baskets.  </P> <P> Moorpark never led by more than seven points, Valley never by more than six, in  what was a crucial conference match-up for both teams.  </P> <P> Valley (17-9, 7-1 in conference) won its first six conference games but lost at  Santa Barbara on Wednesday and needed a victory to remain a half-game ahead of  Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Moorpark (16-8, 4-3) was attempting to bring front-running Valley back to the  WSC pack as well as rebound from a loss Wednesday to Canyons.  </P> <P> "You can only try to get the kids up for certain games," Stephens said. "We  knew this was going to be tough."  </P> <P> Valley led at halftime, 34-33.  </P> <P> "I told them at half the difference was going to be on the boards, and Shelton  (Boykin) and Shawn (DeLaittre) got us some defensive boards."  </P> <P> Boykin finished with eight points and six rebounds. DeLaittre scored a  team-high 24 points and grabbed eight rebounds.  </P> <P> "That's how we got here, him being inside," said Stephens, who began playing  DeLaittre inside more often at the onset of WSC play.  </P> <P> "That's the best game he's had."  </P> <P> Garrick scored 13, and Cliff Barnes and Steve Ward each added 12. Valley's  Andre Harrell finished with 11.  </P> <P> Moorpark's Roger Thomas broke out of a mild scoring slump with 21 points.  Watson made three second-half three-point shots for Moorpark and scored 15.  </P></p>

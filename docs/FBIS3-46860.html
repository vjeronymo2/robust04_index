He gave his personal assurance that army rangers positioned  in Mae Ai of Chiang Mai and Mae Chan of Chiang Rai would be  ready to provide protection to the villagers if fighting spills  into Thailand.    Lt-Gen Panthep yesterday inspected the preparation of  rangers  and listened to a briefing about the general situation at the  Ban Rak Thai border base in Mae Chan District.    An official report said some 3,000 Mong Thai Army (MTA)  soldiers of warlord Khun Sa based in Mong Kan opposite Mae Chan  District are facing some 4,500 troops of the United Wa State  Army (UWSA) near Doi Lang opposite Mae Ai District.    Fighting might erupt at any moment because the MTA wants to  seize some parts of Mong Yon which is under the influence of the  UWSA, the report said.    The report also said that several battalions of Burmese  government soldiers heading for Mong Kan have stopped their  advance because they believe that the MTA might attack Tachilek  township opposite Mae Sai District.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (2): 'Very important steps have been made'  -Interview President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada talks to Stephen Fidler, Richard Bauer and Sally Bowen Question: Your government gives the impression of having a lot of vision, a lot of ideas, which seem forward-looking and coherent. But some of the measures you have introduced - for example the reform of the executive - may have put back other aspects of your reform. And after 15 months of your government, its practical impact seems to have been limited. Answer: In the first year of this government, the legislation which came about, including constitutional reform, was simply extraordinary. But that is very far away from people's lives. Let's start with our reform of the executive branch. If you don't take that step at the beginning of a new government the cement gels and you can never change it. But there's a cost - in time lost until people adjust and until the system works - but the steps that have been made have been very important. Let's go to step number two - popular participation. For the first time in 500 years we have recognised the existence of native communities. Why Bolivia works with a low level of violence, and is a working, functioning democracy with our terrific, critical poverty is basically because the family and the community is very important. We've created territorial municipalities - true local government - as opposed to the traditional, colonial, Spanish city where the landowners lived and which governed the countryside. We've given economic and political power back to the people. Two-thirds of Bolivians are Indian communities and the great majority of Bolivians don't speak Spanish - as the president doesn't speak it well. We also took 20 per cent of the central government's income and distributed it according to the population, so for the first time in 500 years people received money instead of sending money to central government. They're deciding what they're going to spend the money on, and we've also given them the administration of health and education. The central government will provide the teachers and the doctors, but the community will administer them. Of course, the teachers' unions are indignant and the doctors are outraged because they have these poor, dirty Indians telling them what services they need. It started on July 1, so the people are starting to get the money. Of course, they'll wake up and realise the money's nothing next to the problems, but before they had nothing. Aren't you worried about local corruption? The church asked me about that and I said if that should happen we'd be the first country to have democratised corruption. Why should only the big guys steal? Let the little guys steal. But I don't think so - I asked that of the local mayor in a community I visited and he said: 'I can't because everybody's looking at me'. What about central government? The third thing was constitutional reform, and we've gone for the German (electoral) system where we have proportional representation in the congress, but half the legislators are voted by districts. Now, we just have a list, so if you vote for the president in every department you get the president's men. But they're going to have the right to vote for the guy that represents them and for the president, but we will still have proportional representation. In the constitutional reform, we've brought in the ombudsman, and we've brought in complete reorganisation of the judicial branch. Finally, we come to capitalisation which is probably the cornerstone of the whole thing. In traditional privatisation you sell the state-owned assets and whoever buys them has to invest and modernise. What we're saying is, don't buy it from us, put in the money to modernise it and what is left in the hands of the state, which would be up to 50 per cent, we then distribute to the Bolivian people for pension plans. That's easier said than done: individual capitalisation pension plans. Are you optimistic that capitalisation will work, will attract investors? We're very sure that it will. Let me give you a reason why: Bolivia is a relatively large country but it's a small, poor economy. But we had never taken into account, living up here in the Andes, that it is a hub: its location is what makes it valuable. Let's take the electric energy sector: we have 31 companies interested in the capitalisation which we hope to have finished by March. What they've told us is you're sitting at 4,000 metres and an awful lot of water goes down to sea level, and it's environmentally friendly. We can sell the electricity into southern Peru, northern Chile and Argentina and into Brazil. You take the second sector; hydrocarbons. Bolivia, on top of very important reserves, is situated strategically so that it can export into northern Chile, southern Peru, Sao Paulo. For big oil companies, gas was a nuisance and an unnecessary by-product. But in an environmentally-conscious world, big companies have to be gas-orientated. We think the prices are ridiculously low, we think we are being taken to the cleaners, but we know that the trend as people get used to gas, and see the benefits of an abundant, economic and clean fuel, we're sitting on a gold mine. The last thing on the agenda is educational reform. Here we're talking about something that nobody ever accepted - that you should learn to read and write in your native language. Nobody can learn another language until he's learned to read and write and think in his own language. This doesn't sound like much, but this is revolutionary. They grab these poor children, they throw them into school, they have a teacher that talks to them in Spanish and are prohibited to even use their native clothes. Secondly, we've decided that all schools, public or private, must be accredited. We want to have standard testing; we've created a regulatory body that's elected by a two-thirds majority to do this. The schoolteachers are outraged because they will be dependent on the community. Isn't it true that you're really not informing people much about capitalisation? In a way, you're right. We learn from Machiavelli that change is not advisable because those affected realise it immediately and those benefiting take a long time. So there's a terrific problem in communications, and it's basically because the president isn't talking to the people. The reason he's not talking to them is that we are in this gestation period - these are very hard policies to put in place. This is the critical year; we must finish capitalisation this year, we think we can do it - easily we'll get it done by 1995. But people won't see anything till 1996 because the people who capitalise this country will have billions of dollars on deposit but then they have to do the studies, they have to place the orders and then they'll be seeing it moving. Do you have a clear strategy of what you will do about Bolivia's illegal coca production? Obviously not; who has a clear strategy with drugs? The day somebody invents a synthetic cocaine it's all finished. But the damage is to us because our institutions are too weak to resist the cartels. The amount under cultivation hasn't grown in the last few years. Is that good news? In drugs, all I can say is it's like having cancer and saying it's not growing. You haven't got free of the cancer but at least it's not growing. Are the armed forces and police involved? Well, no. The armed forces were intensely involved before democracy came back. These institutions have a great ability to cleanse themselves through promotions, and they retire so quickly and they move up, and we have isolated the armed forces; they only give a support role to the police. The police, who were terribly corrupt have again been purified, I won't say lily-white, but I think that the area of greatest preoccupation is the judicial branch. We're working very hard because a country without justice is like a land without water. We're working very hard to depoliticise it; make it independent; make it impartial; make it competent. Generally, institutionally we're doing relatively well. Where we're not doing well is that the so-called farmers' unions are the bottom rung of drug trafficking. I'm not saying they're taking it to England or taking it to the US, but they're definitely getting the paste to the boys in the line. Colombia's integrating backwards; they want to produce their own coca so they don't have to depend on Bolivia. The Bolivians want to produce their own cocaine so they can sell it directly to the market. It's a very, very dangerous situation and I must admit that we're racking our brains.                         *       *       * Don't forget that Bolivia was, like most countries, not only ineffective at providing goods and services, it was really ineffective at providing social services. We recognise that that's the role of the state - the real mechanism of redistribution of wealth - but we think governments, including the developed countries' governments, are awful at doing that. They're better at producing electricity or oil than they are at producing health and education. So we're giving it back to the people. . . There's one thing that makes me see the light - there's no way I can do it worse than the others have done. When they say 'How can you give all these Indians all this political power and economic power?' I say 'They can't do worse than we've done.' You're worried about corruption, you're worried about them having a party; at least it'll be a good party. They can't do it worse than we've done for 500 years.

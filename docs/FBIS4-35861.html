			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Gadi Sukenik] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who returned from  Morocco tonight, says that he and King Hassan agreed to launch  telephone and postal lines from Morocco to Israel, and that  reciprocal diplomatic representations will be probably opened by  the end of the year.    Replying to a question, Peres said the letter with portions  of his Knesset address on the issue of Jerusalem, which had been  sent to the Norwegian foreign minister, was not even marked as  confidential, and it contained no new elements. Our political  correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports:    [Begin recording] [Sukenik] Mr. Peres, it was hoped that  this visit would result in some kind of a formal link between  the two countries. Why did it not happen?    [Peres] I do not know whose hopes they were. Our only hope  was to move the major multilateral convention, the one that was  slated to be held in Amman, to Morocco. I finalized this point  with the Americans; I finalized it with the king; a date has  been set. Israel will participate in it, as will many Arab  countries; it will be unprecedented. If you ask me, it matters  to me more than having a consular official here and there.    [Sukenik] Still, when do you expect a Moroccan  representation to be inaugurated in Israel?    [Peres] I know the date, but I will not divulge it.    [Sukenik] This year?    [Peres] Yes, possibly before the end of this year. [end  recording]    [Sukenik] While Mr. Peres was abroad, he was informed by the  prime minister on the telephone of the appointment of Efrayim  Sne, a Rabin camp member, to a ministerial position. Peres had  been opposed to the appointment, and his camp members reported  his harsh reaction after the fact.    [Begin recording] [Peres] It is all absolute nonsense. I  spoke with the prime minister. We reached an understanding, and  I am positive the understanding will be adhered to.    [Sukenik] What is that understanding?    [Peres] When it is publicized, I will announce it even on  television. [end recording]</p>

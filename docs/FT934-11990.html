			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Complex call for Dutch telecoms  -The tough task presented by the KPN sell-off WITH tens of millions of 'customer contacts' per day, Koninklijke PTT Nederland (KPN), the Dutch telecommunications and postal company, ought to be the quintessential household name, auguring well for its partial privatisation early next year. The flotation is the biggest in the history of the Amsterdam bourse, and is a formidable marketing challenge for all banks, brokers and advisers involved. The timing of KPN's initial flotation, however, gives it a lead over its larger European rivals - like Deutsche Telekom (DT) - in the competition for investors' funds. DT is likely to be two years behind. But the inclusion of the Dutch postal services in the flotation sets KPN apart from the string of privatisations awaiting the European telecommunications sector. International investors will have to be convinced that, contrary to the situation in most other countries, the Netherlands' postal operations are profitable and achieving roughly the same return on investment as KPN's telecommunications side. At home, marketing the shares will also be far from simple. Though every potential Dutch investor is almost by definition a KPN customer, he or she may not immediately recognise the company's name. It is KPN's two main operating subsidiaries - PTT Post and PTT Telecom - which are household names. KPN itself is a holding company, the name of which commands little recognition. A first tranche of shares in KPN, representing up to 30 per cent of the company's 40m shares, is scheduled to be floated in the first six months of 1994. Estimates for the total value of KPN vary widely from Fl 16bn (Dollars 8.6bn) to as much as Fl 28bn, making the first tranche worth at least Fl 5bn. Additional tranches are expected to reduce the state's stake to around one third later in the 1990s. Oyens &amp; Van Eeghen, an Amsterdam-based subsidiary of Credit Lyonnais, estimates that the shares of Fl 100 nominal will be floated at Fl 425 each, valuing the company as a whole at Fl 17bn. It also believes KPN will carry out a 10-for-one share split before the flotation to boost the marketability of the shares. In London, Robert Fleming Securities puts the probable range at between Fl 425 and Fl 600 per share and says the shares would be particularly attractive towards the bottom end of this range. Definitive forecasts are complicated by the fact that KPN has yet to comment on its future dividend policy. As a utility stock, KPN is likely to be regarded as an investment for income rather than for capital growth. The Dutch government is setting the machinery in place for the privatisation. Earlier this month it chose ABN-Amro, the Dutch bank, as global co-ordinator for the share flotation, with ING and Rabobank as co-lead managers of the syndicate in the Netherlands. The names of banks leading foreign syndicates are expected to be disclosed later this autumn. In the summer, the government made clear what kind of domestic competition PTT Telecom can expect to face in its home market later this decade. Starting in 1995, the country's railway, cable television operators and electrical utilities will be encouraged to join forces and lease their lines and cables to business customers. In turn, these corporate customers will be able to use these lines for data communication and private networks between their offices. In 1998, these lines can also be used for normal 'voice' services. Despite this looming increase in competition, KPN is expected to continue its dominance of the Dutch telecom market. Apart from the flotation price, one of the most intriguing unknowns is the way the government will choose to pitch the shares to the public. Unlike Britain, which under recent Conservative governments has consciously tried to widen share ownership, the Netherlands has never sought to promote share buying among the public. Nor does the country have a tradition of big privatisations - because it never went in for mass nationalisation in the first place. In the late 1980s, during the sale of two tranches of shares in DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, no special effort was made to attract private investors. This time, the sale of a company with far stronger roots in Dutch society may spur the government into at least considering the use of special promotions to sell the shares. So far, there seems to be little support for the idea of offering shareholders discounts on their telephone bills. But one idea is a scheme under which small investors will pay reduced commission charges when buying KPN shares. This is the third in a series on the privatisation of Europe's state telecommunications operators.

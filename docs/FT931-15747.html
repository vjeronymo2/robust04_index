			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / French Bonds: Trading subdued after 'battle of the franc' THE RELIEF in Paris was almost audible. Last Thursday, after the Bundesbank had cast a tacit vote of confidence in the French franc by reducing its fixed repo rate by 15 basis points, the battle-scarred French currency closed beneath the FFr3.4 barrier against the D-Mark for the first time in a month. Since early November, when the money markets renewed their attack on the franc, the Bank of France has done everything that it can to defend the currency - from spending heavily from its reserves, to last Tuesday's announcement that it was temporarily replacing the five- to 10-day rate with a one-day facility at the higher rate of 12 per cent. The strategy seems to have worked. 'The second battle for the franc is over and the French authorities have won,' said Mr Didier Maillard, chief economist at Banque Paribas in Paris. 'There is still a lot of tension in the foreign exchange markets and there could be further attacks on the franc. But it is safe for the time being,' he added. The French government certainly seems to think so. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister and architect of the franc fort policy of protecting the French currency in his former role as finance minister, was sufficiently confident this weekend to assure the French electorate that the franc would 'not be devalued for as long as I am prime minister.' In other words, the French authorities are now convinced that they have bought a breathing space for the franc - at least until German interest rates come down, thereby enabling France to follow suit without endangering its currency. But in the meantime, the prospects for French bonds are scarcely scintillating. 'The long-term outlook is very positive,' according to Mr Christopher Potts, chief economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. One way or another French interest rates are bound to come down and the French bond market should then really start to perform. But in the meantime it will be fairly subdued.' Subdued was certainly an appropriate adjective for last week's performance. The French government's regular auction on Thursday received a lukewarm response, raising FFr16.46bn. The yield on the benchmark 10-year OAT government bonds slipped to 7.98 per cent by the end of last week - significantly lower than 8.02 per cent the previous week and 8.13 per cent a month before. Moreover, the spread between French OATs and German bunds is still much wider than the French authorities would wish. The gap rose as high as 100 basis points when the markets stepped up the second assault on the franc in late November, and is now hovering at between 90 and 100 basis points, in spite of last week's 'triumph' for the French authorities. The consensus among economists is that the spread will remain at that level until German interest rates come down and the franc is finally free from the threat of devaluation. In the meantime, the French economic scene, and the Paris bond market, will continue to be dominated by the fluctuations of the franc and by political uncertainty in the approach to the March elections. Once the franc is safe and the elections are over, French bonds ought to recover and the spread against bunds will narrow. Mr Potts of Indosuez suspects that it may fall as far as 30 basis points by the end of 1993 - even lower than its historic low of 38 basis points in late 1991, when the fight for the franc seemed a long way away.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed JMK, PLS: "Two-Day NATO Summit Over"; as </F> released by Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 11 Jan (BELGA) -- On Tuesday [11 January],  at the end of the two-day summit meeting of the heads of state  and government at NATO headquarters in Evere, NATO Secretary  General Manfred Woerner said his impression regarding the  situation in Bosnia is that "clear determination was shown at  the summit not to allow the present situation to drag on." The  civil war in the former Yugoslav Republic was not on the agenda  at the NATO summit, but was "comprehensively and thoroughly  treated on Monday evening during a dinner, and on Tuesday  morning," said Woerner.    NATO is reiterating its support for UN mediation and for a  solution at the negotiating table, said Woerner, who continued  by saying that NATO is prepared to carry out air strikes in  order to support the UNPROFOR troops in Bosnia and Sarajevo, and  to protect the Muslim enclaves.    There are two kinds of air strikes, said Woerner: those  aimed at protecting UNPROFOR troops, and air strikes like those  NATO approved in August 1993. He emphasized that air strikes  will only take place if there is a consensus among the countries  belonging to the North Atlantic [Cooperation] Council, and  provided that UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is in  agreement. When asked whether the NATO countries have reached  agreement on this, the secretary general answered that "the  situation on the ground needs to be assessed, and the safety of  the UN ground troops must be borne in mind."    NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner called the Brussels  summit "a historic turning point." The reform of NATO has taken  a great step forward. "We are now on track for the 21st  century," said Woerner.    Fresh assignments have been outlined clearly, and this was  done in a "highly constructive atmosphere among all 16 NATO  countries." A renewed, more mature relationship is growing up  between North America and Europe, claimed Woerner, who said that  "everyone was impressed by the strong leadership of the U.S.  President."    The principle of expanding NATO was approved, and the  countries of East Europe were invited to work with NATO within  the framework of Partnership for Peace agreements.    Finally, a more flexible structure will be created for  crisis  management and peace assignments, and NATO will develop its  strategy vis-a-vis the proliferation of nuclear weapons and  weapons of mass destruction.    Admittedly, there is still some discord in NATO about  carrying out air strikes in Bosnia, since some countries have  NATO troops there while others do not. However, the readiness  to carry out such strikes is greater now than it was in August,  since the ground troops increasingly are being exposed to  danger, said U.S. President Bill Clinton at the end of the  meeting.    The allies are unanimous in their support for a text on  Bosnia in the final declaration of the NATO summit, Clinton  said. In it, the NATO countries reaffirm their readiness to  carry out air strikes under the authority of the UN Security  Council in order to prevent Sarajevo and other threatened areas  from ending up in a stranglehold. In addition, the allies are  assigning the UN military on the ground the task of drawing up  plans for relieving the UN contingent that is blocked inside  Srebrenica, and for reopening Tuzla Airport for humanitarian  aid. In this context, the UN commanders can ask NATO to carry  out air strikes, said the U.S. President. He also said the NATO  countries had agreed that tougher rhetoric can only be used if  it is translated into action. According to Clinton, air strikes  now depend first on how the Bosnian Serbs behave, and second on  what the UN commanders in Bosnia request.    The President was "pleased" that the Partnership for Peace  initiative proposed by the United States was approved "at this  historic meeting, my first NATO meeting." "General Powell will  immediately contact the military" in those East European  countries interested in the Partnership with a view to preparing  future forms of cooperation, such as military exercises.    Clinton also said he was pleased with the stronger role  which  the Western European Union -- the defense component of the  European Union -- will play in the alliance from now on.  However, in his view NATO remains the most important defense  alliance, and he therefore thanked Secretary General Manfred  Woerner for his strong leadership.</p>

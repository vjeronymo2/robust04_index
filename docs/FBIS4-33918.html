			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by provisional President Emile </F> Jonassaint; passages within italics in Creole -- recorded]    [Text] Men and women of my country: I have decided to  address the nation tonight. It is a serious moment. Haiti, our  country, is in great danger. Reviled, ridiculed, humiliated, and  strangled, Haiti risks invasion and occupation. I appear before  you tonight with certainty and faith, determination, and the  courage of men of peace and goodwill. As president of the  Republic -- the one who is primarily responsible for the  nation's fate -- it is incumbent upon me to fully assume the  responsibilities of our time before the Haitian people and the  international community. Without beating about the bush and with  all the necessary serenity, and invested with all the authority  of my office, I clearly state that history, the Constitution,  and the permanence of our deep values forbid me from giving in  to threats, and imperatively orders me to defend, by all means,  the imperiled fatherland. It will be defended.    Tonight, I come to ask you -- all quarrels and disagreements  aside -- to mobilize for the defense of our country. I solemnly  declare that Haiti will not give in. Haiti will not submit to  orders from foreigners. Haiti will face them. I have demanded  and have obtained the provisional government's word that it will  take all measures to ensure our survival as an independent and  fully sovereign nation. Thus, a state of emergency is declared.  A series of government measures will go into effect immediately.  I order the Haitian Armed Forces commander in chief to guard  against all possibilities.    Haitians who have forgotten their patriotic duty and have  joined with foreigners to demand the invasion and occupation of  our sacred land, again enslaving the Haitian people, further  adds to the excessiveness of our tragedy. I feel sorry for them.  I ask you to overcome this painful treason. Haiti cannot and  must not die. Tonight, I ask you to preserve the heroic legacy  of Toussaint Louverture, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, and Alexandre  Petion. I ask you to move proudly toward this period of  resistance, the royal path carved by our ancestors. Together,  may we write this new chapter, surpassing ourselves with renewed  dignity and the celebrated unity of all social forces in this  country!    May it be said that the men and women of this country will  fervently relight the torch of resistance to foreign invaders  and unflinchingly undergo the constraints of this time of  struggle and heroic uprising [marronnage heroique]! May it be  said simply that we have greater commitment to our  responsibilities and the requirements of our time! In these  tragic moments of the national life, I ask you to keep cool and  to attend to your daily affairs as usual. On the other hand, it  is the responsibility of all of us to remain mobilized and  vigilance for the sake of unity and determination, like the  ancestors, to struggle to the death in ensuring the country's  defense before the enemies.    From now on, may each man and woman in this country take  responsibility for the endangered fatherland. The honor of a  country cannot be divided. Enlightened by the shades of our  ancestors, enlivened by the sources of our beliefs, mobilizing  all the resources of our ancestral strategies, we again find ...  [pauses] we will reclaim the dignified legacy of the illustrious  runaways, the obscure blacksmith of our freedom.    On behalf of the Haitian nation, I thank all those nations  that have refused to give in to the immorality, the arrogance,  and the perfidy of a certain international community, to those  that have relieved us of our misfortunes. May God and the  protecting gods of the homeland help us in our quest to go  beyond ourselves. Courage! We will manage to reach that together.    Haitian men and women, I am obliged to appear before  you today to say a few words as the country is in danger. We  have been aware of the propaganda against us for a long time,  but today it is worse. A giant that can destroy us in five  minutes because we are weak and do not have atomic bombs has  declared war on us even though we have done nothing against it.  Why? I have heard it is because they want to restore democracy  in this country. Where was that democracy? I never knew about  that democracy.    During the 1990 elections, I was a State Council  member. I also took the candidate for whom everybody was voting  seriously, and voted for him myself. Today, I am obliged to say  that. But I am ashamed of having voted for him because today, a  Haitian [Aristide] who was always referring to Charlemagne  Peralte, Dessalines, and so on, and who was always criticizing  those with whom he is today cohabiting, is imploring those  people to come and invade Haiti, to reduce us to slavery.    Everyone has the right to vote for the one they want. I  too voted for the person I wanted. But I do not think that any  Haitian can accept another Haitian asking that Haiti be reduced  to slavery. It is not possible. This is why we say no, this is  impossible. I remember the words General Henri Christophe said  when Gen. Leclerc appeared in the Cap-Haitian harbor.  Leclerc asked Christophe to lay down weapons, but Christophe  replied as follows: You will enter Cap-Haitien after all  cities... [pauses] after the whole country is burnt, and I will  still be fighting you even on the ruins. A Haitian Army officer  said the same thing recently. Well, today, I repeat it as well.  We cannot give in to anyone. We acknowledge that Haiti is weak  and that we cannot fight against giants because we do not have  atomic bombs that we could drop on their countries. If they knew  we had atomic bombs, they would all respect us. But today, they  have dropped in on us. They want to come and destroy us, to  reduce us again to slavery. Why? We do not know. For democracy?  Was there ever any democracy?  When it was asked to burn people with tires, I was  ashamed. I never knew Haitians could reach that level of  savagery. I always knew Haitians as docile people who loved  everyone, loved one another. They [not further identified] make  them hate one another now. That is no longer possible. Today, we  are tired of that. I believe we must all unite because we cannot  return to slavery. That is not possible. And those who want to  make us return to slavery, they themselves should come here.  They do not know what kind of negroes they are dealing with.    Several foreign journalists came to question me lately.  I told them Haiti does not have the atomic bomb, but Haiti has  better than that. Haiti has guardians they do not know, and the  day the guardians intervene, get involved, then everyone will  ask where they had been, where they came from, who they are. The  foreign journalists came to ask me, and I told them that. Many  people will be surprised. Many cities may disappear, and no one  will understand. They think anyone can do whatever he pleases in  Haiti. That is not true. We all know that, and you all  understand very well what I am telling you.    Everyone who is able must help. And I know that  everyone will help. We will see what will happen. We cannot bend  before the enemy. We cannot let them destroy us. They can reduce  us to ashes in a few minutes, as I told you. We do not have the  means to defend ourselves. We do not have enough weapons. We are  a small goat before a lion. They can devour us in a moment. But,  only if God wishes it. We know the word: (Agarou) says, if God  wishes it!    The people, the Haitians who ask that we be invaded,  what are they themselves doing abroad? For two and a half years,  they have been wasting the country's money, giving it to white  Americans while we Haitians are dying of hunger. They did not do  anything for us. The Taiwanese Government gave them U.S. $2  million. How much did they give us? We all know who benefited  from that money. We did not receive anything. We did not get  even a gourde. Therefore, I do not think today that we can stand  up and let foreigners invade us because of a criminal who burns  people. I do not know where he got all the bad things that he  carries in him. He chose the wrong road. We cannot follow him on  the road he has chosen. We have chosen the right road because we  know that we do not make many of the things happen that happen.  We are not alone on this earth and every Haitian knows that.    Once there was an OAS director general who visited  Haiti. I believe his name was (Alejandro Ofila). He paid a visit  to one of the big newspapers in Haiti. As he was leaving, he  told the director [as heard]: They say, Director, that your  country is poor. But what amazes me in Haiti is the human warmth  and spirituality in all Haitians. Haitians have something in  their eyes that no other people have. This is someone who had  traveled around the world. I believe that what he said is true.  I wrote something in French at that time. I said: Honor to this  great man who knew how to look at us, not with physical eyes,  but with the eyes of the spirit because the spirit sees farther  than physical eyes, which are nothing. The physical body is  nothing. It can be destroyed. But no one can destroy spirit.  That is all I wanted to tell you. I believe we will all unite to  defend the country. Toussaint Louverture, Dessalines,  Christophe, Petion, Capois-la-Mort said no, this cannot be done.  Today, we are obliged to say the same thing. We know they can  destroy us. We do not have enough weapons to defend ourselves.  But, we have possibilities that they do not know. They may face  misfortune. Only God knows!    I will not stay too long because I know that you need  many things. At one time, that government was trying to help  you, but now they are talking to us about invasion. They are  going to invade us. Why? What did we do to the white men?  Nothing. Haitians did not do anything to the white men.    To restore democracy in the country. Was there  democracy in Haiti? Has democracy ever existed in Haiti? I do  not know what the foreigners call democracy. Perhaps, they have  democracy in their country. Yet, in their country, negroes do  not have rights. It is only now that negroes, more or less, have  rights in their country. Then, what does that mean? So now they  can defend negroes -- to bring the little negro [Aristide] back  to Haiti. Why does this little negro not come by himself? If he  is really strong, why does he not come? He has given all the  money he is spending to Americans. He has given millions of  Haiti's money, which was saved abroad, to one American.    Do foreigners have the right to do that? This is a  crime they have committed against us because we are weak. They  have taken advantage of us. But they do not know that they will  not endure for long because of that. Look and you will see that  what I say will happen. They think Haitians are a little thing.  Yes, Haitians are nothing. But all Haitians have behind them a  lot of things that they do not know about. They will realize  this before long.    All those who harmed Haiti have succumbed. There is a  certain president who is now in jail for theft. He was leading  the group who were saying that Haiti should be destroyed. Where  is he? He is in prison for theft, for a bad cause. Others have  fallen; others will fall. They even have many problems in their  own countries. We must know that, too. They see fleas on us  because we are thin dogs while they have big ticks walking on  them in their country. They are not serious, they are not more  serious than we are. Then, it is only that I was telling you. I  ask all of you to unite, to remain mobilized in order to defend  the country.    If they destroy us, we will all die together. Haitians  never fear death. I (?remember) when I went to take the oath at  parliament, I saw the Independence Act. It began: Freedom or  death. Haitians can no longer live in slavery. Either we die, or  we remain free. But they will cool before long, you will see,  and I say thanks to you.</p>

Copies of the letter was released today by the Presidential  Palace and was said to be delivered by former President Corazon  Aquino who is visiting Seoul as guest of honor of a forum  sponsored by the Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the  Asia-Pacific Region.    "The relationship between China and the United States is  important for the security of our region and that the current  difficulties besetting that relationship should be resolved with  the long-term interest of the region in mind," Ramos said in the  letter.    He did not elaborate how the Philippines and South Korea  could help ease the difficulties between China and U.S., mainly  disagreement on human rights and trade issues.    Ramos also sought Kim's views, saying he would be grateful  for the South Korean president's support on this matter.    The two presidents met twice since they assumed offices, one  in Seoul last May during Ramos' state visit to South Korea, the  other in Seattle last November when both attended the informal  meeting of leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  forum (APEC).    "We learned that much could be achieved for our region  through frank and informal exchanges of views and opinions,"  Ramos said.</p>

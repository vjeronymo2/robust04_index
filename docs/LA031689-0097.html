			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGER NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> BROTHER, THIS KID LOOKS LIKE A BATTING CHAMPION  </P> <P> Chris Gwynn longs for the day when people stop referring to him as Tony Gwynn's  brother.  </P> <P> Chris is having a tough enough time trying to edge into the Dodgers' crowded  outfield this spring without being constantly compared to the three-time  National League batting champion in his family.  </P> <P> Although Chris Gwynn is the same type of hitter as Tony -- he drills line  drives -- he hasn't come close to the numbers posted by his older brother with  the San Diego Padres.  </P> <P> Still, the .299 batting average Chris Gwynn compiled at triple-A Albuquerque  last year wasn't all that bad. It only looked that way when matched against  Tony's six consecutive .300-plus seasons and career .331 average in the major  leagues.  </P> <P> So what if Chris Gwynn isn't a second Tony Gwynn? The Dodgers are high enough  on him to consider him a candidate for their 24-man roster, and for the  defending World Series champions, that's a major compliment.  </P> <P> In fact, the Dodgers' No. 45 could just as well have been the Padres' No. 19 in  disguise when he started in left field against the Minnesota Twins Wednesday.  He looked like a carbon copy of brother Tony as he lined a double down each  foul line in his first two times at bat. His two-for-three day in the Dodgers'  5-4 victory raised his exhibition average to .450 -- nine for 20.  </P> <P> "We're both contact hitters," Chris said. "We're both left-handed, so I guess I  picked up my stroke from watching him when I was a kid."  </P> <P> At 24 -- Tony is 28 -- Chris is still young enough that a return ticket to  Albuquerque wouldn't put a serious crimp in his career. He already has put in  two seasons there, however, so he sees nothing to be gained from a third.  </P> <P> "A year ago, it was good for me to go back," Chris said. "We were loaded with  outfielders, and I knew I'd be better off playing every day. Now I just want to  be here, even if it means pinch-hitting and backup duty."  </P> <P> Gwynn noted that Mike Devereaux, a fellow rookie outfielder up from  Albuquerque, got a big break when the Dodgers traded him to the Baltimore  Orioles last Saturday for pitcher Mike Morgan.  </P> <P> Asked if he wishes he had gone in Devereaux's place, Gwynn said, "If that's  what it takes for me to play, yes. Actually, the trade was a great break for  all of us -- Mike, me and Jose Gonzalez (still another outfield hopeful from  Albuquerque).  </P> <P> "Last spring, we had so many outfielders here that you might get two hits and  somebody else might get three. Now it's down to Jose and me, and my goal is to  be consistent. I want to open someone's eyes."  </P> <P> When Gwynn said the outfield competition boiled down to him and Gonzalez, he  didn't mean that one of them was sure to make the team. Unless Franklin Stubbs  is traded, which could happen, there may not be an opening.  </P> <P> Barring a deal, Mike Davis and Stubbs will be the primary outfield spares  behind Kirk Gibson, John Shelby and Mike Marshall. Stubbs also figures to  understudy Eddie Murray at first base. Whether that leaves a spot for a sixth  outfielder depends on how Manager Tom Lasorda arranges the roster.  </P> <P> Mariano Duncan, nominally an infielder, is getting a tryout in the outfield. If  he and utility infielders Dave Anderson and Mike Sharperson all stay, and  Stubbs isn't traded, both Gwynn and Gonzalez will be in trouble.  </P> <P> "If they want a left-handed contact hitter off the bench, I could be their  man," Gwynn said.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> A remark made by Manager Pete Rose of the Cincinnati Reds last season is still  a source of enjoyment for Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda. Before Wednesday's  exhibition against the Minnesota Twins, Lasorda said, "Last year, Pete Rose  became one of the greatest prophets of all time. They beat us, 18-2, in  Cincinnati one night, and the next day he said, 'The Dodgers? I'm not worried  about the Dodgers. I'm worried about the (San Francisco) Giants and Houston.'  The next time in, we were 8 1/2 games in front."  </P> <P> Shortstop Alfredo Griffin has been so hot that when he went two for four  Wednesday, he dropped four points to .541. . . . Third baseman Jeff Hamilton,  who has been out a week with a bruised left thigh, is almost ready to return to  the lineup. . . . Mike Morgan, the newest Dodger, will continue his bid for the  fifth starting spot in a stint scheduled for three innings against the Montreal  Expos at Vero Beach today.  </P></p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Holders Technology static at Pounds 380,000 Reducing costs and minimising exposure to bad debts and adverse currency movements helped enhance margins at Holders Technology, the supplier of tools, materials and equipment to the printed circuit board industry. Pre-tax profits were static at Pounds 380,000, against Pounds 378,000, on turnover down from Pounds 3.73m to Pounds 2.98m. Mr Rudolf Weinreich, chairman and chief executive of this USM-quoted company, said that the UK economy had made no improvement, discernible either to Holders or to its customers, in the second half. Given this he regarded the result as 'satisfactory'. Indeed the recession had spread to the Continent and had stifled progress in Germany and the Netherlands. Earnings rose fractionally to 8.56p (8.51p) per share; the proposed final dividend is unchanged at 4p to make a maintained total of 6p.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The need for some type of agency guidance on smoked fish is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also evidenced by several other factors. First, the 1970 final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, which covered only hot-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish and the processing parameters that they required, is still  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being used as a guideline by some States. These earlier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters could result in commercially undesirable products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These parameters ought to be updated with the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technological understanding and processing flexibility for both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hot and cold smoked products. The guidance in this document can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide the basis on which such updating can occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the manufacture or sale of cold-processed fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products is not permitted in at least two States because there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are no regulations or regulatory guidelines for these products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 170). There is some pressure, however, to permit the sale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these products. The Canadian Government, for example, has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urged these States, Minnesota and Michigan, to permit the sale of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these products so that Canadian products may be exported to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States (Ref. 170). Some type of guidance that helps to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> define the processing parameters and techniques that reduce human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health risks from cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products would provide State, as well as federal, public health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officials with the tools necessary to evaluate the safety of cold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processed products manufactured in the United States, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those imported into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, in 1988 FDA conducted a survey of processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters used by fish smoking plants in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seventy five percent of the firms surveyed did not do final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product testing to ascertain whether their products met commonly recognized (Ref. 182) parameters for their products (Ref. 24).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information collected in this survey augmented information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained from the New York State Department of Agriculture and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marketing (Ref. 24), which had conducted a similar survey of fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smoking establishments in that State at approximately the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time. A total of 64 establishments were surveyed by FDA and New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> York State, representing over 90 percent of the smoked fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers in the United States. Among the species of fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the survey were chubs, bluefish, trout, carp, salmon,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whitefish, and herring. Processing information was collected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from manufacturers, and samples were collected for laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Travel: A day with Hals, Steen and Rembrandt - Adam Hopkins seeks out locations in Amsterdam which have inspired generations of artists Let's face it, there are plenty of museums in Amsterdam - almost too many. And they are generally presented as if the noblest of achievements is to wear out good shoe-leather in them, especially the Rijksmuseum. As a paid-up lover of Dutch art, I agree, of course - but only up to a point. How can one fail to be moved by the wide skies and infinite cloudscapes of the Dutch landscape and water painters; fall willing victim to the bricks and brooms of Pieter de Hooch's street scenes; or laugh colludingly at Jan Steen's scenes of family confusion? All this before the bigger guns of Rembrandt and Vermeer, Frans Hals and latter- day van Gogh are even wheeled into action. But the real place to begin in Amsterdam, if you want to enjoy it best and feel at least some of the impulse that drove the painters, is with the actual subject-matter they depicted. Much of it still exists in this most eye-catching of cities. Start with the canals, the greatest of them devised in 1609 by an inspired town planner and dug a little later in a majestic triple ring - Prinzengracht, Keizersgracht and Herengracht - around two thirds of the city, giving it the curious horsehoe shape which it has never lost. Rembrandt and company were at the height of their powers during this undertaking and there is little in Europe that is lovelier than to submit to the canal-side scene of the 17th century, the interplay of brick and gable, leaf and branch and water, with the narrow, delicate canal houses aspiring ever upward, their fronts as full of windows as a Dutch East Indiaman of square-rigged sails. The multiplicity of human characters that Rembrandt featured may not persist in quite the same form - all seems a little more uniform today  - but there is still a huge variety to experience: faces and demeanours Dutch and Indonesian, Surinamese and South Moluccan, faces of the old Dutch empire, faces - counting in oneself and other visitors - from everywhere. Then, to take a more concrete example, there is the ever-appealing flower market on the Singel canal, which is itself a modern version of an older market now infilled at the back of the town hall. The original can still be found in quite a few 17th century paintings of the city - I came on an example just the other day in the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection in Madrid and there are others in Amsterdam's engaging Historical Museum. The town hall, a grandly classical building endlessly represented by the painters, still exists just as it was. A 10-minute walk, alongside the main road or canal, will bring you from Dam Square and the town hall to the delightful West Church or Westerkerk - sketched by Rembrandt - with the pompous crown of the Habsburg Archduke Maximilian on its tower. Rembrandt is buried in the interior, exact spot unknown, and there is a statue of Anne Frank, who lived and suffered just 100 yards away, outside the church's door. Across the canal here is the old working-class district of the Jordaan, much given in the 19th and early 20th centuries to revolutionary disturbances, themselves often depicted by the painters of the day. This is another excellent district for strolling. And back on the far side of town, close by the often-choppy river Amstel - which of course gives its name to the whole city - you will find swing bridges of the type that van Gogh favoured. You do not need to know the painterly references to enjoy a canalside start to Amsterdam - it all becomes crystal clear when you finally hit the museums  -but you can certainly pick up a trick or two from the painters as you progress. For yet another enduring aspect of Amsterdam is its excellent pubs and eateries, much patronised by the painters when they were flush. You could start right in the middle of town, close to the History Museum. Here Haesje Claas in Spuistraat will offer you traditional Dutch grub in a cosy, old-fashioned atmosphere, the sort of interior the painters often showed. You can imagine the kind of food - a stampott, say, featuring curly kale and meatballs. Or, more my line at mid-day, the old and pretty pub of Hoppe, right on Spui square, will serve an excellent cold beer, while Kootje van Brootje, a superior sandwich bar next door, proffers soft white rolls with raw herring and onion. (Those in the mood could skip the beer and go for a quick shot of Dutch gin, the rougher young or yonge being preferable, in my opinion, to the smoother oude. In which case they might end up like someone in a Jan Steen painting.) There are other restaurants round here for evening time - the posh and sometimes touristy but always entertaining Five Flies (more properly d'Viff Vlieghen), with its host of ancient little dining rooms and quirky corners (more Dutch interiors), or Lucius, where the effort goes into the excellence of the fish-dinners. But as with the canals, one ought to range a bit. How about an Indonesian rijstaffel, many-dished, in Tempo Doelo near the Rembrandtsplein? Or a hint of designer sophistication at Les Quatre Papillons - one of the four chefs, the so -called papillons, is English. As for the Jordaan district, it is much less known to visitors. Steer by nose - almost all pubs serve food as well as drink. Last time I was passing I had a meal (evenings only) in de Reiger - the name means Heron - in Nieuwe Leliestraat, and very good, and very homely, it was too. Which brings one, finally, to the museums. The History Museum, of course, is excellent. One could say the same of the Maritime Museum, although it is vast and you will not want to see it all; as is the much-lauded Jewish Museum. But really, I suppose, we are talking Rijksmuseum for historic Dutch painting, van Gogh Museum for the one-eared master, and the Stedelijk for international modern. Although the van Gogh can be done as a single - and extraordinarily illuminating - whole, it would take days to get right round the other two. My own tactic is to pick just one or two painters at a time (the guidebooks come in very handy here) and otherwise concentrate on the canals and eateries, and even, maybe, take a quick flip through the red light district. That way I may not get much wiser but I certainly feel I get into the spirit. Adam Hopkins visited Amsterdam as a guest of Travelscene, tel: 081-427 4445, staying at the excellent Pulitzer Hotel on the Prinzengracht, a series of converted canalside houses joined to make a single, decidedly upmarket, hostelry. Flight by Transavia from Gatwick. Three nights, two sharing, breakfast, airport transfer, from Pounds 314. Restaurants: medium price - Haesje Claas, Spuistraat 275, (tel: 62649998) and Les Quatre Papillons, Beuliingstraat 5-7 (6261912); expensive - de d'Viff Vlieghen, Spuistraat 294 (248369) and Lucius, Spuistraat 247, (6241831); economic - Tempo Doelo, Utrechtsestraat 75 (6256718) and de Reiger, Nieuwe Leliestraat 34, (6247426). Food prices are comparable to London, maybe a shade lower, although you certainly have to watch wine costs.</p>

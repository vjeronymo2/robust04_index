			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  articles and editorials from ROK vernacular newspapers published  on 8 February on the U.S. order to prepare for the Team Spirit  military exercise and the DPRK nuclear issue.    The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 2 a  900-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong  Chin-sok analyzing the background of the order to prepare for  the Team Spirit exercise.    The article interprets the order to prepare for the Team  Spirit exercise as a realization that "the negotiations on the  North Korean nuclear issue have actually ruptured" and explains  that the order serves as an ultimatum to North Korea.    The article reports "the United States is most concerned  about the possibility that North Korea may declare itself a  nuclear possessing country because this would automatically  exempt North Korea from the obligation to accept nuclear  inspections, and as a result, sanctions by the UN Security  Council would not be as easy."    The article quotes Dr. (Spector) of the Carnegie Endowment  for International Peace: "There is no clue that could prove  North Korea is a nonnuclear country."    The article forecasts that the U.S. Government will look to  "a final settlement at the edge of the cliff" by not announcing  the detailed schedule of the Team Spirit exercise for the time  being.    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 an  800- word editorial criticizing the use of the Team Spirit  exercise as a negotiating card.    The editorial asserts that the "purely defensive" Team  Spirit  exercise is "inevitable" and "natural" under the current defense  system of the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces and that it was not  appropriate to use the exercise in the negotiations in the first  place.    The editorial asserts that if the exercise had not been used  as a negotiating card so easily, we might not have been blamed  for evoking the tension first by resuming the preparations for  the joint military exercise after saying it was possible to  suspend the exercise.    The editorial asserts there is no guarantee that North Korea  would give up nuclear development even if all its conditions are  met because in the past North Korea has always added new  conditions after concessions have been made.    The editorial continues that in dealing with such a  sensitive  issue, it should be made clear what concessions we are able to  make, and the advantages and disadvantages of giving up or  insisting on nuclear development.    The editorial reports that while continuing dialogue  efforts,  we should make full preparations for the people's safety and the  right of existence and urge the government to show, thorough its  security posture, its clear position toward the North Korean  nuclear issue.    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a  1,000- word article by Washington-based correspondent Chin  Chang-uk.    The article notes that even though the hard-line moves of  the  United States -- including U.S. Defense Secretary Perry's  remarks regarding the use of sticks after carrots, the  resumption of the Team Spirit exercise, deployment of Patriot  missiles and Apache helicopters, and disclosure of the five-step  operation plan -- may lead to a crisis scenario, analysts of  Korean affairs in Washington are optimistic.    The article reports that the analysts assert that North  Korea  will eventually accept all the inspection conditions of the  International Atomic Energy Agency and that North Korea is  dreaming if it thinks a war is inevitable under its current  military preparedness. The article reports that the analysts  think North Korea is not at all prepared for a large-scale war  based on the fact that "there is a serious food shortage in  North Korea, there has been no signs that it has made any  efforts to secure more military provisions, and that North Korea  has only a two-month energy reserve with its existing energy  storage facilities."    The article cites another assertion that because North Korea  is more afraid of the counterattack by ROK-U.S. Combined Forces,  war will not breakout on the Korean peninsula as long as North  Korea does not lose its reason.    The article concludes with concern by pessimistic analysts  about the possibility that the United States might lose its  reason after the humiliating results of the negotiations with  North Korea.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ONLY 5 MINUTES LEFT, ATLANTIS LIFTS INTO ORBIT  </P> <P> With only five minutes left in its 64-minute launch "window," the space shuttle  Atlantis roared into orbit on a cloud of flame and smoke at 11:47 a.m. PDT  Thursday, launching the United States into a new era of planetary exploration  after an 11-year hiatus.  </P> <P> "Four of us are happy to be back in space, and the fifth is happy to be here,"  radioed commander David M. Walker shortly after Atlantis entered its  185-mile-high orbit.  </P> <P> "It was quite a cliffhanger," said acting NASA administrator Dale D. Myers,  referring to the cloud cover at Kennedy's main runway, where Atlantis would  have landed if the launch were aborted.  </P> <P> Cloud cover at the site forced a 59-minute delay in the launch, almost causing  the mission to be scrubbed for the second time in six days. An attempted launch  last Friday was halted 31 seconds before liftoff when a cooling pump on one of  the shuttle's engines failed.  </P> <P> A little over six hours after launch, Atlantis was scheduled to carry out its  prime objective, when mission specialist Mark C. Lee would release the  $325-million Magellan spacecraft from the orbiter's 60-foot-long payload bay.  An hour later, Magellan's solid rocket motor was to ignite, launching the craft  on its 15-month, 800-million-mile voyage to Venus, where it will use radar to  map the surface of Earth's sister planet.  </P> <P> Magellan will be the first interplanetary probe launched by the United States  since 1978, and the first ever launched by the shuttle. With it, NASA is  entering an unprecedented period of scientific activity that will include the  launch of the Galileo probe to Jupiter in October and the orbiting of the  Hubble Space Telescope in December.  </P> <P> "Nobody is ever going to question our leadership in planetary science again,"  said Lennard Fisk, NASA's associate administrator for space science.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sharp Contrast  </P> <P> Thursday's weather was a sharp contrast to last Friday's perfect conditions. A  light rain soaked Atlantis on pad 39B for an hour shortly after dawn, and thick  clouds threatened rain for most of the day. Air Force meteorologist Capt.  Thomas Strange noted that "all of the clouds on the (Florida) peninsula" seemed  to be right over Cape Canaveral and Kennedy.  </P> <P> But a brisk breeze from the ocean blew most of the clouds westward at the last  minute, and chief astronaut Dan Brandenstein, flying over the Kennedy landing  strip, finally reported that the skies were clear enough for an emergency  landing if one proved necessary.  </P> <P> Beyond the weather, the countdown went virtually flawlessly, and launch  director Robert B. Sieck called it "exhilarating."  </P> <P> "Did somebody win the pool up there?" mission control commentator John  Creighton asked the crew. "We had only five minutes left in the window."  </P> <P> "We wouldn't want to push it any closer," replied Walker.  </P> <P> It was the fourth shuttle launch since the space program was jarred by the  January, 1986, destruction of Challenger and the 60th manned launch in the U.S.  space program. Four more shuttle launches are scheduled for this year,  including the first post-Challenger flight of Columbia, which is still in the  process of being refitted with changes mandated after the Challenger accident.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Venus Orbit  </P> <P> Magellan, designed at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and assembled by  Martin-Marietta Corp., will not reach Venus until Aug 10, 1990, when its  braking rocket will shift it into a 3-hour, 9-minute elliptical orbit. For 37.2  minutes of each orbit, a sophisticated radar system built by Hughes Aircraft  Co. will map an 18-mile-wide swath of the planet's surface. It will then use  the rest of the orbit to radio the data back to Earth.  </P> <P> In the 243-day primary phase of the mission, Magellan will map 80% of Venus's  surface, sending back more data than all previous planetary probes combined.  </P> <P> Scientists hope the data will allow them to understand the motion of tectonic  plates on Venus, shedding new light on the causes of earthquakes on Earth,  where tectonic motion is obscured by erosion and weathering.  </P> <P> They also hope to learn more about the conditions that caused a so-called  runaway greenhouse effect on Venus, which raised its surface temperature to  nearly 900 degrees Fahrenheit.  </P> <P> The other members of the crew are pilot Ronald J. Grabe and mission specialists  Mary L. Cleave and Norman E. Thagard.  </P> <P> Atlantis is scheduled to land at Edwards Air Force Base at 12:44 p.m. PDT  Monday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE ATLANTIS ASTRONAUTS  </P> <P> Navy Capt.

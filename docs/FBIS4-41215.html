			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Sergey Romazin, chief of the </F> Russian Federation Ministry of Justice Administration for  Elaboration of Legislation on Judicial Reform and Struggle  Against Lawbreaking; place and date not given: "Inevitable,  Rather than Harsh Punishment. New Draft Criminal Code Reflects  New Crime Situation"]    [Text] Russian citizens have always found it hard to  comprehend the winged phrase uttered by the literary hero that  the Criminal Code ought to be respected. Even more so in these  new times of troubles, when everything at home is topsy-turvy.  And especially since the archaic nature, ideologization, and  conservatism of the criminal legislation currently in force are  obvious to everyone. The attempt to produce a new Criminal Code  (two years ago) was successfully thwarted. A fresh attempt is  being made now. A working group comprising specialists from the  Ministry of Justice and the State Legal Administration and  eminent legal scientists has completed its work on the general  section of Russia's new Criminal Code.    Working group member Sergey Romazin, chief of the Russian  Federation Ministry of Justice Administration for Elaboration of  Legislation on Judicial Reform and Struggle Against Lawbreaking,  answers ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's questions.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Sergey Borisovich! You must agree that  the reality in our country is harsh. Explosions echo in the  streets, contract killers operate, all and sundry talk about  mafia and corruption. The president's latest edict "On Urgent  Measures..." is a kind of line drawn beneath a far from  brilliant state of affairs. Will the new Criminal Code provide  a kind of panacea against criminal misfortunes?    [Romazin] It is necessary to make this clear straightaway:  The general section of the new Criminal Code is the part which  formulates the general principles of criminal policy, offers  material definition of crimes, categorizes crimes, explains  terms like "recidivism" and "organized forms of crime," and  elucidates questions concerning the system and categories of  punishment, criminal records, and others. The special section  of the Criminal Code -- which is not yet ready -- will cover  specific crimes and the punishment for them.    Now let us turn to explosions and panaceas. One of the tasks  facing the working group was to bring criminal legislation in  line with the criminological realities of today. Of course,  these questions will be largely resolved when drafting the  Criminal Code's special section.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] What is and what is not deemed a crime?    [Romazin] The definition of "crime" is fairly brief: "Any  act (whether of commission or omission), prohibited by criminal  law and causing damage or threatening to cause damage to an  individual, society, or the state, is deemed a crime." Let me  draw attention to the fact that this definition already reflects  the contemporary hierarchy of values protected by the state from  criminal infringements: the individual, society, and the state.  This sequence will also provide the foundations on which the  system of the new Criminal Code's special section will be built.  The following also stems from this definition: People cannot  be punished for acts which are rejected by society on moral or  ethical grounds but are not specified in the criminal law. The  Ancient Roman jurists used to say: "There is neither crime nor  punishment unless so provided by the law."    Substantial amendments have been introduced in the Criminal  Code's general section on punishment. Censure, the imposition  of an obligation to make restitution for any damage caused, and  corrective labor have been excluded from the list of  punishments. The latter category of punishment is purely Soviet  because, until quite recently, we had the socialist idea of  "re-education through labor." You have to agree that this is an  anachronism in the market era.    The Criminal Code retains forms of punishment like fines,  deprivation of the right to hold certain office or engage in  certain activity, deprivation of military or special ranks,  confiscation of property, and imprisonment.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] How about the death penalty?    [Romazin] The draft's authors failed to reach unanimity on  this question. Under the Constitution, the imposition of the  death penalty is restricted only to cases involving the  commission of especially grave crimes against life. By way of  an alternative, it was proposed to altogether abolish the death  penalty as a form of punishment and introduce life imprisonment.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] When talking about organized crime, the  law and order organs blame the lack of a legislative base for  the struggle against it. Does the draft Criminal Code fill  these loopholes?    [Romazin] Having worked for more than 30 years in the  courts, let me say that all references to the lack of a law in  the struggle against organized crime are more myth than reality.  Even the Criminal Code currently in force makes it possible to  institute proceedings not only against "underlings" but also  against the top mafia bosses. As a matter of fact, this should  be the topic of a separate conversation. But as regards the  draft, let me say this: Staffers of law enforcement organs will  be given a clear definition of what constitutes a group of  persons conspiring to commit a crime, and the very term of an  organized criminal fraternity group will be explained. The  struggle against this type of crime will probably be helped by  the formulation that all persons participating in a group crime  are equally liable regardless of the function they may have  performed, according to previous agreement, during the  commission of the crime.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] In other words, henceforth anyone  hiring a killer will be held liable for premeditated murder.    [Romazin] Exactly. Moreover, participation in any form of  group criminal activity will always attract harsher punishment.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] It is well known that criminality is  now "getting younger." Has this trend been taken into account  by the draft's authors?    [Romazin] Most certainly. Taking into account the results  of age psychology studies and criminological indicators, a  standard age of criminal responsibility is brought in at 14  years. At the same time, if a 14-years old adolescent accused  of having committed a crime is psychologically retarded, he will  be deemed not liable to criminal proceedings.    For the first time, it is proposed to introduce in our  legislation a norm imparting legal significance to the fact that  a crime has been committed by someone aged between 18 and 20  years. What does this mean? In exceptional cases, taking into  account the nature of the committed crime and the specific  features of the accused's personality, the court may apply  measures of punishment provided for minors against persons who  are 18, 19, or 20 years old.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] The press and academic literature have  expressed the opinion that it would not be a bad thing to  introduce criminal liability for legal persons.    [Romazin] At present only physical persons can be held  criminally liable, in other words citizens who have reached a  certain age, are mentally healthy, and so on. At the same time,  there are frequent situations when criminal liability for any  damage caused to the environment or the health of millions of  citizens as a result of harmful discharges by industrial  enterprises attaches to some "fall guy" (as a rule the shop  foreman, shift or section chief, and so on who has been forced  to implement an unlawful decision made by the legal person's  collegial organ -- board of directors, shareholders' meeting,  and others -- under fear of punishment, dismissal from work, and  so on). This is, to use the legal language, an objective  imputation. Consequently, a person is sentenced but the crime  goes unpunished.    Our authors' collective sees just one way out of this legal  arbitrariness: In the event of any act specified by the  criminal law, the actual legal person itself will be subject to  criminal -- and I emphasize: criminal, not any other --  liability.    A few words at this point about punitive measures. The  draft makes provisions for fines, prohibition to engage in  certain activity, confiscation of property, and winding up of  legal persons. Let us hope that the fear of criminal punishment  will force our firms, joint-stock companies, enterprises, and  other organizations to adopt a more respectful attitude toward  the law and bring their corporate interests in line with the  interests of individuals, society, and the state.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] So, work on the Criminal Code's first  section is completed. What happens next?    [Romazin] The draft, whose discussion is not yet complete,  will be submitted to the president for onward submission to the  State Duma once all remarks and proposals have been summed up.  I assume that this will happen this year. There is no room for  any further delay -- I think that everyone realizes this.  Especially today, when State Duma deputies, numerous jurists,  and the mass media are perfectly justified in sounding the alarm  about divergences between the edict "On Urgent Measures..." and  the Constitution.    [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] One last question. Quite often  staffers of law and order organs advocate making the Criminal  Code harsher. What is your opinion?    [Romazin] Any professional would confirm that the main point  in the struggle against crime is not the harshness of punishment  but its inevitability. According to militia statistics, more  than 2.5 million crimes are committed each year but only  something like 800,000 criminals actually stand trial. Anyone  can draw his own conclusions. Nonetheless, I would not say that  the draft is all that liberal. Any persistent criminal,  murderer, rapist, and anyone who crudely tramples the law is  "entitled" to expect harsh punitive measures and look at the  draft Criminal Code as quite tough.    At the same time, persons who have committed nonviolent  crimes, who have repented for doing so, and who have made  restitution for any damage caused, can hope for lenience by the  law. Thus, it would be more appropriate to talk not about  harshness but about the principle of differentiated criminal  liability, which is consistently implemented in the draft new  Criminal Code.</p>

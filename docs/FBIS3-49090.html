She added that in a speech today, Finance Minister Ivan  Kocarnik told ministry staff that few countries can boast of a  budget surplus, and the Czech Republic is the only country  undergoing transformation that has a surplus. The surplus, he  said, is a sign of successful economic transformation,  especially as the new tax system was instituted and enforced  with no loans from the state.</p>

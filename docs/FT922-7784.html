			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / UK Company News: The Battle For Midland - Searching for simple solutions to systems tangle may stall savings / A look at the problems of integrating the banks' computers THE STRUGGLE to unite the computing systems of Midland Bank with those of the winner of the takeover battle will be expensive, prolonged and not without substantial risk. That is the view of data processing experts who have been involved in previous large merger attempts. They point to the experience of Woolwich and Nationwide Anglia building societies, the merger plans of which foundered on the economic impracticality of uniting incompatible systems. Or there is the example of Girobank and the Alliance and Leicester Building Society, where the merger went ahead but it took 18 months before Girobank customers were able to use their bank cards in Alliance and Leicester cash mach-ines. Estimates of the complexity of the task in the Midland battle are complicated by the secrecy in which the banks shroud their computer operations, for both security and competitive reasons. Midland and Lloyds this week refused to give details of their data processing systems. It is tempting to think of a bank's computer system as an integrated whole, like an electronic filing cabinet. Where two systems are incompatible, it is because the cabinet is the wrong shape or the holes in the filing cards the wrong distance apart. The reality is not so simple. Computer arrangements in many big banks are a sprawling mess of incompatible systems, each built for a separate purpose, often with little in common. They will include retail systems, branch automation systems, wholesale banking operations, cash management systems, automated teller machine networks and securities trading and accounting systems. Many are so old and complicated that nobody in the data processing department can remember how they work. Documentation is not one of the computing industry's greatest strengths. Maintenance, the word the data processing industry uses for extending and modifying existing systems, is an expensive nightmare. It is impossible, however, simply to throw away the mess of wiring and computer code and start again. The systems, inefficient as they are, support the banks' commercial operations. If the economies of scale expected of a merger are to be achieved a serious effort to integrate information technology across the enlarged group will have to be put in place. The Hong Kong and Shanghai offer document talks of: 'Economies in production processing through combining data centres and communications networks and enhanced purchasing power.' There are four issues at stake. They are the processing software, the hardware or the physical computers, the network and staffing. One consultant believes the principal cost savings will come through rationalising data processing staff, which can number thousands for a large bank. Mr Steven Landles, a divisional director with BIS Group, a leading banking software company, says merging systems should proceed in three phases. In the first, the two sets of systems are allowed to run in parallel for up to two years. No savings can be expected in this period. In the second phase, the best systems have to be selected. If Lloyds were to win the merger battle, for example, its branch automation system would be likely to be selected over that of Midland. The third phase would involve developing a single, integrated system to cover all the banks activities. The cost of developing a new branch automation system alone has been set at Pounds 50m. Anomalies exist at every stage. Midland and Lloyds use similar processing software for their automatic teller machines but Midland's reciprocity partner in automatic teller operations is National Westminster, while Lloyds' is Barclays. Lloyds uses IBM central processing hardware exclusively while Midland is in the process of moving from Unisys to IBM. Other consultants believe technology will be the least of the enlarged group's problems, arguing that differences in business processes will prove the biggest hurdle to a smooth merger. But whoever wins the merger battle, rationalisation of information technology will not provide jam today. And it will be a hard slog to ensure jam tomorrow.</p>

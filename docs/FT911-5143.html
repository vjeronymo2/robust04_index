			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Citibank's UK arm to shut car loan side Citibank Savings, the UK retail banking arm of Citicorp, is to shut its loss-making UK car loans operation with the loss of over 50 jobs. The closure is the latest of a series of withdrawals by large lenders from the asset finance market. In January Bank of Ireland said that it was winding down British Credit Trust, its finance house subsidiary. Mr Jack Davies, Managing Director Citibank Savings, said: 'The auto finance business has been a marginal operation for us for a number of years and the losses experienced by a number of people in the credit industry was really what led to our decision to close it.' Mr Davies confirmed that the car loans operation had been losing money but denied claims that losses reached Pounds 12m last year. At the same time Citibank Savings is beefing up other parts of its consumer finance operations, especially mortgage lending and home improvements. These activities will now make up a new division of Citibank Savings called Citibank Home Loans.</p>

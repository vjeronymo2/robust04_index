			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Owner-managers' optimism faulted BUSINESSES that are owner-managed expect to achieve an average 4.8 per cent growth over the next 12 months, says a survey of 900 businesses by Mori for accountants Ernst and Young. Such confidence by owner-managers reveals a 'disturbing expectation gap' given economic forecasts of zero or negative growth over the same period, Ernst and Young said. The firm urged realism: 'We suspect that the estimates are based on hope rather than hard evidence. Forecasts that cannot be supported will undermine confidence among companies' financiers.' A total of 63 per cent of owner-managed businesses thought the economy would improve over the next year and 66 per cent said the election result had increased confidence. The companies surveyed all had annual sales of between Pounds 5m and Pounds 100m - those with sales of more than Pounds 50m were most likely to think the economy would improve.

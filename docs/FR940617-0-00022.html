Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The program described by this final rule is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under No. 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, and 10.852, Rural Telephone Bank Loans.

Since that time part 1762 has been incorporated into part 1755. Due to the pertinence of the comments received REA decided to incorporate many of them into the document. The revised rule was published as a 7 CFR part 1755 proposed rule on March 14, 1991, at 56 FR 10827 with a 60 day comment period. During this period comments and suggestions were received from six major manufacturers of central office equipment. Many useful comments and suggestions were received and many of them have been incorporated into the revised Form 525 Contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The last revision to the Form 525 Contract was September 1966. Since that date, significant changes have been made in the telephone industry. The profound advancement in central office equipment technology has made possible many new services on a cost effective basis. Divestiture and competition, legislation and regulation have brought about many changes in the conduct of telecommunications business. The revised Form 525 Contract incorporates these changes into the Central Office Equipment Contract. The main changes to the Contract are new requirements that: (1) Provide for a software license, (2) provide for patent, copyright, and trademark infringement protection, (3) provide a cap on consequential damages, and (4) provide Equal Employment Opportunity requirements. In addition, it revises and updates provisions for (1) delivery and installation of equipment, (2) inspection and testing of the completed installations, (3) payments to the contractor, (4) insurance, (5) liquidated damages, and (6) completion of the project. This action will make it possible for REA telephone borrowers to continue to provide their subscribers with the most modern and efficient telephone service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> REA has issued a series of 7 CFR chapter XVII parts which serve to implement the policies, procedures, and requirements for administering its loan and loan guarantee programs and the loan documents and security instruments which provide for and secure REA financing. The technical change to 7 CFR part 1753 updates the number of days allowed for acceptance testing in order to conform with REA Form 525 Central Office Equipment Contract (Including Installation). The revision to 7 CFR part 1755 codifies REA Form 525, Central Office Equipment Contract (Including Installation). The 7 CFR part 1755 also describes where copies of the contract may be obtained. REA telephone borrowers are required to use the REA Form 525 Contract where major central office facilities are being procured and installed under contract. The present REA Form 525 has become outdated due to technological advancements and other reasons. Advanced technology and equipment concepts have introduced new issues. Contract terms and obligations need to be modified and updated to more accurately reflect present business practices. Some representative issues addressed in updating this contract are: Expansion of patent infringement protection to include copyrights, trademarks, etc.; software right-to-use licensing terms; warranty coverage; use of information; consequential damages; delays in project; liquidated damages; bonding and insurance; independent contractor provisions; and support of discontinued products. All these additions and changes have been made so that REA telephone borrowers can continue to provide their subscribers with the most up-to-date and efficient telephone service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

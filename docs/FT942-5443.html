			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / International Company News: Alfa's fading badge gets a polish - Fiat is reviving one of Italy's most famous marques Alfa Romeo, one of Italy's most famous - but in recent years most troubled - carmakers, is poised for a re-launch by its owner, Fiat. A programme is under way to expand Alfa's European dealership network by 20 per cent - requiring the appointment of more than 200 extra dealers - to prepare for new models starting in the autumn. According to Mr Paolo Cantarella, managing director of Fiat Auto, the first of the new range, a Ford Escort-sized sporting hatchback designated the 145, is scheduled to enter the showrooms in September. It will be followed by four other Alfa Romeo models by early 1996 under an investment programme which since the Italian motor group acquired Alfa Romeo in 1987 has totalled about L5,000bn (Dollars 3bn), says Mr Cantarella. He insists that there will be no let-up in the Alfa Romeo investment programme in spite of the problems besetting the parent company. Fiat ran up a net loss of L1,783bn in 1993, its biggest ever. Fiat Auto, the main operating division which includes Fiat, Lancia, Ferrari and commercial vehicle maker Iveco as well as Alfa Romeo, lost L1,756bn. The Alfa investment is relatively small set against a new model and plant programme for the automotive division as a whole which totals L40,000bn. It is seen by many industry observers as a last ditch attempt by Fiat to secure a long-term, independent future for the group in Europe's vehicle industry. About half of this sum has been committed, according to Mr Cantarella. Alfa produced 130,000 cars last year, compared with a peak of 220,000 in 1989. While sales of Fiat-badged cars fell by 0.3 per cent in the first four months of this year - compared with a rise of 3.8 per cent for the European new car market as a whole - Alfa Romeo's sales fell by 14.9 per cent. For the first time, Alfa Romeo is to launch its new car in all left-hand drive European markets simultaneously. The 145 will go on sale in September and other 145 versions will be added by the end of the year. An all-new Spyder convertible and new coupe will be added in 1995, followed by a flagship luxury saloon and a replacement for the current Alfa 155 medium saloon. Mr Cantarella refused to project the size of increase in Alfa Romeo production to result from the new model programme. 'But I can assure you that we will recover the investment we are making,' he said. To further support Alfa's relaunch as a sporting marque, Mr Cantarella is spending Dollars 40m this year on motor racing - more than Dollars 10m in the UK to compete in the British Touring Car Championship. 'Sport is not an option for Alfa Romeo - to invest in racing is essential,' he says. Fiat is hoping to inject life into its Lancia executive cars unit, which has also seen a 10 per cent sales fall so far this year, through an expansion into the multi-passenger vehicle (MPV) market in collaboration with Peugeot Citroen of France. It has put on sale a Lancia version of the MPV in which the two partners have invested some Dollars 1.5bn at their Sevel vans joint venture plant in Italy's Mezzogiorno and at Sevel Nord, a new plant near Valenciennes in northern France. Sevel is an acronym for Societe Europeene de Vehicules Legers, set up in 1978 with both Fiat and Peugeot holding 50 per cent share stakes. The plants have the same ownership structure but the French group has management control of the MPV facility and the Italian group retains management control of the vans plant. Both Mr Jacques Calvet, Peugeot's chairman, and Mr Cantarella say they are considering further collaboration. However, Mr Cantarella makes clear that this is on a project basis and that there is no prospect of closer financial or equity links.</p>

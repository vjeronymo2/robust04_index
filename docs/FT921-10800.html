			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / O &amp; Y seeks Pounds 215m from Canary Wharf OLYMPIA and York, the Canadian property company, is considering raising Pounds 215m from small investors for its Canary Wharf development, it emerged last night. The developers plan to do this by using a syndicated deal or enterprise zone property trust. O &amp; Y will sell number 10 Cabot Square to the specially created trust. Investors will then be offered the chance to buy units in the property. They would eventually receive a proportionate share of the sale price. Mr Robert John, a director of Olympia &amp; York, said that the final decision on whether to go ahead with the deal would be made in the next couple of days. 'We are looking at a number of financing options,' he said. O &amp; Y, which has invested about Pounds 1.4bn in Canary Wharf, is trying to raise Pounds 300m-Pounds 400m on the tower at Canary Wharf. In previous financing rounds in 1990 and 1991, it raised Pounds 547m. O &amp; Y is keen to explore new ways of exploiting the tax breaks in the enterprise zone, since it cannot set them against its own tax bill as it makes no UK profits. Other methods of exploiting tax allowances, such as leasing finance, have become more difficult as the recession has reduced companies' need for tax shelters. Because the properties are based in a designated enterprise zone, full tax relief is available to individual investors. This acts as a powerful incentive to richer individuals who might otherwise avoid the property market. The deal will come with put options for trust holders, allowing them to sell their share of the building back to the developers after 10 years. Property investment, particularly in the Docklands, is speculative, and it is thought that this might be necessary to entice small investors. The deal would not remove all control from O &amp; Y. The developers, it is understood, will have call options, exercisable from the 12th year onwards. These will allow them to buy back the property at a pre-agreed price, which would increase each year. This would be by far the biggest enterprise zone trust which has yet been launched. Several large office blocks in Salford, Docklands and Telford have been funded using this route.</p>

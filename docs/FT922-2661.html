			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: Continental says Pirelli should repay dividend CONTINENTAL, the German tyre company, yesterday demanded that Pirelli, its Italian rival, should repay the dividend received last year on its shares in the Germany company. The demand represents an intensification of hostilities between the two companies, following Pirelli's announcement that it will be launching a second attempt to remove shareholder voting restrictions at Continental. This challenge will be mounted at a shareholders' meeting scheduled for July 3. The two companies spent almost 18 months trying to negotiate a merger until talks broke down in December last year. The German company's demand for DM8.91m (Dollars 5.53m) stems directly from a courtroom victory it won over Pirelli last month. Continental said yesterday that the ruling meant that Pirelli was not entitled to collect a dividend on its shares, just as it was not entitled to have voting rights on those shares. Pirelli said last night that it would not pay back the dividend as it was already challenging the legal decision on which the claim for the repayment was based. Continental said if Pirelli did not pay the money back it would take the Italian company to court in an attempt to obtain it. Once the money had been obtained, it would be paid into a dividend reserve and be available for distribution to shareholders at some stage in the future. The Hanover court ruled on May 29 that Pirelli's earlier attempt to overturn voting restrictions - which limit shareholders' votes in Continental to 5 per cent no matter how big their stake - was invalid on the basis that contrary to German company law, Pirelli had not declared it spoke for more than 25 per cent of the German company. At present, Pirelli owns 5 per cent and has options over a further 34 per cent. The court ruled that Pirelli had direct control over a minimum of 25.4 per cent of Continental when it launched its first challenge in March last year. These hostilities come at a complicated time in the relations between the two companies. They are still in negotiations over the sale of some of Pirelli's non-tyre businesses which Continental would like to buy.</p>

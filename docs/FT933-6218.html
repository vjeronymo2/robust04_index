			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: A finger of fate The giant finger of fate descends again from the Coliseum flies: English National Opera has opened its 1993-94 season with a revival of Simon Boccanegra. David Alden's 1987 production frames a darkly violent, broodingly personal response to perhaps the most 'inward' of Verdi's middle-period operas. The stage-picture is cluttered by too much psycho-symbolic baggage (Alden's later ENO productions have proved more disciplined in their stagecraft). Atmosphere is unvaried, larger issues tend to get lost, yet on Thursday the contorted passions and confrontations of the characters were heated to boiling-point - any Verdi staging that can urge performances of such searing emotional force out of all its participants must have unlocked some powerful Verdian truths at the opera's centre. The cast is characterised by strong, unbeautiful voices sensitively used - Gregory Yurisich tremendous in the title role, pictured left, with Janice Cairns (Amelia); David Rendall (Adorno), Keith Latham (Paolo); only John Connell's Fiesco seems short-breathed, underweight. The revival would benefit from a less self-conscious, stop-go conductor than Alexander Rahbari.</p>

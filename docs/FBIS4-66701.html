			<p>CSO     [Text] Moscow, March 7 (UNI). Russia will help India  modernise T-72 tanks and other Soviet-designed weapons,  according to commander-in-chief of the Russian land forces  Col.-Gen. Vladimir Semyonov, reports ITAR-TASS.    He announced this after the final round of talks with Indian  army chief Gen. B.C. Joshi yesterday. Gen. Joshi left for home  this morning after a nine-week official visit to the country.    The Russian general also did not rule out leasing some types  of weapons for two or three years to India, he however, did not  elaborate.    Observers recall that India had taken a nuclear powered,  submarine from Russia on lease in the eighties.    While talking to ITAR-TASS, Gen. Joshi expressed India's  willingness to continue military-technical cooperation with  Russia and said 70 percent of arms with the Indian army were  Soviet-designed. He also talked of India's problems in getting  the spares.    According to the Russian media, Gen. Joshi had shown  interest  in purchasing the latest T-72 C tanks, self-propelled artillery  guns and military aircraft. However, the Indian embassy here  denied the report saying such negotiations are conducted at a  much lower bureaucratic level.</p>

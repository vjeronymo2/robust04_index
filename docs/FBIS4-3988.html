			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, April 27 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher arrived here this evening from Riyadh on a  24- hour visit to Egypt as part of his current Middle East tour.    Immediately after arrival, Christopher delivered the first  batch of police cars donated by the U.S. Government for the  Palestinian police force to Nabil Shaath [spelling of name as  received], PLO chief negotiator.    Christopher said an effective police force was essential to  making a success of Palestinian autonomy when Israel pulls out  its troops from the the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    He said the shipment of the vehicles was a tangible sign  that  the process of implementation of the peace accord will be soon  be under way.    Shaath said in taking the delivery of the U.S. gift that he  was happy to have received the the first shipment of the  automobiles, which "will make it possible for the Palestinian  police to start deploying in Gaza and Jericho."    The U.S. official is scheduled to meet Thursday with  Egyptian  President Husni Mubarak and will hold talks with his Egyptian  counterpart 'Amr Mussa on the Middle East peace process and  other international issues of common concern.    Christopher is expected to be present at a tripartite  meeting  with Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat, who is scheduled to  arrive here after midnight, and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres, who will arrive in the Egyptian capital early Thursday.    The meeting is to remove hurdles blocking the signature of a  final Palestinian-Israeli agreement on implementing Palestinian  self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.    Political observers say the mission of Christophers present  Middle East tour is to assist in resolving the delicate problems  facing Palestinian and Israeli negotiators currently meeting in  Cairo to reach a successful conclusion so 'Arafat and Israeli  Premier Yitzhaq Rabin will be able to sign a final agreement  early next month.    His second task, according to the observers, is to try to  convince Israel and the Arab parties concerned to return to the  negotiating table and resume the bilateral talks in Washington,  suspended in the wake of the Hebron massacre of February 25 by  an Israeli settler, killing some 40 of Palestinians.    Christopher is to discuss with Egypt how to make efforts to  push forward the peace process and he may call on Egypt, the  only Arab state that has diplomatic ties with Israel, to play a  more active role in resumption of the bilateral Arab-Israeli  peace talks, particularly the talks between Syria and Israel.    Before leaving Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Christopher said the  Middle East has suffered too long from bloody conflict and  repressive rule.    Now the region "has a chance to turn a new page, to put war  aside, to choose peace, to end the boycott of Israel and lay the  foundation for regional development and cooperation," he noted.</p>

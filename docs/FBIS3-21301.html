They are asking the court to  instruct the General Custodian to transfer the land to the  state, and to obligate the government's legal adviser to open an  investigation into serious irregularities in the procedures of  the tender request.    Presiding High Court of Justice Judge Theodore Or yesterday  issued a temporary injunction forbidding the carrying out of the  tender request process, including a meeting that was to be held  yesterday in the office of the General Custodian, until the  decision of the High Court of Justice on the appeal.    The appellants argue, through attorney Dany Zeydman, that  the  very decision to issue the tender request is not legal, and is  tainted by extreme lack of reasonableness. According to them,  the decision stems from extraneous considerations of preferring  the settlers in general and the 'Ateret Kohanim Yeshiva in  particular, over the good of the public. The appellants argue  further that even if the decision is found to be reasonable, the  tender request itself is defective to the extent that it becomes  a tender request in appearance only.    According to the appellants, it becomes clear from the  minutes of the deliberations of the General Custodian that the  regular attorney of the 'Ateret Kohanim Society, Eytan Geva, and  its main contributor, Ervin Moscowitz of the United States, had  already been brought into the earliest stages in the process of  the decision to issue the tender request. In this manner,  'Ateret Kohanim and those close to it were given an unequal  opportunity to learn about the land being offered for sale and  to put together their offer accordingly.    At the critical meeting where it was decided to issue the  tender request, only two days before its publication, there was  discussion of an explicit proposal of 'Ateret Kohanim, and the  representative of the General Custodian even recommended that  the proposal be accepted.    It is also asserted that the tender request itself was  issued  even though the Israel Lands Administration expressed its  agreement to receive the lands into state ownership. According  to the appellants, not only did the General Custodian ignore  this agreement, it also issued the tender request without  announcing this to the proper persons in the Administration.  <H5>  A Systematic Policy </H5>   The appellants also assert that the General Custodian issued  the tender request even though there are still no plans. This  means that the price that will be asked for the land will be  radically lower, and the proceeds from the sale will be reduced.  The General Custodian issued the tender request after he himself  acted to release this land for construction, but he abandoned  this process while it was going on.    In this regard, the appellants note that the policy of the  Israel Lands Administration is not to issue a tender request for  land that is not planned.    The appellants note that a man who was employed by 'Ateret  Kohanim as an identifier of land in the territories, for the  purpose of purchasing it, is now employed in a similar position  in the office of the General Custodian. They emphasize that the  tender request for the land in Abu Dis was published in only one  newspaper, in contradiction to the instructions of the law, and  with an extremely short period for submitting bids.    According to the appellants, such acts are actually another  link in the systematic policy of the General Custodian to  earmark in advance and illegally monies and land to settler  societies in East Jerusalem, as a committee headed by Ministry  of Justice Director-General Hayyim Klugman, which examined the  subject, has already described.    The appellants believe their suspicions were reinforced by  an  "appraisal" that was made of the value of the land in Abu Dis. A  minimum price of only approximately $66,000 was established,  which is the price a one-room apartment in Jerusalem, was  established for 33 dunams.    It also appears that the General Custodian deviated from the  statutes regarding tender requests for the sale of lands, to  which he himself is a signatory. According to these statutes,  the chairman of the tender request committee is supposed to open  the envelope that contains the appraisal of the government  appraiser, and to record it in the minutes, without bringing it  to the knowledge of the bidders.    However, not only was the appraisal known to 'Ateret  Kohanim,  but it was also not from the government appraiser, rather from  the staff officer for appraisals in the Civil Administration in  the West Bank. And this was even though the land is located in  an area where Israeli law applies, and which is not in the area  in which this appraiser specializes.</p>

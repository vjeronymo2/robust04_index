			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CNN PONDERING EVENING NEWSCAST  </P> <P> Cable News Network today said it is considering an evening newscast to compete  directly with the big three TV networks.  </P> <P> The idea under consideration calls for a newscast at 6 p.m. or 6:30 p.m. "to go  head to head with the networks," and CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw would have a  role on the program, CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said.  </P> <P> But, he said, CNN officials haven't made a final determination of whether a  frontal assault on Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather would be a good  idea.  </P> <P> The proposal calls for a half-hour, stand-alone newscast, unlike CNN's  virtually 24-hour, all-news format, in which the news is continuously updated.  </P></p>

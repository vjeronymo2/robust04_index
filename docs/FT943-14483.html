			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Observer: Brittan uber alles Sir Leon Brittan should think about changing the title of his lunchtime speech at the Policy Studies Institute in London tomorrow. Instead of 'What next for Europe?', a much more appropriate theme would be 'What next for Leon?', particularly since just a few hours later, in Brussels, EU leaders are set to choose Brittan's next boss. Everyone knows that Luxembourg's Jacques Santer is the hot favourite to take over Jacques Delors' job as president of the European Commission. He's the dark horse candidate who has made late strides after better-known candidates such as Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, Belgian premier Jean-Luc Dehaene, and Sir Leon himself were either blocked or dropped out of the race. But while the prospect of Santer's arrival in Brussels has dismayed some senior Commission officials who remember the uninspired reign of fellow Luxembourger Gaston Thorn in the early 1980s, it may not entirely displease Sir Leon, the competition commissioner. As a student of German politics, he would no doubt recall the immortal words of the Bavarian heavyweight Franz-Josef Strauss - a great power in the land even though he never rose to be chancellor of Germany: 'Es ist mir egal wer unter mir ist' (I don't care who is below me).</p>

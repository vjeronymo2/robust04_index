			<p>BFN     [Text] The Electoral Commission has said that all political  campaigning should cease forthwith. In a statement in Lilongwe,  the commission said it had received reports that some political  parties are still campaigning or are disguising themselves as  other parties. It said that all campaign activity is barred by  law at this time. It called on citizens to report observations  of campaign activity to the commission, and warned that those  who continued to campaign or to impersonate other parties are  subject to prosecution.</p>

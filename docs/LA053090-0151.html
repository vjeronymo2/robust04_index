			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NORWAY'S KING OLAV IN HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Norway's King Olav V, at 87 Europe's oldest reigning monarch, has been  hospitalized in Oslo with inflammation of the heart but is likely to leave in a  few days, spokesmen said today.  </P> <P> "The king is in no danger," his secretary, Magne Hagen, said.  </P> <P> "He will probably be out in a few days."  </P> <P> King Olav was hospitalized Tuesday night for observation of a slight  inflammation of the lining around the heart.  </P> <P> He has had a string of official engagements in recent days and attended a  commemoration in northern Norway on Monday of the 50th anniversary of the first  Allied victory of World War II.  </P> <P> A great-grandson of Britain's Queen Victoria, King Olav ascended the throne in  1957. For many Norwegians, he is a symbol of resistance to the Nazi occupation  of Norway during World War II. As crown prince, he fled to Britain in 1940.  </P></p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Trading in Banesto to resume Spain's Stock Exchange Commission said yesterday that trading in Banesto, the banking group in which the authorities intervened to impose a new management at the end of last month, would be resumed on Tuesday next week. The decision could indicate that the Bank of Spain and the leading domestic banks were near agreement on a rescue plan for the troubled group. The chairmen of the top five banks are due to meet the governor of the Bank of Spain and Banesto's acting president today - the second such meeting in the space of four days - and details of Banesto's salvage are likely to be officially disclosed on Monday. The commission said it made its decision after being informed by Banesto that its gross financing needs were Pta605bn (Dollars 4.27bn) and that, as part of the plan to recapitalise the group, the par value of Banesto's shares would be reduced from a present Pta750 to 'less than' Pta500. The rescue plan for Banesto being discussed calls for a capital increase of not more than Pta200bn to be underwritten by the leading domestic banks and held on their behalf by the Deposit Guarantee Fund, the official agency charged with salvaging bankrupt banks. Banesto is thought to have told the commission that the domestic financial sector, comprising both the private banks and the Bank of Spain, would also provide Pta285bn to acquire Banesto's non-performing loans and that Banesto would set aside all its reserves to provisions. But there is disagreement over the final figure of the capital injection, and over the burden that will be placed on Banesto's existing shareholders through a reduction in the nominal price of their shares.</p>

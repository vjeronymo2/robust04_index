			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov  told Interfax that although Pyongyang's withdrawal from the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] complicated matters,  Russia was not withdrawing its call for an international  conference on the Korean peninsula.    He said it was not Pyongyang's decision to withdraw from the  IAEA and Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that called for  sanctions. Sanctions were not introduced against a country for  this kind of decision, Panov said, because any country had the  right to join a treaty or withdraw from it.    Panov went on to say that the international community was  discontent with Pyongyang's failure to show good will and  cooperate with the IAEA. As a result, the IAEA had failed to  get a full picture of the North Korean nuclear program and had  moved to raise the issue of sanctions.    Panov said that both Russia and its partners were interested  in a negotiated solution of the problem. The Russian call for  an international conference was gaining support, he said.</p>

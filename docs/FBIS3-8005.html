			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Smajl Terzic from Maglaj] </F>   [Text] At the time of filing this report, and it is 1400  now, all the defense lines in the zone of the 7th South  Operative Group are under fierce attack, as the [Serb] aggressor  tries to capture Maglaj. The united [B-H Army and HVO, Croatian  Defense Council] units are not yielding an inch of the free  territories of Tesanj, Maglaj, Doboj, and Teslic.    At about noon today, the heaviest artillery and infantry  attack so far was repulsed in the region of (Suskova Kosa) and  Bandera. During the day an infantry attack on (Planike) was been  repelled, where our fighters inflicted heavy losses on the  enemy. Some 20 chetniks were killed, and the same number were  wounded.    In the operational zone of the 203d Glorious Motorized  Doboj-Bosnia Brigade, the aggressor has been attacking  ferociously, but to no avail. Civilian targets are coming under  continuous shelling, while sniper fire is incessant in  (Miljevac), (Bugarilovici), and (Jelovci).    We know for a fact that chetniks Rade (Subotic) and Nebojsa  Milakovic are particularly notorious for killing civilians. One  of them is responsible for killing a one-year-old child in its  mother's arms, as she was on her way from [word indistinct] to  the Tesanj war hospital.</p>

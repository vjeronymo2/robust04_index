			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 2 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The U.S. trade representative has released an  annual report on foreign trade barriers that calls on Japan to  improve the current procedures of procurement by the Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT). In response, the  Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] made clear on 1  April that it is ready to negotiate with the United States in  April, at the earliest. The NTT announced a set of measures to  revamp its current procurement procedures, including free  contracts, in response to a package of external economic  measures that the government announced on 29 March. The MOPT  expressed a willingness to negotiate with the United States with  the aim of briefing that country on the measures announced by  the NTT.    Japan and the United States have concluded an  intergovernmental agreement on NTT's procurement. An annual  review of the NTT's procurement is to be conducted in accordance  with the agreement, but the 1993 review has yet to be undertaken.</p>

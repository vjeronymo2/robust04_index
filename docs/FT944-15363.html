			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / World Trade News: GM to buy Japanese steel Kawasaki Steel has signed a contract with General Motors to supply hot and cold-rolled steel sheet for vehicle body parts and components. The contract represents a shift in GM's 'buy American' policy, which the Japanese steelmaker believes has prevented it from receiving orders from GM for 20 years. Ford terminated purchases from Kawasaki in 1991 in a 'buy American' policy, while Chrysler stopped buying from the Japanese company after Japanese steelmakers were hit by anti-dumping charges in 1992. Recent price increases by US steel companies may have been a factor behind GM's policy shift, Kawasaki said.</p>

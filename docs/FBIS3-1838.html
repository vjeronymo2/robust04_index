			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- The Credentials  Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People's  Congress (NPC) submitted a name list of nine NPC candidate  deputies to the NPC Standing Committee for deliberation today.    They have been elected by the Standing Committees of  provincial people's congresses and approved by the Credentials  Committee of the NPC Standing Committee.    The nine candidates are Zhang Rongmao and Liang Zengbiao  from  Liaoning Province, Zheng Longzhe from Jilin, Jin Nengchou from  Fujian, Li Rongqin from Shandong, Li Changchun from Henan, Wei  Jisong from Guangxi, Chen Shineng from Guizhou and Zhang Xiuming  from Xinjiang.    Chen Shineng was elected governor of Guizhou Province by the  Guizhou Provincial People's Congress last year.    The nominations will be subject to deliberation by the Sixth  Session of the NPC Standing Committee, which began today.    The new candidates are supposed to replace the deputies who  have died, resigned or been discharged from their positions.    Five deputies, Yang Lieyu, Aisin Giorro Pu Jie from Liaoning  Province, Fan Haogu from Henan Province and Gao Xianhua from  Sichuan Province, died of illness during the past year.    Aisin Giorro Pu Jie was a brother of Aisin Giorro Pu Yi,  China's last emperor.    One deputy, Wu Disheng, former mayor of Shenyang City in  Liaoning Province, died in a plane accident last year when he  was visiting Israel.    A deputy from Shandong, Jiao Zuguang, asked to resign from  the position of deputy to the NPC, and his request was approved  by the Standing Committee of the Shandong Provincial People's  Congress.    Two deputies, Wang Zhengguang from Yunnan, and Xu Xiaocheng  from Xinjiang, were deprived of their NPC deputy status for  corruption and other illegal practices.    Wang Zhengguang, former head of Wenshan Prefecture in  Yunnan,  is being investigated by the local procuratorate for taking  bribes.</p>

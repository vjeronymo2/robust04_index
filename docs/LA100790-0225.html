			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE KILL GUNMAN AT HOUSE;  </P> <P> OXNARD: AUTHORITIES REPORT THAT THE MAN POINTED A WEAPON AT THE OFFICERS.  </P> <P> Oxnard police officers shot and killed a man who had threatened a La Colonia  family Saturday evening after the man pointed a handgun at the officers, police  said.  </P> <P> Sgt. Jeff Young said several officers responded to a call that a man was drunk  and waving a gun at a Hayes Avenue residence.  </P> <P> "Several officers were talking with the woman at the front of her residence  when the man exited the house carrying a weapon in his hand," Young said. "He  was confronted by the police and then the shooting occurred."  </P> <P> The man, whom police had not identified by late Saturday, was wounded several  times in the legs and at least once in the head, Young said.  </P> <P> The sergeant said he did not know if the man, who was about 50 years old, had  fired at the officers.  </P> <P> The man died almost immediately and was taken to the Ventura County coroner's  office for an autopsy, which is scheduled for this morning, police said.  </P> <P> The shooting ended a confrontation that began when the man arrived at the Hayes  Avenue residence and began threatening the family, Young said.  </P> <P> "No one at the residence knew who he was. They'd seen him around and he knew  someone who lived there, but his acquaintance was not there at the time," Young  said.  </P> <P> "He told the lady he was going to start killing people," said a neighbor who  identified himself only as Max.  </P> <P> He said the woman and her two young children had fled to his house.  </P> <P> Police said the woman called for help about 6 p.m. and was still on the  telephone when officers arrived. Neighbors said they heard no shots until  police arrived.  </P> <P> Saul Rivas, who lives at the Angel Hotel across the street from the house,  said: "I was watching TV, and I heard like firecrackers: Boom! Boom! Boom!  Boom! About four times. When I came out the guy was already dead."  </P> <P> The shooting took place on a street dotted with two restaurants and four bars  and in a neighborhood that has one of the highest crime rates in Oxnard.  </P> <P> Several witnesses were taken to the Oxnard police station and interviewed,  police said.  </P> <P> Investigators from the coroner's and district attorney's offices responded to  the shooting. The district attorney's office investigates all shootings  involving police officers.  </P> <P> Young said there was at least one fatal shooting by an Oxnard officer last  year.  </P></p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Fabian warning of Labour rift A sharp warning that the Labour party risks relapsing into the complacency which lost it the past four general elections is issued today by the Fabian Society. Ms Glenys Thornton, the acting general secretary of the centrist Labour pressure group, says the party's unwillingness to confront change threatens to paralyse attempts to create a strategy appropriate to the 1990s rather than the 1960s or 1970s. In a hard-hitting article in the latest issue of Fabian Review, she adds that the backlash by traditionalists against the party's modernisers has provoked a dangerous outbreak of faction fighting among Labour MPs.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Tariel Abulfaz Ogly Guseynov, president of </F> the Azerigaz State Gas Company of Azerbaijan, by an unidentified  correspondent; place and date not given: "Tariel Guseynov: `To  Strictly Save Gas Everywhere and in Everything.' Tariel Abulfaz  Ogly Guseynov, President of the Azerigaz State Gas Company of  the Republic, Is Our Interlocutor"]    [Text] FROM OUR FILES. T. Guseynov has been working  in the oil and gas industries for more than 30 years now. He  began his labor activities as a fitter with the Artemeft NGDU  [Oil and Gas Production Directorate]. After serving in the army,  he graduated from the imeni M. Azizbekov Oil and Chemistry  Institute (currently, the Oil Academy). Subsequently, he worked  within various establishments for marine oil and gas production  and was director of the Azerbaijan Gas Processing Plant. For  seven years, he headed the Aztransgaz administration. He has  been president of the Azerigaz State Gas Company since September  1992. He has a son, a daughter, a grandson, and a  granddaughter.    [VYSHKA] Esteemed Tariel, you are at the very apex of the  pyramid of a complex and diverse economic unit which is one of  the pillars of the republic's economy. This pyramid has been  shaking for a long time, and the magnitude of this "fever"  strikes a strong blow at our entire lives. After all, it is hard  to even imagine Baku being left without the blue fuel....    [Guseynov] Let us not take too dim a view of the situation;  nonetheless, this is not ruled out. It is paradoxical that one  of the powerful oil and gas regions of the former Soviet empire  cannot presently provide fuel for itself. The reasons for this  are many. The disintegration of the uniform imperial structure  for the management of the most significant, strategic sectors  that had operated for decades actually paralyzed the gas sector  of Azerbaijan. The established centralized system of gas  distribution (even if greatly flawed) was destroyed, and this  affected in a most lamentable manner the economy of not just our  republic but also other states of the CIS.    Emergency measures were needed to salvage the gas industry  and use it as much as possible in the interest of a sovereign  Azerbaijan and its people. The creation of the Azerigaz State  Company by an edict of the president of the republic one and a  half years ago marked the beginning of this effort, as immense  as it is crucial.    [VYSHKA] Pardon me, but attempts to somehow gather the gas  sector under the same hand had been made in the republic  before....    [Guseynov] Certainly, attempts had been made. Beginning in  1980, I had personally pushed through projects of centralizing  the gas supply of the republic at the various levels of  authority. However, this did not advance beyond verbal approval.  Proceeding from its interests, Moscow tenaciously held all the  ropes of the gas supply in its hands. The gas sector of the  republic was an eternal stepchild: In some cases, it was merged  with other state structures, and then they would think of  something else. In a word, the sector was left without a master.  Figuratively, it was tightly bound hand and foot. As a result,  the structure of the distribution system is chaotic; it does not  comply with international standards and, most importantly, at a  great cost, which even now results in nothing but losses.    Of course, one and a half years is not a period sufficient  for bringing the sector to the level of effective development,  even more so in view of a huge "backlog" of pent-up problems.  However, is it possible to discuss any shifts at present?    Of course, there have been certain changes but they are not  of the essence. The main point is that our company which has  succeeded in creating a unified sectoral mechanism has asserted  itself. The might of Azerigaz is great: There are about 10  associations, the gas facilities of cities, main administrations  of construction, two machine-building plants, the Scientific  Research Institute of Gas Issues, and dozens of other auxiliary  enterprises and organizations. It is very important for this  huge mechanism to begin operating smoothly....    [VYSHKA] Unfortunately, this has not come about yet. At  present, reports on gas deliveries are akin to messages from the  front line. This is how you hear it: Turkmenistan has suspended  gas deliveries to Azerbaijan; plants have stopped because of a  shortage of the blue fuel; gas supply to the rayons has been  turned off.    [Guseynov] All of this is true. Putting it frankly, the gas  delivery situation is critical. The overall need of our republic  for gas comes to 16 billion cubic meters. Previously, we  received 7 billion cubic meters of gas from Russia and  Turkmenistan; Iran delivered another 3 billion cubic meters. At  present, we obtain about 6 billion cubic meters of our Azeri gas  and, in addition, we have a contract for the delivery of [number  illegible] billion cubic meters of Turkmen gas on a clearing  basis. Turkmenistan must deliver over 8 million cubic meters of  gas. [word illegible] production toward the repayment of the  debt has not been shipped from our republic so far. Only a few  days ago did the government confirm quotas for the shipment of  Azeri products; this has been recorded in a pertinent decree. We  are now taking measures to solve the existing problem although  this is not all that easy to accomplish, given that the debt for  the Turkmen gas has come to 60 million of accounting dollars  since the beginning of the year.    [VYSHKA] Apparently, the existing situation is prompting the  Azerigaz to take extreme measures.    [Guseynov] Of course, there is no other way out. Gas supply  for many rayons of the republic has been cut off. We deliver gas  at the very limit of our potential to the enterprises and  population of Baku and other large cities. At present, the most  significant task is to create reserves of the blue fuel, to pump  the gas received into underground storage facilities. We endured  the past winter with difficulty. We should now think about the  forthcoming cold season. Fuel prices are growing and by all  signs the growth of costs will continue. Therefore, one can  hardly count on an abrupt improvement in gas supply in the  immediate future.    [VYSHKA] In all of this, it should be taken into account  that  the still immense quantity of gas that is purchased at great  expense during what is wartime to us is simply lost, and at  times also stolen. At present, the issue of [lines missing in  the original], strict accounting, and the prevention of all  theft is as acute as ever. You will agree that in this respect,  the Azerigaz itself has many shortcomings.    [Guseynov] I agree. Despite the measures taken, the large  loss of gas persists. Imagine that until very recently one out  of four or five consumers in the republic was not registered.  Rampant permissiveness and arbitrariness of individual leaders  of rayons, enterprises, services, and so on have produced the  background for all types of violations in the consumption of  gas. In the last two years, a lot has been done to rectify the  situation although I will repeat that a very great loss is still  allowed to occur. We have introduced a new service within the  organization of our company--the directorate of state gas  supervision--which regularly examines the correctness of gas  consumption. I will note that in Baku alone, recent inspections  have established major violations in the consumption of gas in  Sabuninskiy, Surakhanskiy, Narimanovskiy, Khatainskiy,  Nasiminskiy, and other rayons. Unregistered enterprises and  organizations have been discovered that have been consuming gas  for a long time without paying for it. We also clarified the  picture of gas consumption in the residential sector where great  loss is also allowed to occur. We can say that in the republic  as a whole, up to 10 percent of natural gas consumers are  unregistered.    Besides, the condition of many gas mains serving farms is  lamentable; tremendous funds are needed to upgrade them. We are  now making various efforts to reduce the loss of gas; we have  tightened up monitoring in order to prevent its theft [lines  missing] to create a precise system of accounting for gas. Some  300,000 household gas meters will be manufactured for us under a  $14-million contract signed with Minimetals, the Chinese state  company. The technology of producing these meters is also being  purchased (250,000 a year), with the right to sell them to all  countries for five years. Incidentally, the first 30,000 meters  have already been delivered to Baku; at present, preparatory  work for their installation is underway, primarily in the  suburbs of the capital city. We engage in active cooperation  with Israeli companies with regard to the local production of  gas lines made of polyethylene.    Several days ago, we had yet another meeting with  representatives of the World Bank with whom we are negotiating,  by decision of the government, the allocation of credit for  upgrading the entire gas industry. We are developing a technical  and economic feasibility study on rejuvenating the gas sector of  the republic jointly with SOFREGAZ, the well-known French  company. On the whole, the signing of an agreement on the  extension of a large long-term loan at the level of our  government and the leadership of the World Bank is scheduled for  the fall of this year.    [VYSHKA] All of this is good; all of this is in the future;  of course, in the absence of rejuvenation industry will not be  placed on a developmental path. However, what is to be done  about gas, what is to be done in order not to be left without  the blue fuel?    [Guseynov] It should be saved, and saved again everywhere  and  anywhere. The government of the republic has confirmed priority  measures to save natural gas. It is necessary [lines missing] to  switch to the use of liquefied gas in rayons, villages, and  settlements, to convert enterprises on a mandatory basis to  residual fuel oil (of course, where conditions for this exist),  to introduce high punitive sanctions, and to use other measures  against the violators of gas consumption procedures. We should  dispense once and for all with the flawed practice whereby: You  provide natural gas for us, and we will settle later. Consumers  owe us more than 4 billion manats, and we just cannot collect  them. However, no sooner than we cut back gas delivery to a  debtor, complaints are lodged with all echelons.    [VYSHKA] Incidentally, recently some publications have  missed  no opportunity to let you have it--among others--without  concealing their malice.    [Guseynov] I respond to such antics by some sorry excuses  for  journalists calmly. Unfortunately, the pages of certain  newspaper publications have become a place for slandering and  abusing people, for accusations without proof against officials.  We talk to such solely through the judicial system. Something  else is alarming: Recently, attempts at undermining confidence  in the authorities and the leaders of state structures have been  growing; they are bending over backwards to promote nervousness  and get in the way of actual endeavors to overcome the crisis in  the national economy and the entire republic. This is why we  cannot relax by any means. We should undertake to skillfully  solve problems, to do everything to defeat the enemy and  strengthen and develop our native independent Azerbaijan.    [VYSHKA] Thank you for the interview.</p>

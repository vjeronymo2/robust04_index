			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DE KLERK, MANDELA URGE END OF APARTHEID AS TALKS BEGIN  </P> <P> President Frederik W. de Klerk and African National Congress leader Nelson  Mandela today urged the swift abolition of apartheid and began historic talks  aimed at ending white-minority rule.  </P> <P> The three days of meetings are to remove obstacles to full-scale negotiations  on a new constitution that would give the 28-million black majority a voice in  national affairs for the first time.  </P> <P> De Klerk and Mandela, standing on the lawn of a Dutch colonial mansion where  the talks were held, said South Africans of all races want swift change. All  political parties must work toward a peaceful solution to racial and political  divisions, they said.  </P> <P> Nearby, the pro-apartheid Conservative Party walked out of a debate in  Parliament to protest the talks. The Conservative leader, Andries Treurnicht,  said the government should not negotiate with an organization that has carried  out guerrilla attacks and still was committed to armed struggle.  </P> <P> "South African law forbids all these actions," said Treurnicht, whose party is  the main opposition in Parliament's white chamber. The tri-cameral Parliament  also has chambers for people of mixed-race and Indian descent. Blacks are  excluded.  </P></p>

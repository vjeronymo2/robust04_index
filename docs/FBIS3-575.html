			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The flag no longer flies on the roof of the former  Italian embassy in Mogadishu. It was lowered at 0718 this  morning. Five members of the "Colonel Moschin" battalion lowered  the flag -- the same five men who had raised the tricolor on 15  December 1992.    There are no more Italian troops in Mogadishu. Some  divisions remain in Jowhar, where this morning General Carmine  Fiore, the commander of the Italian contingent, will hand over  the "Italia" hospital in the town to the non-governmental  organization, InterSos. The hospital will be run by Italian and  Somali doctors.</p>

But there are already such  criticisms as "the undiluted part is too meager and it will  have no immediate effect," or "they have merely compiled  measures not adopted heretofore." While "the premier's  leadership" has been powerfully staged, aiming to bolster an  economy nearly at rock bottom, only the moves of the ministries  have been conspicuous; and a general comment is that a  "bureaucratic odor" has been wafting about even more than in the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] era.    At a press conference following the cabinet meeting for  deciding on countermeasures, Prime Minister Hosokawa explained  the coalition government's first economic measures, by gesturing  toward the panels nearby. From the prime minister's emphasizing  that "since these are measures based on a consumers' position,  they should definitely be effective," the earnest staging gave a  sense of their trying to give the impression of the premier's  leadership and the enthusiasm of a coalition government trying  to stave off any further crumbling.    As though moved by the prime minister's zeal, officials in  the Finance Ministry also had been hustling about for the past  several days developing measures, saying "We will do as you,  Prime Minister, instruct us" and watching television pictures in  the ministry of Prime Minister Hosokawa giving press conferences  here and there.    However, the Ministry of Finance for its part had not  originally intended to add any new financial measures for the  economy and had considered the present measures "adequate for  distribution of marginal profits from the strong yen and for  easing regulations." Just the middle of last month, a certain  Budget Bureau official made light of the situation, saying  "Sometimes it's nice to have a chilly summer. It's nice and  cool." Yet, with a chilly summer coming on top of the strong  yen, economic conditions have quickly turned darker. The fact of  the matter is that even Finance Ministry bureaucrats have begun  to change their expressions.    Then, Finance Ministry bureaucrats, who had been playing  second fiddle, leaped onto "giving weight to consumers," which  Prime Minister Hosokawa had put forward. They had racked their  brains over the fact that "with public works already going full  tilt, any add-ons would be useless; so then we might pull  together providing welfare measures and cultural facilities."  So, they came up with "improvement of social infrastructure on 1  trillion yen scale," which is being called the sole undiluted  part of the latest measures.    Although the prime minister's office had provided the ideas,  in actuality they were measures shaped by the Finance Ministry's  planning and staging. One economist said scathingly of them, "In  short, they have merely pulled together a budget for items other  than public works and called it giving weight to consumers. I  cannot understand at all how, overall, it stimulates the economy  to eliminate differences between roads and museums."    An aide of U.S. Treasury Under Secretary Summers, who  arrived  in Japan that same day, also was critical, saying, "It won't  contribute to economic recovery or to expansion of domestic  demand. I'm disappointed."    Yet, one can hear from a part of the Ministry of Finance the  counter-argument that, "In the LDP era, the scale was loaded up  in trillion yen units by the secret chamber negotiations of  ruling party officials; but that kind of anachronistic bubble  disposition is gone. We'd like that to get some credit."    On the other hand, as if putting "bureaucratic leadership"  into practice, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] is elated that "it has turned out as we insisted." The  "need for financial moves also among the economic measures"  which MITI had called for since the summer has been chieved. It  is also elated because of the land supervision system being  eased, as MITI Minister Kumagai had earnestly hoped, even though  it was worked in by indirect phrasing. A former MITI bureaucrat,  too, the MITI minister "had the experience of being shouted at"  as an underling of parliamentary vice minister Kumano. Hence, it  is held that their relationship is not harmonious. But, he says,  "We've become good friends" with this opportunity; and he  chuckles endlessly at this unexpected by-product.    Yet, a National Land Agency official, who had opposed easing  the land supervision system, says angrily, "I fear that land  prices, which had finally settled down, will climb again. Does  Mr. Kumagai understand the feelings of consumers?" This could be  called an internal spat among officials; but its substance took  a form long desired by the real estate industry; and while they  speak of giving importance to consumers, that may be called the  part where the risk of its being void of content bursts forth.    Unanimously, LDP officials now out of power offer  criticisms: "To begin with, it was former Economic Planning  Agency Director Funada, who yielded to the ruling coalition  parties, made a rock-bottom proclamation, misreading the  economy. Nevertheless, we cannot forgive such things as "taking  measures because of the legacy of the former regime's defeat,"  and "Although the yen rose sharply from foreign investors taking  advantage of us because the oalition regime is irresolute, it  has no concrete measures against the strong yen."    While called a coalition regime, until just recently its  major cabinet officers were all members of the LDP. It appears  that the idea is circulating as an undercurrent in the LDP that  just because they left the party "does not mean they can  immediately bring out a sense of freshness."    On the other hand, from Finance Ministry bureaucrats who saw  things go as they had wanted, one hears it said, "At first we  worried a bit, but he's a pretty good prime minister, isn't he.  He's quite easy to deal with." It seems all but unmistakable  that, turned around, this "easy to deal with," means "easy to  control."</p>

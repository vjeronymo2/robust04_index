			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (6): Strong yen's winners and losers - Corporate Earnings Until now, many ordinary Japanese have taken pride in the rising value of the yen as a sign of national strength, even though it could only be appreciated when they travelled abroad, buying cheaper handbags in Paris and extra cans of Fortnum and Mason tea in London. However, this perception has shifted drastically as the sharp rise in the yen this year has eroded corporate profits and accelerated an exodus of manufacturing from Japan, raising fears of job security and declines in workers' real income. After fluctuating around the Y125 to the dollar level during January this year, the yen rose to Y105 in June, and has remained around that level ever since. The Japanese manufacturing sector's high reliance on exports is damaging the economy, due to lower sales and profits from the sharp rise in the yen. Benefits from the stronger yen have been small because of low import levels - and sluggish demand. According to Nomura Research Institute, research arm of Nomura Securities, the higher yen caused losses of Y45.2bn and profits of Y3.3bn during the first quarter of 1993, while the second quarter saw losses of Y925.3bn and profits of Y350.8bn. NRI estimates that if the yen rate remains at about Y105 to the dollar in the second half of 1993, annual exchange losses incurred by exporters would total about Y4,000bn, while importers are expected to make about Y3,000bn in exchange gains for the full year, generating a net loss of Y1,000bn. Earnings by export-oriented industries, especially electronics, cars, textiles and shipping, have been hit. Beneficiaries of the higher yen have been limited to power utility companies and some oil refiners, which rely on fuel imports. Foods and paper and pulp companies also import materials, but lower demand due to the prolonged economic slump have overshadowed the gains. Although the export ratio of consumer electronics companies has fallen sharply during the past six to seven years, the ratio remains high, averaging 41.5 per cent last year. Companies in this sector which centre business on audio visual-related machines generated 60.1 per cent of their sales overseas. A Y1 rise against the dollar is said to cause losses of Y5bn at Sony and Y2bn at Matsushita Electric Industrial. Sony which posts 65 per cent of its sales overseas, suffered a 53 per cent fall in parent pre-tax profits for the first half to September. Overall sales fell 11 per cent to Y852.6bn as the yen's rise cost the company Y74bn in sales. The export ratio of six leading carmakers average around 51 per cent. According to Wako Research Institute, a rise of Y1 against the dollar would cause a 10.6 per cent fall in pre-tax profits. Nissan Motor, which posted pre-tax losses for the first half, has warned that it will not make a profit for the full year to March. During the first half, the impact of the yen's rise amounted to Y100bn. Some Y50bn was absorbed through forward exchange dealing and price rises, and the net impact on sales totalled Y50bn. The high yen led to the 'Finland shock' in the shipbuilding industry earlier this year, when Kvaerner Masa of Finland captured an order from Abu Dhabi to supply tankers. The high yen is eroding the competitiveness of Japanese shipbuilders and a fall in prices based in dollars, due to increased competition, has led to sharp declines in yen-based profit margins. According to brokers James Capel in Tokyo, during the six months to September, gross tonnage of approved new buildings increased by 6.5 per cent, but the total value of the orders declined by 18.9 per cent. The high yen has cut into exports of the textile and chemicals sector while leading to increased import penetration. Inventories of polyester filament at textile makers have risen due to the increase in cheaper imports from south-east Asia and the fall in exports. In the chemicals industry, net exports of resins were down by 31 per cent during the first six months of this year. On the other hand, Japan imported 3.8 times as much high-density polyethylene, accounting for almost 4 per cent of domestic demand, up 3 percentage points. Meanwhile the higher yen lowered imported fuel and material costs for several industries. The gas companies saw a jump in interim profits thanks to a fall in fuel costs and a rise in demand for gas due to an unusually cold summer. However, gas and electric power companies have been ordered to pass on profits from the higher yen, and are expected to pass a total of Y265bn to the consumer this year by lowering rates. Tokyo Gas saw interim pre-tax profits surge 211.2 per cent to Y14.4bn, thanks to higher demand and lower costs. The company saw fuel costs fall 3.8 per cent to Y54.8bn on lower fuel prices and a higher yen. However, it forecasts a 2 per cent fall in full-year pre-tax profits to Y35bn, due to the lowering of gas rates. Although the higher yen reduced costs at electric power companies, a fall in demand amid the economic slump and the cold summer hurt profits. Tokyo Electric Power posted a decline in interim sales and profits for the first time in five years. Electricity rate cuts are expected to reduce the company's income by Y36bn for the year to March next year.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Looking forward to the end of the price war  -The Herald's postponed float Shockwaves from the newspaper price war have extended far beyond Fleet Street. For The Herald, the Glasgow-based morning paper, the resultant loss of sales has helped postpone its stock exchange flotation, which was expected to take place in mid-1995. Caledonian Publishing, the paper's owner, badly wants to escape the treadmill of heavy interest payments on the debt taken on when management bought the business from Lonrho in May 1992. Lonrho sold George Outram, as it was then called, for Pounds 74m in a deal organised by the merchant bank Robert Fleming, the lead investor. The company had to raise a further Pounds 20m for working capital and to buy the newspaper presses, which had been leased. Though costly, the MBO was a cause for celebration in Scotland. A new Scottish company had been born and The Herald had escaped the clutches of an owner which did little to strengthen the business. But the past two and a half years have not been as successful as the buy-out team - led by Mr Liam Kane, chief executive - had hoped. The Herald, founded in 1783, is one of Scotland's two quality dailies, mainly serving Glasgow and the west of Scotland. It is more cheerful and broad-minded than The Scotsman, whose heartland is around its Edinburgh base and whose circulation is more than 80,000 compared with The Herald's current 111,000. Caledonian Publishing also owns the Evening Times, the Glasgow evening paper, and a number of magazines, including the Scottish Farmer. Its turnover last year was Pounds 59m. After the buy-out Mr Kane, a former News International executive, embarked on strengthening the two newspapers and reducing their operating costs. The company invested Pounds 2m in on-screen page make-up and in introducing new sections to The Herald, devoted to business, homes and gardens, jobs, property and sport. The Evening Times launched a weekend newspaper. A series of cut-backs in the advertising, circulation and production departments have reduced staff numbers in the group from 1,045 at the time of the MBO, incurring exceptional costs of Pounds 11m. By the end of this year the headcount will have fallen to 813. Yet The Herald's circulation has never regained the peak of 125,000 reached in February 1992. The newspaper dropped 'Glasgow' from its title but any benefit to sales was cancelled out by economic gloom. Average circulation in the financial year to September 1993 was 115,000 (compared with the previous year's 119,500). Despite expensive TV advertising, The Herald has not made as much progress as it had hoped outside Strathclyde region, where sales now stand at about 30,000, 'Economic recovery is under way now but it is led by manufacturing rather than consumption,' said Mr Kane. Caledonian Publishing's operating profit fell from Pounds 10m in 1992-93 to Pounds 8m in 1993-94, with a drop in operating margin from 17 to 14 per cent. In July Mr Kane told staff: 'Despite a lot of work in reducing costs, we are still hugely uncompetitive compared with the newspaper groups we face in the daily battle for readers and advertisers.' He launched a further programme of cost cutting and redundancies, this time biting into The Herald's editorial department, and trimmed a staff pay rise. Caledonian Publishing also had to go back to its banking syndicate, led by the Royal Bank of Scotland, to borrow a further Pounds 5m. Although it has repaid Pounds 5.5m of the Pounds 43m it took on in 1992, it faced having to defer repayment of Pounds 2m because of its inadequate profit performance, and took on another Pounds 3m to cover further redundancies and other costs. That means interest payments, which had declined from Pounds 6m in 1992-93 to Pounds 5.3m in 1993-94, will rise to about Pounds 5.6m this year. The price war has only aggravated matters. Mr Kane says the cut in the price of The Times last year to 30p did not make much difference to The Herald; but this June the Daily Telegraph cut its price from 50p to 30p, followed by a further price cut by The Times and a cut by The Independent. Though the bulk of the circulation of The Herald is protected because most of its readers buy it for its Scottish coverage, the price war reduced the paper's sales by 2 per cent this summer. A cut in the The Herald's cover price was out of the question. However, the largest single effect of the price war, says Mr Ron MacDonald, Caledonian Publishing's finance director, has been to reduce the price/earnings ratios of newspapers on the stock exchange. 'Until there is a change of sentiment regarding national newspapers as well as regionals, then the Caledonian float can wait,' he says. It is projecting pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.8m for the current year and Mr Kane says there has recently been some improvement in advertising. A float next year, he says, is 'still a possibility'. A flotation would have other benefits for The Herald. 'I'm still waiting for them to deliver the product I know they are capable of, but don't seem to have the finance to achieve,' says Ms Christine Tulloch, media director of Faulds Advertising, one of Scotland's leading agencies.</p>

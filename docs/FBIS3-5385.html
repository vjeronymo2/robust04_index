			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In the wake of the recent Japan-U.S. summit  breakdown over new economic cosultations, ASAHI SHIMBUN  conducted a nation-wide opinion survey 27-28 February to  determine what the public thought of Japan-U.S. relations. The  results of the survey show those who thought current Japan-U.S.  relations as "going well" plunged to 20 percent from 37 percent  only two months ago. Those who thought the relations are "not  going well" rose sharply to 64 percent from 42 percent, thus  giving the worst evaluation on the relations since 1982 when the  first such survey was conducted.    Views on the future of the Japan-U.S. relations have also  become more pessimistic. Only 16 percent of the pollees said  they thought the relations would "go in a favorable direction,"  and this percentage is way below the 26 percent in the previous  poll which was also the highest in the history of this survey.  On the other hand, views given on the position of the Japanese  Government which rejected the U.S. demands at the summit, broke  down to 20 percent saying "it was only natural," 57 percent  saying "it was unavoidable," and 12 percent saying "it was well  done."    After the new economic consultations broke down, the United  States stepped up its offensive against Japan, for instance, by  charging that Japan's cellular phone market is closed. As if  reacting to such a U.S. move, those who thought "the current  Japan-U.S. relations to not be going well" far surpassed the  previous highest rate of 47 percent shown at the time of the  survey in December 1992, thus suggesting that the public views  the situation as serious.    The percentage of those who gave positve views on the  relations as "going well" dropped substantially, in particular  among people over 50. Broken down by occupation, more white  collar workers and those in the farming, forestry and fisheries  industries were found to be departing from their earlier  positive views. Broken down by political party background,  those who have turned pessimstic were conspicuous among  supporters of the Liberal Democratic Party, Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party], the Democratic Socialist Party and Shinto  Sakigake [Harbinger Party].    On the outlook for future Japan-U.S. relations, 23 percent  said they thought relations will "head in a bad direction, and  51 percent said they thought "there will be no change." This 23  percent predicting a" bad direction" is comparable to the record  worst 24 percent shown in the December 1992 survey which was  conducted shortly after Bill Clinton was elected President.    More older people and men thought the Japanese Government's  position at the new economic consultations was "natural" than  did younger people and women. Twenty-five percent of male  respondents against 16 percent of female respondents said they  agreed with the government's position.</p>

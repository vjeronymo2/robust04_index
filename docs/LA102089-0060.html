			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> HEED NICARAGUA LESSON, SALVADORANS TOLD  </P> <P> When Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez met this week with the  antagonists in El Salvador's civil war, he urged them to look to Nicaragua for  lessons in how to make peace.  </P> <P> "In Nicaragua, nobody asks any more how many died in the latest battle," Arias  said. "They ask how the election campaign is going."  </P> <P> As enemies in Nicaragua turn from bullets to ballots, the rightist government  and Marxist rebels of El Salvador have launched their own effort to end Latin  America's most intense conflict, a 10-year war that has cost an estimated  70,000 lives.  </P> <P> But the peculiarities of the Salvadoran war make it more intractable than the  fading Nicaraguan war between the Sandinista government and U.S.-backed  Contras.  </P> <P> The Salvadoran government and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front  agreed Sept. 15 in Mexico City to try to make peace "by political means in the  shortest time possible" through monthly negotiations.  </P> <P> Their first round of substantive talks, however, reached an impasse here  Wednesday. In three days, they agreed on nothing but to meet again in November.  </P> <P> In some ways, the Salvadoran talks mirror those the Sandinistas and Contras  held in late 1987 and early 1988. While battle fatigue pushed the contenders to  the table, diplomacy has worked against the guerrilla side in both countries.  </P> <P> Poles apart in ideology, the FMLN rebels and the Contras ended up in the same  bind -- both facing a government bolstered by the 1987 Central American peace  agreement that aims to end rebel insurgencies.  </P> <P> Within the limits of that five-nation accord, which brought Arias a Nobel Peace  Prize, both rebel groups were obliged to recognize a regime they had fought to  overthrow and to negotiate for little more than equal rights in a freer  political system.  </P> <P> In Nicaragua, peace talks broke down in June, 1988, but not before producing an  informal truce that still holds. With the Contras weakened by a cutoff of U.S.  military aid, the Sandinistas drove most of them into Honduras, then won a  regional pact for the rebels' disarmament in exchange for early elections, set  for Feb. 25.  </P> <P> Nobody expects a quick settlement in El Salvador. But Arias and other optimists  dare to predict that the ebbing tide of East-West conflict makes one  inevitable.  </P> <P> Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani has proposed an immediate cease-fire;  just as the Contras reacted to a similar Sandinista offer two years ago, the  FMLN rejects it.  </P> <P> The guerrillas say Cristiani is maneuvering politically to undermine them  without making real concessions. As a prelude to a cease-fire, they demand  fundamental reform of the constitution, the political system, the judiciary and  the military.  </P> <P> A Costa Rican official involved in both peace efforts said that sooner or later  the FMLN will have to accept a cease-fire with few conditions, at least as a  basis for further talks.  </P> <P> "If not, they risk losing their credibility," he said. Recalling that the  Contras "ceased to be a legitimate force" after breaking off their talks last  year, he added that "the same thing could happen to the FMLN."  </P> <P> The official said Arias privately pressed this view on the guerrillas, holding  up the Nicaraguan cease-fire -- the so-called Sapoa agreement of March, 1988 --  as a model.  </P> <P> FMLN leaders have listened to Arias with quiet dismay, rejecting his premise  that the two conflicts can be treated equally.  </P> <P> In their view, the FMLN is strong enough militarily to win concessions in  return for a cease-fire, while the Contras were defeated on the battlefield.  </P> <P> "Sapoa is a dirty word for the FMLN," rebel spokesman Arnoldo Ramos said. "It  implies symmetry between our forces, which are self-sufficient, and the  Contras, which are a mercenary army of the United States."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Two laid-off instructors at the TVA Power Operations Training Center at the  Sequoyah Nuclear Plant near Chattanooga, Tenn., said they reported cheating on  crucial examinations given to nuclear employees. Bill North, 41, and Jackie L.  Shields, 48, both veteran TVA employees until last month, said they have asked  a judge with the U.S. Merit System Protection Board to arbitrate their case.  The former academic training coordinators said they will tell the judge about  TVA workers they say cheated, some more than once, on written tests required by  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. An NRC spokesman said the charges are  serious and an investigation may begin today, the Chattanooga News-Free Press  reported.  </P></p>

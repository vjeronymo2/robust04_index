			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Mail order boost for Farepak FAREPAK, the USM-traded mail order distributor and food processor, reported pre-tax profits up 31 per cent, from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 4.84m, on turnover ahead 35 per cent to Pounds 62.8m for the year to April 30. Turnover for the mail order business, responsible for the bulk of pre-tax profits, rose by 23 per cent; the division's pre-tax contribution increased 44 per cent. However, the small travel operation saw pre-tax profits down to Pounds 23,000 (Pounds 102,000) while food processing declined from Pounds 647,000 to Pounds 566,000. Earnings per share improved 29 per cent to 14.3p (11.1p) and a recommended final dividend of 3.55p brings the total to 5p (3.87p). The net cash balance rose to Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 4.68m). Mr Christopher Hulland, finance director, said the improved performance was largely attributable to a widening of the network of its Christmas hamper selling agents, up 10,000 to 50,000. Farepak runs its hamper selling business as a joint venture with Fine Art Developments.</p>

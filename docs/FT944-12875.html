			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / International Press Review: Moscow tries to see the news in the oil leak - Russia In the daily Rabochaya Tribuna of last Wednesday, an item appeared in the front page brief news section, 'In one paragraph'. The headline read: 'Ecological catastrophe in northern Russia - and it seems it worries the Americans more than us'. The story, citing the Voice of America radio station, said: 'American officials say that, in a region of the Arctic round the town of Usinsk, a pipeline has ruptured, causing the largest oil spill in history. American representatives in Washington, quoting information coming from Russia, say that 2m barrels of oil has been spilled. The US deputy energy secretary says that the spill is an ecological catastrophe.' This says a great deal about coverage of the Usinsk oil spill, about the attitude of the press - and of official and civil society - to the incident, and about the state of ecological awareness in Russia. It also says much about the majority Russian view of the world as one eco-system. For, with few exceptions, the Russian press covered the incident if at all through the industry and government sources cited in last Tuesday's New York Times, which broke the story. Only two leading newspapers, Izvestiya and Sevodnya, gave it wide coverage - though limited largely to news written in Moscow, not on-the-spot reports or analysis. By the end of the week, a Russian wire service was quoting the head of the company responsible for the spill as blaming western interests for blowing up the story for commercial gain. Yet the facts - the spill, the declaration of an emergency situation in the region and vast natural damage - were known to and published in newspapers in the Komi republic weeks before the Times story. The region's Krasnoe Znamya (Red Banner) of September 15 ran a splash headline: 'Pipeline of Trouble - Usinsk region has become an area of ecological disaster'. The story gave details of streams running with oil and roads covered with lakes of oil. It ended with the observation: 'We don't just have a state of emergency here: we have an ecological catastrophe.' The story - which the paper followed up throughout October - did not appear in the central press, nor on all-Russia TV. Not because of censorship - but because it was not seen to have more than local importance. Western journalists who travelled to the inaccessible region to cover the story last week were met with hostility mixed with genuine bewilderment: Why come all this way to cover as common a thing as an oil leak, and what has it to do with you? Izvestiya, the best of the central dailies, did best by the story. It ran a splash headline last Wednesday: 'Why should Americans be more concerned about an oil spill in the tundra than Russia?' It slammed the Komi oil company for attempting to conceal the whole affair, saying it was a 'saddening circumstance' that the alarm was raised by the Americans and that a government commission was formed only after US Vice President Al Gore offered assistance. The daily Sevodnya made the story its second front page lead - noting in an editorial comment with the story: 'It's understandable and, alas, all too common that information on our ecological disaster should again come from the west.' But by the end of last week an explanation emerged for the western concern: it was driven by the profit motive. Interfax news agency, quoting 'experts of Moscow's leading broker and investment companies', said the news had clipped between Dollars 1 and Dollars 2 off the shares of the Komi Oil company. 'Komi Oil director General Valentin Leonidov told a shareholders' meeting on Friday that the campaign on the pipeline accident was carried out in the interests of those who want to buy Komi Oil for a song,' it said.</p>

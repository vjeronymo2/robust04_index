			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleko Aslanishvili and Odik Kukhilava under the </F> rubric "Report From the Emergency Zone": "The Sun Is Peeking  Through"]    [Text] 1. "I'M NOT AFRAID TO GO INTO ANY  VILLAGE"A    For the philistine, the "trouble in Mingrelia" is not over.  The philistine looks suspiciously at the man just in from  Zugdidi or Tsalendzhikha and tries a "shrewd" guess: "Are there  still roadblocks on the highways?" "Are people walking freely in  the streets?" The philistine wants to know the truth, but he's  still suspicious; for him, the truth is bounded by his own  narrow vision. For him, therefore, the question that is on  everyone's lips, "What's happening in Mingrelia?", still carries  political import.    Well, then, we will start by answering that question: What's  happening in Mingrelia now is, in general, what's happening all  over Georgia. There's hope and there's hopelessness; people are  fearful of the morrow, people are tired of the uncertainty,  people want work and quiet, people are less agitated about  politics, and, to tell the truth, they couldn't care less about  a lot of things that, we think, people here in Tbilisi worry  about....    If there is anything that greatly stirs the emotions in  Zugdidi these days, it is the adversities of the Abkhazian war  and the refugee problem, because both matters are terribly close  to them. These are probably the main concerns, although a city  and rayon that are on the front lines have plenty of other  problems too.    Nevertheless, what is probably of most concern to readers is  the present political confrontation and crime situation in the  region. We have already partially mentioned this in general, but  now we will elaborate.    This lovely city is in dire straits. Everywhere you look  there are burnt-out buildings. The streets are thronged with  people--refugees who have nothing to do or anyplace to go, and  so they kill time talking to each other, grasping at straws,  fine-combing a thousand times through any bit of news in the  desperate hope of a tangible chance to return to Abkhazia.    A brief digression: Last year (and the year before  last) were really difficult and extraordinary times for Zugdidi  and its people. Between January 1992 and November 1993, about 30  buildings burned down--the Inguri Pulp and Paper Combine's  Egrisi Hotel, the Odishi Hotel, the military commissariat, the  city internal affairs department, the environmental protection  building, municipal services buildings, the Tutarchela shopping  center, the trade administration warehouse, School No 8, the  main building of the boarding school.... The television tower  was blown up, and dozens of industrial, agricultural,  educational, cultural, consumer service, and other structures  were trashed. The machine building plant has been looted (copper  components have been removed from costly program-control  machines, and a third of the equipment cannot be restored. The  Music and Choreography Society's enterprise has been stripped  clean, the Meat Combine is now nothing but a shell; everything  else has simply been looted. The damage done by fires alone is  estimated at over 60 billion rubles. That's just the estimate!  But there is no way to calculate in rubles the spiritual and  physical trauma suffered by society, or the lives of 130  Zugdidians sacrificed in the confrontation of brothers "on both  sides."    Colonel Pridon Adamia, chief of the Zugdidi Internal  Affairs Administration, has this to say: I was appointed to  this position last year, on 6 November. Before that, I served as  Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister of Abkhazia. We had to fight our  way out of Sukhumi, which was surrounded. I know Zugdidi very  well; 20 years ago I served as its chief of militia. I almost  got killed twice here last year in attacks by the ex-President's  followers. First near Ingiri, and another time near Tsaishi,  where I had come on business from Abkhazia, they caught me and  were going to shoot me. When the Head of State appointed me and  rayon head Edisher Chargazia, he said "You with your wise gray  head and experience, and Edisher with his youthful energy and  enthusiasm, will complement one another, and I hope we will soon  return Zugdidi to normalcy." We gave him our word and are doing  everything we can to keep it.    Now about your question: The "Mingrelian resistance" is a  myth, a concocted story designed to aid their side, and they  even managed to convince some segments of the public, or rather  they convinced themselves. There was no "Mingrelian resistance."  What was happening here was absolutely unacceptable to 80  percent of the region's population. Eighty percent! What  happened was that the ex-President's followers brought all their  supporters together in Zugdidi, from all over the republic,  where they indulged in violence and lawlessness, senseless  sabotage and terror, which the law enforcement agencies, manned  by weak and unprincipled cadres, could not cope with. Zugdidi  and some neighboring rayons were virtually cut off from the rest  of the republic. The public at large, its leaders, and--most  important--the basic nucleus of the urban and rural  intelligentsia, were afraid and downhearted. Hence, Mingrelia  had nothing to do with it. The pace of stabilization that is  underway in the region now will convince you of this.    Until November 1993, when government troops entered Zugdidi  and took control of the situation, the police were attacked  repeatedly, resulting in the building being burned down and  destroyed, officers being killed, and almost all weapons,  equipment, and vehicles being stolen. The police were only  guarding certain special and vital objects such as banks, the  bakery combine, the milling combine, and the museum. In order to  reinvigorate the Internal Affairs Administration, we reorganized  the personnel. We discharged over 50 officers and demoted over  20. City and rayon departments were set up in the city's and  rayon's territory. We recently added 100 staff slots. We are  creating subdepartments in Narazeni, Darcheli, Tsaishi, Zeda  Etseri, and Kuleshkari, which will enable us to deal more  promptly and efficiently with crime and maintain closer contacts  with the public.    Today there is not a single armed supporter of the  ex-President hiding in the woods of Zugdidskiy Rayon. We have  brought them over to our side (about 500 men!); today they are  wielding hoes or have been formed into official military  outfits. A number of them have left the rayon. They voluntarily  turned in about 500 automatic weapons (not to mention  confiscated heavy equipment and lots and lots of shells and  cartridges), and we are not prosecuting them. Forty men whose  weapons we had to take by force are being prosecuted.    These days I'm not afraid to go into any village. By this I  mean, there are no more organized armed political opponents. On  the other hand, the crime situation is very bad. For one thing,  there are about 80,000 refugees in the city and rayon. Many  low-lifes and criminal elements came with them, and they are  continuing to engage in banditry and make trouble. For another  thing, besides the police there are eight different armed  formations in Zugdidi, and they do not obey one another--namely,  Sukhumi, Ochamchire, Gali, and Zugdidi internal troop units, and  Gali and Zugdidi Mkhedrioni units.... Eight different military  units! Many of these fighters are obviously undisciplined, and  some of them have been in jail three or four times. Moreover,  the Abkhazian Military Police, headed by Colonel Temur Khazalia,  which is supposed to be keeping order among them, is defending  the temporary border on the Inguri--besides the fact that  Abkhazian boyeviki [guerrillas] and their mercenaries have been  attacking peaceful villages and engaging in criminal activities,  stealing property and kidnapping people. We have caught many  criminal gangs. Unfortunately, they include many military  men.... [end of Adamia quote]    Batoni Pridon Adamia told us that recently he had punished  one officer because two of the man's cartridges were missing. He  said it off-hand, while he was talking about strengthening  discipline in the police administration, but that nuance caused  us to draw a parallel several times when we heard confused  gunfire in the city. One time we happened upon the boys of the  "Gali Battalion" expending probably a couple of hundred  cartridges on some bottles for target practice, just for fun.  Another time, a warning shot by one "quick-on-the-trigger"  officer of the property protection administration startled us  right downtown. A third time, some unit's brave lads broke in on  a gathering of refugees who were upset over a tasteless  statement by Butros Butros-Ghali in the UN Security Council on  21 March, acted like bullies and shot up the place.    This is just to illustrate that whenever the peace is  disrupted in the city, it is generally due to the creative  efforts of those numerous armed formations or news of the  enemy's fresh attacks on villages across the Inguri, which are  administratively part of Zugdidskiy Rayon.    Nevertheless, life goes on relatively normally in this  front-line city and rayon.    The number one task today is to improve the region's economy  and boost agriculture.    Agroindustrial Association Chairman Vazha Pipia has  this to say: Our rayon's agrarian sector includes 25  kolkhozes, 10 social-sector farms, 10 inter-farm enterprises,  two agrocombines and five agrofirms and joint-stock companies.    Last year left us a poor legacy. Instead of the planned  40,000 tonnes of tea leaf, only 9,400 were picked. Lack of  control, disorganized labor and lack of discipline have brought  it about that the tea plantations have not been tended properly,  the necessary measures have not been carried out, 85 percent of  the nut plantations have been appropriated by the people under  the pretext of privatization, and the rest are in ruins and  unfenced. Because of failure to carry out cropping operations  properly, tung, bayleaf, mulberry, and other perennial plantings  have declined. Things are critical in the livestock sector: only  six social-sector farms still have a livestock section complex,  and the cattle population is low. A lot of agricultural  machinery and tools have been stolen or wrecked.    Everything needs to be repaired and restored. Even though we  suffer from a chronic shortage of fuel (at this stage we need at  least 200 tonnes of diesel and 30 tonnes of gasoline for spring  operations, but so far we have only received 30 tonnes of  diesel), somehow or other the pruning and shaping of the tea  plantations is going smoothly, also laochay procurement. About  200 tonnes of laochay have already been procured, and we could  have boosted that to 1,000 tonnes if it weren't for the lack of  fuel. We have customers for it too, who will pay in dollars. But  instead of procuring it we're letting it rot in the ground. We  also have an experimental tea pressing factory to make brick tea.    So far we haven't received any kind of mineral fertilizer.  But we took 800 tonnes of phosphorous and potassium fertilizer  left over from last year and applied them to the soil.    The power shortage is making it hard for us to prepare the  tea factories for the season. The factories still have 150  tonnes of half-finished goods that have not been sorted.    There is another problem that has us worried--we are afraid  that the skyrocketing price of fuel and energy is going to make  our tea industry unprofitable. According to preliminary  estimates, a kilogram of packaged tea is now worth as much as  3,000 Russian rubles, but in barter exchange our tea is not  worth more than 1,500 rubles. The government ought to take a  protectionist attitude toward agriculture.    The value of tea leaf has yet to be settled. Presumably,  5,000 coupons for hand-picked tea. The controversy goes on. The  peasant demands either Russian money or goods in kind.    This year we rectified one of last year's injustices: the  tea  factories made a lot of unearned profit by buying tea leaf  cheaply from the social-sector farms (or, more accurately, at  the current prices then), processing it, and then selling it  dearly (the prices suddenly shot up), leaving the farms with the  short end of the stick. Therefore, we made the factories give  half their profits from last year back to the farms. This money  will be used to save the plantations. In the past two or three  years not a single gram of tea leaf has been picked on 45  percent of our plantations--2,400 hectares (more accurately,  followers of the ex-President wouldn't let it be picked)--and  the plantations reverted to the wild.    There are 15 state-owned and 14 cooperative mini-factories  in  Zugdidskiy Rayon. These mini-factories have caused us no little  trouble. They are currently being reregistered and relicensed,  this in order to determine the legality of the sources of their  tea leaf, allocation and construction of facilities, and  compliance with technological specifications. As for the  family-owned shops (there used to be more than 150 of them in  the rayon), the Board has banned them. This is because they were  not complying with the specifications of tea leaf processing,  and because they were operating basically on stolen materials  and electricity. [end of Pipia quote]    Other qualitative changes are taking place in Zugdidi.  People  are in favor of retaining the social-sector farms. The Board's  course of action is to create Agro Associations and  Agrocombines. Integration is underway. Where farms and tea  factories were once separate, they are now being joined in the  form of combines; otherwise, the farms would inevitably go  bankrupt, and that would be a heavy burden on the working man.  The idea of creating agrofirms and agrocombines was necessitated  by this injustice.    The first agrocombine was created in Ingiri in 1986. Now  tested in practice, the experiment is being adopted widely.  Already created this year are the Zeda Etseri Agrocombine, the  Rukhi Commercial Production Agrofirm, the Narazeni Agrofirm, and  the Akhalsopeli Joint-Stock Company. So far, all the kolkhozes  and farms have been preserved.    It briefly rained that day in Zugdidi. What happened was, it  suddenly clouded over, the way it does in coastal areas, but it  didn't turn into a downpour. Soon the sky cleared again and the  sun peeked through, just as sunshine is beginning to appear in  all spheres of the life of Zugdidi. But that is a subject for  future articles.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / EC goods proposal approved by ministers A European Commission proposal to crack down on the sale of counterfeit goods from non-EU countries was approved by ministers in Luxembourg yesterday. It will increase the power of customs authorities to stop fake goods entering the EU, writes Emma Tucker. Under customs procedures introduced in the Union four years ago, a trademark owner can obtain a temporary 'freeze' on the import of a consignment of counterfeit goods and can then take legal action. The new proposal will allow customs authorities themselves to decide whether an application from a trademark holder is valid. It also extends the scope of the legislation to cover pirated goods and design rights.</p>

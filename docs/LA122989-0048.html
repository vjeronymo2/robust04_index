			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DUBCEK WINS KEY CZECH POST AFTER 2 DECADES  </P> <P> Alexander Dubcek, the champion of the Prague Spring reforms, triumphantly  returned to power Thursday as the Speaker of Parliament after two decades in  forced obscurity.  </P> <P> "This is a moral satisfaction to the hundreds of thousands of people who have  upheld the ideals" of political pluralism and individual freedom, Dubcek told  lawmakers after he was unanimously elected by the 269 deputies present.  </P> <P> The televised vote by the Communist-dominated 350-member Federal Assembly for a  man ousted and banished by authorities would have been unimaginable just two  months ago.  </P> <P> Dubcek's political renaissance is just the latest in a series of historic  political victories for Czechoslovakia's pro-democracy movement. Since  mid-November, it has ousted the hard-line Communist leadership and installed a  reform government dominated by non-Communists.  </P> <P> Czechoslovakia's changes have come amid democratic reforms in Poland, Hungary,  East Germany, Bulgaria and Romania this year.  </P> <P> Today, the Parliament is to meet at Prague's Hradcany Castle to elect  playwright and opposition leader Vaclav Havel as president. Havel is to be  inaugurated immediately after the vote.  </P> <P> Deputies voted Thursday to amend the presidential oath to be taken by Havel to  eliminate the pledge of allegiance to socialism.  </P> <P> In his acceptance speech before Parliament, Dubcek praised the peaceful  revolution as a continuation of the reforms that began in 1968 and were crushed  by a Soviet-led invasion.  </P> <P> "The deep changes in society . . . have resulted in my return to responsible  work in the highest legislative body in the land," Dubcek said. "The autumn of  1989 developed the ideals of the Prague Spring of 1968 and inspires our nation  today toward new creative actions."  </P> <P> After the Soviet-led invasion, Dubcek was ousted as Communist Party chief,  expelled from the party and sent to work as a forestry manager in Bratislava  where he was kept under police surveillance. Although renowned abroad, he was  excluded from the state-controlled media in Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> He recaptured the spotlight Nov. 24, speaking to 250,000 pro-democracy  demonstrators on Prague's Wenceslas Square.  </P> <P> Next to Havel, Dubcek is the second most powerful symbol of reform in  Czechoslovakia and is the favorite son in his native Slovakia.  </P> <P> Dubcek's role in the new government was decided during intense negotiations  between the opposition, representatives of the Communist Party and members of  smaller parties and political groups. The talks also produced a list of new  deputies to replace 23 hard-line Communists who resigned.  </P> <P> The government is to serve until elections are held next year, possibly in  July.  </P> <P> Parliament voted Thursday to amend the constitution to allow the appointment of  the new deputies, including Dubcek.  </P> <P> Only one of the 23 new deputies is a Communist Party member. The others are  members of smaller parties or are independent, although Communist Party members  will continue to hold the majority until free elections.  </P> <P> Communist Party leaders Ladislav Adamec and Vasil Mohorita sent a message of  congratulations to Dubcek and said the ideals of 1968 are a "source of  political inspiration for the party's new policies of democratic socialism."  </P> <P> The Prague daily Vecerni Praha reported Thursday the first arrest of a major  Communist Party figure since the revolution.  </P> <P> Miroslav Stepan, ousted Prague Communist Party boss, was being held in custody  after his arrest Dec. 23, the newspaper reported.  </P> <P> "Stepan was indicted for preparing the criminal act of abuse of power of a  public official," the newspaper reported.  </P></p>

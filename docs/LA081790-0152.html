			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TELECOM INDUSTRY LOSING MARKET SHARE  </P> <P> The U.S. telecommunications industry is still a world leader in high-tech  products but sales of its low-end goods have fallen, causing a drop in the  overall global market share, a Commerce Department report said Thursday.  </P> <P> "The report demonstrates that the U.S. industry remains strong, but the  long-term trends are not going in a positive direction," said Under Secretary  of Commerce Michael Farren.  </P> <P> Farren told a news conference that although private industry must take the lead  to regain competitiveness, the government was doing its part to help.  </P> <P> "In an industry as pivotal as telecommunications, U.S. companies must maintain  their lead in the Pacific Rim, the New Europe and our own hemisphere," said  Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher in a statement issued with the report.  </P> <P> Mosbacher called on industry to spend more on research and development, improve  manufacturing technology and stress exports further.  </P> <P> "The U.S. government will do its part by aggressively pursuing measures to open  markets in countries that erect unfair barriers," he added.  </P> <P> The report, ordered by Congress, said U.S. producers will likely remain  competitive in such high-end telecommunications as advanced switching and  information services, but not in more basic telephone equipment.  </P> <P> It said U.S. companies were disadvantaged compared to Japanese and some  European companies because American workers lacked the needed education and  training of their competitors.  </P> <P> The report added that foreign market barriers and state subsidies granted to  some overseas companies created drawbacks for American firms trying to sell  products abroad.  </P> <P> The report said the overall trade picture was mixed, citing both last year's  export increases, which cut the telecommunications trade deficit by $673  million, and the remaining substantial deficit of $1.9 billion.  </P> <P> U.S. market share in fiber optics fell to 50% in 1987 (the latest year  available for detailed figures) from 75% in 1984, and in office data switching  equipment to 36% from 100%, according to the report.  </P> <P> But in other areas, the United States held its ground. The report said the U.S.  share in voice mail systems remained at 100% during the period and in local  area telecommunications networks fell only 2% to 98%.  </P> <P> The report said current Administration proposals that would help  competitiveness include capital gains tax relief.  </P></p>

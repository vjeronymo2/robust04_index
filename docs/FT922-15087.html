			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Much of Europe and Libya look set for business as usual: Neither side can afford to drag oil into tit-for-tat sanctions threats over Tripoli's alleged role in airliner bombing COLONEL Muammer Gadaffi's reported threat to halt trade with countries imposing United Nations sanctions against Libya would, if carried out, be a severe blow to several European countries which depend on the country's particularly light, low-sulphur crude oil. But since 80 per cent of Libya's gross domestic product derives from trade, and 97 per cent of its trade is oil exports, mostly to Europe, few analysts believe Col Gadaffi could afford to enact any self-imposed oil export embargo. Libya's oil revenues are roughly Dollars 9bn a year. Indeed, yesterday journalists from Europeo, the Italian magazine in which Col Gadaffi was reported to have made the threat of a retaliatory trade embargo, denied that the Libyan leader had specifically mentioned a cut-off of oil at all. 'Gadaffi did not actually pronounce those words,' said a Europeo spokesman. However, the dependence of some European countries on Libyan crude also makes it certain that they would oppose any tightening of sanctions against Tripoli to include a trade embargo against a supplier of rare crudes and easily reachable across the Mediterranean. According to oil industry officials, Italy, Germany and Spain privately made it clear to the US in November, when the furore over Libya's alleged role in the Lockerbie bombing came to a head, that they would not back a trade embargo against Tripoli. Their non-compliance would make any such embargo toothless. Libya sells 95 per cent of its oil and petroleum products to Europe, mostly to Italy, Germany, Spain, France and the UK - its five main trading partners  -a total of 1.33m barrels a day. There is no trade with the US since Washington imposed its own trade embargo in 1986, again over alleged Libyan complicity in a terrorist attack. Moreover, the oil imported is of a light, sweet quality upon which several refineries in Italy, Germany and Spain depend and it would be extremely difficult for these countries to replace the oil. Although the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries is producing a surfeit of oil, extra capacity is only available generally in high-sulphur, heavy crudes. 'You cannot say there is any spare light, sweet crude capacity in the market,' says one analyst. 'Most light, sweet producers are operating to capacity.' Italy is at most risk from any threat of halting oil sales and other commercial activity and is viewing with concern the international community's worsening relations with Libya. Italy imports 27 per cent of its crude from Libya and is the country's principal EC trading partner. Rome has given its full backing to the UN resolutions penalising Libya for failing to hand over the two suspects in the Lockerbie bombing; but in private Italian officials have been urging caution and the need to avoid a break-down in communications with Tripoli. Italian ambivalence underlines official fears that Italy risks suffering far more from any Libyan retaliatory measures than Britain, France or the US, which have pressed hardest for sanctions. Last year Italy imported 17.4m tonnes of crude from Libya worth L5,480bn (Pounds 2.54bn), a 2 per cent drop in volume on the previous year but still 27.6 per cent of total oil imports. This is more than double the oil imported by Libya's next largest European client, Germany. It also represents 41 per cent of total Libyan oil sales. At the same time Italian companies, notably via ENI, the state oil concern, are involved in all aspects of the Libyan industry from exploration and production through to construction of refineries. Italy is studying the possibility of importing gas from a Libyan offshore field via a pipeline to Sicily. Libya is also a useful market for a wide range of Italian consumer and industrial goods which last year increased 30 per cent to L1,687bn. Alitalia, the national carrier, transported 17.6m tonnes of goods by air freight last year and more than 31,000 passengers; and the Tripoli-Rome air link is regarded as one of Libya's most important air connections. Spanish officials are also watching anxiously. Libya supplies Spain with about 10 per cent of its imported crude, though this is decreasing as Spain's three refiners have begun to secure their own upstream supplies. But about 19 per cent of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) Spain imports is Libyan. Barcelona and much of the rich industrial territory around it are heavily dependent on Libyan LNG, which is supplied under long-term contracts the Spanish have with Tripoli and Algiers. Spanish diplomats were warning yesterday that any decision to increase pressure on Tripoli would place Spain in a difficult position. 'We would be very concerned if these sanctions were hardened into a full economic embargo,' one official said. Germany, which depends on Libya for 16 per cent of its oil imports, appeared relatively unperturbed by Libyan threats. 'We have been dealing with Gadaffi since 1958 and we have been though our share of bilateral and multilateral quarrels, and not once has he interfered with our supplies,' one industry leader said yesterday. The economics ministry was equally sanguine. 'We expect no supply problems,' an official said. 'There is no shortage of oil on offer, although we cannot of course rule out price repercussions.' Swiss officials were equally unflustered. Libya supplies 15 per cent of the country's 2.6m tonnes of annual crude imports. 'If it had come a year or so ago, I would have said it was very serious,' Mr Baptist Gehr, economic adviser of the Swiss Petroleum Association, said yesterday. Since then, Libyan interests have invested heavily in oil refining and distribution activities in Switzerland, and so Mr Gehr thinks it unlikely that the Libyan government would want to damage its own operations. 'I think it is unlikely that after all this investment Libya will then refuse to supply us,' he said. In June 1990, Tamoil (Suisse), a Libyan controlled consortium, purchased a 65 per cent stake in Gatoil, Switzerland's fourth-largest oil company then in bankruptcy administration, for SFr201.25m (Pounds 77.7m). It later bought the remaining 35 per cent stake from Sasea Holding, the investment banking group headed by Mr Florio Fiorini. Britain, despite having severed diplomatic links with Libya, also imported 1.6m tonnes of Libyan refined petroleum products in 1991 while exporting Pounds 255m worth of goods, mainly machinery, to Libya. But given Britain's own domestic supplies of light oil and its political determination to bring the Lockerbie suspects to justice, the UK would likely not be as worried about a Libyan oil ban - imposed either from without or within.

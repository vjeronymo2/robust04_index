			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Regulators get tough with Hyundai group SOUTH KOREA'S Hyundai conglomerate came under renewed financial pressure yesterday when its main creditor bank banned five subsidiaries from making industrial investments or acquiring property for the next six months. Meanwhile, the South Korean banking supervisor said it was likely that a second Hyundai subsidiary would lose its rights to unrestricted credit access following a similar curb on Hyundai Electronic Industries over the weekend. Unrestricted credit is an important privilege in a country plagued by credit shortages. The actions are linked to a growing conflict between the government and Mr Chung Ju Yung, the founder of Hyundai. Mr Chung recently created the Unification National Party (UNP), which captured a pivotal parliamentary position in last month's National Assembly elections after it campaigned on an anti-government platform. Korean Exchange Bank (KEB) said it was imposing the penalties on the five Hyundai concerns because the companies recently purchased property and built facilities without its permission. This violates the country's strict credit control rules. The companies involved are among Hyundai's most important. They include the shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries, the car maker Hyundai Motor, Hyundai Wood Industries, Hyundai Aluminium Industry, and Hyundai Electrical Engineering. Hyundai already has claimed that alleged financial restrictions imposed on the conglomerate by the government in recent months have led to delays in its investment programme, including the development and production of a new range of vehicles. The government has denied that Hyundai has been subject to credit sanctions. While KEB was disclosing its decision, the Office of Bank Supervision said that Hyundai Electronics Industries would probably be stripped of its right to unlimited credit this Friday unless it could disprove charges that it illegally financed the UNP in the parliamentary elections through bank loans.</p>

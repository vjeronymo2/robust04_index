			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal's enthusiasm to buy shares in Euro Disney is matched by Walt Disney's willingness to cut its stake. Given that the US media group knows the project better than the Saudi prince, that looks like yet another argument for selling the shares. Even so, the prince's involvement could help Euro Disney's forthcoming rights issue in a number of technical ways. For a start, it means there is less chance that the underwriters may have to unload hundreds of millions of unwanted shares on the market after the issue. It also makes it more likely that the issue price will be nearer the top of the FFr5-FFr10 range. So shareholders who do not take up their rights may not be quite as heavily diluted as feared. In the longer run, the prince's promise to build a Dollars 100m convention centre should help fill Euro Disney's empty hotels. The hope must be that his involvement will also make it more likely that a second 'gate' at the theme park is built. Given that the banks have a grip on future spending by Euro Disney, the company could probably not act on its own. Of course, if the prince is as shrewd a financier as his investment in Citicorp would suggest, he will not be willing to give small shareholders a free ride on his convention centre. He will presumably negotiate a deal that ensures that the lion's share of the extra hotel revenues from the project flow to him rather than Euro Disney. Then again, if the prince is smart, he may indeed be buying into Euro Disney at the bottom of the roller-coaster.</p>

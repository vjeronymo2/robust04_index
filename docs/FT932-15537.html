			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Treasury firm on petroleum tax proposals THE TREASURY was last night taking a hard line over its controversial Petroleum Revenue Tax reform proposals ahead of a series of meetings between ministers and oil industry leaders. Although political pressure for a government climbdown was mounting, senior Treasury figures said the industry should not expect any changes to its proposals. The comments followed suggestions that the government might be prepared to go some way towards addressing the industry's concerns by fine-tuning the transition arrangements, particularly to meet some of the objections over the retrospective nature of the changes. The oil industry is finding it difficult to present a united front against the changes because there are some companies that stand to gain substantially in terms of increased cashflow. Nevertheless, the industry seems united over one issue - the retrospective nature of the tax changes. Companies say they applied to the Department of Trade and Industry for licences to explore in the North Sea on the understanding that the rules would not change. As part of the application process they committed themselves to drill a certain number of wells. Some suggest that they could not fulfil these obligations without tax relief. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has said that if companies had already entered into contracts for drilling wells they could still apply for tax relief. But oil companies want that undertaking to cover 'firm commitments' they have made to drill wells. The Treasury yesterday dismissed these arguments and suggested there was no legal requirement for oil companies to stick to exploration targets agreed with the DTI. The new rules will lower the rate of tax paid on existing fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish it altogether for new fields. They also remove tax relief on exploration and appraisal work in the North Sea, a change that will hit many of the small independent companies hard. The industry suggests that the changes will quadruple the cost of exploring in the North Sea. Oil operators are warning that they will have to scale down exploration severely if the changes go ahead. A survey found that 85 per cent of oil companies expected job losses to result from the changes.</p>

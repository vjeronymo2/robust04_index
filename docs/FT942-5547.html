			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cargill biodiesel-from-rape project Cargill, one of the world's largest privately-owned agriculture and commodities companies, is joining United Oilseeds Marketing, a co-operative, in a project to produce up to 100,000 tonnes of biodiesel a year from oilseed rape. 'Two years ago if you mentioned industrial crops you were a bit of a crank, but since then we've seen huge demand from farmers and industrial customers to get to grips with non-food crops,' said Ms Ann Gutteridge, an oilseeds trader at Cargill. Farmers are able to grow non-food crops on land set-aside as part of the European Union's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy without giving up subsidies. French farmers have been growing oilseeds for the production of biofuels for the past three years. But in the UK the industry has not got off the ground, mainly because of scepticism by the government over its viability. Cargill says it can use its own funding to show that biodiesel could be made viable in the UK, but it also wants to open a discussion with the government about opportunities for use of the fuel. The company said that the project would involve 'millions of pounds expenditure', but said it was too soon to put a final figure on it. The scheme could be in place by next year's harvest, the company says, if it can secure commitment from farmers to grow enough oilseeds and if it can find a market for the fuel. Cargill will then commission a biodiesel conversion plant at either Hull or Liverpool. It plans to guarantee farmers up to Pounds 120 a tonne for the oilseeds. Biodiesel is expected to be 10p more expensive to produce than conventional diesel but could be made competitive if the government was prepared to take a lower tax levy on the fuel. A recent report from the British Association for Bio Fuels and Oils called on the government to tax biodiesel at 10 per cent of the rate on fossil fuel. This would mean the Treasury giving up on revenues of Pounds 28m. It suggests the government could recover this by adding 0.20p per litre tax on conventional diesel.</p>

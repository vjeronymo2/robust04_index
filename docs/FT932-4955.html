			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Salomon hopeful of retrieving Pounds 6.7m THE LONDON operation of Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, is trying to recover Pounds 6.7m (Dollars 10.3m) lost through what it says was a fraud perpetrated in the back office of its gilt-edged marketmaking unit. Salomon said that although the money had not yet been traced, the firm was optimistic about the prospects of recovering it. The management of the firm does not expect the alleged fraud to have any effect on its earnings and says that no clients have suffered any loss. The sum is believed to have been removed from the company's account in a single transfer last month. The alleged fraud was discovered by Salomon and reported to the Metropolitan Police, the Bank of England and the Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulating organisation for wholesale financial services firms which was formed in 1991 from a merger of the Securities Association and the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers. On May 27, a 27-year old man was arrested at his home in south London and bailed to return to London's Rochester Row police station on July 7. A second man, aged 32, arrested a few days later at an address in Buckingham Palace Road, will also appear at the police station on July 7. At that stage, the men will either be charged, released on further bail, or told that no further action will be taken. The police declined to comment further on the progress of the investigation. Salomon said it had issued a writ against an individual. Because fraud is a criminal offence, the Bank of England and the Securities and Futures Authority are not likely to take an active role in the case. The SFA said that it would take action only if any of its registered members were convicted, unless the case had wider implications on the way a firm is run. 'If the firm was lax in its compliance and through that laxity endangered clients money, (we would take action), even if no other persons were party to the alleged fraud,' the SFA said. The Bank of England, which is the supervisor of the gilts unit, would be 'kept fully informed,' it said. If the alleged fraud is an isolated incident in the back office, discovered and reported by Salomon, the firm is likely to be able to avoid any further fall-out from the case. Nevertheless, the episode is something of an embarrassment to Salomon, which has been attempting to project a 'clean' image following a damaging scandal in 1991, when it was discovered that the firm had rigged US Treasury market auctions. Senior executives including Mr John Gutfreund, former chairman, had failed to inform the authorities immediately of the transgressions.</p>

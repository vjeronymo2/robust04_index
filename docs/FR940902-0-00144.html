After honoring all requests for designation from eligible entities under section 101(a)(4)(A) of the Act, and making any qualified discretionary designations under section 101(a)(4)(B) of the Act, the Governor shall include uncovered areas in the State within other designated SDA's willing to accept them or within a State administered SDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Appeals <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Technology: Saving space with the office computer - Worth Watching A computer system which stacks like a hi-fi unit has been developed by Motorola, based on its MC88110 Risc microprocessor. The Series 900 enables five units - the central processor box, memory units, etc to lock together without screws. The company believes the Unix system can be stacked together by any end-user, and will be bought by companies that want the potential to expand their computing facilities rapidly . The Series 900 has a five-year warranty on parts and labour. Motorola: UK, 0628 39121.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOTTO ODDS  </P> <P> "Last week 36 million tickets were sold with no winner . . . imagine one  individual spent $36 million on tickets. He would have lost everything,"  (letter, Feb. 23).  </P> <P> There are two major fallacies in this argument. First, 36 million tickets sold  does not mean that 36 million different numerical permutations were entered.  </P> <P> Two or more people often come up with the same 6 numbers as their entry. If one  person bought 36 million tickets for himself, he would have a much better  chance of winning than 36 million people independently buying one ticket each.  </P> <P> Secondly, the mythical $36-million ticket purchaser would probably not have  "lost everything." Monetary awards are given for combinations of 3, 4 and 5  numbers correct, as well as 5 plus the bonus number. Just because no one wins  the big prize one week doesn't mean that thousands of $5 and up prizes are not  won.  </P> <P> Thank heavens some of the lottery money goes to help schools. Perhaps we will  finally have citizens properly educated in logic and mathematics!  </P> <P> CATE WONEIS  </P> <P> Redlands  </P></p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Caribbean leaders to set up trade bloc Leaders of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) meeting in Barbados are set to approve the establishment of a regional group which will be the forerunner of a trade bloc in the Caribbean Basin. Prospective members of the proposed Association of Caribbean States include the Group of Three (Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela), Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Central American states, Suriname and members of the Caribbean Community. About 15 dependent territories will be offered associate membership. The likely membership of the ACS has a combined population of 200m people, an estimated gross national product of Dollars 500bn, estimated annual merchandise exports of Dollars 80bn and annual merchandise imports of Dollars 100bn, Caricom said. The leaders of Caricom, which has a combined market of 5.5m people in 13 English-speaking countries, including Belize in Central America and Guyana in South America, are reviewing prospects for the 20 year-old community following the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Several Caricom members - Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago - have requested the US to list them as potential Nafta members. There is concern, however, that Caricom could be split if some members became Nafta signatories or established formal links with the trade group. The annual Caricom summit will also review the region's banana market in the European Union amid continuing concern about competition from Latin American fruit. The leaders will also consider whether to admit the first member from outside the English-speaking group. Suriname, a former Dutch colony in north-eastern South America, has applied for Caricom membership.</p>

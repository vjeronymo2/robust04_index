			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Lunchrooms. (i) The employer shall provide lunchroom  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities for employees who work in areas where their airborne  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure is above the TWA and/or excursion limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The employer shall ensure that lunchroom facilities have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positive pressure, filtered air supply, and are readily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accessible to employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The employer shall ensure that employees who work in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas where their airborne exposure is above the PEL and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excursion limit wash their hands and faces prior to eating,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drinking or smoking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The employer shall ensure that employees do not enter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lunchroom facilities with protective work clothing or equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless surface asbestos fibers have been removed from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clothing or equipment by vacuuming or other method that removes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dust without causing the asbestos to become airborne.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Smoking in work areas. The employer shall ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees do not smoke in work areas where they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupationally exposed to asbestos because of activities in that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Communication of hazards to employees_Introduction. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section applies to the communication of information concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos hazards in general industry to facilitate compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with this standard. Asbestos exposure in general industry occurs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a wide variety of industrial and commercial settings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employees who manufacture asbestos-containing products may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposed to asbestos fibers. Employees who repair and replace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automotive brakes and clutches may be exposed to asbestos fibers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, employees engaged in housekeeping activities in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industrial facilities with asbestos product manufacturing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations, and in public and commercial buildings with installed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos containing materials may be exposed to asbestos fibers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of these workers are covered by this general industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard, with the exception of state or local governmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees in non-state plan states. It should be noted that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees who perform housekeeping activities during and after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction activities are covered by the asbestos construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard, 29 CFR 1926.1101, formerly 1926.58). However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housekeeping employees, regardless of industry designation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should know whether building components they maintain may expose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them to asbestos. The same hazard communication provisions will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protect employees who perform housekeeping operations in all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three asbestos standards; general industry, construction, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipyard employment. As noted in the construction standard,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building owners are often the only and/or best source of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information concerning the presence of previously installed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos containing building materials. Therefore they, along  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with employers of potentially exposed employees, are assigned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific information conveying and retention duties under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Installed Asbestos Containing Material. Employers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building owners are required to treat installed TSI and sprayed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on and troweled-on surfacing materials as ACM for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this standard. These materials are designated ``presumed ACM or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PACM'', and are defined in paragraph (B) of this standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Asphalt and vinyl flooring material installed no later than 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also must be treated as asbestos-containing. The employer or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building owner may demonstrate that PACM and flooring material do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not contain asbestos by complying with paragraph (j)(6) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Duties of employers and building and facility owners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Employers and building and facility owners shall exercise due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diligence in complying with these requirements to inform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employers and employees about the presence and location of ACM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and PACM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Building and facility owners shall maintain records of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all information required to be provided pursuant to this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or otherwise known to the building owner concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presence, location and quantity of ACM and PACM in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building/facility. Such records shall be kept for the duration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ownership and shall be transferred to successive owners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Building and facility owners shall inform employers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees, and employers shall inform employees who will perform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housekeeping activities in areas which contain ACM and/or PACM of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the presence and location of ACM and PACM in such areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Identification of ACM and PACM shall be made by an industrial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hygienists or by persons whose skill and experience with respect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to identification of asbestos hazards, is the equivalent to that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of industrial hygienists and so can be demonstrated by the owner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Warning signs. (i) Posting. Warning signs shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided and displayed at each regulated area. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning signs shall be posted at all approaches to regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas so that an employee may read the signs and take necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective steps before entering the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Sign specifications. The warning signs required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section shall bear the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> DANGER <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASBESTOS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CANCER AND LUNG DISEASE HAZARD <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RESPIRATORS AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ARE REQUIRED IN THIS AREA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) [Reserved] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The employer shall ensure that employees working in and contiguous to regulated areas comprehend the warning signs required to be posted by paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section. Means to ensure employee comprehension may include the use of foreign languages, pictographs and graphics. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Warning labels. (i) Labeling. Warning labels shall be affixed to all raw materials, mixtures, scrap, waste, debris, and other products containing asbestos fibers, or to their containers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Label specifications. The labels shall comply with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(f) of OSHA's Hazard Communication standard, and shall include the following information: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 10 (TANJUG) -- The opposition Serbian  Renewal Movement (SPO) on Tuesday assessed that lasting peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina required an immediate halt to all conflicts  throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina without any ultimatums and any  promises to any side. President of the SPO Executive Board  Milan Komnenic told a press conference that the party leader,  Vuk Draskovic, on Monday familiarized the U.N. Secretary  General, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and the foreign ministers of  Russia, the U.S., Great Britain, France and Greece, with  proposals to resolve the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In his letters to these officials, Draskovic pointed out  that  after the conflicts have ended, heavy weaponry of all the three  warring sides (Moslems, Serbs and Croats) should be placed under  UNPROFOR control -- and when this is over -- complete  disarmament should be carried out. The leader of the SPO party  which is the backbone of the Depos coalition, the strongest  opposition group in the Serbian parliament, suggested in his  letters the soonest possible holding of a summit of the heads of  state of Russia, the U.S., France and Great Britain, and the  chair-country of the European Union, Greece, and the U.N.  secretary general who would send demands to all the warring  sides to submit themselves to this summit's decisions.    Bosnian Serbs advocate an end be put to all the conflicts  throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. This has not been accepted by  the Bosnian Moslems who propose termination of conflicts on some  of the battlefronts or a truce of up to two or three months.</p>

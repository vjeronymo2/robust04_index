			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the current contractor, the annual value of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract represents an extremely small percentage of its total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sales. As a result, even taking into account that firm's recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investment in specialized filling equipment, the Committee does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider the loss in question to constitute severe adverse impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the other two firms, one of which has not received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a contract for these paints for several years, because neither is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a current contractor, their objections to the addition must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered objections to losing the opportunity to bid on future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procurements for the tree marking paints. Under the competitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bidding system, no bidder is guaranteed that it will receive a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract. Accordingly, the Committee does not consider loss of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to bid on future procurements to constitute severe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters questioned whether the nonprofit agency would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the requirement of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act that 75  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the direct labor hours be performed by people who are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blind. One commenter suggested that the action might not create  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> much employment for people who are blind. Another question  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved the appropriateness of a majority of the sales dollars  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> going to a for-profit company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The JWOD Act's direct labor requirement with regard to nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies employing blind persons stipulates that 75% of the total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct labor hours performed by such a nonprofit agency be carried  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out by people who are blind. Contrary to the suggestion by certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters and confirmed by a court decision, there is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that 75% of the total direct labor required to produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a commodity be performed by people who are blind. Every year for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the past decade, people who are blind have performed over 85% of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the direct labor hours at the nonprofit agency in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, the Committee has concluded that the organization not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only meets, but substantially exceeds the direct labor requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the JWOD Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In considering items for the Procurement List, the Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> focuses on the amount of employment the item will generate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> people with severe disabilities. The amount of sales dollars paid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to for-profit entities is not an appropriate criterion since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing most commodities to the Government requires nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to make substantial purchases of materials from for-profit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firms. In this case, the Committee is satisfied that the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment that will be generated for people who are blind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justifies placing the paints on the Procurement List.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters mentioned the risk assessment study currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underway because of Federal employee concerns about the paints'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects on their health and safety. One questioned the nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's ability to develop any new formulations required as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of the study, while another expressed concerns that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study would be compromised by the addition of another paint. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated above, the Committee is satisfied that the nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency, working with other firms involved in formulating paints,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be able to develop new formulations in response to internal or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> external initiatives. In addition, both the nonprofit agency and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Federal agency which has commissioned the risk assessment study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confirmed that the nonprofit agency's Qualified Products List  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paints are already included in the study. Consequently, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee has concluded that adding the paints to the JWOD Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not compromise the study's results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two of the three commenting paint firms argued that tree marking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paints should not be added to the Committee's Procurement List  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because they are not commodities and, thus, the Committee has no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority over them. The firms argue that the paints are very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complex and time-consuming to produce, while a commodity is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commonly available item.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The word ``commodity,'' as used in the JWOD Act, is a generic term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a product. Nonprofit agencies are currently producing many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highly complex items for the Government under the JWOD Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of these, like the tree marking paints, are Qualified Products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> List items. The Committee finds no basis in its legislation or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> past practice that would lend credibility to the contention that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tree marking paints are not commodities within the meaning of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters, including all three paint firms, contended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the nonprofit agency would not be able to supply the paints at fair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market prices as required by the JWOD Act. One cited the agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inability to win the contract through the competitive bidding pro-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cess as evidence of its position. The nonprofit agency has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advised of the fair market prices as calculated from the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recent set of bids on the basis of the Committee's fair market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing procedures. The nonprofit agency has indicated through its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> central nonprofit agency that it is willing to supply the paints  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using those prices as the base prices for the paints, in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the Committee's fair market pricing system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments were also received regarding concerns about the adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of adding the tree marking paints to the Procurement List on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the economies of areas in which two of the three paint firms have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production facilities. The Committee believes that any potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact on these areas' economies is outweighed by the creation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment for people who are blind, whose national unemployment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate substantially exceeds that of people who are not blind or do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have severe disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the paint firms commented that the nonprofit agency is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a manufacturer or regular dealer under the Walsh-Healey Public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contracts Act, and thus should not be permitted to supply the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paints under the JWOD Program. The manufacturer/regular dealer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement was repealed by section 7201 of the Federal Acquisition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Streamlining Act of 1994, Public Law 103&hyph;455.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

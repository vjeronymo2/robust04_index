			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> NEW NAME: Fullerton College is modernizing its programs, so say goodby to the  home economics division.  </P> <P> Starting this year, it's the Division of Applied Design and Human Studies. . .  . "A name change is all it is," says its dean, Karen Titus. "It was an image  problem." . . . Over the last 2 1/2 years, courses were aimed away from home  skills toward vocational training, and the new name reflects that, she says.  "Women don't want to learn how to cook for their families. They want to cook  for their own catering services." Tammerlin Drummond and Rick VanderKnyff  </P></p>

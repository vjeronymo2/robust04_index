			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Bishop Gabriel Rorech, the minister of state for  foreign affairs, has described his visits to Namibia, Botswana,  and Zimbabwe as successful. [passage omitted]    Ambassador 'Umar Yusuf Baridu, the first under secretary in  the Foreign Ministry, speaking from the ministry's forum,  stressed Sudan's support for the Yemeni people's unity. He said  the continuing struggle between north and south Yemen served  neither the interests of Yemenis nor those of the Arab world,  which was under provocation from global imperialism. Ambassador  Baridu expressed the hope that the sons of united Yemen would  sit together round the negotiating table and resolve their  internal problems without foreign interference.

			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAUDI OIL OFFICIAL'S SON SURRENDERS ON 1982 CHARGE  </P> <P> A powerful Saudi Arabian oil official's son who jumped bail seven years ago  after conviction on a reckless driving charge in Santa Barbara County has  turned himself in, authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> Tarek Abdulhadi Taher, 31, a former UC Santa Barbara student, fled in 1982  after being sentenced to serve 45 days in jail for racing his Ferrari on U.S.  101.  </P> <P> Deputy Santa Barbara County Dist. Atty. Darryl Perlin said a highly placed U.S.  State Department lawyer unsuccessfully asked at that time that the case be  dropped in the interest of good relations with oil-rich Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> Taher was rearrested on a fugitive warrant three years later in Boston but  disappeared once again when a judge there allowed him to remain free on  $100,000 bail, rather than the $5 million requested by Santa Barbara County  prosecutors.  </P> <P> He was not heard from again until this week, when his attorney telephoned,  Perlin said. Taher surrendered himself Wednesday in the court of Municipal  Judge Frank Ochoa, who -- under an agreement with the prosecutors -- ordered  him to serve his 45-day sentence on a work furlough program. He will spend  nights and weekends in jail while being allowed to work for a Santa Barbara  real estate firm on weekdays.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Simple ... Case'  </P> <P> Perlin said the district attorney's office agreed to the deal because "it is a  simple misdemeanor case and he is eligible for that (work furlough) anyway.  </P> <P> The prosecutor said, "We feel this is one of the most significant cases ever  handled by our office . . . because it took on international implications."  </P> <P> He said that a senior U.S. State Department attorney called to express concern  that "the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia could be  jeopardized" if the matter was pursued.  </P> <P> Perlin said the State Department lawyer pointed out that Taher is the son of  Dr. Abdulhadi H. Taher, governor of the Saudi Arabian government-owned company  that develops the Mideast nation's petroleum, petrochemical and mineral  industries.  </P> <P> "Here's a guy who always got his way," Perlin said Thursday. "He finally came  around."  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The International Atomic Energy Agency's policy-setting body, in a move opposed  by the United States and other Western members, passed a resolution denouncing  Israel's nuclear policies as a threat to peace and security. The resolution,  sponsored by 14 states including Iraq, Libya and Saudi Arabia, was adopted on  the last day of the agency's annual conference in Vienna. The vote was 47 in  favor and 28 against, with 12 abstentions. It is widely believed that Israel  has the capability of producing nuclear weapons, but there is disagreement on  whether it has done so.  </P></p>

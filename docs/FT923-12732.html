			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Peat Marwick begins KIO review KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, confirmed yesterday it has begun an assessment commissioned by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) into the agency's Spanish investments and said it expected the first stage of the study to be complete in three months. A spokesman for Peat Marwick, which is KIO's auditor in both London and Spain, said the assessment would examine 'the nature and performance' of KIO's investments in Spain, controlled by Torras, the agency's Spanish holding company. Peat Marwick said the assessment would not initially include recommendations to KIO on its investment strategy in Spain, but that 'we can put recommendations in, as requested, along the line'. The Kuwait government announced on Wednesday that Peat Marwick would undertake the study of KIO's Spanish holdings following a high-level meeting of the state's ministers and senior KIO executives - a move designed to quiet growing criticism in Spain and Kuwait over KIO's handling of the Ercros crisis. Ercros, the KIO-controlled Spanish chemicals group which employs more than 10,500 workers, owes Dollars 2.15bn and KIO's refusal to make new funds available to the group without assistance from creditor banks and the Spanish government raised a storm of criticism in Madrid. Peat Marwick said the full assessment of Torras' holdings would take 'some time' longer than the initial three months. The firm said there were no plans as yet to broaden the assessment to include any other of KIO's estimated Dollars 35bn international investment portfolio.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUNCHTIME  </P> <P> In the '80s, we heard there was no such thing as a free lunch. In the '90s, in  the Los Angeles Unified schools, for many there's no such thing as lunch.  </P> <P> In some schools across the district, the last kid in the cafeteria line ends up  with less than 5 minutes to eat. So, despite federally funded lunch programs  and health education classes about the basic food groups, kids in many of our  schools are still hungry.  </P> <P> Why? In some schools, it's a systems issue: too many kids in line, too few  lines. In others, lunch has been shortened to 20 minutes to facilitate shorter  workdays for teachers, bus schedules, etc. And in some schools, it's simply the  attitude of those scheduling the school day. At our school's council recently,  a teacher suggested we didn't have a problem. "The same kid doesn't end up at  the end of the line every day," she said.  </P> <P> Chew on this: Most prisoners in the state get 30 minutes to eat lunch. Dogs in  the animal shelters get 30 minutes with their bowls. Adults who work 6 hours  get at least 30 minutes.  </P> <P> It's time for our school board -- and maybe the state -- to guarantee our  children time to eat so they can be physically prepared to learn.  </P> <P> BARBARA BRONSON GRAY  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

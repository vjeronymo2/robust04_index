			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Von Roll expects bigger losses VON ROLL, the Swiss steel and engineering group in which Proventus of Sweden bought a 19.7 per cent voting stake last December, said it expected its 1992 losses to be significantly higher than last year's SFr30m (Dollars 20.8m). A recovery was not expected until the second half of 1993 at the earliest, so that a loss was anticipated next year as well, the company said. This contrasts with a statement in August when the directors said they looked for an improvement in the second half of this year. They said sales rose 6 per cent in the first half to SFr1.1bn but margins were unsatisfactory and orders fell 13 per cent to SFr1bn. Proventus said when revealing its stake that the investment would be of long-term advantage, because of Von Roll's interests in waste management systems and other environmental technologies. Von Roll management did not welcome the investment and made clear that Proventus would be held to the bylaw forbidding any shareholder from exercising more than 6 per cent of the total voting capital.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Hard sell on high street: Retailers are discovering that the shoppers of the 1990s are a different and more discerning breed Retailers have been scratching their heads this week, puzzling over the strange phenomenon that is the British consumer. In spite of their expectations of a post-election revival in high street fortunes, few retailers have reported any substantial increases in consumer sales. Although some individual markets, such as cars, carpets and electrical goods, have shown sparks of activity, there has not been a marked pick-up in consumer demand. On Tuesday, Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks and Spencer, was gloomy about the pace of recovery. In the year to March 31, the clothing and food business did better than most but saw UK sales fall by 0.6 per cent to Pounds 4.92bn. And M and S had still not seen the 'whites of the consumers' eyes' since the year end, Sir Richard said. That feeling has been shared by a host of others in recent weeks, as Littlewoods, Sears, Burton, Argos, Kwik Save and J Sainsbury have all reported little evidence of a general pick-up in sales. What makes the situation particularly perplexing is that most consumers clearly have the money - as the current high levels of savings ratios show. According to the Central Statistical Office, consumers saved 10 per cent of their disposable income in the last quarter of 1991 compared with just 4.1 per cent at the beginning of 1988. What is lacking is the inclination to spend. The lingering recession is the primary culprit. Consumer confidence has been shattered and will be slow to recover, according to retailers and most city economists. Many retailers suppose consumers are still unsettled by falls in house prices and the uncertainty caused by the high level of unemployment which continues to grow and now stands at over 2.7m. But many observers of consumer trends are beginning to wonder whether deeper psychological and social factors are also at play. They suggest that the shoppers of the 1990s are a different breed from those of the previous decade and that all consumer industries will have to become far more sophisticated at enticing the public into parting with its money. Much of the evidence for such arguments is more anecdotal than empirical. Some of the strongest trends are best illustrated in the US where the consumer society is more developed than in Europe. Mr Will Ander, a partner of McMillan Doolittle, the Chicago-based retail consultancy, recently told a conference in London that several US research studies had demonstrated that people now valued time as much as money. He suggested part of the reason for this change was the growing proportion of women in employment - three-quarters now work either full or part time. As time had seemingly 'shrunk' for such women, the number of shopping trips had dwindled. The average number of visits to shopping malls each month fell from 3.1 in 1980 to two a decade later; the number of hours spent shopping declined from 12 to four. This meant retailers would increasingly have to give shoppers explicit reasons to come to their stores. Mr Ander predicted this would lead to the predominance of four types of so-called '-est' retailers, which clearly offered either the cheap-est products, the bigg-est selection, the hott-est fashion items, or the easi-est service. The Wal-Mart discount chain, Toys 'R' Us, The Gap fashion chain and Nordstrom department stores, were cited as examples in the respective categories. Mr Ander suggested that such changes in consumer priorities were already discernible in the UK, as evidenced by a recent Harris Poll which found that 54 per cent of consumers said they had less free time than five years ago. His argument is supported by Mr Gary Davies, professor of retailing at Manchester Business School. 'Retailers are asking us to part with our time and that is going to become more and more important to us over the next decade. The working woman has got more things to do and unless you can guarantee her something worth devoting an hour to she will spend it doing something else,' he says. He points to the beginnings of 'a very long-term drift in terms of discretionary spending on shopping' towards other leisure activities, and believes it significant that for the first time since the 1920s, Marks and Spencer's share of consumer spending has fallen in two consecutive years. According to Mr Ander, the recession may also have served to disguise a shift in social values which will have an enormous impact on retailing. Ageing thirtysomething baby-boomers with young families are likely to have a different set of values from those their yuppie predecessors espoused a decade ago. Mr Fabrizio Valente, an Italian sociologist confirms a noticeable shift in behaviour. He says the 1980s saw as explosion of a cultural trends emphasising the 'here and now'. Consumers lived for the present. They were motivated by experimentation and impulse buying. The age was associated with advertising, video-clips and highly ephemeral fashions associated with the latest designer labels. During the 1980s, for example, there were 14,000 products which all bore the Gucci name. In the 1990s, he says consumers are more experienced, shrewd and aware of their individuality and will be more concerned about the environment in which their children live. Much of this may sound like sociological jargon. But retailers are beginning to pick up on these trends, even if they do not articulate them in quite the same language. One chief executive of a big British retailer, for example, tells a tale that illustrates the move towards an era of more self-conscious consumption. He says one of his company's female non-executive directors had recently been amazed to discover that she owned 41 handbags. The interesting point, he suggested, was not that she had bought so many bags but that she had counted them for the first time. On a day-to-day level, retailers are also becoming painfully aware of the pressures that environmentally and socially responsible shoppers can exert on their businesses. The Green Consumer Guide, which advises consumers how to minimise the environmental consequences of their consumption, has sold more than 1m copies and undoubtedly influenced shopping patterns. Retailers have found themselves in the front line of environmental campaigns to reduce packaging, preserve the rainforests by banning endangered hardwoods, or stop driftnet fishing of tuna - which kills dolphins in the nets. Mr Patrick Carson, a director of the Loblaws supermarket chain in Canada and writer on environmental affairs, describes this new breed of environmental shoppers as Higher Inner-Consciousness Consumers, or Hiccs. 'These people make decisions based on ethical, moral and environmental concerns and these consumers are going to use their shopping carts to push for a better world,' he says. Instead of just responding to such emerging concerns, however, Mr Davies suggests that retailers must take a more active role in shaping the market and that there is far more that they can do to stimulate greater consumer spending. He says the excitement has gone out of shopping and that for many people it has become a necessary drudgery crammed into a Saturday morning. He argues that if retailers provided sufficient stimulus to attract shoppers and reward them for spending time in their stores, they would respond by spending more money. He cites the example of Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, which has opened its giant stores in more than 20 countries around the world. He says the store has great customer appeal as shoppers enjoy touching and playing with the exhibits, and taking advantage of subsidised meals and children's play areas. Shoppers typically spend between 1 1/2 and two hours in a store which is far longer than in rival furniture outlets. Their sales are correspondingly higher, he suggests. 'In the middle ages the Bartholomew's Fair market was shut down for debauchery. I wouldn't suggest retailers go so far today but at least they realised then that the only way to get people to travel long distances and sleep in ditches on the way was to offer them entertainment. We have lost sight of what retailing is all about,' he says.</p>

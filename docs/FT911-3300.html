			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Texas fights pioneering swarms of 'killer' bees THE long-dreaded invasion of the US by the Africanised 'killer' honey bee has begun in south Texas, but federal and state officials are prepared for the assault. Five swarms were identified and destroyed last week. US agriculture department (USDA) officials say these were the 'pioneers,' of the main column, which is now about 75 miles south of the US-Mexican border. At risk is the state's Dollars 11m (Pounds 6.4m) honey industry and the 240 commercial beekeepers in Texas who move hives around the state to help crop pollination. They fear that the Africanised bees will take over the hives of the more compliant domestic bees. They worry too about a crop of anti-bee legislation from lawmakers responding to public fears, and mass killings of domestic bees mistakenly identified as Africans. As long as the weather and food supplies remain favourable, south Texas can expect to see honey bee swarms. Officials are trying to quiet public fears, pointing out that the sting of the Africanised bee is no more poisonous than their European cousins. However, they become dangerous if their hives are jeopardised. Unlike the European honey bees - who send a few warriors out to frighten off invaders - the African bees swarm out by the thousands and pursue their prey for up to a mile. The bees have demonstrated their restlessness ever since 26 swarms escaped from their keepers in Brazil, which imported them in 1956. The hybrids have been moving north ever since. In appearance they are similar to the less aggressive European bees, but they are small and carry less venom. They produce only enough honey to sustain themselves before they wander off to new fields. After the first Africanised honey bees were found in Texas last October, USDA and Texas state officials, aided by experts from Texas A&amp;M University, began a survey of the areas around the first landing site. The state established a quarantine around the second find and prohibited the movement of managed honey bee colonies in and out of the area. Eight counties extended the quarantine 100 miles north but permitted managed colonies to move into the area. One plan under consideration would pacify the 'killer' bees by killing their queens and replacing them with Europeanised rulers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Petaling Jaya, April 22 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia  Friday called on United Nations Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali to resign for doing nothing to resolve the conflict  in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said he was disappointed  because Butrus-Ghali did not take a firm stand in dealing with  the Serb aggression in that strife-torn country.    The UN should elect a secretary-general who is really an  activist and brave, who could resolve the problems in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, he told reporters in Subang, here.    Mahathir said he believed the resignation of Butrus-Ghali  would bring change towards settlement of the problem in the  former Yugoslav republic.    What is certain is he did not do anything to settle the  conflict in Bosnia, he added.    Dr. Mahathir expressed regret that Butrus-Ghali took the  conflict in Bosnia lightly when it erupted more than two years  ago.    At first, Butrus-Ghali said the occurrence in Bosnia could  be  found anywhere... He said it was not the only one but there  were 10 more in other places, he said.    Butrus-Ghali's statement appeared to encourage the Serbs to  continue their aggression against the Bosnian Muslims on the  grounds that it was not something extraordinary as the same  thing was happening elsewhere.    Asked if Malaysia would play a more important role in the  election of the UN secretary-general in future, Dr. Mahathir  said Malaysia's influence was limited in that matter.    In fact, he said, many countries were pressured by the big  powers to elect their candidate to the post.    Malaysia did not support Butrus-Ghali's election to the post  in 1991, he added.    Dr. Mahathir reiterated that the Bosnian Muslims should be  provided with arms to defend themselves from Serb attacks.    He believed the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be  different if the reverse occurred where the people who are  murdered are non-Muslims and the murderers were Muslims.    If this is the situation, I believe action will be taken  speedily, he said.    Meanwhile Gerakan, a component party of the ruling National  Front, expressed support for the call for Butrus-Ghali's  resignation. He was biased and racialist in making important  decisions, party president Dr. Lim Keng Yaik said.    Dr. Lim, who is Minister of Primary Industries, said the UN  was influenced by big powers like the United States and European  countries and it was uninterested in settling problems in a  country that did not share the same religious belief or in which  they had no special interest.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Tarmac in the black and makes cash call TARMAC, Britain's biggest housebuilder, yesterday launched a Pounds 215m rights issue to fund the next phase of its recovery. It also announced a return to pre-tax profits in the first half. One third of the rights issue proceeds have been earmarked to fund a land buying programme to take advantage of the upturn in the UK housing market. The rest of the Pounds 215m will cover deferred capital expenditure on plant and machinery for Tarmac America, and help the group to expand its international construction business. It will also strengthen Tarmac's capital structure, including the redemption of Dollars 150m (Pounds 97.4m) redeemable preference shares. The one-for-four rights issue is priced at 120p-a-share. Yesterday the share price closed 1 1/2 p lower at 145p. Tarmac reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.5m in the six months to June 30 compared with a loss of Pounds 15.1m in the first half of 1992. Turnover slipped 4 per cent to Pounds 1.3bn, but sales of continuing businesses rose 2 per cent. After taxation, minority interests and preference dividends, the group recorded a loss per share of 0.7p, against a 2.2p loss last time. The interim dividend is maintained at 3p. Mr Neville Simms, chief executive, said Tarmac was nearing the end of its remedial phase and the management was now turning its attention to the next stage. 'Today's rights issue is the final piece of the jigsaw for our remedial strategy and the foundation stone of our strategy going forward,' he said. 'The rights issue will enable us to achieve our medium-term objectives for growth whilst maintaining prudent financial policies,' he said. In the first half, net interest costs fell to Pounds 24m, from Pounds 31.9m, reflecting lower rates and a sharp decline in net borrowings. The group's divestment programme has so far raised Pounds 227m towards a target of Pounds 300m. Overall operating profits increased by 69 per cent to Pounds 24.8m (Pounds 14.7m). The housing recovery and improved prices in quarry products, together with the benefits resulting from Tarmac's rationalisation and refocused strategy, all contributed to the improved performance. Exceptional items added another Pounds 1.7m to profits, against Pounds 2.1m last time. Within the group's three core businesses, turnover in the quarry products division increased to Pounds 260.3m (Pounds 240.7m), but operating profits fell to Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 8.7m), reflecting a change in product mix. The housing division more than doubled its operating profits to Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 7m), even though turnover declined to Pounds 255.5m (Pounds 281.9m). But profits fell to Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 9.3m) in the construction division despite an increase in turnover to Pounds 480.9m (Pounds 448.5m). The rights issue is fully underwritten by Lazard Brothers and Samuel Montagu. People, Page 21; Lex, Page 26</p>

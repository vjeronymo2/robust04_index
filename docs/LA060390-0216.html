			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MAN AND HIS GARDEN SOW SEEDS OF ANGER  </P> <P> Let's take a trip down a stretch of Daphne Avenue in Gardena, a middle-class  suburb lined with middle-class homes. Look at the neatly trimmed lawns at house  after house after house. Wait. Off to the left. Something's wrong here.  </P> <P> The front yard is wild with vegetation.  </P> <P> As residents of Daphne push lawn mowers back and forth to create their images  of the perfect front yard, the vegetation at James Skeie's place continues to  grow. And GROW. AND GROW.  </P> <P> Rising along with the wildflowers, herbs, shrubs, trees and vines is his  neighbors' ire.  </P> <P> What he regards as a garden, they see as an unsightly assortment of jungle-like  weeds that detract from the neat appearance of every other home on the block.  </P> <P> And in what has become a grass-roots battle over what is acceptable for the  front yard of a home, residents of the block are pressing the city to crack  down on the Skeies' overgrown greenery. The battle has provoked a spirited  debate in many of the street's one-story homes about how much freedom a  property owner ought to have.  </P> <P> "I see Cambodia when I look across the street," said Catherine Nau-Ortiz, who  has collected 30 signatures on a petition asking the city to order the yard  cleaned up. "I call it the jungle house."  </P> <P> Nau-Ortiz, a supervisor at a dental supply company, says her neighbor's yard is  the reason she has not been able to sell her home in a year, despite dropping  the price $20,000. Prospective buyers, she said, focus more attention on his  property than hers.  </P> <P> For next-door neighbor Tibor Denes, a cabinetmaker who has lived in his house  for 25 years, Skeie's yard brings with it health problems.  </P> <P> "It draws rats," he said. " . . . If someone chooses to live like this, perhaps  he doesn't belong here. People like this live in the mountains. This is a  city."  </P> <P> Skeie, 56, is a tall man with a well-trimmed white beard who has lived at the  home for about five years. He has had run-ins with neighbors and officials in  the past over this and other conditions on his property, but the yard has  always been found within the law.  </P> <P> "I rather despise taking care of a lawn like Joe Blow," he said during a recent  tour of the property that included an occasional chomp on an herb or two. "Yes,  it's a little chaotic, but it's naturalistic; it's romantic and it has a lot of  color."  </P> <P> He sees the yard as an experimental nature preserve, a botany lab for his  8-year-old daughter, as well as a fruit and vegetable garden. There are dozens  of different plants on the small plot, including peppermint, strawberries, a  plum tree, a dwarf elm.  </P> <P> Skeie acknowledged that there had been a rat problem at the property, but rat  poison has brought it under control. He agreed that the growth "lacks  definition and boundaries and needs some trimming." He even admitted that his  plants are probably better suited for the country. But the problem, he said, is  a lack of understanding by his neighbors.  </P> <P> "I'm very anti-Establishment," said the self-described preacher, teacher,  collector and real estate agent who now spends much of his time in the garden.  "I don't want to be offensive to people, but I don't want to be pushed around."  </P> <P> Some of Skeie's neighbors have become his unlikely allies.  </P> <P> "My aesthetics are different from his aesthetics," said Wayne Verrell, an  insurance claims adjuster. But Verrell did not sign the petition, saying his  neighbors are too eager to press their values on another. "I've learned to live  with it. I personally think it looks like a weed garden and needs to be cleaned  up, but to each his own."  </P> <P> Robert Baxter, an engineer who lives around the corner from Skeie, pondered the  matter long and hard before finally deciding to add his name to the list of the  disgruntled.  </P> <P> "I feel that anyone who owns a home should be able to do with it what they  want," he said. "But in his case, I think he's taken that to an extreme. . . .  I'm thinking, 'Gee, Jim, if you could just trim it a bit.' "  </P> <P> Nau-Ortiz and several neighbors have complained to city, fire and health  officials about the property for several years. Along with the lawn, they are  fed up with piles of collectibles around the home and an inoperable car in the  driveway.  </P> <P> The city prosecuted Skeie in 1988 for storing combustibles and keeping more  than three rabbits -- Skeie had a dozen. Skeie pleaded no contest, was placed  on a year of probation and agreed to keep his property up to code.  </P> <P> "What happens is we go out and find violations in those areas we have control,  cite him, and he cleans it up just enough to meet code," City Manager Ken  Landau said.  </P> <P> Another problem has been that there is no city ordinance that specifically bans  an overgrown yard. Gardena has laws that address fire hazards, health and  safety violations, vehicles parked on lawns and even overgrown weeds, but city  officials say the yard does not violate any of those codes.  </P> <P> In an appearance before the City Council last month, Nau-Ortiz called on the  city to pass a property maintenance ordinance that would prevent property from  becoming a "public nuisance" through inadequate maintenance.  </P> <P> Such an ordinance has been proposed in Gardena in the past but has never won  city approval because council members are worried it might infringe on property  owners' rights.  </P> <P> Councilman James Cragin -- who likened Skeie's yard to "a refuse dump that  someone has planted flowers in" -- has asked the city attorney to bring the  ordinance back to the council this summer.  </P> <P> All the clamoring has prodded Skeie to take a second look at his garden.  </P> <P> He talks about trying to make peace with the neighborhood by trimming back some  of the growth here and there. But he doesn't plan to go too far. He vows that  his yard will never take on the "golf course look" of all the others on the  block.  </P></p>

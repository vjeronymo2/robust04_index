			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Perilous moment AUTHORITARIANISM is once again haunting Latin America. The second military coup attempt this year in Venezuela and Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's dissolution of Congress in April underline the fragility of the region's democracies. In a sense both countries are special cases. In Peru, the threat to the state from the left-wing fanatics of Sendero Luminoso and political stalemate helped to explain, if not to excuse, Mr Fujimori's move. Venezuela, one of the richest countries in Latin America, is still suffering a hangover from the 1970s oil boom and has yet to adapt its economy to a scarcity of resources. Yet what both are suffering is a crisis of the state, and in this they are not alone. Neither provides the levels of public safety, health, education and other services required by the population, and they are no longer rich enough to buy off troublesome pressure groups. Unfortunately, most Latin American governments are in a similar position. The temptation, when the going gets rough, is to blame liberalising and budget-cutting reforms. But it is the original system, not the effort to change it, that is responsible. Only by making their economies more responsive to market forces and by showing greater fiscal responsibility will Latin American governments achieve sustainable economic growth and combat corruption, special-interest politics and misallocation of resources. Change may be easier for strong governments than for weak ones, yet there are things that all could do to reduce the political risks. They could better communicate the benefits of their policies - pointing out, for example, that it is the poor who have most to gain from reduced inflation. Equally, they should do more to provide targeted help where policies are hurting the poor. They should also have smaller, more professional armed forces, which means initially paying off surplus men. On balance, most Latin American countries are still on the right track, and deserve continuing international support. Even in Venezuela and Peru there are chinks of light. The Venezuelan coups failed because the rebels failed to overcome popular suspicion of men in uniforms offering solutions to their problems. In Peru, Mr Fujimori was forced to hold elections last month to reinstate Congress. Without external pressure - mainly through the international financial institutions - it is doubtful whether Mr Fujimori would have made this concession. Recent political troubles should be taken more as signs of progress than of despair. As De Tocqueville wrote, the most perilous moment for a bad government is when it seeks to mend its ways.</p>

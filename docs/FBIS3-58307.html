These states are now to receive a  consolation prize once more, in the form of the Partnership for  Peace that NATO is to offer them at the summit to be held on  Monday [10 January].    The Visegrad states above all -- Poland, Slovakia, the Czech  Republic and Hungary -- have a claim for rapid and complete  integration into the alliance and the EU that is morally  justified. In retrospect, the establishment of the "Solidarity"  free trade union in Gdansk represents the first blow that shook  the communist giant; in what was formerly Czechoslovakia, the  "Charter 77" dissident movement developed the principles of the  "velvet revolution" and a civic society to follow communism; and  finally, when the barbed wire between East and West was cut in  Hungary, the collapse of the Berlin Wall was only a question of  time. In view of these historic services, one can understand  why the Polish foreign minister bitterly described the NATO  offer as worthless, as "a signpost without any information on  directions or distances."    Shortly before Clinton's departure, the U.S. Government did  at least provide some information on the direction: The  Partnership for Freedom is a step toward the "evolutionary  expansion" of NATO, a transitional stage. This provides little  consolation to those states that no longer belong to the East,  but (still) cannot join the West. Lacking firm economic and  domestic stability, they are being kept in a debilitating  intermediate stage and are exposed to the tumult that has seized  Europe following the end of the Cold War. They have shaken off  Soviet domination and must now learn that Moscow -- even if the  West denies it -- still has a say in their affairs.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / BMA attacks drive for performance pay The British Medical Association yesterday angrily opposed government proposals to introduce locally-based performance-related pay in the National Health Service next year. Delegates to the BMA annual conference in Birmingham backed the existing pay structure and supported a motion saying that they would not tolerate performance-related pay for salaried doctors. Mr John Chawner, chairman of the BMA's hospital consultants' committee, warned of retaliation if the government persisted with its plans. He said senior doctors gave an average of 30 per cent of their time beyond official hours for nothing, saving the NHS Pounds 300m. 'I have to say to the government that they will not continue to give it for nothing,' he said. Ministers want arrangements for moving towards performance-related pay and local bargaining to be in place for the 1995 salary awards early next year. The salary review bodies that make recommendations on doctors and nurses will start gathering evidence in September. Department of Health negotiators are putting pressure on the BMA and health service unions to agree an enabling clause opening the way to local pay bargaining before then. Negotiations resume next week. Mr Chawner said that performance-related pay and local bargaining would 'strike at the heart of the NHS and the heart of our work as professionals'. He said hospital trusts in financial difficulty would pay nothing at local level. In others surgeons who performed many operations would receive pay awards while psychiatrists and other specialists who did work that could not be measured by such criteria would do less well. 'Doctors will seek to work in places and in specialities where they are better paid. In this sense it does herald the end of the NHS as we know it,' he said. Mr Chawner said the BMA had told ministers it was not against the legitimate measurement of good performance but would not go along with the 'Mickey Mouse schemes' that had been proposed. The BMA will follow yesterday's conference decision by writing to the prime minister emphasising its concern. But it will face difficult choices if the government refuses to shift. The salary review bodies are likely to recommend only a modest national increase next year, releasing as much cash as possible for the switch to local bargaining. Most NHS unions and professional associations are unlikely to object as strongly to performance-related pay as the BMA. In these circumstances the BMA is likely to use the negotiations to explore whether there is scope for agreeing a version of performance-related pay more acceptable to its membership.</p>

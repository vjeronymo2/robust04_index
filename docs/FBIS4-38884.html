			<p>BFN     [Text] Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich's  political popularity has doubled, officials at the Belarusian  Political Research Center Eridan announced today.    Kebich leads the list of the officially registered  candidates  to the post of president with 372,000 signatures in support of  his candidacy.    Ex-speaker of the Belarusian parliament Stanislav  Shushkevich  and leader of the Agrarian Party Aleksandr Dubko secured the  smallest number of signatures (123,000 and 117,000,  respectively). The other candidates are former head of the  temporary parliamentary commission for combating corruption  Aleksandr Lukashenko, Secretary of the Communist Party's Central  Committee Vassiliy Novikov and leader of the Popular Front Zenon  Poznyak.    An opinion poll held by the Eridan Center revealed that the  popularity of Lukashenko, Novikov and Dubko has increased from 2  to 4 percent since April, while that of Shushkevich has gone  down from 9.8 to 7.1 percent and Poznyak -- from 5.4 to 4  percent.    The same poll showed that 57.8 percent of the respondents  welcome the unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary  systems, and 77.7 percent favored the creation of a  Belarusian-Russian financial and economic union.</p>

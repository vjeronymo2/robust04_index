			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Arts: All change at Arts Council - Off the Wall Anthony Everitt, who resigned yesterday as secretary general of the Arts Council with one year of his contract still to run, has done the wise thing. It is unlikely that Lord Gowrie, who takes over as chairman on April 1, would have wanted his contract renewed. Everitt can now depart on the same day as Lord Palumbo, and an era will come to an end. The two men can be proud of the money they squeezed out of the government over the years; less happy about the initiatives they launched which tended to flounder or cause uproar. It was not specifically the fracas over the London orchestras' funding which prompted Everitt's decision, but the debacle came to symbolise indecisiveness at the top. Significantly, all four men concerned with trying to create a super orchestra - Lord Palumbo, Everitt, music director Ken Baird, and head of the music panel Bryan Magee - are going or gone. Five Council members are also due to retire. Grey Gowrie has a clear playing field in terms of personnel and no obvious organisational nightmares. Everitt, who is returning to his old life as a journalist, commented ruefully yesterday that, after spending all this time in committees working out new structures, his successor can enjoy himself with the arts. Thoughts naturally turn to his successor. It is unlikely that his deputy Mary Allen will rise to the post. The front runners must be Colin Tweedy, who has run ABSA for over ten years and earned a bigger job; Timothy Mason, once boss of the Scottish Arts Council and now licking the London Arts Board into shape; and Mike Elliott of West Midland Arts, with Clive Priestley, management consultant turned arts lover, as outsider. It looked nasty on Wednesday night as the crowd pressed round the building. A security guard tried to calm things with a megaphone, but with little success. Tempers were frayed; there was real anger. The disgruntled throng was the Friends of the Tate being forbidden entry to the Picasso exhibition. The Tate had completely misjudged the numbers anxious to see the show at the members' private evening. Six thousand turned up; the gates had to be closed and hundreds went away frustrated. Millbank was locked solid and became a no go area for taxis. The Picasso show could be the most successful in the Tate's history. On the first day paid admissions exceeded 3,500, which suggests a total attendance approaching 300,000. Only the 1976 Constable exhibition, which attracted 313,000, is likely to prove more popular. Don't phone Alan Ayckbourn over the next few days: the nation's most performed living playwright is setting the week aside to create his 47nd play. At the moment it is shaping up as a work of Hitchcockian menace, but that could change. His last play started as a time travel comedy and then turned nasty. Ayckbourn was in Rome this week, which was a surprise since he hates travelling and rarely leaves Scarborough. But as Montblanc, the luxury pen people, was awarding him Dollars 25,000 as the European winner of its annual culture prize, he made the trip. The money goes straight into his special cause, the removal of his theatre, the Stephen Joseph Theatre in the Round, from its cramped premises in a former school into a refurbished 1930s Odeon cinema. With luck the new theatre will open in the heart of Scarborough next spring. There will be a small studio space seating up to 200, and a bigger area, seating 400, and still in-the-round. The project costs Pounds 4.3m. Ayckbourn has raised Pounds 2.4m and is not proud. 'We want one big sponsor and will sell the name. I'm quite happy for it to be called after Mrs Toshiba's granny'. Ayckbourn has no wish to concentrate all his energies as artistic director of the theatre. 'I've got at present two or three ideas banging around in my head.' The plays will still flow. But fund raising is his current pre-occupation. 'It's hard to prime the rusty Yorkshire pump. When I approach local businessmen they say 'if its going to be that good, why are you doing it here?''.</p>

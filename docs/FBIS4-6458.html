			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- Rallies protesting the  U.S. pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and  the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea were held on  April 10 in front of the embassies of the United States and  Japan and the South Korean "embassy" in-Moscow, according to a  report.    Participating in the rallies were a secretary of the central  committee, and the first organisational secretary of the Moscow  committee, of the All-Union Bolshevik Communist Party, and  people from different walks of life.    The speakers at the rallies sharply denounced the United  States and its followers, Japan and the South Korean  authorities, for carrying the situation on the Korean peninsula  to the brink of war on the pretext of the DPRK's "nuclear  development", and demanded that the United States stop at once  its interference in the internal affairs of Korea and new war  provocation manoeuvres.    They demanded an immediate withdrawal of the U.S. troops and  nuclear weapons from South Korea and expressed full support to  the Korean people in their struggle for peace of the country and  its peaceful reunification.    Statements and appeals denouncing the anti-DPRK moves of the  United States, Japan and the South Korean authorities were  published at the rallies.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Hurd will not rule out end to embargo MR Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, yesterday did not rule out an end to the arms embargo against Bosnian Moslems, although he reiterated the arguments against such a policy. 'It may become inevitable,' he said, though he underlined his belief that such a move would be the 'politics of despair', indicating an acceptance among outside powers that there was no solution but to allow the warring factions in Bosnia to fight it out. On British television, Mr Hurd said that if peace negotiations broke down, and the position of the UN forces in Bosnia became intolerable and they were pulled out, then he could see some outside powers insisting they armed those involved in the fighting. He refused to be drawn on whether the UK would use its veto if the proposal for lifting the embargo were put to the UN, but added that that point had not yet been reached, since there was no majority on the Security Council in favour of such a move.</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Swiss Bank lends support to Trafalgar cash call SWISS Bank Corporation has emerged as the mysterious sub-underwriter of more than 40 per cent of Trafalgar House's Pounds 204.5m rights issue, announced on Thursday. It was able to take up this position because of an option agreement with Hongkong Land, the Jardine Matheson-controlled property company which has a 20.1 per cent stake in Trafalgar. The agreement allows it to sell more than 70m Trafalgar shares to Hongkong Land at a price of 79p. This is substantially above the rights issue price of 60p. The resulting profit of about Pounds 14m would offset losses incurred by Swiss Bank if the rights issue flopped and it was forced to take additional shares onto its own book. The arrangement for Hongkong Land to buy further shares from Swiss Bank at 85p was a crucial factor behind the timing of the rights issue. Trafalgar House needed the extra capital to avoid the danger of breaching borrowing covenants. It said last week it expects to make a further Pounds 120m in provisions this year to cover both restructuring and the dwindling value of its commercial property portfolio. Robert Fleming, which helped put together the option agreement, underwrote the 79.9 per cent of the rights issue not accounted for by Hongkong Land. Less than half of that amount was sub-underwritten in the market.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Honduran accord with IMF The Honduran government has signed a letter of intent with the International Monetary Fund which will open access to Dollars 650m (Pounds 411m) in loans from Washington-based lending institutions. The agreement follows approval in October by the US Congress of tax reforms intended to reduce the Honduran fiscal deficit from 11.2 per cent of GDP to 7 per cent this year, and to 4.5 per cent in 1995. The Honduran economy is expected to contract by 1.5 per cent this year after suffering drought, energy shortages, and a drop in the price of bananas, its main export. Without the IMF accord, the government would have fallen behind with foreign debt obligations.</p>

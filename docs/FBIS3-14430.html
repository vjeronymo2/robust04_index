			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani has  asserted that the Jordanian position on Jerusalem is clear,  frank, and unequivocal. In a statement to Jordan Television,  Dr. al-'Anani said he agrees with the PLO on the need for  coordination before and after any event or political development.    Dr. al-'Anani was commenting on a statement by the PLO  office  at the United Nations. The statement expressed astonishment at  Jordan's position on inserting the Jerusalem issue in Security  Council Resolution 904.    The information minister asserted that the Jerusalem issue  was only mentioned in the resolution's preamble and not in the  operative articles, which much weakens it. He said inserting  the Jerusalem issue in this way in the resolution made it  difficult to omit the word Jerusalem, and led to the U.S.  abstention. It gave the United States a future pretext to  abstain or even veto any resolutions on the basis that it has  demonstrated its position in Resolution 904.    The minister said inserting the Jerusalem issue raised the  voices of Israelis and the leaders of U.S. Jews, who say  Jerusalem is Israel's unified capital. He stressed Jordan's  consistent position on Jerusalem, namely, Jerusalem is an  indivisible part of the occupied Arab territories, as stipulated  in Resolution 242, which provides for regaining all occupied  Arab territories in return for peace.</p>

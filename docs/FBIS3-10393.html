			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate </F> for the Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD]    [Text] In some of the meetings I have held in recent weeks,  I have been asked, particularly by representatives of the  business sector, about the immediate political future of the  country in the event my presidential ticket wins the presidency  in the 1994 elections. These people specifically insisted that  I outline my thoughts regarding the possibility of restoring a  military- dictatorial government in the event the alliance  formed to support my candidacy were to win the elections.    On previous occasions and through other means, I have had  the  opportunity to refer to the topic. I have pointed out that one  factor must be taken into consideration: the internal  transformation -- which was unthinkable in other times -- that  has taken place within the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD]  regarding its operation. In spite of the complexity of its  statutes based on a difficult community organization, we have  complied with all steps required for the democratic selection of  candidates.    Unrestricted nominations and direct and secret elections led  to an internal mobilization to a degree never seen before. To  this effect, I am proud to say that the custom of choosing  leaders and candidates from outside the party according to the  likes or dislikes of the chiefs of military zones has been  surpassed. This has led to a democratic practice that  strengthens party organization; thus the PRD has become an  important factor in the consolidation of the system.    My fellow party members and I are aware that access to state  leadership is only possible and desirable through respect for  and compliance with the rules of political coexistence. At the  proper moment, we rejected all attempts to disturb institutional  order through acts of force or riots that tried to change the  structure of the state or stability. More than once, we firmly  said that any political or military adventure that sought to  shorten the presidential term of Guillermo Endara would be  openly rejected by our party. This led to severe criticism by  some politicized groups for which such a criteria "extended the  life of Endara's government" and led -- according to them -- to  a sort of suicide because all hopes for redeeming the country  were reduced to an electoral result. That was the same time at  which the proposal for a constituent assembly was promoted,  based on the erroneous idea that it could direct the course of  events and substantially change the country's situation if the  legitimacy of the government was questioned.    The aforementioned facts show that the PRD decided to take  political action within the system, with clean and open cards  and with a sincere admission of the errors that at one fateful  moment isolated the party from the majority of the nation.  Within the PRD, we feel a noble and healthy pride at having  surmounted such difficult stages and at having reached a new  democratizing conscience that, in just four years, has turned it  into an obligated point of reference at the hour of describing  the national situation.    Meanwhile, there is no military group that, for reason of  any  political force, can reassume direction and control of public  functions. Nobody in Panama has that ability to garner  nationwide support. No one can lead all the driving forces of  the nation to establish autocratic governments that do not  comply with the norms of political and social coexistence.    To this effect, I think that any president, party, union, or  group that tries to substitute the laws of political consensus  with a government that has unrestrained power will be left  without the national support necessary for its legitimization.  Consequently, its possibilities for ruling will be reduced to a  minimum. There is currently no political or social condition  that will allow the existence of autocratic or dictatorial  governments. Even at the international level, there is no room  for new radical experiments, given that the collective  conscience abroad emphasizes the new paths man must follow,  greatly concerned over his rights and freedom, without  forgetting the urgent social needs that have been increasing in  recent years.    Therefore, I point out that the democratic organization  should try to improve so it will likewise have the ability to  offer true solutions to the people with fewer resources and will  grant them the educational instruments to develop in today's  complex society.    The only thing that we ask is that the rules of the game not  be changed; that it be accepted that we exist; that we  participate in the system; that we are prepared to win; and that  our government is completely feasible. It is a simple duty of  understanding the reality of the country in a mature manner and  with a sense of responsibility.</p>

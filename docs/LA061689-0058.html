			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Scuba divers blew up three boats carrying badly needed food to Lebanon's  embattled Christian heartland, and two people died in a new round of Syrian  shelling. The supply boats were blown up in the southern port of Sidon, about  25 miles south of Beirut, after frogmen apparently attached mines to the  vessels, a police spokesman in Beirut said. Syrian forces have blockaded  Christian-run ports in the Christian enclave north of Beirut. The supply  vessels were carrying fruit, vegetables and other goods. Syrian gunners  bombarded the Christian enclave with howitzers and rocket launchers, killing at  least two people.  </P></p>

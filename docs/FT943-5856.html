			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Lira recovery continues The lira yesterday continued its gradual recovery on the currency markets to again reach the L1,000 level to the D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith. A combination of encouraging events - most recently, a favourable floating rate bond auction - helped the lira to a London close of L1,000, from L1,007 on Tuesday. Elsewhere in Europe, the D-Mark's performance was fairly mixed, as it failed to benefit from the upward trend in French interest rates. The franc was barely changed at FFr3.422 against the D-Mark from FFr3.423. The announcement that the Irish Republican Army was suspending military operations after 25 years had little discernible impact on the pound. The trade weighted sterling index finished at 79.1 after opening at 78.8. Market talk about progress in the US-Japan trade talks helped the dollar finish firmer against the yen at Y100.175, from Y99.665. It ended slightly lower against the D-Mark at DM1.5783 from DM1.5805. In New York it edged up to a closing Y100.185 and DM1.5817. Overall activity was quiet, with most traders focusing on today's Bundesbank council meeting, and the release tomorrow of the monthly US employment report. The firmer lira was one of a number of currencies which defied those who thought higher rates in France would favour the D-Mark. Mr Adrian Schmidt, international economist at Chase Manhattan, said there were three factors which explained the lira's recent recovery from a low of L1,030 on August 12. These were the firmer tone to the dollar, improved expectations of a credible budget package - based primarily on government plans to implement a pensions reform package - and the good response to Tuesday's auction. While the recent absence of political tensions has clearly helped the lira, most observers believe that the market will continue to place a risk premium on it, until there is evidence of sustained calm on the political front. Analysts were split as to whether the decision by leading French commercial banks to raise rates presaged a bottom in European rates, or not. Mr Brian Durrant, economist at broker GNI, said the rates increase did 'not have Bank of France official policy implications and certainly does not imply conclusively that the European interest rate cycle has bottomed'. But Mr Robert Thomas, head of research at NatWest Markets, said the move, aimed at bolstering lending margins, 'surely underlines that there is not much more to go in European rates, if at all'. He added that it was most unlikely that the banks had not spoken to the Bank of France first, and their action in then raising rates suggested they were not confident about the prospect of a further fall in rates. Various theories circulated about why the banks lifted rates. One is that they were trying to pressurise the Bank of France to hasten rate cuts. Another suggested they were acting pre-emptively in anticipation of the Bundesbank raising rates at its meeting today. The latter view is certainly a minority one. A Reuters poll of 20 European economists, ahead of the council meeting, found that only five of those polled thought the discount rate would not be cut again, and none are predicting it to be above the current level of 4.5 per cent at the end of the year. The consensus is that it will be at 4.25 per cent. Economists at SG Warburg argued, in their latest foreign exchange review, that 'the Bundesbank lacks economic justification for further monetary relaxation'. This is based on the view that inflation is approaching a cyclical bottom. 'They will also have to facilitate substantial issuance throughout potential political uncertainty in the coming months, a scenario which rules out measures that may leave the D-Mark and Bundesbank credibility at risk.' If the Bundesbank does opt for change, it is most likely to revert to a variable rate repo. The repo rate is currently fixed at 4.85 per cent. Earlier this week, a Bundesbank council member said the bank had an interest in keeping alive interest rate speculation. Analysts were reluctant to predict whether the IRA announcement might benefit sterling. One line of reasoning was that the pound would firm if Prime Minister John Major's reputation was seen obviously to have been enhanced by the ceasefire declaration. Sceptics, however, said he might well have opened a Pandora's box, fostering political division among his own supporters. In the medium term, analysts surmised that the fiscal implications of a unified Ireland would probably have more impact on the Irish punt, than on sterling. The August purchasing managers report conveyed little fresh information about the economy and was ignored by sterling. It also had little impact on the futures market, with the December short sterling contract closing at 93.40, from 93.43. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 194m assistance after forecasting a daily shortage of Pounds 300m.</p>

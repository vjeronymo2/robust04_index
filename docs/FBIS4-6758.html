			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Chang-sop from the "Special Report" </F> supplement: "Caution Prevails on Creation of Financial  Conglomerates"]    [Text] No Korean bank is ranked among top 160 banks in the  world. Even a combination of the 13 commercial banks will make  it smaller than the world's 23rd largest bank. Only 16 banks  are listed on the Banker's Top 500 in July last year. The  average capital of the five major Seoul-based banks is just a  tenth of that of their Japanese counterparts. Even worse,  profitability of Korean banks is quite low by international  standards. A Korean bank employee generated a before-tax income  of 9.7 million won in 1991, compared with 51.2 million won for  his counterpart in Japan and 97.8 million won for an employee of  the 52 foreign banks in Korea.    This dismal picture made it inevitable for Korean banks to  sharpen international competitive edge and a way of bolstering  their global competitiveness is to increase their size or to  become financial conglomerates. [sentence as published] An  economy of scale or managerial efficiency will arise if banks,  securities companies and insurance houses are merged to become  financial conglomerates. But caution prevails over a hasty and  arbitrary creation of financial conglomerates, many analysts  said.    Professor Yi Pil-sang and other critics contend that the  government is plotting a scheme to control the financial market  through the creation of big players. They said they agree in  principle with the government's move to establish a few mega  financial institutions which will deal in banking, securities  and insurance services. They said financial conglomerates, if  established, will sharpen international competitive edge of the  Korean financial industry. As Korea recruited and intensively  trained "elite sportsmen" to win gold medals in the Olympics, so  Seoul now needs to foster a few "representative financial  institutions" which can compete with Citibank, Bank of America  and Japanese and European mega banks domestically and globally.  But they warned that no people or businesses, except for  industrial groups such as Samsung and Hyundai, have enough money  to become financial conglomerates.    About 300-500 billion won is necessary to take over a bank.  Except for the government and industrial conglomerates, no one  and or firm has such a huge amount of cash, many analysts said.    Government officials said that the government will strictly  separate industrial conglomerates from muscling into financial  groups. But critics say even if the government legally bans the  participation of Samsung, Hyundai and other industrial groups,  they may provide money through tricky arrangements to their  "henchman" to establish financial conglomerates. Ultimately,  financial conglomerates will become a "private safe" for  industrial giants, they warned.    Furthermore, there is skepticism whether prospective  financiers, if any, are ready to take over the commercial banks,  which are saddled with a huge amount of nonperforming loans.    Textbook theory alleges that the synergy effect will arise  when financial conglomerates handling banking, securities and  insurance emerge. But there is no proven evidence that the  synergy effect has emerged. Many local banks have used their  securities, insurance and other financial subsidiaries as  "channels" for digesting layers of "good old boys." It is no  coincidence that financial institutions of which parents are  banks have been performing more poorly than those with no  affiliation with banks.    Another hindrance to the emergence of financial  conglomerates  is the rule that no one can control more than 8 percent of any  Seoul- based commercial bank. This rule has made local bankers  drift without real owners and left room for government  intervention in their internal management although it committed  itself not to meddle in their internal affairs.    Pak Chae-yon, senior secretary for economic affairs to  President Kim Yong-sam indicated that the government would  loosen the maximum share-holding limit to foster the financial  conglomerates.    Risks on financial conglomerates are widespread. Trouble in  a subsidiary will have a chain effect on the rest of the sister  companies in financial conglomerates. Collusion may exist among  these subsidiaries for regulating competition, forming a cartel  on pricing and other unfair deals. They many exchange customer  information, which may create a conflict of interest.    Before the emergence of financial conglomerates, Korea needs  to revamp the current regulatory system in which the three  supervisory bodies do not have a coordinating function. Mindful  of such negative effects, Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong said  the issue of fostering financial conglomerates is a long-term  subject. The Ministry of Finance said at the current stage, the  government has no official position on the issue although it has  embarked on a full- scale study. Professor Yi of Korea  University said that the government should first deregulate its  internal control on financial institutions, help banks eliminate  the huge amount of nonperforming loans before the idea of  fostering financial conglomerates is considered. He and many  critics said financial conglomerates should emerge naturally,  not artificially by the government. Any artificial measure will  invite a special favor legitimacy controversy of their birth as  many industrial conglomerates have been constantly facing, they  said.    Daehan Kyoyuk Insurance announced that it would seek to  become a financial conglomerate by taking over a bank and a  merchant bank soon. It has taken over a securities subsidiary  from the ailing Bank of Seoul. The other candidates frequently  mentioned as candidates for financial conglomerates include  Shinhan Bank, Coryo Securities Daishin Securities, Korea Life  Insurance and Tongyang Securities.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Major Banks' Ownership Structure (Unit: , as of the end of 1992)      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |        |Cho Hung|CBK     |Korea F-|BOS     |Shinhan |KorAm   |Hanil   |  |        |        |        |irst    |        |        |        |        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Governm-|-       |0.11    |-       |-       |-       |-       |-       |  |ent     |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gov't-I-|-       |-       |0.03    |-       |-       |-       |-       |  |nvested |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |  |Cos.    |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Banks   |1.16    |78.37   |3.29    |5.04    |6.17    |1.29    |8.61    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Securit-|0.24    |0.07    |0.04    |6.05    |17.18   |10.69   |4.91    |  |ies     |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Insuran-|2.75    |2.45    |3.21    |11.47   |3.20    |2.20    |6.52    |  |ce Firms|        |        |        |        |        |        |        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Investm-|4.57    |8.50    |3.92    |4.73    |3.40    |5.73    |1.91    |  |ent-Tru-|        |        |        |        |        |        |        |  |st Co.  |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Short-t-|-       |-       |0.08    |0.44    |-       |0.07    |0.74    |  |erm     |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Finance |-       |-       |-       |0.13    |-       |0.09    |-       |  |Cos.

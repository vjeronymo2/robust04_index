			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Arts: La Fille mal gardee - Covent Garden Ballets change. No matter with what care a company may seek to preserve its choreographic patrimony, the erosions brought about by the transmission of steps from one dancer to another, from one generation to another, bring mutations in text and style. Technique changes; bodies change, and worst of all, those nuances of feeling wherein lies the spirit of the choreography, are lost or distorted. Frederick Ashton was really only interested in first casts. What happened to his ballets after them was an inevitable process which subtly altered, and perhaps diminished, his creation. Yet managerial good sense has dictated that his ballets must be seen on fresh bodies every year. The task for the new casts is not only to preserve the letter of the text (which, by itself, killeth) but to honour the work's spirit (which giveth life). La Fille mal gardee is, more than any other Ashton creation, is plainly a cast-iron, change of cast-proof, ruin-proof work of genius. Its structure is a marvel of integration between ensemble and solos. Its narrative is taut, as grounded in good sense as a Moliere comedy, and as rich in human feeling. Its dances seem an effortless outpouring of pastoral delight - and the testimony of members of its first cast suggests that its creation was of the happiest. Looked at dispassionately its virtues are superabundant, and unflawed: there is not a dull or unnecessary step in it, nor a moment when the attention is sated by dance or drama. Happy, then the young inheritors of its leading roles, as we saw on Monday night when Fiona Brockway and Tetsuya Kumakawa took the stage for the first time as Lise and Colas. Both are bright, gifted artists who find much to engage their talents in Fille, and much to delight us. They both play for quick, vivid physical effects. Understandably, they see their debuts in terms of physical hurdles to be sunnily overcome, and there were many rewards in Miss Brockway's buoyant, sparklingly accented point-work - like the easiest coloratura - and in Mr Kumakawa's bounding virtuosity and in his multitudinous pirouettes (I fancied that he turned nine in the last act coda). Dramatically these performances were lively. Miss Brockway is Widow Simone writ young, with temperament and to spare; there is no doubt about the ardour that Kumakawa's Colas feels for Lise. Yet I was most touched by both performers in the very closing scene of the ballet, when Miss Brockway became gently adoring in Colas's arms, then moved with a lovely spaciousness through her final solo, and when Kumakawa suggested the intense happiness that Colas knows now that Lise is his. Such joint sincerity and sweetness of feeling was the quality that marked these characters in their creation by Nerina and David Blair, and it is the life-giving spirit of the ballet. From Iain Webb an Opera House debut as Alain marked by real depths of emotion. He gives the simpleton a puppyish eagerness and incomprehension of worldly ways which generates true pathos in the moment when he discovers Lise and Colas in each other's arms. From David Bintley and David Drew their customary fine readings of Simone and Thomas. From the company, splendid dancing.</p>

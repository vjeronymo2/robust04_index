			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Ministers to seek early coal industry sell-off THE GOVERNMENT is to push for early privatisation of the coal industry in spite of the furore over the pit closure programme. Ministers intend to start work on firm proposals as soon as they put in place the package for saving some of the 31 pits earmarked for closure last October. They have concluded that putting British Coal into the private sector is the best way of ensuring that subsidies to the industry, now seen as an inevitable part of the package, are ended by the late 1990s. Legislation on privatisation is likely for the parliamentary session beginning in the autumn of this year, or the following session at the latest. Previously, ministers had suggested that the crisis over pit closures could force a more significant postponement of privatisation, at least until it could be made commercially viable. They now believe there is no reason why British Coal should not be privatised while it still receives subsidies, provided there is a clear schedule to phase them out. Ministers are likely to justify the policy stance as putting pressure on British Coal to improve its performance, and emphasising that the long-term objective of moving the company into the private sector remains unchanged. The subsidies, to be collected either from the taxpayer, or, more likely, through levies on electricity bills, would be aimed largely at enabling British Coal to replace some of the 20m tonnes of coal imports which come into the UK each year. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will be in Brussels today to brief European Commission officials on his plans, and ensure that proposed subsidies for British Coal fit in with EC policies on competition and on aid to industry. While still considering a range of ideas to increase British Coal sales to electricity generators from the proposed level of 40m tonnes in 1993-94 and 30m tonnes in the following four years, the government is moving away from the idea of closing Magnox nuclear stations which are nearing the end of their lives. It believes such a move would be too expensive, partly because of the decommissioning costs, and because relatively few pits or jobs would be saved, especially as nuclear jobs would then be cut. Ministers are also unenthusiastic about setting up an energy commission to supervise the electricity and gas industries, and want to keep the existing system of regulators for each industry. But they think that the government might be able to play a larger role in shaping the industry by supplying information or setting priorities, such as encouraging renewable forms of energy.

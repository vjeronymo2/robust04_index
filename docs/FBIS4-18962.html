			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Dan Ericssom, Christian Democratic </F> Community Party secretary, by Monica Bjorklund; place and date  not given]    [Text] A really dirty Social Democratic election campaign  intended to push the Christian Democrats out of the Riksdag --  that is what the Christian Democratic Community Party [KDS] is  expecting and already seeing signs of.    "The Social Democrats do not shy away from engaging in  incredibly negative campaigns," party secretary Dan Ericsson  said. "In their own election documents you can see that in  August they intend to demoralize the government parties' people,  and for a week in September they will push out one of smaller  parties.    ``They have put together reports about us, found quotes  which  are being used in campaigns of letters to newspapers, and do not  even shy away from writing letters signed `local KDS  supporter.'''    Social Democratic Party secretary Mona Sahlin often declares  that the KDS is a party on the right wing. This is part of the  Social Democratic campaign against the KDS, according to Dan  Ericsson.    "It is their strategy, voiced a long time ago, to try to get  at the KDS by getting us into the right-wing trap. If you are  right wing you frighten people. Regardless of what we say on  the issues, they will go on hammering this message home."    The KDS is not a right-wing party, Dan Ericsson stressed. It  is a party in the political center.    In the latest Sifo [Swedish Institute for Opinion Research]  poll, the KDS comes dangerously close to the 4 percent threshold  for representation in the Riksdag. But the party feels far from  down for the count.    "Our ambition is to win back the voters we have lost since  the election. And also win some new voters from the Social  Democrats," Dan Ericsson said.    He received me in his office at the KDS Riksdag chancellery.  And he protested immediately when he saw the headline over the  diagram which will accompany the interview: "KDS Voters Pull to  the Right."    "Since the election we have lost just as much to the Social  Democrats as to the nonsocialist parties," he explained.    The Christian Democrats will concentrate on five issues in  the election campaign: family policy, care services and the  care of the elderly, legal issues, environmental policy, and  economic policy.    Family policy is not only about child-care allowances, but  above all about putting the family in the center and supporting  it in different ways.    The care services and the care of the elderly are, in part,  about getting more resources for them. Dan Ericsson was  unwilling to say exactly where this money will be taken from,  but a solution involving some form of care insurance could be  part of the picture here.    "The fact that the Social Democrats have gone public and  said  that health care does not need any more money is sensational, to  say the least, bearing in mind how harshly they have criticized  us when we have been unable to win over other parties on issues  relating to care."    On legal issues the KDS will stress ethics. It is impossible  to get at crime if people do not have a clear ethical foundation  on which to stand, the party believes. Schools must assume a  more educational role, according to the party secretary.    On environmental policy the KDS will demonstrate that it is  a committed environmentalist party which has pushed  environmental issues hard during the life of this government.    In economic policy the KDS will continue to try to sell its  proposal for tax subsidies for jobs in the home performed by  young people. But there is no suggestion of a general tax  rebate for domestic services.    The EU [European Union] issue cuts right through the  Christian Democratic Community Party. The party leadership are  convinced supporters of membership of the EU, but among the  party's sympathizers there is more of majority for "no."    "This is probably because many people have not seen the  overall picture yet," Dan Ericsson said hopefully.    He thinks that the Social Democrats' party secretary, Mona  Sahlin, has harmed the whole EU issue by saying that farmers and  businessmen should pay an additional EU contribution.    "This is completely absurd. The EU is a shared commitment.  Statements like these only create confusion."    Nor does he have any time for Center Party leader Olof  Johansson's proposal that increased environmental levies should  finance Sweden's contribution to the EU budget.    "There should be no earmarked financing of the EU budget  contribution."    An issue which cuts right through the nonsocialist coalition  government is the rundown of nuclear power. The KDS and the  Center Party want legislation to the effect that 2010 will be  the final year. The Moderate Coalition Party wants to continue  to operate the nuclear power stations as long as safety can be  guaranteed. Dan Ericsson admitted that the Moderate position is  "a little threat to the cohesion of the government."    "I really think that the Moderates should think this one  through."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, April 27 (TASS) -- "We must first of all  solve the problem of stopping hostilities in Nagorny Karabakh  and then gradually settle all the other issues, linked with that  conflict," Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of the Council of the  Federation, the upper chamber of the Russian parliament, said  today during his meeting with chairman of the Azeri Supreme  Soviet Rasul Guliyev.    Informing journalists on the meeting, head of the council's  press centre Yuriy Algunov said that in Guliyev's opinion  "nobody needed the continuation of the Karabakh conflict". He  said that the war was lately receding, but it was a very slow  process.    Informing the guest on the work of the upper chamber of the  Russian parliament, Shumeyko noted that there were several views  on the status of the Council of the Federation. Some people  believe the council should be a buffer between the president and  the State Duma. Shumeyko stressed in this connection that the  "legislative power has never been nor will be a buffer".    Shumeyko, who is also chairman of the Council of the CIS  Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, dwelt on the role of parliaments  in the effort to integrate the members of the Commonwealth of  Independent States (CIS). He noted that the former Soviet  republics had many common interests. The problem is to "find  optimal ways for their rapprochement without harming their  sovereignty".</p>

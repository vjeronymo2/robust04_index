			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, February 22 (CNS)--An increasing number of  Chinese students are returning from France with their number  outstripping for the first time the number of state-supported  students going to France last year. Among 355 returned  students, 81 are doctorate degree-holders, according to China's  embassy in France.    Some 5,000 Chinese students have been sent to study in  France  at public expense since reform and opening to the outside world  started. To date, over 3,000 of them have returned to China,  constituting 60 percent of the total number.    The embassy's education counsellor in France said that the  policy of the Chinese government on supporting students studying  abroad, the encouragement of their returning to China and their  free coming and going had won the understanding and cooperation  of most of the Chinese students studying abroad. Those in  France said that the policy indicated the state's kindness and  trust in making it possible for them to choose various ways to  serve their motherland. They also held that returning to China  would fully exploit their talents in view of the new economic  situation in China.    Compared with China, the ongoing depressed European economy  and particularly the rapid increase in the number of unemployed  in France made it difficult for Chinese students there to get  suitable jobs while the immigration laws recently issued by the  French government made such problems as residence and social  insurance for foreign students there unsettling, adding another  reason for the increase in the number of Chinese students  returning home.</p>

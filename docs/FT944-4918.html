			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: New-issue downturn hits Wall St underwriting fees The fees Wall Street investment banks earn underwriting stock and junk bond offerings have fallen to all-time lows this year because of the sharp downturn in business activity, according to a report by Securities Data, the New Jersey-based financial information group. Although fees have fallen in all categories, the record lows for initial public offerings (IPOs) of stock and junk bonds are especially worrying because underwriting these types of issues is traditionally among the highest-paying business on Wall Street. Consequently, investment banks are hit twice: the volume of underwriting business is falling, and the fees they earn on that business are also falling. Securities Data says that IPO fees - traditionally the highest because the risk firms take on when selling the stock of newly-floated companies is greater than in other areas of underwriting - have fallen 7 per cent in the last year. Today, firms are charging 6.7 per cent of the principal amount of each issue, compared with 7.2 per cent a year ago. For example, if an underwriter sells Dollars 100m of stock in an IPO, the firm will earn Dollars 6.7m for its efforts rather than Dollars 7.2m. Mr Jeff Rainess, an analyst at Securities Data, says: 'Rising short-term rates are killing the new issuance market, and Wall Street firms are scrambling to get business.' In the junk bond market - which, like IPOs, has contracted this year because of rising US interest rates - fees have fallen 19 per cent, also to a record low. Junk bond issues are now charged at 2.1 per cent of principal, compared with 2.6 per cent last year and a high of 4.5 per cent in early 1991. The biggest decline in underwriting fees, however, has been in the investment-grade debt category, where the volume of debt issued has plunged 30 per cent this year. Fees on debt issues have dropped 23 per cent, to 0.51 per cent of principal.</p>

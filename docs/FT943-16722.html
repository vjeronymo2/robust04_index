			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Non-resident Commonwealth citizen I refer to your reply saying that 'as a non-resident Commonwealth citizen, you are entitled to a personal allowance against your UK income tax liability'. If this is so, could you please let me know: 1. Since which tax year has this been so? 2. Is one also entitled to higher personal or age allowance or only basic personal allowance? 1. Non-resident Commonwealth citizens have been entitled to full personal reliefs since 1990-91. In 1989-90 and 1988-89 (which is as far back as claims can be made, under the general six-year time limit) the rules were different and entitlement to relief depended upon world-wide income. 2. The only allowance not available to a non-resident is the transitional allowance for a married woman whose husband had a small income in 1989-90. (See also answer to previous letter). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Keating Bail Rules Modified: Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito ordered indicted  Arizona businessman Charles H. Keating Jr. to follow a stricter weekly check-in  schedule after prosecutors complained that the former thrift executive couldn't  be found over the Thanksgiving Day weekend. Ito ordered Keating and the Los  Angeles County District Attorney's Office to choose a specific day and time for  weekly check-ins by telephone. "That way, you don't have to play phone tag with  each other," Ito said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The proposal on putting off parliamentary and  presidential elections could be implemented by prolonging the  Pact on Civic Accord, Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray told Interfax.    In his opinion, such a move would appease a wide spectrum of  political forces, including the opposition which he believes  would support the idea of postponing elections in the absence of  a realistic contender to Boris Yeltsin and in hope that such a  contender will at some point emerge in the ranks of the  opposition.    He also said that the Civic Accord Pact was "a document  based  on a certain balance of political interests and forces." "Given  political will, it can easily be prolonged by amending the  Constitution and by prolonging the powers of all branches of  authority," he said.    He welcomed the political forces' newly acquired skill for  coming to terms with one another, but noted that in the current  complicated situation, early elections could also help to ease  political tensions.    He also expressed the opinion that the proposal to put off  elections was the Russian political elite's attempt to prolong  its term in office.</p>

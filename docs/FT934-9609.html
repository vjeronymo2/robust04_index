			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Lucas pensioners' challenge fails THE LEGAL challenge by 70 pensioners to a Pounds 150m 'gift' to Lucas Industries, the automotive and aerospace components company, from its pension fund failed yesterday when a High Court judge ruled the payment was lawful. The payment, made in 1990 and approved by the pension fund's trustees and the Occupational Pensions Board, was made to deal with the potential tax liabilities of the fund's large surplus. The pensioners had challenged the legitimacy of the trustees' actions. Mr Justice Vinelott said both the payment and the trustees' actions were proper. The payment had been accompanied by automatic increases in benefits to members who were represented on the board of trustees.</p>

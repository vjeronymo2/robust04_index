			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Japan has been discussing  North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program with  South Korea and the United States to formulate its own policy on  the issue, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Friday [25  March].    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news  conference that the premier told cabinet members he had compared  notes on the nuclear threat from north korea with visiting South  Korean President Kim Yong-sam.    He also said Tokyo has been discussing the issue with  Washington, the top government spokesman said.    But Hosokawa said it will take time before the government  decides on its own policy to help resolve the North Korea issue.    Meanwhile, Takemura welcomed Russia's proposal to hold an  international conference on Pyongyang's nuclear program, adding  that Tokyo will seek further information about the proposal from  Moscow.    Russia on Thursday proposed the holding of an international  parley on the issue, saying it should be attended by Russia,  China, the U.S., Japan, and North and South Korea, as well as  representatives of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  and the United Nations secretary general.</p>

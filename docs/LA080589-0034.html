			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS: UNEVEN VIBRATION FROM REGGAE TRIO  </P> <P> "Jah is the strength of my life." That regulation-issue reggae lyric took on an  added dimension during Israel Vibration's hour-plus performance before a packed  house at the Music Machine on Thursday. The vocal trio, Jamaican-born but now  New York-based, were childhood polio victims -- Cecil Spence and Lacelle Bulgin  used arm braces and Albert Craig a cane to support themselves on stage.  </P> <P> The three singers democratically split lead vocals, but the constant shifting  of position at the center mike slowed the pace. The Roots Radics band provided  powerful backing, as well as persistent feedback that frequently obscured the  harmony vocals. While the music kept the audience locked in a slow, steady sway  throughout the set, Israel Vibration's performance only occasionaly rose above  the level of proficient reggae grooving.  </P> <P> Charlie Chaplin was more successful during his 30-minute opening set. He's one  of the few artists working in the rap/sing deejay style who eschews "slackness"  (sexually boastful lyrics), and he had some of the grainy, gritty quality of  the late Peter Tosh. His forceful stage presence made that maddening deejay  habit of suddenly interrupting and then re-starting a song halfway palatable.  DON SNOWDEN  </P></p>

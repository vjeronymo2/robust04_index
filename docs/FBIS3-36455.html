Uglyov  had announced his attention to reveal this information in his  address to Russian President Boris Yeltsin on January 22, if the  latter failed to discuss with him issues related to the  destruction of chemical weapons.    The chemist explained his decision by the fact that he saw  hope that the authorities could hear his voice after his recent  meeting with the presidential advisor for national security,  Yuriy Baturin. In addition, Uglyov said he feared that revealing  the formula and other specific features of the new chemical  weapons could enable some countries to launch its uncontrolled  production.    Uglyov also said he held hope for a favorable end of  "Mirzayanov's fanned case." He said the scientist's intention  to reveal the formula was the reason for launching legal  proceedings against him.    The press conference was also attended by another former  chemist, now disabled Vladimir Petrenko, who became victim of  chemical weapons tests conducted in the institute over a decade  ago.</p>

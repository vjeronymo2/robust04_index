			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Feature by RENMIN RIBAO reporter Chen Weiwei (7115 4850 </F> 0251) and XINHUA reporter He Ping (0149 1627): "Hold High the  Banner of the Shock Brigade -- Li Ruihuan Meeting With  Representatives of Old and Young Shock Brigades"]    [Excerpts] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Two generations of  shock brigade leaders in the capital today happily gathered at  the Beijing International Convention Center, with each wearing a  big bright-colored red flower on his chest. At 0900, when Li  Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau, and Zhang Baifa, executive deputy  mayor of Beijing, entered the center, all those present gave  warm applause to them who both served as leaders of shock  brigades well-known throughout the country in the 1950s.  [passage omitted]    Youth shock brigades came into being in the 1950s as  national  economic construction was on the upsurge. In the new situation  brought about by reform and opening-up, the banner of the shock  brigade has become ever more resplendent, under which a large  number of young pioneering workers have emerged. [passage  omitted]    On behalf of the younger generation, Li Keqiang, first  secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth  League, asked the older generation to rest assured that the  younger generation would carry forward the fine tradition of the  older generation and that the banner of the shock brigade would  fly high into the next century.    Forty years elapsed in the twinkling of an eye. Recalling  the past and comparing it with the present, Li Ruihuan was  excited. He said: "Tremendous changes have taken place in our  country over the past 40 years. During these years, youth shock  brigades in the capital have made outstanding contributions to  the construction of the city, winning honor for building  workers, for Beijing residents, and for the Chinese people.  Youth shock brigades have scored marked achievements, gained a  wealth of experience, trained a large number of qualified  personnel, and formed fine traditions and work style. I hope  that you carry forward all such good things and develop them."    Liu Ruihuan then said: "The new situation has set new  requirements for us. I hope that while carrying forward the  tradition, you will gain fresh, more useful experiences. You  should not only do a good job in building houses and roads but  also step up your ideological education. A new generation of  well-educated, well-disciplined people with lofty ideals and  moral values should be cultivated. It is hoped that the younger  generation is better and stronger than the older one."    Words with deep feeling and ardent exhortation!    When Li Ruihuan finished his speech, the audience responded  with warm applause.</p>

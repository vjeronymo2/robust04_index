			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / The carrion call: The housing market offers many bargains for scavenging home hunters, but uncertainties about price create pitfalls for the amateur AFTER the anxieties of a war and three interest rate cuts this year, the UK housing strike is breaking. The sellers' market of the 1980s is a memory. Buyers are returning. Visitors are touring the builders' show houses again. Homes prepared for sale, but held back a year or more ago, are beginning to reappear. But the market now presents many difficulties to home buyers. Where should they start and how can they spot the bargains? In the past year, the only active traders, apart from those forced to move house, have been people with the cash and the nerve to treat the recession as an opportunity to make scavenging bids. As a result, real housing prices (allowing for inflation) are now some 35 to 40 per cent below the 1988 peaks. As interest rates fall, the vultures are being joined by less aggressive buyers and sellers. But they face great uncertainties in establishing a fair price for any particular property, because the gap between asking and selling prices has become disconcertingly wide. The reluctance of most English home buyers to haggle is matched only by the unwillingness of sellers to regard their homes as an object of barter. This form of bargain-phobia is peculiarly British. Americans buy by the square foot of usable space and they will pay, or expect to receive, what the residential price indices suggest. The French take any asking price as a starting point to bid and counter-bid. Investment purchasers the world over buy sight-unseen on the basis of a cash analysis of the rental returns. But the moment a British buyer crosses the doorstep of a British owner's home, the strain of the encounter renders both incoherent with feigned politeness. The buyer adopts the restraint of a visitor. The vendor assumes the responsibilities of host. For perhaps the biggest single personal cash transaction of their lives, buyer and vendor meet as complete amateurs. So a common wish to make a deal may often be strangled by cultural reserve and what both recognise as an invasion of privacy. For this reason, sales agents prefer to take prospective buyers around homes without a resident vendor nervously tagging along to see if the visitors like the wallpaper. When buyers do try their hand at bidding, they are often so lacking in finesse that the seller is deeply offended and may turn down a respectable subsequent offer - 'I would not sell our house to those people if they paid us.' So how can the opportunist make the most of the latter months of a buyers' market without leaving a trail of disgruntled people and failed deals his wake? The first step is to become a cash buyer, by selling his present home, if necessary. No-one can hunt bargains without ammunition to hand. The second step is to identify the characteristics of the prey. Agencies put vendors into three classes: active sellers, hopefuls, and improbables. The active sellers set a price based on the actual selling price of equivalent properties. The hopefuls hold out for the premium offered by people who fall in love with a property. The improbables insist on prices they heard about in mid-1988 and tolerate a 'for sale' board as a permanent fixture. Anyone considering a move up-market or sideways need not fear to accept a 20 per cent cut on the 1988 cash value of his house to achieve a sale. This will be more than offset by the advantage of becoming a cash buyer with the bargaining muscle to win a 20 per cent cut in the value of a more expensive property. Because the equation is reversed in a move down-market, sales of retirement homes have been badly hit. That also explains why so many of the hopeful and improbably-priced properties are towards the top of the mid-price ranges. Holding out for a better price tomorrow makes sense only if the turn in the market is expected to result in an increase in prices as well as more activity. But a surge in prices is unlikely, because supply is more than adequate to meet any likely rise in demand. Every potential buyer who has been unnerved by the falling market of the past two years is matched by an equally keen but cautious seller. Those signs of a turning point that are bringing out potential buyers are also persuading owners to accept that their home is worth substantially less than it was the year before last. So the canny home hunter will not be rushed into buying. There is plenty of time to take careful aim and pick off an ideal home at a good price. With cash in hand, what should be the opening move? 'First plan your strategy,' says James Wilson, of the property buying firm Wilson &amp; Wilson. 'The timing now is perfect as the market has undoubtedly bottomed out.' Finding the right property may take a long time. The buyer needs to be highly selective because of the large number of poor properties which remain unsold in a slack market. 'Poor' may be in terms of relative price or relative quality. 'Valuations have been impossible to make with any accuracy, so asking prices are all over the place,' Wilson says. That is why the professional buying agents rarely look at an asking price these days. They start with their own valuation as the basis for a recommended offer. An individual home hunter should to do the same. 'Sales 'hype' has changed in the 1990s. Now every property is claimed to be 'realistically' priced, even if it bears no relation to what we would regard as achievable,' says Wilson. 'Some of the deals we have completed in the past year were at a third less than the price initially quoted.' In a rising market it is often argued that the best value is offered by the cheapest property in an expensive area - to reap the benefits of generally rising values in a fashionable neighbourhood. That approach now has its dangers. Cheap property often goes with large and unpredictable renovation costs, which may not be money well spent in a soft market. While prices can be negotiated downwards, buyers should concentrate on houses of quality, whose true value can be asessed more easily. If asking prices are an uncertain guide to values, how can any non-specialist expect to know how, and what, to bid? The answer seems to be that they cannot, on both counts. For a start, by no means every asking price is inflated. Trevor Kent, past president of the National Association of Estate Agents, now with an agency in Gerrards Cross, finds many buyers 'are so blindly certain that the market allows them to get more off, whatever price a house is offered for, that they lose the deal'. Bargaining does not mean hammering down an already fair price. A structural survey of a property can help the buyer judge a fair price. A mortgage lenders' inspection and valuation aims to show the resale value of property in case the buyer should fail to meet the payments. This valuation is likely to be conservative, however. Those who still want to shave a few thousand from the asking price of a property in an estate agent's window, but do not feel up to face-to-face bargaining, can pay a pre-agreed fee to another estate agent to negotiate. As Chris Maunder Taylor of North London agents Stock Page &amp; Stock says: 'That is still unconventional in the private sector but it is standard practice for commercial property and, in this market, it makes sense.' A private buyer who has already selected a property could expect to pay an agent as little as a few hundred pounds for negotiating a price. The professionals judge the vendor as much as the property. Maunder Taylor says: 'When you go around someone's house it is not difficult to find out why they are selling in today's market. It might be to get a quick sale to make a move. It may be that they are under pressure. The bottom line may be that the bank is breathing down his neck or he must move to pay school fees . . . usually there is some good reason and you have to put that together with the survey and valuation information to pitch your offer. 'English people are not often good at this sort of bargaining. It calls for bazaar trading; street market tactics,' adds Taylor. The principle is to get a dialogue going, rather than to make an offer which is so far from the seller's expectation that it becomes impossible to haggle. James Wilson says: 'Whenever you make an offer it must border on the credible. One wonders sometimes if people who make offers at half the asking price are really serious. It may be good for their ego, but it merely annoys the vendor. The chances of concluding a deal are nil.' Home hunters looking for the sharpest bargains can take a lead from the scavenger bidders by concentrating on properties that must be sold. Truly distressed homeowners are easy to spot. The pincer effect of record loan rates and declining resale values on heavily borrowed home buyers forced an unprecedented 44,000 repossessions last year. The Council of Mortgage Lenders' recent estimate that 123,000 borrowers are now six months or more in arrears with their payments hints at the number of home owners with serious cash difficulties. That figure implies a similar flood of forced sales this year, and plenty of scope for the vulture instincts of the toughest of home bargainers. However those numbers do not show the extent of the next layer of struggling owners, the wider category of 'near-distressed' sellers. Excluding cash buyers and those taking out less than the average mortgage advance of 60 per cent or more, about 1m owners stretched their borrowings near to the limit to buy at 1987 and 1988 prices. Recent rate cuts are too little too late for many whose homes are now worth less than their mortgages. These owners stay out of the lenders' alarm lists by managing to keep up the loan payments, but they would be keen enough to sell and reduce their commitments if they could. The number of forced sales this year could be 100,000 or more, according to Trevor Kent. Many more who have postponed a move - for example, divorced people living in the same house, those who have moved jobs or those with grown up children - are waiting to put their houses on the market. This suggests an even stronger case for handing over price negotiations to a neutral professional. Home hunters too squeamish to take advantage of an owner's problems cannot expect to bag the bargains. The hidden mass of would-be movers counterbalances the frequently described, but yet to be sighted, 'pent-up' demand for homes. That is invariably misinterpreted as a tidal wave of buying power ready to crash back into the market and send prices surfing ahead once more, as they did after previous slack periods. But past history may be a poor guide. The housing recession of the last three years was the first since World War Two in which prices retreated in cash terms. The 35 to 40 per cent fall in real terms suggests a long haul back for any owners still hoping that inflation will bail them out. Of course, inflation will erode the real value of their mortgage. Owners may also hope that inflation will tend to push up the value of their properties at least in cash terms. But demand is still highly price-sensitive, while potential supply is held up by the number of forced sellers. In the longer term, the shortfall of new houses being built, compared with the likely increase in the number of those who would like to own their own homes, will tend to raise real prices. Meanwhile bargain hunters have time to shop around. A revival of activity now depends on owners accepting lower prices rather than on buyers bidding each other up into another credit-filled bubble. The bargains are out there waiting for buyers with cash, and the risks of selling ahead of any sudden rise in prices are minimal.</p>

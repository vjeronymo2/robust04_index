			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Three easy ways to be charitable CHARITIES may perhaps come lower on the Christmas list than usual for many people this year With economic problems mounting, families might feel that charity begins at home. It is at times like this, however, that charitable donations can make the most difference. And the government has made it much easier to make them effectively. Three schemes allow you to give generously at the taxman's expense and all of them could be worth considering over Christmas. Give As You Earn Provided your employer operates the scheme, or can be persuaded to do so, this is the easiest way to give. Donations up to a maximum total of Pounds 50 can be made each month and they are 'grossed up.' In other words, they are treated as coming from your pre-tax income so, effectively, 40 per cent taxpayers part with Pounds 30 for a Pounds 50 donation and 25 per cent taxpayers get away with Pounds 37.50. It is possible to give to a range of charities this way, subject normally to a minimum donation of Pounds 5 a month for any individual charity. Some employers even will pay the costs of administration. If you are bothered about payroll deductions, you can stop the scheme at any time, although donors cannot reclaim money paid out already. Gift Aid This scheme is particularly useful for top-rate taxpayers who want to give large donations. If you go through the formalities, a gift to a charitable group can be treated as net of basic-rate tax. In other words, a Pounds 400 donation is viewed as if you had paid Pounds 533.33. The charity could then claim tax relief at 25 per cent (Pounds 133.33). This is great for top-rate taxpayers, who can then reclaim for themselves the 15 per cent difference (Pounds 79.99) between basic and top rates. So, a top-rate taxpayer could give Pounds 533.33 to charity for a net outlay of Pounds 320.01. The only snag is that Pounds 400 is the minimum donation, which could put it out of the reach of some - although this is still lower than the original limit of Pounds 600. But there is no point in giving a sum between Pounds 320.01 and Pounds 400 without going through the gift aid formalities. The Charities Aid Foundation has a cunning scheme, the Charity Account, for getting round this. The CAF is itself a registered charity, so you can make a Pounds 400 donation to the foundation; it will then make payments to the other charities of your choice. This service even comes with a chequebook to make it easier to keep tabs on your giving. Covenants This is the oldest-established way of giving tax-efficiently, and requires you to take out a long-term regular commitment. The tax advantages are similar to Gift Aid - basic-rate tax relief can be reclaimed from the Revenue by the charity, while top-rate taxpayers can reclaim an extra 15 per cent for themselves. Donations must be in fixed and regular amounts, though, with neither maximum nor minimum levels. The law requires that the covenant is drafted to last for at least three years, and the intervals at which donations are to be made - whether monthly, quarterly or annually - must be set at the outset. There is a complicated choice between gross or net donations. If, for example, you choose to give Pounds 100 gross, the charity will always receive Pounds 100 - but you will have to part with more if tax rates go down, and with less if they increase. If you covenant a net sum, then the charities will bear the brunt of tax changes. The CAF allows its Charity Account to be funded via a covenant as well as via a single Gift Aid donation. The charities movement is rapidly becoming more commercially savvy; thus, there are plenty of other novel ways to give painlessly and even pleasurably. Christmas cards and novelty records allow you to give to charity en passant. A similarly harmless way to give small amounts comes with a number of prettily decorated credit cards - 'affinity cards' - which allow you to make donations each time you make a purchase with them. The amounts involved are small, but they can add up. The CAF has another appealing new option: charity vouchers. These work in the same way as book or record tokens, but are not open to the charge that they limit the recipient's choice without conferring any benefit. The CAF's voucher allows a third party to give via Gift Aid (using the allowance of the person who gave them the voucher) to the charity of their choice. The CAF offers the vouchers in denominations of Pounds 10, Pounds 25 and Pounds 50. All of these are matters for careful and considered private choice. You may think that the purposes on which your tax is spent - social services, education, defence and the rest - are more worthwhile than any charities. But if there are causes you want to support, it is silly not to take advantage of the government's own recent fit of generosity. Charity vouchers are obtainable from: Charity Gift Voucher Department, Charities Aid Foundation, 48 Pembury Road, Tonbridge, Kent TN9 2JD.</p>

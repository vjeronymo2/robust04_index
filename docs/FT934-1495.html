			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Eliza Tinsley down to Pounds 0.33m Eliza Tinsley Group, the USM-quoted maker of hardware products, yesterday reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 408,000 to Pounds 329,000 for the six months ended September 30 1993. The result contrasted with a 40 per cent increase in profit to Pounds 713,000 for the 1992-93 year. Turnover in the half year improved from Pounds 7.47m to Pounds 7.86m but pressure on margins affected the result. The interim dividend is increased from 1.8p to 1.96p on earnings per share of 2.84p (3.57p). Mr Andrew Hall is to be co-opted to the board as chief executive in January. Following this, Mr David Fletcher will resign as chairman but stay on the board. Mr Jeremy Sharp, presently chief executive, will become chairman.</p>

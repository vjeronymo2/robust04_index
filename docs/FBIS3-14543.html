			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk] </F>   [Text] Since 6 March, the murderous Saddamite regime has  been launching a barbaric and wide-scale military campaign  against the marshes overlooking al-Nasiriyah, al-Basrah, and  al-'Amarah cities, with a view to besieging and annihilating our  people who live there. It is part of a premeditated criminal  plan to stop the popular current, which is opposed to the  regime's criminal practices against our struggling people.    According to the information we have received from our  strugglers in the region, the authority's troops conducted a  large offensive along several battlefronts, using tanks,  artillery, and infantry troops from four divisions and backed up  by regiments from the Republican Guards. They overran a large  area of the marshes following concerted artillery bombardment  using internationally banned napalm bombs, which caused huge  fires in several villages in the region that left several  villagers dead.    The following facts emerge from the recent treacherous  Saddamite attack against our people in the south:    1. The isolated regime in Baghdad has launched the attack to  liquidate the bastions of Iraqi jihad and popular resistance,  which pose an increasing threat to the regime, have become  rallying points for the people, and provide a ray of hope for  salvation now that the international threats to bring down the  regime have vanished.    2. Saddam and his gang continue to act with hatred toward  the people and a desire to harm and muffle them, despite the  catastrophes, perils, and calamities caused by this gang to the  people; this increases day after day without any hope of change  in the gang's bloody and inhuman practices.    3. The new world order, led by the United States and backed  by its allies, does not care much about the constant deaths,  general starvation, and utter misery in Iraq caused by Saddam's  gang. They also do not care much about the violations of human  rights in the south. Among the Security Council resolutions,  they only care about the destruction of Iraq's strategic  weapons. For this reason, they focus their entire attention on  destroying these weapons, a goal that has turned into the  standard criteria for judging the Iraqi regime's attitude and  discipline.    4. The annihilation, destruction of the environment, and  devastation of the populated areas in southern Iraqi are part of  a comprehensive Zionist scheme, which closely resembles the  campaigns of annihilation and demographic changes carried out by  the Zionist entity in Palestine and is intended to be  standardized throughout the Islamic countries.    5. The silence of world public opinion at what is happening  in Iraq is part of a multifaceted collusion against the gigantic  Islamic trend, which started during the blessed uprising of 1991.    Let us all announce a general mourning throughout the world  over the March 1994 massacre, which is still in progress. Let  us all participate in organizing permanent and vocal marches in  front of the Saddamite regime's embassies throughout the world.  Let us intensify our protests over the world's murderous  silence on the annihilation of our people. Let us do everything  we can to help save our people, who are dying inside Iraq, and  not just sit with our arms folded and accept the work of destiny.</p>

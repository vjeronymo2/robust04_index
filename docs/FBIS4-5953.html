			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nguyen Van Thu] </F>   [Text] Industrial explosives have been in use in Vietnam  for about a century now. After the north was liberated, we  continued to use explosives to mine coal and metal ore, quarry  rock, and build roads and bridges and hydroelectric projects.  Each year, we consume about 10-20,000 tons of industrial  explosives. In the past, these were imported mainly from the  (former) Soviet Union and China.    During the past 5 years, in accord with the policy of  coordinating national defense with the economy, military  organizations have stepped up research and produced  approximately 4-5,000 tons of industrial explosives a year,  satisfying some of our needs for such materials. Making full use  of the surplus capabilities in national defense production, in  the coming years, the volume of production may reach 10,000 tons  a year. Many groups of scientific and technical cadres from the  Technical General Department, the National Defense Industry and  Economics General Department, the Military Technical Institute,  and the Explosives Technical Center at the Military Technical  Institute who have gone abroad to do research and familiarize  themselves with the manufacturing of military explosives have  had a chance to view the production of industrial explosives.    In many countries, the production of industrial explosives  is  coordinated closely with the production of military explosives,  with those production installations directly subordinate to the  military or to industrial ministries. The production of  explosives (both military and non-military) involves special  techniques, many years of experience, and, in particular, ranks  of skilled technical cadres and workers and means of preventing  explosions.    During the past 5 years, on behalf of the state, the State  Science and Technology Commission (now the Ministry of Science,  Technology, and Environment) has guided research in  manufacturing industrial explosives. This has included many  state-level topics, an example of which is the KC-03 program.  The results of the research are very encouraging, and they have  soon been used in production. Almost all of the state-level  topics have been allotted to installations in the military, and  the topics have been inspected by more than 10 state-level  scientific and technical councils with the participation of the  Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment, the Labor  Safety Inspection Committee (Ministry of Labor, War Invalids,  and Social Affairs), the Fire Protection Department (Ministry of  Interior), explosives experts from the Science and Technology  Department and the Coalimex Corporation (Ministry of Energy),  the Mining and Geology College, the Military Technical  Institute, the Military Explosives Center [MEC], and the  National Defense Industry and Economics General Department. The  topics and products inspected include black explosives and  slow-burning fuses (Z121), Ammonite AD1 (Z113, Z121), fire  conducting line (Z121), lighted and electrical fuse boxes  (Z121), TX1 and TZ1A explosives (Z131), TMN 15 explosives  (Z115), VEOT explosives (MEC), Zerno 21/79 (Z121), TNT (Z131,  Z113, Z115), Watergel TNP1 (MEC), and Watergel TFD 15 (Z115). It  is predicted that Watergel TNP2 and gelatin explosives (MEC)  will be examined this year.    Since 1991, the Ministry of Science, Technology, and  Environment has given the task of building and improving  industrial explosives laboratories to the Military Explosives  Center and allotted funds to it for this. Today, explosives that  are produced domestically or imported from abroad are all  inspected at this center, with the exception of safety tests for  methane gas and coal dust, which are conducted in the explosion  chamber at the Mine Chemicals Enterprise (Coalimex).    Military installations have been given permission to  manufacture many types of fireworks, sky-rockets, mortars, small  firecrackers, ocean rescue flares, sports ammunition, and  bullets for hunting rifles to serve the needs of the people and  major festivals.    As for the national defense industry, the Z131 and Z113  plants plan to import the technology needed to manufacture  advanced industrial explosives. This will be imported from  several countries.    Gelatin explosives first began to be manufactured during the  late 1970s in France, Sweden, England, and the United States and  have been in common use in the world for the past decade. Sweden  calls this Emulite, and China calls this gelatin explosives.  Countries refer to this as oil gelatin, because it is composed  of two basic compounds: a very thin continuous oil compound  around a non-continuous compound consisting of very small drops  of an oxygenated saline solution one-tenth of a micron in size  having a strong bee-hive structure because of mixing the gelatin  agents. Besides this, people have said that as compared with  such highly explosive materials as gas bubbles, plastics, and  small crystals one-tenth micron in size, gelatin explosives have  many advantages. For example, they are very safe, they withstand  water well, they are very effective in breaking up rock, they  are easy to charge in the mines, they give off little poisonous  gas, and so on. Using watergel and gelatin explosives is the  path that we must follow in order to gradually replace the older  types of explosives such as ammonite, TNT, zerno, and dynamite.  Once we are able to produce these domestically, the cost of  gelatin explosives will drop greatly (approximately $500 per  ton). Today, imports cost about $700-1,100 per ton, depending on  the type and the country selling the explosives.    For several decades now, the state has had a policy of  closely controlling explosives. In 1968, it promulgated Standard  83 KHKT-LDTBXH-NV, which made the science and technology sector  -- formerly the State Science and Technology Commission -- and  the labor and internal affairs sectors responsible for  controlling all aspects based on the functions assigned. Today,  the general stipulation in our country is that the production,  storage, and circulation of industrial explosives, both within  and outside the military, are to be monitored by the Ministry of  Science, Technology, and Environment, the State Labor Safety  Inspection Committee, and the Fire Protection Department, and  things must be done in accord with Explosive Materials Standard  TCVN 4586-88 and Decision 237 QD promulgated by the State  Science and Technology Commission (now the Ministry of Science,  Technology, and Environment) on 10 June 1988.    In 1994, construction activities need more and more  industrial explosives to mine coal, quarry rock, manufacture  cement, build railroads and expressways, build hydroelectric  projects, and satisfy other needs of daily life. In the face of  this situation, we feel that the state should soon conduct  studies and establish mechanisms and procedures concerning  controlling the production of industrial explosives and, in  particular, concerning the supply and distribution of industrial  explosives. Steps must be taken to avoid irrational obstacles  and having to go through so many unnecessary intermediary steps  as at present. Some people think that controlling supply and  distribution should be unified in one ministry (the Ministry of  National Defense or the Ministry of Energy). Others think that  the Ministry of Energy should supply and distribute explosives  within the sphere of the coal sector and that the Ministry of  National Defense should supply and distribute explosives in the  other sectors. These plans are too bureaucratic and rigid. When  engaged in buying industrial explosives from foreign  corporations including ICI, SNPE, The Bac Phuong TQ Corporation,  and the NFC TQ Corporation. We observed that they directly  distribute and export the products that they produce without  having to go through any intermediary corporation.    Based on the specific situation concerning studying,  manufacturing, distributing, and controlling industrial  explosives in many countries and in Vietnam today, we propose  that if the state authorizes a sector to produce or import a  product, it should also allow that sector to directly supply and  distribute that product. This will reduce unnecessary  intermediaries, and reduce the cost of producing coal, cement,  ore, and rock and encourage research and the production of many  types of essential industrial explosives while still maintaining  safety and security. This is because each sector that produces,  supplies, and distributes industrial explosives will be  monitored by state organizations. We believe that in the coming  period, with respect to industrial explosives, new advances will  be made in research, production, and use to support the building  of our country.</p>

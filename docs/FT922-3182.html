			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Major steps back from row in Commons on Maastricht THE GOVERNMENT yesterday appeared to betray its growing fears over the strength of MPs' opposition to Maastricht by indicating that any Commons vote on the treaty would be avoided until at least the autumn. Amid an increasing acceptance, in private, by cabinet ministers that the government would lose a Commons vote on Maastricht at this stage, it emerged that Mr John Major's hint last week of a general debate before the summer recess was unlikely to be fulfilled. Ministers admit that next week's Irish referendum, the Lisbon European Community summit later this month and the French plebiscite in September may lead to a substantial change in the government's position. So far it has urged ratification of the treaty without renegotiation but rejection by another country could wreck that strategy. In spite of Mr Major's talk last night of 'overwhelming support' among Tories for his position, the government's reluctance to provoke a confrontation will be portrayed by Tory and Labour MPs opposed to the treaty as a retreat. It will fuel speculation that ministers will eventually admit that the Danish referendum result requires renegotiation, if not the dropping, of the treaty. A bill to ratify Maastricht will not return to the Commons until October, possibly later. However, ministers said the government's position was consistent with Mr Major's line of awaiting events. 'The way forward in the wake of what has happened is something which cannot be determined by one government. It depends on 12 governments,' a cabinet minister said. After a week of feverish speculation at Westminster - not helped by the absence overseas of Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary  - the unease over Maastricht at every level of the Tory party has become more apparent. Senior Tories said Mr Major would have to exert his authority over the party on his return. Tory Euro-sceptics, in the government and on the backbenches, are preparing to mount strong opposition to the treaty. Mr Bryan Gould, a challenger for Labour's leadership, said the government was in danger of 'sitting like frightened rabbits waiting for the onrush of events without having anything to say about what should be done'. In the Commons, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, responded to barbed questions from Tory Euro-sceptics by emphasising the importance Mr Major attaches to subsidiarity - the principle by which decisions are taken at the lowest appropriate level of government. Mr John Biffen, a former cabinet minister, added to government embarrassment by calling for the blocking of Mr Jacques Delors' reappointment as European Commission president.

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / EC Davids fending off Goliaths THE European Community's smaller member states seem to be winning the battle to stop the big powers trying to change the EC's decision-making procedures to favour the large member states. France in particular, but also Germany and the UK, have been looking at how to tilt the balance in their favour when the EC takes in up to four new member states - Austria, Sweden, Norway and Finland - around 1995. But ambassadors of the Twelve on Thursday night passed on to foreign ministers without amendment a paper from the Belgian presidency preserving intact for 16 member states the voting procedures which now apply for 12. Foreign ministers will have to decide, beginning probably at a special meeting on October 26, whether to preserve the status quo, or risk intra-EC confrontation and the alienation of the four applicant countries if the decision-making balance is altered. 'This is something we are prepared to die in the last ditch for,' said a senior Irish official, who warned that any strengthening of the larger member states' position at this stage could tear the Community apart. The Irish, along with the Dutch and the Danes, refuse to countenance any change now in the basic chemistry of the EC, which has a weighted majority voting system giving small states a real voice and influence. At enlargement negotiations in Luxembourg this week, ministers from the applicant countries rejected any reform of EC decision-making before they are inside and able to shape it. If reforms went ahead beforehand, 'we would end up joining another kind of Community, not the Community we originally applied to', warned Mr Pertti Salolainen, Finnish foreign trade minister. The larger member states fear the EC would be paralysed if it takes in a large influx of small countries under existing rules. But the Lisbon summit last year decided that the first wave of enlargement needed technical adjustment rather than reform, which would be put off until aspirant members from east and central Europe and the Mediterranean start accession negotiations.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA, NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> FUNDING INNOVATIVE TEACHING PROGRAMS  </P> <P> By the start of next year, children in science classes at Andersen Elementary  School will be able to watch their teacher perform experiments on a special,  mirrored lab table.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa High School biology students will study intertidal zones and  estuaries with special fieldwork labs, and Estancia High School students will  have access to a computer database with information from more than 200  countries.  </P> <P> The projects were among those that will be funded by grants from the  Newport-Mesa Schools Foundation, a nonprofit group that underwrites innovative  teaching programs. This year, 53 individuals received grants totaling almost  $40,000.  </P> <P> The projects were singled out for their contributions to academic excellence  and their practical application in the classroom, according to Reg Fifer, one  of the foundation directors.  </P> <P> Among them were money for a school nurse to purchase a vision testing kit to  identify students with early childhood sight problems, the purchase of new  science books to replace those written before 1960 in one school library, and a  set of books that teachers hope will help integrate classical literature into a  kindergarten language arts curriculum.  </P> <P> The grants, donated by the foundation in a lump sum, allow the district to fund  projects that it cannot afford.  </P> <P> Of the 49 grants given out, 11 went to fund science-related projects. Teachers  interested in improving computer-teaching tools received 10 of the grants, and  language arts, elementary reading, math and other projects split the remaining  grants. Teachers could receive a maximum of $1,000.  </P> <P> According to science teacher Kathleen Schwartz, who will be purchasing a  rolling, mirrored lab table for her classroom with her grant, smaller projects  often spark ideas for other teachers across the district.  </P> <P> "One of our precepts is 'Let's get a new idea going,' " said foundation  President Diana Long. "Then let's see how easy it is to extend that idea  throughout the entire district."  </P> <P> The foundation started in 1981, in an effort to make up for funds that were  lost after the passage of Proposition 13. Since then, the foundation has  distributed more than $450,000 to teacher projects.LAURA MICHAELIS  </P></p>

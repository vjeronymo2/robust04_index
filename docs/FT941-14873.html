			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bank Austria tries to force the pace / A look at attempts to reform a savings banking sector The long-awaited reorganisation of Austria's savings banks sector looks set to begin within weeks following growing pressure for action from two of the country's leading financial institutions. Conflicting interests and fear of change had stalled attempts at reform for the sector, which almost everyone in Austria agrees needs restructuring to reflect developments in the past two decades. During this time the number of savings institutions has declined by half while the number of branches quadrupled. Mergers have altered the balance of forces within the sector, which is dominated by the city of Vienna's Zentralsparkasse savings bank (now part of Bank Austria since it merged with the Landerbank in 1991), the Erste Osterreichische Spar-Casse, the second largest savings bank, and the five biggest provincial savings banks, with the smaller banks fighting to preserve their independence. After years of fruitless discussions and broken deadlines for agreement, Bank Austria, the country's largest commercial and savings bank, and the Erste warned this month that either the savings banks agree to Erste's proposals for restructuring the sector, or they will impose their own solution through a reorganisation of GiroCredit, the savings banks' clearing institution, in which they jointly hold more than 52 per cent. Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, Bank Austria chairman and chief executive, said a decision must be made by the end of February at the latest. The alternatives are: Bank Austria sells about two thirds of its 31 per cent stake in GiroCredit to a consortium comprising the Erste, Austria Collegialitat Versicherung (a leading insurance company) and the savings banks. Erste, which already owns about 21 per cent of GiroCredit, would buy an extra 10 per cent, making it the largest single shareholder. These shares plus all the shares in GiroCredit held by the savings banks would be transferred to a new holding company which would own GiroCredit. The holding company would gradually build up stakes in its participating banks. Failing agreement, Mr Haiden said the alternative is for Bank Austria and Erste together to act jointly as majority shareholders in GiroCredit, forcing changes on its supervisory and management boards, and a reassessment of its tasks and priorities. 'We have some thoughts about a possible future strategy for GiroCredit,' said Mr Haiden. The proposals hang or fall on a reorganisation of the shareholding structure of GiroCredit, which is owned by the savings banks and was established in 1937 to manage the funds of its affiliates and serve as a clearing institution for the whole sector. The problem is that GiroCredit has out-grown its original responsibilities by developing banking activities that increasingly compete with those of other banks, including some of its own shareholders. 'GiroCredit has built itself up as a commercial and investment bank and it is a fierce competitor (against) our bank or the Erste. It doesn't make sense,' Mr Haiden said. The reorganisation would help to refocus GiroCredit's banking activities, lead to considerable cost savings among the banks through synergies, and protect savings banks against foreign or domestic predators. 'It would be an important step to keep the savings bank sector intact, to avoid savings being sold to banks outside the savings banks sector,' says Mr Reinhard Ortner, executive board member at Erste. In the past, a large number of small and medium-sized savings institutions had small stakes in GiroCredit, which was able to dominate them, but as a result of mergers and consolidation, the seven largest savings banks now account for about 85 per cent of total business turnover for the savings banks. The large savings banks have no need for an institution like GiroCredit but the small banks need it more than in the past. 'GiroCredit should improve and deepen its relations with these savings banks,' Mr Haiden said. Mr Hans Haumer, GiroCredit chairman, hopes the holding company will be approved. 'It will end three years of uncertainty, and give a significant impulse to our activities. In the medium term it will create synergies in close co-operation with Erste and there will be significant gains in efficiency for the whole sector.' Failure would be a setback for GiroCredit, but he believes a solution will be found. 'A foreign bank could be a possibility (as a partner),' he says. The small savings banks have been lukewarm about the proposals, fearing they will lose more control over GiroCredit and be dominated by Erste. Only a handful bothered to answer a letter outlining Erste's proposals. 'The direct influence of small savings banks in GiroCredit is not that strong now. A holding company will give them at least as much influence as they have now,' Mr Ortner said. But he insisted 'the ball is in their court'.</p>

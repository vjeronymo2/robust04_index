			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 18 Jun (AFP) -- It was  officially reported here today that guerrilla threats could keep  about 12,000 citizens of Bolivar Department in northern Colombia  from voting in the 19 June presidential runoff elections.    Department Registrar Maria Rocio Cortes told the media that  "we still do not know how we are going to solve the problem"  created by the resignation of electoral delegates and voting  officers in 20 corregimientos of Simiti and Santa Rosa  Municipalities. She admitted that, despite the fact that units  from two Army brigades are in control of the area, the people  are just as afraid as they were during the 29 May elections,  when the abstention rate in the area reached 85 percent.    It has just been learned that with the support of regular  troops, efforts are being made to transport civil registry  personnel from other communities by helicopter so the elections  can be held.    In Medellin, the country's second largest city in the  northwest, a drop in the number of buses providing service was  noticed today due to threats by the People's Militias, which  yesterday burned a bus in an effort to hinder the elections.</p>

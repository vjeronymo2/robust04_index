			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Aids experts come to AZT's defence AZT will remain the cornerstone therapy for Aids in spite of the preliminary results of a large-scale Anglo-French study, published on Friday, that raises questions about the effectiveness of the drug, US Aids experts said. The so-called Concorde study should not cause alarm, medical experts and Aids activists in San Francisco stressed. The study 'doesn't really change what we already knew or suspected; that AZT when administered as a single therapy is not very effective,' said a spokesman for the San Francisco Aids Foundation, which offers counselling and support to those with the HIV virus. Current US treatment uses AZT (produced by Wellcome of the UK and marketed as Retrovir) in combination with other drugs such as DDI (didanosine, made by Bristol-Myers Squibb) or DDC (valcitabine, Roche), both of which have been approved by the FDA for treatment of HIV infection. This 'combination therapy' was developed as, in most patients, the HIV virus became resistant to AZT after six to 18 months, Aids experts said. It was not surprising the European study, which followed HIV-infected patients over a three-year period, showed the limitations of AZT. Early treatment of HIV infection is still critical, the experts maintain, as studies suggest the virus is active in the lymphoid tissues ' the lymph nodes, tonsils and spleen - during the so-called latent period, which can last up to 10 years after infection, and before symptoms appear.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Ruiz Calderon] </F>   [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio yesterday said the  first phase of the Great National Agreement (GAN), which deals  with bringing together the first sectors to discuss the  proposal, has been successful, given the positive response.    He highlighted the fact that "the organized private sector,  the government workers, and the cooperative organizations have  shown great will to collaborate. This forecasts a positive  response from the other sectors of the community and, in  general, demonstrates the achievements this government  initiative has made."    Despite the president's optimism, however, the Labor and  Popular Action Union, UASP, conditioned its participation in the  GAN talks to several points brought onto the scene by the  Executive Branch and asked for an open agenda. The private  sector says that dealing with social and economic issues at the  same time is an obstacle to the talks.    De Leon said that he will meet with members of CACIF  [Coordinating Committee for Agriculture, Commercial, Financial  and Industrial Associations] on Friday [18 February]. He will  meet with cooperative organizations next week. He already has a  positive response from various sectors. The president added that  he has "not been able to hear the other sector's proposals  because of the strike in which they are engaged. This does not  mean there has not been a generally positive response."    The president concluded by expressing optimism. He believes  the country will attain the goal of governability, which will  allow us to set the foundation for social structure changes  later on, "which is why the government will sign the agreements  and abide by them."</p>

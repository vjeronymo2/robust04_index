			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ZHAO AND UP TO 6 OTHER MODERATES REPORTED TARGETS OF PURGE IN CHINA  </P> <P> A conservative Chinese leader Friday indirectly denounced Communist Party chief  Zhao Ziyang's reformist faction for plotting "schemes and intrigues" against  the party, amid reports that Zhao and as many as six other moderates were  targeted for a purge.  </P> <P> The public attack was another indication that the conservatives had gained an  upper hand in the leadership power struggle that was provoked by the  student-led pro-democracy movement.  </P> <P> "The dogs are biting the dogs, fighting for a bone," said one Beijing resident,  describing the fiercest power struggle in a decade.  </P> <P> Chinese sources said hard-line leaders had summoned senior Communist Party  members to Beijing for a special meeting, and state radio broadcast an order to  rank-and-file party members to "carry on their duties" and "immediately quit  demonstrations."  </P> <P> Word of what could be the biggest leadership purge in a decade came as students  leading the democracy movement voted overwhelmingly to continue occupying  Beijing's central Tian An Men Square, despite increasing chances of a  crackdown.  </P> <P> But there were no protests Friday at the square, and the number of occupying  students camped in a shantytown of plastic tents dwindled to between 20,000 to  25,000.  </P> <P> Veteran party conservative Chen Yun, in a nationally televised address, warned  of a secret plot aimed at toppling paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and his  allies, including Premier Li Peng.  </P> <P> Chen did not mention Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang by name, but his attack  clearly was aimed at Zhao's liberal reformist faction of the party.  </P> <P> "We old comrades must resolutely expose and struggle against a very, very small  number of people who have fabricated schemes and intrigues, and never yield to  them," Chen said.  </P> <P> "This turmoil is truly not coincidental. One of the important reasons is that  for a certain period of time we have eased off education in Marxist thought,"  he said in language reminiscent of chaotic factional strife and leadership  struggles of the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution.  </P> <P> Chinese and Western sources said that Zhao, Defense Minister Qin Jiwei and as  many as five others were marked for a purge for opposing conservative Li's  decision to declare martial law a week ago and deploy troops in Beijing.  </P> <P> Zhao and Qin were believed to have been under a form of house detention all  week but had yet to be formally arrested, Chinese sources said.  </P> <P> The sources said the six were considered part of an "anti-party clique" that  failed to stem student protests that sparked the largest anti-government  demonstrations since the founding of the communist state in 1949.  </P> <P> Chinese sources said that in order to lend the coming purge an air of  legitimacy, the shake-up would not be announced until after the conservatives  succeeded in holding a special plenum of the party's Central Committee.  </P> <P> As the country awaited results of the power struggle, state radio broadcast an  order to rank-and-file party members.  </P> <P> "All party members have to remain in their posts, carry on their duties  carefully and observe martial law" and "immediately quit demonstrations, the  petitions, the strikes and the boycotting of classes."  </P> <P> Of China's 1 billion people, only 47 million are party members. Although some  party members joined in the pro-democracy protests, most demonstrators were  non-party students and workers.  </P> <P> Premier Li appeared to be consolidating his authority, after resurfacing  Thursday for the first time since the power struggle erupted and declaring the  Deng government "capable and stable."  </P> <P> The Communist Party newspaper People's Daily carried a statement Friday by the  political department of the Beijing region's military command throwing its  support behind the martial law decree issued a week ago Saturday by Li. The six  other military commands surrounding the capital had issued similar statements  earlier in the week.  </P> <P> Western diplomats said the army has moved more troops into the city's outskirts  in recent days. At least 80,000 soldiers were believed encircling the capital  after failing in initial attempts last weekend to break through citizens'  barricades, the diplomats said.  </P> <P> Li, whose resignation has been called for by the protesting students, said  Thursday that the army had stopped not because it was unable to move but  because it had been "tolerant" of the peaceful demonstrations.  </P> <P> The Western and Chinese sources said Zhao had been named as leading an  "anti-party clique." They noted that military statements backing the martial  law decree criticized a conspiracy by a "small group of people."  </P> <P> "At first we thought they meant the student leaders and those supporting them,"  a Western intelligence source said. "But it looks like they mean the people  with Zhao and against martial law."  </P> <P> Besides Zhao and Qin, others believed targeted included Zhao's former  secretary, Bao Tong, head of a Zhao-sponsored reformist think tank, and Hong  Xuezhi, a senior member of the National People's Congress, the Parliament.  </P> <P> Also included were Yan Mingfu and Wen Jiabao, both senior Central Committee  members, and Du Runsheng, director of the party's rural policy research center,  the sources said.  </P> <P> Zhao and Yan had tried to conciliate with the students, while the others were  criticized for supporting or being too tolerant of the protests or of  permitting news coverage of the demonstrations, sources said.  </P> <P> Leaders of the student movement, meanwhile, held a crucial all-night meeting in  Tian An Men Square, with 278 students voting to continue the sit-in that began  in earnest May 13, said Ji Cheng, a student at Beijing University.  </P></p>

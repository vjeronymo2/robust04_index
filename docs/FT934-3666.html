			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Plea on divorce pact rejected A divorced father who is being asked for extra money by the Child Support Agency failed yesterday to overturn a 'clean break' divorce settlement under which he gave up his share of the family home on the understanding that he would not pay maintenance. Mr Gary Crozier, of Gretna Green, Dumfriesshire, had asked the High Court to set aside the divorce settlement and give him his share from the sale of the home. Mrs Justice Booth said the settlement contained provision for nominal maintenance of 5p a year. This reflected the legal principle that the clean break formula had never applied to the on-going responsibility of parents to a child.</p>

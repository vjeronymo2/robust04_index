			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Repsol posts 1.8% advance ahead of further placing REPSOL, the Spanish oil and gas conglomerate being prepared for further partial privatisation by the Spanish government, yesterday reported a 1.8 per cent increase in net profits for 1992, to Pta71.43bn (Dollars 607m), despite a sharp drop in cash flow. Repsol said it was delighted with the results, 'particularly if one compares them with the rest of the sector'. Operating profits fell nearly Pta10bn to Pta119.8bn, while cash-flow, after tax, fell 10.4 per cent to Pta154.06bn. The Spanish government is planning to place up to 40m shares in Repsol - roughly 13.3 per cent of the group - with institutions in the Spanish and international markets before the end of May. The flotation could raise close to Dollars 1bn and, if fully used, will reduce the state's holding from 54.5 per cent to just over 40 per cent. Repsol said it had managed to squeeze the most out of a difficult year thanks to good returns on some recent investments and the impact of a tough cost reduction programme. The group had shed nearly 2,000 jobs over the year, bringing the workforce to 19,632 people. It posted a 77 per cent increase in operating profits to Pta18.6bn in its exploration and production division thanks, it said, to exploration successes and to a 20 per cent increase in crude production. As expected, however, Repsol's troubled chemicals division continued to suffer along with the rest of the international chemicals industry, losing Pta7.9bn after making a meagre operating profit of Pta1.2bn in 1991. The Repsol refining and marketing division saw operating income fall more than 16 per cent to Pta86.6bn partly because of new accounting rules, partly because it is having to shed service stations belonging to the Campsa group under EC monopoly rules and, lastly, because of tighter margins for refined products in international markets.

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Skiing into trouble - Insurance is a must on snow holidays Skiing holidays can do strange things to your perception of risk. Normally cautious and unsporty types launch themselves down steep, icy slopes towards cliff edges and pine trees without blinking an eye. Some even watch fanatics jumping off mountain tops with parachutes and think: 'I could do that.' A few, feeling their youth slipping away, may try to play teenagers on snowboards at their own game. If you are tempted to such recklessness, but then find yourself hurtling out of control towards a group of American lawyers, it might not be much comfort at the time to know that you have Pounds 1m worth of medical cover and another Pounds 1m personal liability. Later, you could be profoundly relieved. Insurance is essential for skiing trips, but make sure you know what you are covered for. Snowboarding is acceptable to most insurers, but many of them baulk at the idea of parapente - parachuting from mountaintops. Heli-skiing is equally unpopular. Off-piste skiing is a tricky point. A few feet the wrong side of the piste marker is one thing, but swooping across an avalanche-prone slope on the wrong side of the mountain is quite something else. Most of the specialists cover off-piste automatically but tour operators' own travel insurance, besides being more expensive, tends to have more exclusions. Drinking and skiing can be as dangerous as drinking and driving, although it remains more socially acceptable (at least in Europe). If you have an accident after several gluhweins too many, most insurance companies could theoretically refuse to pay up, citing clauses which oblige skiers to take 'reasonable care.' But since mountain rescue teams do not usually carry breath analysers, claims are unlikely to be challenged. Last year, specialist insurer Douglas Cox Tyrie took the controversial step of excluding theft of skis while unattended and unsecured. Thousands of pairs of skis are left propped outside mountain restaurants every day, but this clause meant you could not claim if yours were stolen. Other insurers refused to take the same view, however, and cover for unattended skis is now back. The most important elements of ski insurance are medical expenses and personal liability cover. After that, you might want cover for general baggage and ski equipment, plus cancellation, curtailment and delay. Then there is piste closure or no-snow cover, which pays out if your skiing holiday turns into a mud-sliding one. Some policies cover only the absolute essentials: Douglas Cox Tyrie's 'mini ski' policy is just for medical expenses, personal liability and personal accident insurance. This is aimed at people whose luggage is protected under home contents insurance and who can do without cancellation and no-snow cover. Fogg Travel also has a basic medical and liability-only package, called Medicard. The selling point is that, as the name suggests, the insurance comes with a card recognised as proof of insurance by mountain rescue services and hospitals in most European and some American resorts. Thus, those unlucky enough to need assistance do not have to hand over their credit card first (or have their skis ripped off their feet as security). Medicard costs Pounds 16 for up to 17 days in Europe, and Pounds 35 for the rest of the world. If you go skiing more than once a season, you might be interested in DCT's Flexiski package. This covers you for the whole season and any number of trips, although none of them can be for longer than 28 days. The policy costs Pounds 45 for the mini-ski cover and Pounds 85 for comprehensive protection. Some people seem still to believe - dangerously - that paying for their holiday by credit card and carrying a form E111 is all they need for insurance. But this is not the case unless yours is one of the few gold cards which does provide full annual travel insurance. The E111, which entitles British citizens to reciprocal medical care in the EC and some other countries, makes it cheaper to consult state doctors - but it does not run to mountain rescue services or private clinics. Even when the E111 can be used, you might have to pay cash at the time and reclaim it when you get home. The table gives an idea of comparative prices, but details of cover vary and it is important to check relevant points before choosing a policy.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                        INCLUSIVE SKI INSURANCE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                           Europe                 US/Worldwide                   10 days       17 days       10 days      17 days  --------------------------------------------------------------------- AA Travelsure     pounds44      pounds44     pounds96.50   pounds96.50 Bishopsgate       pounds30.25   pounds34.65  pounds74.60   pounds93.65 BUPATravel        pounds31.20   pounds34.70  pounds55.40   pounds62 Columbus          pounds20*     pounds28/??  pounds45??    pounds                                 pounds36????               59????

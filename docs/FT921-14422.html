			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Dividend rise lifts Southern Business shares SHARES IN Southern Business Group, the photocopier supplier which came under fire 18 months ago for its contractual practises, yesterday jumped 15 per cent as the company announced a modest rise in annual profits from Pounds 14m to Pounds 14.4m. Analysts said the share price, which closed 14p up at 106p, took heart from the decision to lift the final dividend from 1.62p to 1.91p, making a total of 2.94p. Profits were struck on turnover ahead 9 per cent at Pounds 51m. The group claimed forward contracting income - the total value of all its contracts - of Pounds 300m at the end of the year to September 30. The average life of Southern's contracts has been reduced from about nine years to six. Mr Roger Limpenny, finance director, said the company had spent a considerable amount of 'time, energy and money rectifying our past misdemeanors'. He was referring to accusations that Southern had offered onerous contracts, sold by salesmen employing high pressure techniques. The sales force had been retrained and Southern now boasted an endorsement from the Plain English Campaign on its revised contracts. Mr David McErlain, managing director, was equally anxious to quash any lingering doubts about Southern's practices. 'The criticisms caused us to take a long hard look at our company . . . That (in turn) enabled us to come in with results which have more than shown we have held our own in a difficult marketplace.' Earnings per share rose from 9.67p to 10.07p. COMMENT Reporting an increase in profits and turnover at a time when your main customers - small businesses - are falling at a rate of knots is not bad going. Then, to raise the dividend 15 per cent - indicating that 1992 is likely to be even better - will leave many competitors green with envy. Southern is rightly proud of generating so much cash last year, but that is partly a consequence of slower growth. When recovery comes, the company, which grew at an annual compound rate of 20 per cent between 1984 and 1990, is likely to have to return to shareholders for cash. For next year, forecasts are pitched at Pounds 16.1m, giving a prospective p/e of 9.5. For the moment, the shares appear to be undervalued.</p>

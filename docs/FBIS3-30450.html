Speaking at a press conference of the Christian Democratic  Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), of which he is a  member, Belehradek was reacting to Zhirinovskiy's interview with  the REUTER news agency of January 30. In it, Zhirinovskiy said  that the Czech Republic would soon lose Moravia and that all  that would be left of it would be Prague and several breweries  were the beer was turning bitter.    Belehradek said that "Stalin's spirit and Russia's  great-power policy" were radiating from the opinions of  Zhirinovskiy, the leader of Russia's nationalistic Liberal  Democratic Party.    He said that the KDU-CSL was sharply opposed to efforts to  divide Europe into German and Russian spheres of interest, and  added he did not understand at all why Moravia should become a  political card in the game of great-power interests.    Replying to journalists' questions, Belehradek admitted that  Zhirinovskiy probably knew little rather than much about  Moravia. There may exist "a certain card" which may have been  discussed with some representatives from Slovakia, because  Zhirinovskiy had mentioned Bratislava and Slovakia as well.</p>

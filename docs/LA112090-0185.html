			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> OIL FUELS AUSTRALIAN TAX CUTS  </P> <P> Treasurer Paul Keating gave Australians a $760-million tax cut today, financed  mainly by increased revenue from higher oil prices. Keating, calling his deal a  "golden opportunity" to trim inflation, cut taxes for salaried employees by an  average $2.24 a week.  </P> <P> The deal, combined with a previous wage pact for Australia's 7.9 million  payroll workers, will result in total tax cuts of $8.21 a week beginning Jan.  1. In addition, a $9.12 a week wage increase takes effect in mid-May.  </P> <P> The Australian Council of Trade Unions has approved the deal, which breaks the  traditional cycle under which employers have raised wages to match increases in  inflation.  </P> <P> Keating said that instead of having employers raise their wage bills and fuel  inflation with price increases, the government would "pay" workers by cutting  taxes.  </P></p>

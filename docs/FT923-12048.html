			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Observer: Whale of the day It's all rather tasteless. The anti-whaling nations are still trying to digest Norway's unpalatable decision to resume commercial whaling next year, yet Norwegian newspapers are teasing their readers' taste-buds with a battle to find the most delicious way to serve dead whale. Since the International Whaling Commission imposed a moratorium on whale-hunting in 1986, whale meat has rarely been found on the menus of Norway's finest restaurants. However, since Norway decided to get back into the whale-hunting business, the country's whale-eaters have resurfaced, spawning a shoal of their favourite whale recipes, often accompanied by full-colour newspaper pictures. Aftenposten, Norway's leading daily, has assured its readers that there will be enough meat to go round from the 120 whales allowed under the new quota, and suggests as dish-of-the day whale marinated in wine with finely-chopped leeks. Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister, who had been considered a champion of the environment since she chaired the UN World Commission on Environment, has yet to send in her favourite whale recipe to the local newspaper.</p>

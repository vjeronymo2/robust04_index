			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> $2-MILLION BAIL SET FOR TODD BRIDGES  </P> <P> Municipal Court Judge David Horwitz today granted bail in the amount of $2  million for actor Todd Bridges, charged with the attempted murder of a man  inside a reputed rock house.  </P> <P> Bridges, 23, the former child star of NBC-TV's "Diff'rent Strokes," had been  held in custody without bail since his arrest a month ago. Over the objections  of prosecutors, Judge Horwitz set bail at $2 million for the actor.  </P> <P> Bridges, however, will remain in custody without bail in a separate case in  Compton in which he is charged with stealing his BMW automobile at gunpoint  from a South Los Angeles repair man without paying a $500 bill.  </P></p>

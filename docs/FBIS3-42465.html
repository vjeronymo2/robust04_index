			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Text] We obtain a depiction of the structure of the  landscape of a  material in an atomic microscope based on the forces of  interaction between atoms in a microprobe and the material under  investigation. However, Swiss scientists warn that imperfections  in the tips can lead to spurious results.    In the 1 June APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS a case of an atomic  microscope misrepresenting the topography of a diamond film is  described. Examinations with a scanning electron microscope and  a scanning tunneling microscope revealed that the film surface  consists of sharp facets and edges formed by oriented crystals.  The atomic microscope presented this surface in the shape of  truncated pyramids, and the microprobe's tip had that same  squared-off shape.    Microprobe tips are etched in batches from silicon wafers.  The scientists found three flawed tips in a batch of 10. Dust or  imperfect processing technology could have been the cause of the  flaws. Scientists see the solution to the situation in  scientists calibrating the tips before beginning experiments.    SCIENCE NEWS, 13 June 1992, No. 24, p. 399.  <H5>  VIPER Explosives Detector </H5>   I. Cambridge (a division of Meggitt Control) is offering the  VIPER (Vapor Intensifier for Plastic Explosive Recognition)  portable explosives detector that permits the detection of  particles and vapors of plastic explosives.    Detection of plastic explosives is a difficult task due to  the low pressure of the vapors emitted by them. However, a trace  of explosive is adequate for the VIPER detector and therefore it  can be utilized to detect such explosives as hexogen, PETN, and  semtex, and also the more broadly used trinitrotoluene and  dynamite. The instrument is easy to use. Collection of samples  can be done using a vacuum technique or by wiping a surface with  a special cloth. Samples taken for the content of both vapors  and also particles of explosives are processed identically and  are placed in an analyzer.    The VIPER detector has already undergone testing at the Lima  Peru airport, where it was used to inspect the baggage of all  passengers of three international American airlines for three  days. Security forces managed to completely inspect  approximately 1,000 items for explosives content thanks to the  detector's rapid operation (no more than three seconds) and  operation in real time with a low probability of false alarm.

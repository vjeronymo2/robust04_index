			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mates's allegations on Polly case rejected EVIDENCE emerged yesterday to contradict many of the allegations in Mr Michael Mates's resignation speech concerning the conduct of the investigations into Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman. Mr Mates said in his speech: 'The SFO launched a highly publicised raid on October 30 1990 on the headquarters of PPI . . after the company was in administration . . beginning a process of trial by media.' Journalists were present at the time of the raid on the company, as they were during other SFO raids such as when Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell were arrested. PPI was in administration at the time. Since the time of Mr Nadir's arrest in December 1990 - and until he skipped bail in May with little likelihood of returning - newspapers were in fact constrained by potential contempt of court in what they said, for fear of prejudicing his trial. 'The SFO did not go to northern Cyprus as requested by Mr Nadir's defence lawyers, even though they visited the island to make other criminal inquiries in the past.' Foreign Office officials say the northern Cyprus authorities have adopted a two-track policy for access of British police. There is full co-operation in waiving the need for official paper on issues such as drugs and the return of deported northern Cypriots to the island. Whenever the Nadir case is raised, northern Cyprus insists that cooperation must be conducted formally government-to-government which the Foreign Office cannot allow because the UK does not recognise the state diplomatically. The Metropolitan Police says that two officers mentioned by Mr Mates were on the island for deportation duties unrelated to Mr Nadir. One senior police officer yesterday conceded it may have been possible that one or two of the officers may have asked about Mr Nadir in conversations with local people, but they were doing so in personal capacity and did not form part of official investigations. 'There is evidence of improper collusion between a senior officer of the Inland Revenue and the SFO.' Mr Michael Allcock, head of the Inland Revenue's special office 2, which deals with high-profile and international tax investigations, was suspended in September last year and is under police investigation. Mr Michael Jones, his solicitor, yesterday stood by his earlier statement that his client was 'instrumental in the detection of Mr Nadir's affairs and the subsequent referral thereof to the Serious Fraud Office.' It is understood that Mr Allcock passed to the Stock Exchange some of the information he came across during an investigation into Mr Nadir's tax affairs. The Exchange and the Inland Revenue swap information on an informal basis, according to officials. But the Inland Revenue said it is by law not permitted to release details of taxpayers' affairs to third parties except when ordered to by the courts. Mr Jones does not deny that as part of his job Mr Allcock may have had some contact with the SFO. He strongly rejects the suggestion that this could amount to anything improper. He said nothing he had been told by the police indicates that Mr Allcock's suspension had anything to do with the Nadir case, although Mr Nadir's camp has accused Mr Allcock of being part of a conspiracy against him. Mr Jones understands that his client was suspended pending an investigation into allegations of corruption and bribery. He said no criminal charges have yet been brought and Mr Allcock has not so far been interviewed by police. 'Papers from documents taken by the SFO in the October 1990 raid were passed to the administrators.' Administrators to PPI at accountants Touche Ross confirmed that they did receive some papers from the SFO after the raid at the time of administration, but said they related to the company and they were therefore entitled to receive them. Court-ordered raids on Mr Nadir's property coordinated by Mr Neil Cooper, his trustee in bankruptcy, took place earlier this year. These removed a number of Mr Nadir's personal effects including his diaries. Mr Cooper says he only took this action as a final resort because Mr Nadir refused to cooperate. 'Improper influence has been exercised by the SFO when it claimed police were investigating an alleged attempt to bribe the trial judge, Mr Justice Tucker. The police had never declared their intention to do so.' When the allegations were first made in the court, they were taken seriously by both the SFO and the Metropolitan police investigating them. They were later dismissed as an attempt to destabilise the trial. 'The SFO suggested a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by Mr Nadir, Mr Anthony Scrivener, his defence counsel, Mr Wyn Jones, Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner, and Mr Justice Tucker. This was unfounded.' Since the hearing was in camera, it is unclear whether the allegations were made by counsel to the SFO or the Department of Public Prosecutions. But the suggestions were never taken seriously by anyone who was in the hearings. 'Whose agenda was being served by publication (of Mr Mates' letter to the attorney-general)?' Mr Mates says only Mr Nadir, the attorney-general and the SFO had copies. The SFO claims its investigators did not have copies. Others suggest it may be in Mr Nadir's interest to leak information which makes his chance of obtaining a fair trial in the UK impossible.</p>

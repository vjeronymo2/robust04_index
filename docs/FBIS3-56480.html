			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko has  expressed surprise and disagreement with his Russian counterpart  Andrey Kozyrev's statement saying Moscow will not write off  Kiev's debt for fuel imports from Russia as compensation for the  withdrawal of the nuclear weapons Ukraine had inherited from  ex-USSR. He spoke in an interview with Interfax on Friday.    Ukraine's debt for fuel imports from Russia ran at more than  1 Tn rubles as of December 1, 1993, according to Russia's  government statistical committee.    Earlier in the day, Kozyrev told Interfax that Kiev would  receive fuel grade uranium for its nuclear reactors but "any  write-off of the Ukrainian debt is out of the question."    For his own part, President Kravchuk, speaking at a news  conference in the Ukrainian embassy on Friday, said Moscow was  committed to compensating Ukraine both for long range and  tactical nuclear weapons.    Kravchuk said Ukraine is to receive compensation in fuel  grade uranium for the withdrawal of the long range weapons from  its territory but Moscow will be solely in charge of exports of  500 tons of the uranium reprocessed from the nuclear warheads.    The Ukrainian leader said experts on the three sides were  yet  to define the amount and form of compensation for the tactical  nuclear weapons to be withdrawn from Ukraine. He believes one  option is to write off Kiev's debt for fuel imports from Russia.    As he rejected Kozyrev's statement, the Ukrainian minister  said the write off formula was laid down in the tripartite  agreement.</p>

Kozyrev, who is on a visit to China from Wednesday, held a  press conference on Friday in Beijing before leaving for  Shenzhen and said that the North Korean nuclear problem was  discussed during his talks with Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen.    He and Qian confirmed again their countries' opposition to  the possession of nuclear weapons both by North and South Korea,  he said.    Kozyrev said they are watching the situation on the Korean  peninsula and that the principle of nuclear nonproliferation  should be maintained for world peace and stability.    He said Russia and China should help solve the North Korean  nuclear crisis.    There is the least possibility right now of war breaking out  in the Asia-Pacific region since the Second World War, he said,  but there still are chances of disputes among nations in the  area.    He added that the positions of Russia and China on North  Korea are very similar.    Kozyrev also said that he discussed with Qian ways to  strengthen friendly and economic cooperation and to promote  bilateral relations.    He hinted that he has discussed with Qian on ways of  military  cooperation between their two nations, but did not elaborate.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: Prices weaken as Bundesbank leaves rates alone European government bonds weakened in moderate turnover following the Bundesbank's decision to leave German interest rates unchanged. Although few market participants had seriously expected a rate-cut announcement, there had been lingering hopes for a small cut in the 6.25 per cent emergency Lombard rate, or an announcement of fixed-rate securities repurchase agreements at a lower rate. 'It was a classic case of silly stories making the rounds,' said Mr Huw Roberts, European bond strategist at NatWest Markets. He expects the Bundesbank to continue lowering its repo rate gradually in coming weeks. Until the Bundesbank's council returns from its four-week Easter break, central-bank watchers will shift their gaze to the US Federal Reserve, whose open-market committee is due to meet on Tuesday. Many European dealers are hoping for another Fed tightening sooner rather than later. This, accompanied by further European rate cuts, is seen to help European bonds separate from the US Treasuries market. After firming at the open on short-covering in the futures market, UK gilts took another tumble after German rates were left unchanged. Moreover, after reports of overseas selling on Tuesday, some traders said the market was awash with unwanted supply. The Treasury's announcement that it was giving the Bank of England greater freedom to operate in the gilts market had little impact - if anything, traders said, it should have had a positive effect, as it may make gilt issuance more transparent. The June long gilt future fell by  19/32 point to 111 5/32 . German bunds shed about  1/2 point in the 10-year maturities, with traders reporting most activity in the futures pits. The June bund futures contract fell 0.45 point to 97.23. French government bonds weakened roughly in line with bunds, and traders are now focusing on next Thursday's meeting of the Bank of France's policy council. They hope it may follow the recent small easing on Germany's repo rate. 'If the German repo rate falls again next week, we could see a move from the Bank of France,' said NatWest's Mr Roberts. France's 6.10 per cent intervention rate currently stands 22 basis points above the Bundesbank's repo rate. Rollovers from March into the June futures contracts on Matif dominated trading, with investors reported to be largely sidelined. The March notional bond future closed 0.46 point lower on the day, and fell another 0.34 point in after-hours trading. Spanish bonds got an early lift when the the Bank of Spain injected overnight funds at a slightly lower rate. However, the late weakness in other bond markets dragged Spanish bonds lower, with the June futures contract ending at 101.12, down 0.19 point. The June Italian BTP futures contract fell 0.52 point to 111.58. After a two-day rally, the US Treasury market consolidated yesterday despite news of low inflation and moderating growth in a regional economic survey. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 11/32 at 92 23/32 , with the yield rising to 6.821 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note eased  1/16 to 99 7/16 , to yield 4.913 per cent. Early on, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's March business outlook survey brought a new ray of optimism to the market. The report's current prices-paid index came in at a tame 16.0, compared with 30.4 the previous month, while the overall business activity index slipped to 24.1, against a prior reading of 26.7. Separately, the Labor Department said the initial claims for state unemployment benefit receded last week, a development generally anticipated by analysts. Overall, the data reinforced the impression that inflation was not a threat to the value of fixed-rate securities, as suggested by this week's figures on consumer and producer prices. Traders responded by bidding up bond prices to modestly higher levels. However, after two straight days of strength - a rarity in recent weeks - they could not resist the impulse to book profits. Despite the good numbers, the market was holding a cautious tack ahead of the Fed's policy-making session next Tuesday. A second move by the central bank to boost short-term interest rates is expected to coincide with the meeting.</p>

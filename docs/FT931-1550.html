			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (8): Complaining in code - The early results of tougher lending criteria SMALL COMPANIES in the UK and the US have complained bitterly about their treatment at the hands of banks. In Japan the complaints may be more coded, but they are just as heartfelt. Bad loan books, weak balance sheets and a declining capital base have forced Japan's commercial banks to tighten up their lending criteria - perhaps even more so than their western counterparts. At the same time the slump in stock prices has cut off access to equity capital for most companies. And much of the equity warrant related finance raised in the heyday of the boom economy is due to be repaid in the next 18 months. A great deal has been made of the tidal wave of some Y10,000bn of warrant-backed paper which companies will have to refinance in 1993, but it would appear to be the least serious of the problems. Most of the money was raised by large blue chip companies which either do not need to replace the borrowings because of falling capital expenditure, or have little difficulty raising money from banks, insurance companies or the bond market. According to Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith of Credit Suisse Japan, some 70 per cent of this year's capital requirement may already have been financed through straight bond issues. As short term interest rates have fallen, bonds have become a more attractive investment for many institutions, so blue chip companies have found a ready market. And while the dividends of 5-6 per cent which companies are having to pay on new bond issues are well above the near-zero cost of capital of the bubble economy years, the higher interest bill is only a modest drain on corporate cashflows. Because banks and insurance companies are now more cautious, but still need to book assets, competition to lend to high quality companies is, if anything, more intense than it was in the 1980s. Mr Hideya Kubo of Nippon Life highlights the dilemma: 'We are keen to expand our lending to quality companies, but it is very hard at present because so few companies want to borrow. With a significant rise in the stockmarket unlikely, and yields on shares too low, we have been forced to hold a lot of domestic bonds. And now that yields on these have fallen too, we may have to consider more overseas bonds as well.' Nippon Life is also trying to establish more regional relationships in Japan so that it can increase its lending to large regional companies outside the Tokyo area. 'We have established contacts with over 400 new companies in the last year,' says Mr Kubo. Still, even if large companies can get the limited finance they need as they struggle to strengthen their balance sheets, small companies face a harder time. In February the Japanese ministry of finance publicly called on the banks to make more loans to small companies: a tacit admission that there is a credit crunch in some sectors at least. This contradicts the banks' argument that they have only returned to pre-bubble criteria for assessing loans, and that they have not become overly conservative. Mr Yasuo Noda, managing director of Dai-Ichi Kango Bank, puts the case: 'It is true that growth in lending is low, but that partly reflects borrowers balance sheet needs. Demand for loans is falling too. We can earn a higher spread from lending to small firms so we do want to lend to good small companies.' The difficulty comes in judging what is a creditworthy small business. Mr Noda acknowledges that while bank managers are under instructions not to overreact, there may be a natural tendency to become over-cautious when so much lending has gone bad in recent years. And Mr Kenji Mitzutani, the senior managing director at Tokai bank, admits that 'small companies may find it more difficult to get further loans, particularly if they want to use property as collateral.' The property issue is important because in many cases it is the only security small businesses can offer. Prices of residential land have fallen by about a third, but there are no reliable figures for commercial property because the market has simply dried up. Some analysts think that the property market may fall by another quarter before it hits bottom. Difficulty in valuing any collateral on offer is one more reason for banks to be nervous. Many companies, even quite small ones, have made life harder for themselves by speculating in the boom years and coming to grief. For example, Yanmar, an agricultural tools manufacturer, has a finance subsidiary with substantial debts. It may have to sell the land on which its headquarters stands, simply to repair its balance sheet - something no Japanese company would normally consider. If bank finance is hard to come by, equity is almost impossible to raise. In Nagoya - Japan's third city, located right in the centre of its manufacturing heartland - there is a queue of medium sized companies just waiting to get a listing on the local stock exchange. Mr Ichiro Kawai, president of the Nagoya Stock Exchange (NSE), says: 'It has been harder and harder to get a listing for small and medium sized companies on the NSE since the supplementary budget last August. I know of at least seven companies which want a listing as soon as possible, but they will have to wait at least until the next financial year which starts in April.' There are plenty of companies behind them. Mr Kentaro Sakai, president of the Nagoya-based Maruman Securities, thinks that over 30 companies would like to come to the Nagoya market in the next year or so. But with little money flowing into the equity market, getting such issues underwritten will be tough. (The government has acknowledged as much, by pulling issues such as the flotation of JR East railways and a further tranche of NTT stock, despite the fact that it would help fund the expanding budget deficit.) Though life is tough, there is at least a partial silver lining. With official interest rates going down, many small firms have seen some fall in their financing bills - even those whose banks have widened out their lending margins. And in Japan there is still a culture of saving businesses wherever possible, rather than grabbing the collateral and throwing the company to the receiver.</p>

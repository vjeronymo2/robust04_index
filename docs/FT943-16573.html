			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Media Futures: The French connection - John Ridding looks at the country's growing multimedia businesses / The world's superhighways For the past month, Parisian movie buffs have had a new source of satisfaction. By popping a card in their visiopass cable box, they can link up to a new pay-per-view movie channel launched by France Telecom and its multimedia partners. For FFr29 (Pounds 3.45), excluding the rental cost of the cable connection, subscribers can save a trip to the cinema. The pay-per-view movie channel is one of the services leaving the drawing board of France Telecom Multimedia. Set up in March, its aim is to keep pace with the international multimedia industry, particularly in the US, and exploit what the state-owned telecommunications company sees as 'a major growth market' for the group. With the liberalisation of Europe's telecoms market scheduled for 1998, the development of multimedia is also a source of alternative revenues for the world's third largest telecoms operator. The task of tapping this new source of income falls to Gerard Eymery, chairman of the new multimedia operation. 'We have to find new products and services,' he says. 'It is not a problem of networks or terminals, but one of discovering what consumers want.' As Eymery points out, interactive telecommunications services are nothing new to France Telecom or the French public. For the past ten years, millions of French fingers have been tapping away daily on the keyboards of Minitel teletext monitors, searching for information on everything from job opportunities to dating partners, paying bills and booking rail tickets. 'There are now more than 23,000 different services,' says Jean-Paul Maury, director of the Minitel project when it was launched in 1979. After its first decade of service, and with 6.5m Minitel terminals now installed, he says the Minitel is making a return on investment. But if it has come of age, the next generation of multimedia activities is still in its infancy. 'We are at the testing stage,' says Eymery, referring to his new projects. Next to be tested, following the launch of the pay-per-view movie service, are a video game channel and a home shopping channel. The games channel, to be developed in conjunction with Matra-Hachette, the electronics-to-publishing group, is due to be launched this Autumn. The tele-shopping channel is expected to start services by the end of the year, and is due to be followed by other products, such as a channel for betting on horse races and one for small advertisements. The various projects reflect France Telecom's strategy of entering Multimedia through partnerships. The pay-per-view movie company is a joint investment with Lyonnaise des Eaux, the construction and communications group which operates the cable television network in the Paris area. TF1, the television channel, and CLT, the Luxembourg broadcasting group are also partners in the project. Negotiations are currently under way to determine the allies in the tele-shopping venture. Further afield, France Telecom has taken an unspecified equity stake in General Magic, the California-based international multimedia group. Last month the French state telecoms group announced it would take a 15 per cent stake in a Japanese multimedia group, alongside 19 Japanese companies, including Mitsubishi, Casio and Seiko. The search for partners, says Eymery is driven by strategic considerations. 'We are seeking to develop higher-value added services, so we need to tie up with companies with expertise in relevant areas.' Financial considerations are a secondary consideration, partly because of the relatively small scale of the investments involved. The total outlay on the pay-per-view service has been about FFr60m. The home shopping channel is expected to require a total of between FFr80m and FFr90m. But what of the returns? Eymery accepts that progress will be gradual. 'All new media services take a long time to establish themselves,' he says. 'That has always been the case, ever since the introduction of the television.' Maury concurs. Even in the US, he says, expectations have exceeded reality in predicting the impact of multimedia. In France, an additional constraint is presented by the low rate of cable subscription. The government's ambitious 'Plan Cable' launched in the early 1980s, cleared the way for the construction of a state-of-the-art cable network. But the high costs of construction, partly passed on to consumers, and the controversial decision in the second half of the decade to grant licences to new terrestrial and satellite broadcasters has resulted in a disappointing level of penetration. There are currently about 5.5m households linked to the cable network, but just 1.4m subscribers. This is one of the lowest rates of penetration in Europe, and compares with 15m subscribers in neighbouring Germany. 'France has made just about every mistake in cable that it was possible to make,' says Eymery. He believes the creation of new television channels has been largely to blame for the cable industry's problems. Despite such obstacles, however, France Telecom says that pay-per-view has had an encouraging start. Subscribers are watching an average of 1.7 films per month, more than in the US, for similar services, although the novelty factor may be a consideration. Within five to ten years, claims Eymery, annual revenues from pay-per-view could reach between FFr300m and FFr400m. Turnover from all of France Telecom's multimedia activities could climb to between FFr5bn and FFr10bn by early next century, he believes. Annual revenues from Minitel are already approaching FFr7bn, derived from almost 90m hours of connections by subscribers per year. But will the traditional videotext service be threatened by new products from France Telecom's multimedia subsidiary? Both Maury and Eymery believe not. At least not yet. 'We will provide an extension to Minitel services,' says Eymery, who argues that the limitations on image quality on Minitel and the different services being provided by the multimedia division will lead to complementarity rather than competition. Maury believes there is still a solid foundation for Minitel. 'If you just need a telephone number then you don't need multimedia,' he says, referring to the system's core directory service, still the single largest source of demand from Minitel users. He believes growth will be maintained through the addition of more sophisticated services and through higher quality sound and images, particularly through connections via personal computers. Within the next few months, France Telecom is due to launch the high-speed Teletel Vitesse Rapide which, it says, will permit faster connections and improved image quality for Minitel users. A minitel terminal with a smart card reader is also due to be launched, allowing remote payment from home using bank cards. In the longer term, however, with the promise of information superhighways, both minitel and the existing cable network may run into technical constraints. 'Down the road, business and private consumers may want faster systems with higher quality images,' says one telecommunications analyst in Paris. 'This would require the creation of a fibre optic network linking households and companies,' he adds. The creation of a nationwide fibre optic network, linking households, is currently a topic of hot debate in France. Anxious not to be left behind by developments in the US and Japan, the government has commissioned a report into so-called 'autoroutes d'information' or information superhighways. The report, by Gerard Thery, former managing director of France Telecom, is due by the end of July. France Telecom is already expanding its network of fibre optic cables. Charles Rozmaryn, managing director of the company, says the target is to install 2m km of optical fibres in the national network by the year 2000, compared with a current figure of 820,000km. For the moment, however, the fibre optic network is not being extended to households. And many are sceptical about the costs and returns that such an extension would generate. 'It would take an investment of maybe FFr200bn to link French households through fibre optic cables,' says Eymery, who argues the investment would not generate adequate returns in the near future. Besides, he already has enough on his drawing board. Previous articles this series: Italy (May 30), Japan (June 13).</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Russia urged to favour pro-reform areas THE collapse of the rouble against the dollar on Moscow's narrow inter-bank market yesterday underlines the wider problems caused by shortage of capital, the need for positive interest rates to attract capital, and the importance of concentrating investment in specific regions of Russia where pro-market reformers are in power. This was the conclusion of discussion on 'local power and economic change in Russia' conducted by Professor Philip Hanson of Birmingham University at the Royal Institute of International Affairs yesterday. 'The size of the country, the lack of a consensus on reform, the lack of a functioning legal system or the means of coercion means that local power is crucial to the outcome of economic reforms,' he said. His views on the importance of the local factor, in a country which has disintegrated into 82 administrative regional units ranging from big cities like Moscow and St Petersburg to obscure ethnic and geographical outposts, were reinforced by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, architect of the still-born '500-day reform programme' rejected by former President Mikhail Gorbachev. To prevent the 'chaotic, individualistic disintegration of Russia accompanied by frustration and violence' Moscow should concentrate on re-establishing monetary discipline and control of banking, credit and monetary policy accompanied by maximum devolution of other powers. 'Devolution is preferable to disintegration. It recognises the reality that, for the first time in its history, Russia has to keep itself together without force applied through a centralised bureaucracy,' he told a meeting at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Mr Yavlinsky is currently working with the EBRD and the International Finance Corporation on fostering privatisation in Nizhny Novgorod, one of the reformist areas receptive to market reforms which, if successful, could serve as models for wider emulation. 'Micro-projects of the Nizhny Novgorod type provide an example of civilised decentralisation and the basis of new types of linkages to replace the authoritarian, top-down structures under which Russia has been ruled since Peter the Great,' he argued. But with the disintegrating Russian economy now on the brink of hyper-inflation the monetary authorities must raise real interest rates to positive levels to encourage higher savings and more rational investment. Russia must also push ahead with privatisation of key sectors like land, energy, gold and diamonds in order to raise the efficiency of key productive sectors and ensure the irreversibility of reform. 'At the moment everything is still nominally state-owned, so those who oppose reform only have to take over the state to get all their power back again,' Mr Yavlinsky warned. The Soviet coup leaders are to be freed from jail but prevented from leaving the country pending a trial set yesterday for April 14, Leyla Boulton writes from Moscow. Of the 12, seven have already been released from custody, and the remaining five were allowed to go home yesterday on the grounds of illness. An incompetent prosecution of the case, plus growing popular sympathy for the former Soviet leaders, suggests that the trial may not even go ahead in the end.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW CREEPS UP 1.52 AFTER SEESAW SESSION  </P> <P> Wall Street stocks eked out a gain today, supported by strength in  transportation stocks and some drug companies, after a seesaw session pushed  the market up and down throughout the day.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.52 points to 2,728.15 after falling  16.73 points Tuesday.  </P> <P> Despite the slight gain in blue chips, transportation stocks soared on  continuing takeover speculation.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones transportation average rose 22.94 points to 1,529.52, shattering  its previous record set Tuesday.  </P> <P> In the broader market, gaining issues led declines 8-7 in fairly active trading  of 174.35 million shares.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bond Prices Rise  </P> <P> Bond prices continued higher in early trading today.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 3/16 point, or nearly $2 per $1,000  face amount, while its yield, which falls when prices rise, dropped to 8.18%  from 8.21% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> The bond market, normally leery of strong economic growth because it raises  inflation risks, held up well after the government reported that personal  incomes rose a healthy 0.7% in July, the best gain in four months.  </P> <P> In addition, consumer spending climbed 0.7%, its fastest pace in three months,  the Commerce Department reported today.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the government significantly revised upward its estimate of total  economic growth, showing that the gross national product was growing at a  healthy annual rate of 2.7% in the April-June quarter instead of the anemic  1.7% GNP rate originally reported.  </P> <P> Bond traders took the GNP report in stride because it was accompanied by a  slight downward revision in an inflation indicator that is tied to GNP.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Treasury Issues Rise  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  rose about 3/32 point, intermediate maturities rose about 1/8 point and  long-term issues were up about 1/4 point, according to Telerate Inc., the  financial information service.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, rose 3.30 to 1,175.46.  </P> <P> Moody's investment grade corporate bond index, which measures total return on a  portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose  0.17 to 327.87.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Yields Decline  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8% as the discount fell 5 basis  points to 7.85%.

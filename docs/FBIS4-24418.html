			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhang Min (1728 2404) and He Guanggao (6320 </F> 0342 7559)]    [Text] Beijing, 27 May (XINHUA) -- A television film "The  Great Wall Is in My Heart" -- a joint production of the  Mobilization Department of the General Staff Headquarters and  the Mass Work Department of the General Political Department --  whose title was inscribed by Jiang Zemin, has been completed.  The eight-part defense education series will soon be  distributed to people's armed forces departments across the  nation.    "The Great Wall Is in My Heart" is China's first  comprehensive and systematic educational TV film on national  defense. Guided by the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism-Mao  Zedong Thought and based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his ideas on  army building in the new period, the series employs a large  amount of stirring historical data and illustrative facts in  presenting a vivid picture of how the three generations of CPC  leadership collectives care about and value defense buildup.  The series, which gives publicity to the series of principles  and policies for China's national defense buildup; the  achievements scored in this regard; and national defense laws  and regulations including the "Military Service Law"; and  disseminates modern defense knowledge, is visual teaching  material on defense education for the broad mass of militiamen,  reservists, and youngsters.</p>

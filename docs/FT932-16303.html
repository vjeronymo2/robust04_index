			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Bonds: Flow of new issues slackens ahead of Easter break THE FLOW of new Eurobond issues started to peter out yesterday, as banks wound down their activities ahead of the long Easter weekend, and after record volume in the first quarter of the year. Interest in the French franc sector of the market is resuming, following last month's National Assembly elections. Now that the change in the balance of power in favour of the right wing coalition has been absorbed, hopes of some reduction in interest rates are spurring the market forward, with five-year bonds outperforming 10-year paper, resulting in a steepening of the yield curve. Solvay, the Belgian chemical company, launched a FF1bn issue of five-year bonds paying 7.9 per cent, priced to yield 85 basis points over comparable French government paper. The proceeds of the issue, which was swapped into floating-rate francs, will be used to pay off shorter-dated debt. Meanwhile, the flow of Latin-American deals continued with a Dollars 50m deal for Banco Braseg, guaranteed by the Brazilian subsidiary of the French insurance company, Assurances Generales de France. The two-and-a-half year deal, arranged by West Merchant Bank, was priced to yield 750 basis points over the interpolated yield curve. Another Brazilian bank, BBA Creditanstalt, is planning to launch a deal next weak via ING Bank, adding to the recent surge of issuance by Brazilian banks. Elsewhere, Bayerische Landesbank launched a subordinated floating-rate note with a floor or minimum interest rate of 5 per cent and a cap or maximum of 8 per cent, in line with other recent 'collared' floaters. The deal, arranged by UBS, pays interest at  1/4 -point below the London interbank offered rate. Despite the reduction in cap levels from 10 per cent, when the first such deals were launched last summer, investor demand seems to be holding up. 'Investors seem to be focusing on the upfront benefit provided by the floor rather than on the cap,' said one dealer.</p>

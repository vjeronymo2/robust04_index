			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 17 TASS--The Russian State Duma  voted down a proposal of the Liberal Democratic Party [of  Russia, LDPR] of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to declare an amnesty to  organisers of the 1991 abortive Soviet coup, of the October 1993  opposition armed revolt in Moscow and of the bloodshed caused by  hard-line opposition during May Day demonstration last year.    Member of the LDP Viktor Vishnyakov told lawmakers that the  1991 coup organisers are being tried "for nothing" as, according  to him "they protected the Constitution" and their only fault  was the abuse of office. The 1991 coup plotters include several  former Soviet top officials, two of who were elected to the new  parliament.    Vishnyakov said that it is hard to legally assess the May 1  developments and added that the clash between police and  hard-line demonstrators was "a provocation from police".    The main organisers of the bloodshed, according to  investigators, are die hard opposition members Viktor Anpilov  and Ilya Konstantinov, both of who were arrested after the  October armed revolt in Moscow.    Dwelling on the October events, Vishnyakov said he would not  like to "lose time in order to provide a legal assessment" of  the developments. He proposed to first declare an amnesty to  the organisers and then probe the reasons of the standoff which  ended when tanks sent by President Boris Yeltsin pounded the  headquarters of the opposition.    The main culprits of the October events are former  Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy, former parliament speaker  Ruslan Khasbulatov and former Security Minister Viktor  Barannikov.    Although the Duma voted down the proposal of the LDP, it was  forwarded, together with other versions of the amnesty, to the  parliamentary committees on legislation and legal reform and on  security and defence for improval.

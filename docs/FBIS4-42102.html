			<p>BFN     [Text] Spain and Cuba signed an investment promotion and  protection agreement yesterday that, in the foreseeable future,  will stimulate the flow of more Spanish capital into the island,  capital that hitherto has been concentrated in the tourist  industry. At the end of the meeting in Havana of the joint  commission on economic and industrial cooperation, the agreement  was signed by Ernesto Melendez, the Cuban minister for foreign  investment and economic cooperation, and Apolonio Ruiz Ligero,  the Spanish secretary of state for foreign trade.    The most important aspect of the agreement is that it  establishes measures to stimulate and protect investment. It  provides for arbitration and conciliation mechanisms and has a  very positive psychological effect, said the Spanish  representative, who stressed that the aim is to encourage  sectors other than the tourist industry because Cuba could  become a highly attractive country for the Spanish economy.</p>

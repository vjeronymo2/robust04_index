[Cardenas] I and other people from my party have been  pointing out for a long time the ill-advised nature of the  neoliberal technocratic model implemented in Mexico since 1982  and the macroeconomic unsuitability of this model here, which  has prompted a heavy deficit in the balance of payments and  maintains an overvalued currency. We cautioned about the  possibility of creating situations of political and social  instability. The problem is that this model is blind to social  demands.    [Cardoso] The neoliberal model becomes successful by  expelling the people from the economic system...    [Cardenas] The model imposed expels the people not only from  the system, but from our national territory as well. Over the  past few years about 500,000 to 600,000 Mexicans have left.  According to U.S. census data, between 12 and 13 million  Mexicans are living in U.S. territory.    The government believed it would be able to handle the  situation through repressive policies, through closing  opportunities for democratic participation, through insufficient  programs like Pronasol (National Solidarity Program), and  through corruption and the connivance [cooptacion] of social  leaders. The government was not unaware of the wild  concentration of national income among just a few. The  government was aware of the fact that the model would favor only  certain areas of production.    [Cardoso] The reality that your are describing involves a  need for rectification. Bearing in mind the North American Free  Trade Agreement (NAFTA), it is appropriate to ask oneself:  Hasn't the Mexican economic reconversion gone too far for such  a rectification to be viable?    [Cardenas] Since 1990, when negotiations were initiated, we  have been raising the need for a agreement that is different  from the current one. In our opinion the agreement must respond  to development rather than to the free trade imperative, and  should not be restricted to North America, but should achieve a  continental level. For us, this way is more in keeping with  Mexico's interests during this phase of economic globalization,  from which we do not intend -- or are unable -- to escape.    [Cardoso] You are raising the NAFTA issue in a very  sensitive  way. After hearing your words, would it be correct to assume  that, if you win in the August elections, the government would  promote renegotiations?    [Cardenas] It is not advisable to speculate so much in  advance. We are convinced that it is possible to achieve a  better agreement, and this was not achieved because the Mexican  negotiators failed to do it right. From the perspective of a  new administration, it must be taken into account that we would  have 11 months until the inauguration to evaluate how NAFTA  functions.    [Cardoso] Yet those 11 months will not be meaningless,  especially as there will be a strong impact on Mexico's primary  production...    [Cardenas] Before the agreement, this administration had  already opened up various economic areas, notably the grain  sector. The entire importation of agricultural and livestock  products has been opened up on the basis of permits that yield  substantial commissions for those who are negotiating them.  These permits have dealt strong blows to the producers of  grain, corn, sorghum, beans, rice, red and white meat, and dairy  products. Mexico's entire agricultural and livestock basic  production was ruined even before NAFTA's implementation.    [Cardoso] Salinas' entire mandate has gone by under the  never  entirely cleared suspicion of an electoral fraud, of which you  were the main victim. Salinas has not been cleared of this  suspicion, and the Chiapas crisis has reinstated it...    [Cardenas] I will correct you at this point. It is not a  suspicion, but the certainty of fraud in the 1988 elections.  This fraud is at the root of the Chiapas problems.    [Cardoso] Salinas de Gortari does not have a very clean  record. Before Luis Donaldo Colosio's "uncovering" (election of  a successor), the president had not even conducted the empty and  formal consultations that Miguel de la Madrid at least had  conducted to elect the current president, so as to give his  candidacy the veneer of consensus...    [Cardenas] The goal of increased democratization has not  become apparent. Nevertheless, there is a problem for the  government: The results of the next elections must be credible  for the whole of Mexican society and for public opinion abroad.  If the government does not guarantee such honesty, I don't know  what society's reaction might be. It will surely be one of  popular wrath, as we have already seen in San Luis Potosi,  Guanajuato, and Michoacan, involving our country's general  mobilization against an abuse -- as our people tend to believe.  This is the great problem that the government is coping with,  especially now with a ruling party candidate who has apparently  been punched and devalued within the government itself.    [Cardoso] Are you not harboring any questions on the way in  which the Chiapas crisis erupted when, within barely a few days,  confrontation was replaced by negotiations?    [Cardenas] This is food for thought. We are viewing the risk  of seeing a division in our country between what is controlled  by the state, and the territory that might belong to the  Zapatistas in a border area with many precious natural  resources. We may not ignore that this conflict broke out  unexpectedly, but apparently is also being resolved even faster,  very smoothly. One of the scenarios that one may not fail to  consider is that the revolt might have involved a terrible and  tragic orchestration.    [Cardoso] Do you challenge the character of a true peasant  revolt, as claimed by the people involved?    [Cardenas] No, no. The social basis of the conflict is  undeniable, but the possibility of manipulation may also not be  easily ruled out.    [Cardoso] In your opinion, what prompted the unyielding  Salinas from the early moments of the crisis to be replaced by a  conciliatory Salinas within just a few hours?    [Cardenas] It may be explained by an old RCA Victor slogan:  "The voice of the master."    [Cardoso] Are you hinting at the United States?    [Cardenas] Yes.</p>

The city's  overseas investment has broadened from solely service industry  to such industrial sectors as electronics, machinery, food  processing and handicrafts.  <H5>  Technological Activities Draw Guangzhou Residents </H5>   Residents in Guangzhou, capital city of Guangdong Province,  are very active in studying new technology as 610 such  organizations have been established in the city, drawing over  80,000 people to learn and exchange skills.

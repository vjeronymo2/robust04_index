			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EU/Russia: No Progress on </F> Cooperation Pact; Talks Set To Go on Until April"; as released  by Brussels MULTINATIONAL SERVICE in English]    [Text] Talks between the European Union and Russia look  likely to drag on even further into this year despite hopes that  the proposed Partnership and Cooperation and Agreement between  the European Union [EU] and Russia would be concluded in the  first weeks of 1994. Stuck on the two controversial issues of  trade in nuclear materials and foreign banking access in Russia,  negotiations have scarcely progressed since December.    Although both sides had been confident that the Agreement  could be successfully concluded before the visit of Russian  President Boris Yeltsin to Brussels on December 9, it emerged  that significant problems remained with trade in nuclear fuel  and the Russian banking sector. Since then, experts from both  sides have attempted to tackle the core of these issues but to  no avail. One Russian diplomatic source was very pessimistic  for the future of the talks, arguing that it was unlikely that  agreement would be reached before the end of March, threatening  a further extension of negotiations into April.  <H5>  Trade in Nuclear Fuel </H5>   The problems surrounding trade in nuclear materials between  Russia and the EU countries focus on a draft separate agreement  negotiated at an earlier date with the Russians in the framework  of the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM). This draft  agreement has been rejected by the Russians who want trade in  nuclear products integrated into the Partnership and Cooperation  Agreement. The Europeans argue that it is crucial to maintain  specific regimes on price levels and traded volumes, etc., in  the nuclear domain and, as such, the issue must be resolved  within a EURATOM accord. In response, the Russians produced new  proposals at the end of January outlining their plans for  integrating nuclear trade into the Partnership Agreement. The  Commission rejected several of the ideas as unclear and  contradictory, but is still examining them. Nevertheless,  according to one Commission source, it is "highly unlikely" to  give a positive response.  <H5>  Banking Block </H5>   The other stumbling block concerns the controversy over  foreign banking facilities. In recent weeks, the Russians have  limited the possibilities for foreign banks to operate in their  territory, while a tentative agreement on the level of activity  of European banks in Russia had already been reached.  Nevertheless, the new law considerably limits the activities of  foreign banks operating in Russia by restricting their  activities to transactions with nonresidents only. Even this  means of operating will only be allowed to continue until  January 1996. Moreover, only those banks with existing links  with Russian residents before November 15, 1993 will be allowed  to stay in business.    The European Union, for its part, is prepared to limit  foreign banking activity in Russia, but on the basis of other,  less demanding, conditions. It is prepared to prevent the  establishment of any new branches of foreign banks on Russian  territory and to limit deposits to those over ECU100,000 which  would concentrate foreign bank activity on large-scale  enterprises. Furthermore, the EU would outlaw transactions on  privatisation shares and Russian bonds while granting a licence  to those foreign banks already established in Russia to allow  them to continue operating.</p>

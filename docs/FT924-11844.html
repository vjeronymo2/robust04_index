			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): Exhausted US investors prepare for a difficult final quarter US STOCK markets put in a resilient third-quarter performance, considering what happened during a remarkable three months. Against a background of overseas markets in turmoil, an international currency crisis (starring a plunging dollar and the breakdown of European monetary union), the ghostlike return of Saddam Hussein, an anaemic domestic economy, the biggest natural disaster in US history, and the entry, withdrawal and re-entry of a potential presidential election spoiler, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 - the broadest measure of leading share prices - gained 2.3 per cent in value between July and September, rising to 417.80. Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.4 per cent to 3,271.66 during the period, taken between them, the performance of the Dow and the S&amp;P showed that US investors were not unduly rattled by the economic, financial and political chaos that swirled around them. The key to the reasonable showing of US markets was liquidity. July opened with yet another interest-rate cut by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, which responded to a dreadful June employment report by lowering the discount rate from 3.5 per cent to 3 per cent. With interest rates at their lowest levels since the Kennedy presidency, investors poured out of low-yielding short-term assets and into equities in search of a better return. The flow of funds into the stock market provided ballast to share prices at a time when economic fundamentals were unpromising. Throughout the quarter, market sentiment was subjected to a steady drip-drip of poor economic news. Although share prices put in a sudden burst in late July (in the process sending the S&amp;P to an all-time high), the rush of demand was sparked by the bond market's reaction to more bad economic news. A sharp fall in long-term bond yields cheered equity investors, who believed cheaper credit would boost economic activity in the latter half of the year. August proved a difficult month, with a string of second quarter corporate earnings reports disappointing the market. General Motors' figures were typical. The carmaker's profits came in below expectations, and were released alongside a warning about future earnings from GM chairman Robert Stempel that could have been applied to the entire economy: 'Sustaining the rate of progress we experienced in the first half of this year appears extremely challenging.' August ended with investors reacting negatively to President Bush's speech at the Republican convention and the Democratic candidate, Governor Bill Clinton, holding a solid lead in the polls. (Although the markets later grew to learn to live with the likelihood of a Clinton victory, analysts felt that, by the start of the final quarter, investors had not yet fully discounted a Democratic win.) September opened with another dreadful employment report and a tumbling dollar, which may have prevented the Fed from cutting the discount rate again. By the end of the quarter, investors appeared exhausted; and the 90-point Dow loss in the first three trading days of October, prompted by renewed concern about the economy, political uncertainty and corporate earnings, pointed towards a difficult final three months of the year. Canada had its own problems, including a weak economy, a sudden rise in interest rates provoked by an attack on the Canadian dollar, and growing fears that the October 26 referendum on whether Que- bec should stay part of Canada could lead to a split in the federation. During the quarter, the Toronto Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.3 per cent to 3,297.88. Although the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico was finally signed in the third quarter, the Mexican Bolsa index fell 16.5 per cent to 1,327.07 amid concern about the slowing domestic economy and higher interest rates.</p>

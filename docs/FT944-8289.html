			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Arts (Openings): London Jazz eclectic, pianist Muhal Richard Abrams begins a UK tour on Friday (25th Nov) at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. An inspiring experimentalist and composer, Abrams is also an original interpreter of standard material. Which parts of his vast repertoire the eight-piece orchestra will perform on this rare visit is anybody's guess - but it could be the gig of the year.</p>

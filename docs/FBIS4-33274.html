			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Exclusive" program] </F>   [Text] Rosa Elena Simeon Negrin, minister of science,  technology, and the environment, has said that one of the huge  problems that Latin America faces in competing in world markets  is a lack of scientists. Simeon pointed out in a PRENSA LATINA  interview that with the GATT agreements and free trade, most  products of most Latin American countries are not competitive.  Simon added: To be able to compete, there must be scientific  and technological support, which Latin America does not have.  She went on to say that was the issue that dominated three days  of debates on scientific development during the meeting of  scientific, technological, and investigative officials in  Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. The meeting ended on 3 June with  a number of recommendations to the Ibero-American heads of state  and government.</p>

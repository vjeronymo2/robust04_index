			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Justice Minister Fernando Vega Santa Gadea has told  EXPRESO that the Council of Ministers has in fact approved a  bill imposing stricter penalties on those who cultivate poppies.  For example, first-time offenders will be sentenced to 8 year  imprisonment terms, and will be stripped of their land.    He explained that this was done "for a very simple reason,  namely the kind of product involved. Addiction to poppy heroin  is 50 times stronger than addiction to cocaine paste. In  addition, trafficking in opium and poppies is the most vicious  trafficking in the world. It rules southeastern Asia, and now  intends to colonize us. It is estimated that there are 50  hectares of poppies in Nueva Cajamarca, in San Martin. They  must be destroyed. If we do not do it now we will be unable to  control it later. We still have time. And those who planted  poppies should be jailed and their land should be transferred to  the state."    President Alberto Fujimori yesterday announced that a bill  will be submitted to Congress imposing penalties of up to 20  years for poppy growers, who have begun to cultivate the plant  in Cajamarca, San Martin, and Madre de Dios. Unlike coca  growers, whose activity is not considered criminal, poppy  growing will be strictly repressed, he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov was  pleased with the first round of Ossetian-Ingush talks that were  held in the Kabardino-Balkarian capital Nalchik last weekend.  He said in an Interfax interview that the talks had been held  in a business-like atmosphere and that the two sides agree on an  agenda and on the main lines of the final document    Galazov said that when the talks resumed in Nalchik on April  13 and 14 the two sided will concentrate on the principles,  specific steps and deadlines for carrying through the Russian  president's decree on return of the refugees and displaced  persons to their homes which they had been forced to leave  during the fall 1992 hostilities.    Galazov added that the joint statement on mass media and the  appeal to the people of Ingushetia and North Ossetia denouncing  terrorism and hostage taking were virtually the first documents  ever signed by presidents of two Russian Federation's members  engaged in a conflict.    At a news conference at the end of the talks, Vladimir  Lozovoi, head of the provisional administration in North Ossetia  and Ingushetia, emphasized the importance of the fact that a  final agenda had been adopted at the end of two days of  discussion because the agenda "built in the principles,  deadlines and steps to implement the Russian president's decree"  while "the draft of the final document which was accepted on the  whole recognizes the positions of the two sides." Lozovoi  emphasized the peace brokering efforts made by Kabardino-  Balkarian President Valery Kokov.    For his part, Kokov emphasized that the origins of the  Ossetian- Ingush conflict were so deep-rooted that the conflict  could not be resolved overnight.    Vyacheslav Mikhailov, Russian deputy minister of  nationalities and regional policy, said at the news conference  he was confident a treaty between North Ossetia and Ingushetia  would be signed.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In the event an appeal to the courts is filed from a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission in a case previously appealed to it from a decision of the Board of Governors, involving the imposition of monetary sanctions of $10,000 or more or a penalty of expulsion, revocation, suspension and/or barring of a member from being associated with all members, notice thereof shall be given to the membership as soon as possible after receipt by the Association of a formal notice of appeal. Such notice shall include a statement that the order of the Commission has or has not been stayed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission of revocation or suspension of a member's broker/dealer registration with the Commission; or the suspension or expulsion of a member from the Association; or the suspension or barring of a member or person associated with a member from association with all broker/dealers or membership; or the imposition of monetary sanctions of $10,000 or more shall be made known to the membership of the Association through a notice containing the effective date thereof sent as soon as possible after receipt by the Association of the order of the Securities and Exchange Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cancellations of membership or registration pursuant to the Association's By-Laws, Rules or Regulations shall be sent to the membership and, when appropriate, to the press as soon after the effective date of the cancellation as possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notices to the membership and releases to the press referred to above shall identify the section of the Association's Rules and By-Laws or the Securities and Exchange Commission Rules violated, and shall describe the conduct constituting such violation. Notices may also identify the member with which an individual was associated at the time the violations occurred if such identification is determined by the Association to be in the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Resolution requires that a final NASD decision of the National Business Conduct Committee (``NBCC'') or the Board of Governors of the NASD (``Board'') imposing monetary sanctions of $10,000 or more or penalties of expulsion, revocation, suspension and/or the barring of a person from being associated with all members be promptly transmitted to the membership and to the press, concurrently; provided, however, no such notice shall be sent prior to the expiration of 30 days from the date of the said decision. Upon review, the Association has determined that the elimination of the 30 day notification delay regarding NASD final decisions ordering the most serious sanctions (i.e., expulsion, revocation, and/or the barring of a person from being associated with all members) would further investor protection and the public interest and that notification to the membership and to the press should be made promptly upon issuance of such final decisions. The NASD, therefore, proposes to amend the Resolution to provide that no such notice shall be sent prior to the expiration of 30 days from the date of a decision imposing sanctions other than expulsion, revocation, and/or the barring of a person from being associated with all members. Such sanctions generally are imposed immediately. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule change would not amend the Resolution's current 30 day notification delay on final decisions of the NBCC or the Board regarding the lesser sanctions, nor amend the procedures with respect to decisions of the District Business Conduct Committees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act which provides that the rules of the association are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest, in that the proposed rule change would amend the Resolution to provide that notice of the issuance of a final decision of the NBCC or the Board ordering an expulsion, revocation, and/or the barring of a person from being associated with all members would not be subject to the current 30 day notification delay to the membership and to the press. The NASD believes that prompt notification to the membership and the press of final decisions regarding such sanctions against members or persons associated with members will provide important information to investors and further the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

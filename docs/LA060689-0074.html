			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S.F. LAW RECOGNIZES UNMARRIED PARTNERS  </P> <P> San Francisco became the first city in the country Monday to grant official  public recognition to homosexual and unmarried heterosexual couples.  </P> <P> Mayor Art Agnos signed the landmark law, calling it "one of the most important  milestones in San Francisco's effort to adopt policies to recognize the  diversity of families and to extend to all people in our city the basic human  right to form families of their choice."  </P> <P> Agnos also appointed a "Task Force on Family Policy" to determine guidelines  for allowing unmarried city workers to add partners, adult children and  extended family members to the city's health plan.  </P> <P> Though denounced by leaders of the city's Roman Catholic Church as an attack on  marriage and the traditional family, the new law won the unanimous support of  the Board of Supervisors before going to Agnos for his signature.  </P></p>

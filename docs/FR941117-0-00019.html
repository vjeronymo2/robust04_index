			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 507(c)(1)(D) of SMCRA provides for funding of the collection of archaeological information required by section 507(b)(13) of SMCRA and any other archaeological and historical information required by the regulatory authority, and the preparation of plans necessitated thereby. Section 507(b)(13) of SMCRA requires accurate maps that include all manmade features and significant known archaeological sites existing on the date of application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 507(b)(13) of SMCRA also requires maps or plans that shall, among other things specified by the regulatory authority, show all boundaries of the land to be affected, the boundary lines and names of present owners of record of all surface areas abutting the permit area, and the location of all buildings within 1000 feet of the permit area. These additional maps and plans are extraneous to the requirements at section 507(c)(1)(D) of SMCRA concerning SOAP funding for the collection of archaeological information. Therefore, the fact that these other maps or plans are not included for SOAP funding at proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(iv) is consistent with the provisions for SOAP funding under section 507(c)(1)(D) of SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above discussion, the Director finds that the provisions of proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(iv) are no less stringent than the provisions of sections 507(c)(1)(D) and 507(b)(13) of SMCRA, and approves them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(v), Preblast surveys. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Arkansas proposed to add a new paragraph at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(v) that provides funding under SOAP for the costs of preblast surveys requested by residents or owners of manmade dwellings or structures within 1/2 mile of any portion of the permitted area. Proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(v) also requires that the applicant or permittee shall conduct the preblast survey of such structures and submit the survey to the Director of the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology and a copy to the resident or owner making the request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 507(c)(1)(E) of SMCRA provides for the funding of preblast surveys required by section 515(b)(15)(E) of SMCRA. Section 515(b)(15)(E) of SMCRA requires that, upon the request of a resident or owner of a manmade dwelling or structure within 1/2 mile of any portion of the permitted area, the applicant or permittee shall conduct a preblasting survey of such structures and submit the survey to the regulatory authority and a copy to the resident or owner making the request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director finds that the requirements of proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(v) are substantively identical to and no less stringent than the requirements of sections 507(c)(1)(E) and 515(b)(15)(E) of SMCRA. The Director approves the proposed requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(vi), Collection of site-specific resource information and production of protection and enhancement plans for fish and wildlife habitats and other environmental values. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Arkansas proposed to add a new paragraph at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(vi) that provides funding under SOAP for the costs of the collection of site-specific resource information and production of protection and enhancement plans for fish and wildlife habitats and other environmental values. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

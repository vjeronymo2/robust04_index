			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> SMALL MIRACLES  </P> <P> MILAGROS -- SMALL ornaments in human and animal shapes -- were often left in  Catholic churches in Latin America for the village priest's blessing. Hopeful  petitioners would hang a charm in the shape of the part of the body that needed  healing (a silver leg, perhaps, for an arthritis sufferer, or a small cherub to  banish infertility) and pray for a miracle (milagro).  </P> <P> Although the church no longer condones the practice, artisans have discovered  that the tiny talismans make interesting additions to hand-crafted jewelry and  clothing.  </P> <P> Venice jewelry shop Tantau Smith sells antique silver lockets hung with  milagros ($95 to $125), as well as silver frames that swing with the miniature  charms and house portraits of Mexican surrealist painter Frida Khalo ($95).  </P> <P> New Yorker Sara Penn integrates the use of milagros with the indigenous fabrics  she collects on her world travels. Her latest offerings, by Knobkerry, combine  two of fashion's current favorites: velvet and ethnic prints. The patchwork  bolero-style vests ($285) are brilliant mosaics of jewel-colored panne velvet  and native fabrics such as South African mud cloth, Central American  tapestries, mirrored Indian cottons and royal kente cloth from Ghana, many of  which are stitched with milagros, tiny mirrors and Native American fetish dolls  in turquoise and horn. Penn's envelope-style purses with theme motifs -- the  sequined-palm-trees representative is embroidered with "Save the Earth"sell for  $225 and are heavy with milagros. All are available at Laise Adzer.  </P> <P>  Tantau Smith, 1353 Abbot Kinney Blvd., Venice; (213) 392-9878. For Laise Adzer  locations, telephone (213) 274-5018. KAREN GRIGSBY BATES  </P></p>

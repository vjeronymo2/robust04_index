			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> GREEK FINANCIER ORDERED EXTRADITED  </P> <P> A U.S. magistrate today ordered that fugitive financier George Koskotas be  extradited to Greece to face charges of embezzling more than $250 million from  the Bank of Crete.  </P> <P> Magistrate Joyce Alexander rejected Koskotas' arguments that he would face  possible assassination if returned to his homeland and that the charges were  political, a category of offense that is not extraditable under a U.S.-Greek  treaty.  </P> <P> Koskotas was arrested by FBI agents Nov. 23 as he arrived in a private jet at a  suburban Boston airport from Brazil. He had fled there from Greece. Koskotas,  35, is at the center of a financial scandal that brought down the government of  former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou in May.  </P></p>

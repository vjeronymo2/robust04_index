			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Ukrainians offered debt swap for nuclear deal Senior US officials have said a key factor in clinching the deal due to be signed tomorrow between the US, Russia and Ukraine on the return of Ukraine's warheads to Russia was the promise by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, to supply Ukraine with oil and gas below world prices. The Russians have also offered to wipe out at least part of Ukraine's energy debt to Moscow. However, the agreement is already causing controversy within Russia, as well as in Ukraine. A senior official of Gasprom, the Russian monopoly gas producer, yesterday said that if a gas-for-weapons swap and an agreement on debt forgiveness had been agreed 'at the highest level', Gasprom would have to be compensated, and the state had no resources to do that. Ukraine owes the Russians Rbs1,000bn for gas supplies, one-third of their total debt to Moscow. The promise of lower prices has also been used to get agreement between Russia and Belarus on economic union between the two states. Mr Yeltsin held talks yesterday with Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, the Belarus head of state, but the official communique issued after the meeting made no mention of the agreement signed in principle last week by the two countries' prime ministers and central bankers.</p>

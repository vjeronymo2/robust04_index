			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary received several comments endorsing the addition of a requirement that an accrediting agency must notify the Secretary and the appropriate State postsecondary review entity of any final adverse accrediting action at the same time the agency notifies the institution or program. On another issue, most commenters believed it was inappropriate to require an accrediting agency to notify the Secretary and others prior to making a final decision that involved the denial or termination of accreditation, although some supported this provision. Some commenters believed that the time frame for requiring accrediting agencies to make available to the public the comments of an institution that loses its accreditation was unrealistic. Finally, one commenter requested clarification as to which agencies should be included in the phrase ``the appropriate accrediting agencies'' that an agency must notify of its decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As mentioned in the NPRM, the Secretary believes that accrediting agencies should be required to notify the Secretary and others at the same time they notify an institution or program of a final adverse action in order to prevent excessive draw-down of Federal funds by the institution or program. The Secretary appreciates the comments received in support of this position. With regard to the issue of notification before an adverse action is final, the Secretary shares the concerns of those who support the inclusion of a requirement to this effect but agrees with those commenters who expressed the concern that notification prior to final action could cause serious harm to institutions that subsequently had the adverse action reversed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the 60-day time frame for obtaining the comments of an institution or program that is subject to a final adverse action, the Secretary believes it is in the best interest of the public to publish as soon as possible the reasons why the agency has denied, withdrawn, suspended, or terminated the accreditation of the institution or program. If the institution or program chooses not to make its comments about that action available to the accrediting agency within 60 days, then the accrediting agency is free to publish its statement of reasons without the accompanying statement of the institution or program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to ``appropriate accrediting agencies,'' the Secretary believes that accrediting agencies should be free to determine which agencies should be notified but that, at a minimum, an agency should notify all recognized agencies that accredit an institution, or a program offered by the institution, if the agency takes an adverse action against the institution or one of its programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A requirement has been added that accrediting agencies must notify the Secretary and others at the same time they notify the institution or program of a final adverse accrediting action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 602.30&blank;Regard for Decisions of States and Other Accrediting Agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary received many comments opposing the requirement that institutional accrediting agencies must review their accreditation or preaccreditation of an institution if a programmatic accrediting agency takes adverse action against a program offered by the institution. Some commenters also expressed opposition to the requirement that programmatic accrediting agencies had to review an accredited program at an institution if the institutional accrediting agency took adverse action against the institution. Many commenters objected to the phrase ``or should have known'' in &sect;602.30(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes that all agencies, including those that accredit only programs, should be required to take into account the decisions of States and other accrediting agencies when making any accreditation or preaccreditation decision involving an institution or program. The Secretary also believes that there may be occasions when a programmatic agency is the first agency to discover a serious problem that threatens the overall ability of the institution to provide a quality education. For this reason, the Secretary believes it is important for an institutional accreditor to review an institution for compliance with its accreditation standards if a programmatic agency takes adverse action against a program offered by the institution. The Secretary allows the institutional accrediting agency the flexibility to determine what an appropriate ``review'' is, however. It does not have to be a full on-site review of the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to agencies being accountable for actions about which they ``should have known,'' the Secretary understands the concerns of commenters that agencies could be held accountable for knowing about the actions of another agency that failed to inform other agencies of its adverse actions. However, there are instances where information about an agency's adverse action against an institution or program becomes a matter of public record, and the Secretary believes that in these instances accrediting agencies should not be absolved from their responsibility to review the institution simply because another entity failed to notify them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10147 Filed 4&hyph;28&hyph;94; 8:45 am]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4000&hyph;01&hyph;P  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

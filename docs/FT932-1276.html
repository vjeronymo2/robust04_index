			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Ferruzzi The restructuring of Ferruzzi-Montedison must be causing sweaty palms among foreign banks which lent to the crumbling empire. But the episode looks less damaging to Italy's reputation than the collapse of Efim last year, which called into question the value of an Italian government guarantee. Ferruzzi appears to be a cut-and-dried case of private sector mis-management, albeit on a grand scale. In that case, other Italian companies should not find themselves frozen out of the loans market. Nor should the government's tentative return to the international bond market be jeopardised. The caveat is that structural damage to the Italian banking system would undermine both private and public sectors. The credit rating agencies are not unduly worried. But until the full exposures of Banca Commerciale Italiana, Credito Italiano and their peers are known, nothing can be taken for granted. Even if an orderly work-out of Ferruzzi's L31,000bn debt can be agreed, the affair raises questions about the management controls applied by Italian banks, particularly during the lending boom of the past three years. That will be an obstacle to the early privatisation of state-owned institutions. There is also a need for all the lending banks to be treated on equal terms. Negotiations so far centre on a small huddle of lenders led by Mediobanca. Foreign bankers will be as unforgiving as the stock market of a solution which is seen to favour narrow self-interest.</p>

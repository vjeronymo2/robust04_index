			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC banana talks still deadlocked EC farm ministers were last night still unable to unblock proposals they agreed in principle in December to set quotas and tariffs on banana imports from Latin America, writes David Gardner in Strasbourg. A blocking minority made up of Germany, Denmark and the Benelux countries looked set to drag proceedings late into the night. Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner was holding firm to the proposals and the March 1 deadline to endorse them legally. The plan would fix a 2m tonnes quota on Latin American imports at an Ecu100 (Pounds 82) a tonne duty, with fruit imported above that level attracting an Ecu850 tariff. Strong pressure was being brought to bear on the Netherlands and Belgium to agree the measures, as they had done in December, and the Dutch and Belgian ministers were understood to be seeking instructions from their governments.</p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: The acceptable face of insurance - Anthony Bailey finds that an industry hit by bad publicity has its good points, too There is a danger that bad publicity surrounding the life insurance industry will deter consumers from buying much-needed products. The most basic of these is life insurance, although it goes under less obvious names such as 'term' and 'protection-only' insurance. The problem is that life insurance has strayed far from its roots. Much of the premium income earned by life companies does not pay for insurance but, instead, is invested to produce a return. Yet, policies which avoid any link with investment can be basic tools of financial planning. 'The most obvious area for life insurance is to provide protection. We give the cheapest and best organised term insurance in the world,' says Peter Smith, of financial adviser Hill Martin. Term or protection-only cover is essential for anyone whose death would leave dependents worse off. That usually means the main earner, but it can be worth buying cover for a non-working spouse as well if his or her death would mean extra expenses for such things as child care. There is a range of policies on the market which pay out lump sums or fixed incomes or can be used for increasing incomes. A competent adviser should be able to suggest the most suitable. Short-term policies can be used in conjunction with inheritance tax planning. Mortgage protection policies are a variation on the lump sum theme. Designed to settle an outstanding repayment mortgage, the level of cover decreases as the outstanding capital diminishes. This can make them especially good value. Critical illness cover is a relatively recent development which might appeal even to those without dependents. It works in much the same way as term insurance - with the crucial difference that it will pay out before you die if you get a specified serious illness. Permanent health insurance also pays out while you are alive. The payment comes as income and is not restricted to serious illnesses. It is a form of sick pay, and should be considered by the self-employed and those who work for an employer with a niggardly sick pay scheme. Getting advice on the best policy, however, is more important than with some other life products. You have to make sure you get a policy which starts paying out when you will need the money as there are different deferment times - the first period of an illness when nothing is paid. You also need to watch out for exclusions. Private medical insurance is another area where life companies have become more active in recent years. Bupa (the British United Provident Association) is generally synonymous with this type of insurance and remains the market leader. These days, though, there is a wide choice of policy and premium, from budget cover (to beat National Health Service waiting lists) to Rolls-Royce cover (which pays for most things, including stays in exclusive private hospitals). What about those policies which provide investment? The illogical combination of investment with insurance has evolved for two reasons: Tax relief on premiums, coupled with taxation of a life fund's investment returns (especially in qualifying policies) did provide a degree of tax efficiency - although mostly for higher-rate taxpayers. But premium tax relief was abolished 10 years ago. Meanwhile, Peps and Tessas now give better ways of sheltering returns from tax. Life companies believe that policies which pay out only on death are hard to sell. Investment-linked insurance promises a return even if people survive. But life company claims that they ensure people get life cover by selling them investment plans are, largely, specious. Even where there is significant life cover, as with endowments linked to mortgages, many people surrender policies early. And many policies have minimal life cover, providing instead long-term, inflexible and tax-inefficient savings schemes. Unfortunately, there are no serious plans to decouple insurance and investment. So, life company promises to clean up their act and ensure sales staff are better trained in future look hollow. They will still sell products unsuitable for most people. Are there ever good reasons to link investment with insurance? Smith is hard put to find them. He suggests that, in some cases, it can be used in inheritance tax planning, while the smoothing effect of with-profits policies might appeal to investors who, otherwise, would not be able to sleep at night. 'Favourable tax treatment within the fund may make single premium bonds tax-efficient for those who pay higher-rate tax and capital gains,' Smith adds. 'But such people usually have substantial assets, are more likely to want a conventional portfolio, and can make use of other tax shelters.' Two products are highlighted as possible buys by James Higgins, of adviser Chamberlain de Broe. 'A few companies offer insurance bond shells into which investors can put their own portfolio of investments,' he says. 'The internal taxation of the bonds can be favourable, but the charges levied by the companies make them suitable only for people with very substantial portfolios.' For the same reason, Higgins says there could be a case for substantial investors to pay into a regular-premium maximum investment plan, particularly as a precaution against future increases in personal taxation. 'But, for most people - including most higher-rate taxpayers  - insurance bonds are a bad idea. They should look at Peps, unit trusts, investment trusts and National Savings instead,' Higgins adds.  --------------------------------------------------------------- Investment managers: fact file 1  --------------------------------------------------------------- Schroders (Schroder Personal Investment Management) Established: 1918  --------------------------------------------------------------- Regulator: IMRO Number of offices in UK: One (London) Number of offices worldwide: More than 30, in 26 countries Funds under management: Pounds 50bn plus (Pounds 1.3bn of private  client money, managed out of London) Number of UK private clients: 400 Number of expatriate/foreign national private clients: 100 Minimum investment for private clients: Pounds 100,000 (investment  concentrated on the Schroder World Fund); Pounds 500,000 (multi-unit  trust portfolio); Pounds 2 million (direct investment in equities) Current asset allocation for private clients: 86% equities, 14% gilts,  bonds and cash.

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / The Irish Referendum: Small EC nations want safeguards BELGIUM, the Netherlands and Luxembourg want guarantees of the rights of small states when the European Community gets larger, Portuguese officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Lisbon. If agreed at the Lisbon summit on June 26 and 27, a clause on guarantees could be added to the Maastricht treaty. It would be similar to an addendum proposed by Britain to enshrine the principle of subsidiarity. Several small states are worried that expansion of the 12-nation EC will limit their impact on Community decision-making and deprive them of control over key areas of policy. Portugal hopes the Lisbon summit will agree on a strategy for enlarging the Community.</p>

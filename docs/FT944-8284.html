			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / In league with the table makers: John Authers analyses the effects of ranking UK schools and other parts of the public sector England's soccer managers have long known the harsh discipline of league tables: if they underperform in the Carling Premiership or Endsleigh League, punishment often swiftly follows. Tomorrow the heads of the UK's state secondary schools face similar pressures, with the publication of performance league tables that will be widely studied by parents, governors and local education authorities. The tables are part of a new culture sweeping the public sector. The performance of managers in other parts of the public sector is also being measured by a range of indicators designed to test their success in delivering services. Tomorrow's school league tables, the third set published in as many years, are the most ambitious so far. They will include figures for exam performance at GCSE (normally taken by 16-year-olds) and A-level (taken at 18), vocational qualifications, truancy rates and - for the first time - details of how long children spend in lessons. The exercise is part of the prime minister's Citizen's Charter campaign to improve the quality of public services. Mr John Major believes that poor performers exposed by comparative statistics will be compelled to improve, even if it is difficult for their customers to go elsewhere for service. In the health service, hospital league tables were published for the first time in June this year. They revealed wide variations in speed of service: in general surgery, for example, 88 per cent of patients were admitted to hospital within three months at the Dorset Healthcare Trust; at the Kidderminster Healthcare trust, 24 per cent had still not been admitted after a year. Doctors complained that the indicators were crude, telling patients nothing about the quality of medical care they would receive. But Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, was unrepentant: 'Information is a spur to improvement,' she said. Next spring will see the most ambitious league table exercise yet, when the Audit Commission, the local government watchdog, publishes tables for the 449 local authorities in England and Wales. These will use 70 separate measures to compare performance across all the main local services. Residents will be able to find out how quickly their council answers the telephone or how long it takes to complete council house repairs. The same exercise will also provide statistics on law and order, such as the speed with which emergency 999 calls are answered, and how many complaints are made against the police. Mr Andrew Foster, controller of the Audit Commission, has already decided not to publish all 60,000 separate items of information - more than appears in a typical UK telephone directory. However, edited comparative statistics will be available next year. Mr Foster believes that the decision to measure performance drives up standards, even before comparisons are published. Including promptness in answering mail and telephone calls in the local authority league tables, for example, required councils to set targets, and measure how often they were attained. These targets, published in June without mention of whether authorities were meeting them, revealed disparities in the tasks authorities were setting themselves. Surrey County Council had aimed to answer calls within 60 seconds, but when it saw that this was far out of line with the rest it cut its target to 20 seconds. The Audit Commission has consulted local government officers closely in choosing the performance indicators, avoiding the confrontational approach adopted by education ministers when setting up school league tables. Mr Foster justifies this by saying that acceptance of the validity of the indicators is important if they are to influence managers' behaviour. 'If practitioners can rubbish our methods, then all the work we've put in is of little value. We can't afford to let our credibility about the nature of the data or the methodology be impugned.' In contrast, the launch of the first education league tables in 1992 was marred by inaccuracies in the data. For example, schools that pooled their A-level results in consortia were not credited with any A-levels at all. Newspaper headlines concentrated on the inadequacies of the government's information, rather than shortfalls in particular schools' performance, dulling the impact of the tables. Even though the data in school league tables are now more accurate, controversy over the choice of performance indicators persists. Teachers, backed by academic opinion, claim it is misleading to judge schools by exam results alone. They say the most important factor in determining a pupil's ultimate examination performance is the level of achievement he or she had reached when starting at the school. Publishing exam results in isolation inevitably shows schools with selective intakes performing best, the critics add. They would prefer to see league tables reflecting how well schools perform with the children they take in. Supporters of such 'value-added' tables fall into two camps. First are those who want tables to take account of social deprivation, which clearly correlates with poor exam results. The four least deprived local authorities in England (measured by the government's educational needs index) are the Scilly Isles, North Yorkshire, Surrey and West Sussex. They came in the top six in the GCSE results league table last year. In contrast, six of the 10 most deprived authorities - the London boroughs of Hackney, Newham, Lambeth, Islington, Southwark and Tower Hamlets - were in the bottom 10 for GCSE results. However, Labour politicians, who oppose the current 'raw' league tables, are nervous about producing tables based on social backgrounds. They fear that this could institutionalise low expectations in deprived areas. They fall into the second camp, which wants to explore value-added measures using academic progress. This would test children at 11 and 16, and see whether they improved by more or less than the average. The problem is that national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds will become compulsory only at the end of this school year. Many local authorities abandoned their own tests of 11-year-olds when the national tests were announced. Reliable 'value-added' tables for secondary schools might therefore be five years away. But even the 'raw' tables derided by teachers appear to have improved performance. Last year 41.1 per cent of 15-16-year-olds in England gained five GCSE passes at grades A to C, up from 38.1 per cent in 1992 when the league tables were first published. Sharp improvements in A-level results have also been recorded by independent schools since newspapers started publishing their own tables in 1990. League tables seem to have had consequences for headteachers. In the private sector, turnover of heads has roughly doubled in the past decade, with many facing angry governors' meetings if their schools slip in the tables. Two years ago, parents even forced the resignation of the high mistress of St Paul's Girls' School in London - never outside the top 10 in the country according to the Financial Times's own ranking - because they did not like her policy of reducing the number of GCSEs which girls took. Football managers will recognise the phenomenon.  ---------------------------------------------------       UK PUBLIC SECTOR PERFORMANCE INDICATORS:                    LEAGUES AHEAD  --------------------------------------------------- Education authorities  --------------------------------------------------- Top seven  --------------------------------------------------- 1993                                         Social GCSE                                    deprivation ranking                                     ranking*  --------------------------------------------------- 1        Isles of Scilly                        1 2        Kingston, London                      38 3        Sutton                                42 4        North Yorkshire                        2 5        West Sussex                            4 6        Surrey                                 3 7        Buckinghamshire                       16  --------------------------------------------------- Bottom seven  --------------------------------------------------- 102      Lambeth                              107 103      Manchester                            95 104      Islington                            104 105      Barking                               67 106      Tower Hamlets                        106 107      Southwark                            102 108      Knowsley                              89  ---------------------------------------------------    LOCAL AUTHORITIES: TELEPHONE RESPONSE TARGETS  --------------------------------------------------- Allerdale:                                   3 rings  --------------------------------------------------- Dorset:                                      4 rings  --------------------------------------------------- Bassetlow:                                   8 rings  --------------------------------------------------- Croydon:                           80 percent within                                           30 seconds  --------------------------------------------------- South Hams:                            30 seconds at                                 switchboard, further                              20 seconds at extension  --------------------------------------------------- East Yorkshire:                    80 percent within                           20 seconds at switchboard;                              30 seconds at extension  --------------------------------------------------- *Based on numbers of benefit claimants, single parents and immigrants.

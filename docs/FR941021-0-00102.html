			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 600.125(n) and (o) pertaining to budget and project changes are carried over from &sect;&sect;600.114(e)(3), (4), and (5). These provisions provide more procedural detail for DOE recipients in dealing with budget and project revisions than is included in Circular A&hyph;110.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 600.127(b) and (c) allowable cost provisions are carried over from &sect;&sect;600.103(f) and (h). Section 600.127(b) provides more detail about DOE evaluation of indirect cost requests than is provided in Circular A&hyph;110. Section 600.127(h) states the DOE policy of opposition to paying fees or profits on financial assistance awards with the exception of Small Business Innovation Research Awards. This subject is not addressed directly in Circular A&hyph;110, although the second Response under the Comments and Responses in the preamble to the Circular states: ``Generally fees and profits are not paid to recipients unless authorized by legislation.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 600.144(f) under Procurement procedures is carried over from &sect;600.119(e) and addresses payments of interest penalties on dealings between recipients and subrecipients, a subject not addressed in OMB Circular A&hyph;110.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final paragraph of Section 151(d) on program reporting is a combination of provisions carried over from &sect;&sect;600.115(b)(3) and (f). This language lists specific performance reporting forms that DOE has developed, has received OMB clearance to use and may use as the Contracting Officer sees fit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 600.151(i) on program reporting is carried over from &sect;600.115(i) and states provisions regarding performance reporting requirements on subawards not addressed in OMB Circular A&hyph;110.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 600.153(h) on record retention requirements is carried over from &sect;600.124(c) and states provisions regarding record retention for program income which was not addressed in OMB Circular A&hyph;110.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The segment of the subpart titled ``Additional Provisions'' was added as a location for rules for types of recipients not otherwise covered in this subpart. The provisions of &sect;600.181 are carried over from &sect;600.125.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> E. Miscellaneous Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further miscellaneous changes of this regulatory implementation of A&hyph;110 from the text of Circular A&hyph;110 as published that have not been included above are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;600.104 Subawards, the sentence beginning ``Thus, this subpart is'' was added to clarify the applicability of these provisions to subrecipients. It does not change the policy of the Circular.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;600.111(b) pertaining to public notice requirements, ``shall'' is changed to ``will, whenever practical,'' because of the possibility that awards may need to be made without sufficient lead time to provide the notification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The last sentence of &sect;600.121(a) regarding financial requirements for research awards has been added for emphasis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The last sentence of &sect;600.121(b)(4) reiterates &sect;600.121(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;600.122(f) on payment, ``awardee's'' was changed to ``recipient's'' to be consistent with DOE usage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The phrase ``as defined in OMB Circular A&hyph;129, ``Managing Federal Credit Programs'''' in &sect;600.122(h)(2) is deleted as an unnecessary cross-reference that may also restrict the applicability of this provision unnecessarily.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 600.123(a) under Cost sharing or matching has been rewritten to improve the syntax.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with UN Secretary General Butrus </F> Butrus-Ghali by Kjell Dragnes in Oslo; no date given]    [Text] The UN role in Bosnia is not a fiasco, UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said. The problem has not been  solved, but people are working actively so that it will be.    Fourteen years as Egyptian foreign minister, the peace  settlement between Egypt and Israel in 1977, the many subsequent  crises in the Middle East -- all of this was a tough, but good  preparation for Butrus-Ghali who is now 71 years old and has  been head of the United Nations since January 1991. "I believe  that I am well-trained to tackle the many crises the United  Nations has to tackle," the secretary general said in an  interview with AFTENPOSTEN.    It is not a tired leader -- despite all the crises and the  many rounds of talks here in Norway -- who today ends his  two-day visit to Norway. The only thing he regrets is that he  has no opportunity to travel home to Cairo to see one crisis  move toward its solution: the signing of an agreement between  the PLO and Israel tomorrow.    "But I have asked your Foreign Minister (Bjorn Tore) Godal  to  represent me," he said.    How do you view the development within the United Nations  from peacekeeping to peacemaking operations?    "I think that we should clearly limit our role to  peacekeeping, and this is in line with the spirit of the United  Nations. But if we need peacemaking in order to be in a  position to distribute food, to give humanitarian assistance, to  stop those people who do not respect the resolutions adopted by  the United Nations, who are committing genocide and atrocities,  the international community should not hesitate to make use of  peacemaking operations," the UN secretary general said.    He said that 15 of the UN's 17 operations are peacekeeping  operations. Article 7 of the UN Charter gives scope for  peacemaking operations, but it was only once the Cold War was  over that these became possible.    It is in this context that Butrus-Ghali sees the former  Yugoslavia. The general picture is that the United Nations has  not had particular success, but the UN head does not agree. The  United Nations has succeeded in preserving peace in Macedonia,  has given aid to 2 million refugees and exiles, and on the whole  has maintained the safe areas in Bosnia.    Thorvald Stoltenberg is given much praise for his role as  mediator, and Butrus Butrus-Ghali was not sparing in his praise  of Norway's efforts -- in the form of soldiers and money. With  a scarcely audible sigh he said that if only others among the  UN's 184 members had been as well-disposed.... Some 160 have  not paid their membership fees or made contributions to the UN  operations. The United Nations finds itself in the midst of a  major economic crisis, with a deficit of $1 billion, and this  does not make it any easier to tackle the world's problems.  "But if the members contribute money and troops I am sure that  the United Nations can tackle the various crises," the secretary  general said emphatically.    The United Nations celebrates its 50th birthday next year.  Many people take the view that the organization should be  reformed. What is your view?    "We will have many ceremonies next year, and we hope that  through these we will be able to mobilize world public opinion  in favor of the United Nations, give a better picture of it, and  win greater support for the organization," the secretary general  said. "In addition there will be a very important conference in  Copenhagen which will create a greater understanding of the  social element -- something that is important these days."    The UN leadership has also distributed to member countries a  questionnaire on reforms, especially of the Security Council.  Most people are agreed that reforms are necessary, that new  members should be admitted to the Council. But they disagree  about which. "I believe that it will be a long debate," the  general secretary said, adding, "I hope they will be able to  accept certain fundamental changes to strengthen the Security  Council and strengthen the UN system."    The message from the secretary general is that the reforms  will be a long process, but once the member nations make up  their minds to invest in the United Nations, demonstrate the  political will, and realize that the United Nations is the only  organization which can tackle global problems, they will then be  on the right road.    Yesterday was filled with meetings, first with Prime  Minister  Gro Harlem Brundtland, then with Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore  Godal, and then an audience at the Palace. Yesterday evening  the prime minister hosted a dinner for the secretary general and  his wife, Maria Leia Butrus-Ghali, at Akershus Castle. Today  Butrus-Ghali will honor the memory of the very first UN  secretary general, Trygve Lie, by laying a wreath on Lie's grave  in Grorud churchyard. Talks at the Storting are also on the  agenda before he travels on to Geneva this afternoon.</p>

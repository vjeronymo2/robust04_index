			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International league of awards led by Britain BRITAIN LEADS the international league in the diversity of honours and the automatic way they are awarded in certain sectors, notably the Civil Service. The US president gives out 'medals of freedom' and Congress has a few awards for people engaged in 'conspicuous good works'. As one US embassy official put it, however, the granting of such honours is a 'rarity, not a routine'. France's Legion d'Honneur was created by Napoleon in 1802, and has five grades: chevaliers (knights), officiers, commandeurs, grands officiers and grand-croix. In peacetime, to become a knight, 20 years' service is required by civil servants and armed forces personnel, or 25 years in professional service. The medals handed out are not as numerous as in Napoleon's time, and numbers of recipients for the top four grades are strictly limited. Although the legion is awarded by the president, its grades are strictly separated and regulated. Chevaliers can become officiers only after they have been a chevalier for eight years; commandeurs must be an officier for five years; grands officers must be commandeurs for three years; and holders of the grand-croix must have held the rank of grand officier for three years. The order cannot be awarded to serving parliamentarians during their term of office; neither can they be promoted during that time, unless as a result of military service. There is a Bastille Day - July 14 - honours list. Last year, recipients included jazz trumpeter Miles Davis and actress Sophia Loren (both made knights), and US Gulf war commander General Norman Schwarzkopf, who became a grand officier. More controversially, Lt Col (then Major) Alain Mafart, a member of a French secret service team convicted of bombing the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior in Auckland harbour in 1985, was created chevalier in July last year. Protests from New Zealand were brushed off with a French statement that almost everyone with the appropriate service receives the award. Germany brought in its honours system in 1949 with the creation of the federal republic. Like France, it has one main award - the Federal Cross of Merit - with varying grades. In Spain, King Juan Carlos can create hereditary marqueses, dukes and counts. He has created 18 such grand titles since becoming king in 1976. Recipients include musicians, intellectuals, and democratically elected politicians.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY: STANLEY KUBRICK'S CHILLING 'KILLING'  </P> <P> Most everyone has seen the precise, epic-like sweep of Stanley Kubrick's  direction in "Dr. Strangelove," "2001," "A Clockwork Orange," "The Shining"  and/or "Full Metal Jacket."  </P> <P> As a young filmmaker in the 1950s, though, Kubrick was attuned to the gritty,  low-budget film noir thriller technique epitomized in "The Killing," recently  released on video.  </P> <P> Similar in story and intensity to John Huston's "The Asphalt Jungle," Kubrick's  film follows a band of very serious thugs planning the biggest score of their  careers -- a million-dollar heist at a race track.  </P> <P> Led by Sterling Hayden (who also starred in "Asphalt Jungle"), the robbery  seems to go as planned except for the intrusion of a small-time gangster  (played by Vince Edwards), who learns of the robbery from the two-timing wife  of one of the gang members.  </P> <P> Like so many crime films of the 1940s and '50s, "The Killing" has an urgent,  desperate mood, intensified by no-nonsense dialogue and newsreel-like  narration. This is an unrelenting 83 minutes, devoid of stylish diversions or  secondary plots.  </P> <P>  "The Killing" (1956), directed by Stanley Kubrick. 83 minutes. No rating.  </P> <P> DOUG LIST  </P></p>

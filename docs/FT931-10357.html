			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Treasury advisers meet to mend strategy rift: 'Wise men' disagree about taxes and interest rates; Statistics point to a slight improvement in the economic outlook THE first policy meeting today of the Treasury's new panel of economic advisers will seek to resolve serious splits among members on subjects such as interest rates and possible tax increases. The seven-strong group will also be divided on whether there should be large cuts in public spending and on the best targets with which to monitor the economy. Several panel members say they want to find as many areas of consensus as possible in their report on the economy, which will be handed to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, on February 18. It will be made public the next day. Today's meeting will be chaired by Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser. It will discuss a range of subjects, including numerical forecasts and policy suggestions. The panel was set up by Mr Lamont at the end of last year to inject greater openness into Treasury decision-making. Its reports will be published about every four months. Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University is the keenest supporter of lower base rates. He wants a cut from 6 per cent to 3 per cent by March 17, the day after the Budget. Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, favours base rates of 5 per cent by the late spring, with more cuts possibly later in the year. But Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the private-sector think tank, and Mr Andrew Sentance, economics director at the Confederation of British Industry, support the government in keeping interest rates stable at least until the Budget. The other three members - Professor Tim Congdon, managing director of Lombard Street Research, Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University and Professor David Currie of London Business School - refrained from revealing their views on interest rates ahead of the Budget. While Mr Davies and Prof Congdon favour large tax rises over the next two years to tackle the growing government deficit, most of the others oppose any immediate action. Mr Britton said: 'The scare stories about the likely large rise in the public sector borrowing requirement may be a poor guide to policy.' Prof Minford said the government should cut taxes over the next few years as part of 'supply side' reforms to strengthen the economy. And while both the monetarists on the panel, Prof Minford and Prof Congdon, want large cuts in public spending, Mr Britton thinks this might have to rise above Treasury targets to accommodate 'overshooting'. Mr Britton is the most optimistic about growth prospects this year, predicting expansion in gross domestic product of about 2 per cent. Prof Minford thinks that if interest rates stay relatively high and the international economy remains fragile, UK output could fall by 0.5 per cent, making 1993 the third successive year of economic decline. Most panel members are extremely gloomy about unemployment, believing the registered jobless total is unlikely to fall below 3m for some years. Although several on the panel think the government's 4 per cent limit for underlying inflation may be breached this year, most are generally sanguine about inflationary trends.</p>

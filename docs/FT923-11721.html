			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coconut prices weather 'malicious propaganda' - Prices have risen sharply on the world market despite health attacks EARLY THIS year Malaysia organised an 11-nation international coconut tree climbing contest in order, the organisers said, to promote the crop. The competition, won by Sri Lanka, was well-timed. Since mid-1991 world prices for most coconut products have risen over 50 per cent. Coconut is a remarkably versatile crop: its flesh can be desiccated and creamed, or turned into copra for animal feed; coconut oil is used in shampoos, cosmetics, cooking oils and margarines; its shell makes high quality charcoal and can be transformed into activated carbon. Officials at the headquarters of the Asian and Pacific Coconut Community in Jakarta, whose 14-member countries account for 82 per cent of world coconut production, describe the coconut tree in almost mystic terms as 'the tree of life'. This stands in contrast to an allegation by soyabean producers in the US that tropical oils, which are high in saturated fat, raise human cholesterol levels and are a possible contributor to coronary heart disease. Mr PG Punchihewa, executive director of the APCC, describes the charge as 'entirely false' and 'malicious propaganda'. Indeed, the soyabean farmers' allegation arouses deep feeling in the coconut fraternity. It is 'a lie of fantastic proportions,' says Mr Chris Mudd, author of Cholesterol and Your Health - the Great American Rip Off*. The issue of which oils - such as coconut, palm, soyabean and rapeseed  - are best for your health is at the centre of a battle among producers for market share. Medical research is inconclusive and continuing studies on the health-effects of fatty acids may tip the balance back in the favour of tropical oils. The rise in the world price of coconut products - coconut oil averaged Dollars 337 a tonne in 1990 and is currently hovering around the Dollars 560 mark - has come as a welcome relief to producers. The reason for the increase, however, is not a victory in the propaganda war, but a sharp fall in production in the Philippines, the world's leading coconut exporter. In January it was estimated that 1992 Philippines production, measured in copra equivalent, at 1.98m tonnes but, because of an extended period of low rainfall which began last October, the figure has been revised to between 1.4m and 1.5m tonnes. Weather problems have been exacerbated by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo and a recovery in production is not expected until 1994. It may take until the second half of the decade before output returns to the 1990 level of nearly 2.5m tonnes. With the Philippines holding a quarter share of world copra exports and over 50 per cent of coconut oil exports, a rise in world prices has resulted. This has been good news for other producers, such as Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Indonesia, with an estimated 3m coconut farmers and production of 2.3m tonnes last year, has overtaken the Philippines as the largest producer but over 80 per cent of its production stays at home. Domestic prices shadow the world market and coconut oil in Java has risen from Rupiah 718 (35 US cents) a kilogram in June last year to about Rp1,175. Indonesia's coconut production is expected to decline marginally this year to 2.25m tonnes, although rainfall has been better than forecast. The area under cultivation has risen sharply over the past 10 years from 2.5m hectares to about 3.3m hectares. Exports of coconut oil, however, have declined from a high of 206,647 tonnes in 1988 to an estimated 155,000 tonnes this year. This has added to concerns that world demand for coconut products will outstrip supply in the medium-term. The APCC estimates that Philippines copra meal exports for January-April amounted to 141,019 tonnes, down 35 per cent on the same period last year. Indonesia's were 38,162 tonnes for January and February, a 59 per cent year-on-year decline. World copra meal stocks in April stood at 58,000 tonnes, compared with nearly 100,000 tonnes a year earlier. There has been a similar decline in coconut oil stocks held in Rotterdam, the main trading centre, to 61,175 tonnes in mid-May from 134,575 tonnes a year before. The market for coconut oil has historically been volatile, collapsing from Dollars 1,155 per tonne in 1984 to Dollars 297 in 1986, and if production does pick-up, traders expect prices to fall quickly. Mr Punchihewa expects stiff competition from soyabean, rapeseed and palm oils but notes that 'there is an element where it (coconut oil) cannot be substituted' in end products. He says the industry will move toward value-added products such as fatty alcohols and glycerine, and there is substantial room for expansion simply by cutting down wastage. APCC officials estimate that only 40 per cent of Indonesia's coconut crop is processed and of the 50bn coconuts produced in the world each year, the shells and husks of half are simply thrown away. *Cholesterol and Your Health - the Great American Rip Off, by Mr Chris Mudd, published by American Lite Co., Oklahoma.</p>

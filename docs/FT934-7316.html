			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Ban fails to halt Nigerian protests: Britain threatens tougher sanctions STRIKES, protests and fuel shortages continued in southern Nigerian cities yesterday, despite a ban on all demonstrations and an assurance by the government that it will not lift the 700 per cent fuel price rise which sparked off the strikes. General Sani Abacha, Nigeria's new military head of state, issued a warning on Thursday that political opponents would be suppressed and and 'political associations' would be proscribed. The new government is being assembled while Mr Ernest Shonekan's civilian interim government ministers and the elected governors of all 30 states, dismissed by Gen Abacha on Thursday, are clearing their their desks. An announcement of the new cabinet is expected by Monday. Britain warned Gen Abacha it was discussing tougher sanctions with its international partners after what it called his deplorable decision to ban political parties. The foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, told parliament that Britain's patience towards its former colony was running out. 'We deplore the decision of the Nigerian military to take back power and, as announced last night, to dissolve all democratically elected institutions,' he said. Britain, other EC countries and the US imposed sanctions on Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, after the previous military government annulled the results of a presidential election in June. Sources close to the military said the seizure of power which took most Nigerians by surprise on Wednesday, was intended to pre-empt action by less senior officers in the armed forces who grew restive over the interim government's loss of control and the stalled transition to democracy. The measures begun by Mr Shonekan to stop fuel racketeering have already taken effect in the north's main city, Kano, where fuel is on sale at the official price for the first time in months. A official in charge of the Oil Ministry until a minister is appointed told the big oil marketers there was no question of rolling back the fuel price, increased from N0.70 to N5 (15p) a litre last week, and they would be assisted in delivering to filling stations. Lagos, the commercial capital, is still badly affected by the general strike. The port is closed, big banks and factories are shut, and fuel and public transport are scarce. Violent clashes were reported in parts of the Yoruba-speaking south-west, the homeland of Mr Moshood Abiola, who was the unofficial winner of the presidential poll annulled in June.</p>

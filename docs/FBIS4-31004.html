			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 31 (CTK) -- The 15-percent maximum  difference in the population of the Senate constituencies is as  acceptable as the 27-percent difference for the ODS (Civic  Democratic Party), Libor Novak, an ODS deputy, told journalists  at a press conference of the ODS Deputies Group today.    The elections to the Senate, the not-yet established upper  chamber of the Czech Parliament, will take place probably in the  autumn, along with local elections. The Senate is to have 81  deputies, one-third of which will be alternated every two years.  It is an "administrative" rather than political matter, Novak  added.    Novak was alluding to the debate on the authenticity of the  presented bill, in which some deputies, including those from the  coalition parties, pointed to the fact that the government draft  bill included 15-percent difference and was more in line with  the equal electoral right embedded in the Constitution, while  the bill submitted to the parliament included the 27-percent  difference.    The ODS considers the order of the constituencies, whose  list  should be included in a supplement to the law on parliamentary  elections, an administrative issue, Novak said. The order is  decisive in determining in which constituencies senators will be  elected for two, four or six years in the first senatorial  elections.    However, the ODS considers the biggest possible  "fragmentation" of the constituencies ideal because it believes  this would help minimize cases in which senators in several  adjacent constituencies would be elected for the same term of  office, Novak added.    The ODA will support the one-round variant for the  senatorial  elections which is based on the principle of a relative majority  (the British system), Novak reported. The two-round system,  proposed by the bill, is also acceptable for the ODS, he added.    No ODS deputy will vote for the abolishment of the Senate,  Novak said. However, Jiri Honajzer, chairman of the ODS  deputies group, admitted that only about half of the ODS  deputies supported the Senate elections.</p>

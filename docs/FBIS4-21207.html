At the end of the 1970's, farmed coca production did not  surpass 30,000 hectares. Last year it surpassed 150,000  hectares according to the Ofecod [Executive Office for Drug  Control], which is under the jurisdiction of the Interior  Ministry. Some less conservative statistics suggest the total  is about 300,000 hectares.    U.S. sources have stated that during the period 1978 to  1993,  drug trafficking activities which were previously concentrated  in the Upper Huallaga Valley expanded at the national level.  Some 200,000 families now farm coca and manufacture cocaine  paste. Drug-related activities generate an income of about $2  billion per year within the Peruvian economy.    Many experts believe the failure of the antidrug struggle  follows the lack of an antidrug strategy and the absence of an  organization to plan, coordinate and implement it.    The national drug prevention and drug control plan seeks to  resolve one of the most vulnerable points of the antidrug  struggle in the country by establishing an organization to  centralize all government efforts in this field.    The General Law on Drugs foresaw in 1978 the need to  establish an organization to draft a drug control policy, to  implement it and to coordinate all the actions to be developed.    Law No. 22095 established the Multi-Sectorial Drug Control  Committee (Comucod) [Comite Multisectorial de Control de  Drogas], an organization to approve the government's antidrug  policy; and the Ofecod, an executive and coordinating  organization. Under the law, Comucod was to comprise six  cabinet members and an alternate from the Supreme Court. The  truth is that Comucod did not fulfill the duties with which it  was entrusted by law and never really worked.    Ofecod came under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry.  It was to have controlled drugs, and implemented and  coordinated government actions. As it turned out, Ofecod  handled administrative functions of disposing of the goods  seized by the police during antidrug operations and ignored the  other duties with which it was entrusted by law.    Experts believe neither of these organizations completely  fulfilled its duties. This, undoubtedly, directly influenced  the expansion of coca farming and trafficking at the national  level.    The lack of leadership, and the dilution and ineffectiveness  of government actions in the antidrug struggle, became obvious  in the early 1980's.    The main institutions involved in the drug control program  at  the time were: the National Coca Enterprise, (Enaco); the Upper  Huallaga Coca Control and Reduction Agency (Corah); and the  Upper Huallaga Development Program (Peah).    Enaco was the government organization responsible for the  monopoly, legal marketing, and industrialization of coca. In  fact, it only captured an insignificant part of Peru's coca  harvest which was mainly being grown for drug traffickers.    Corah, which was entrusted with coca eradication programs in  the area, eliminated several hundred thousand hectares of coca  in the Upper Huallaga region but paradoxically the valley became  the main coca producing region in the world.    Peah, which was responsible for promoting alternative  farming  programs in coca producing regions, yielded insufficient results  and enjoyed little support among coca farmers.    Some experts said the failure of these government  organizations to control coca farming and trafficking lies in  the fact that trafficking is merely considered a criminal  activity that must be disciplined with police repression and  severe legal punishments.    For a long time the antinarcotics struggle was only based on  repressive actions. The police were the main organization  entrusted with conducting these repressive actions through its  diverse specialized units--among them the Mobile Rural Patrol  Unit (Umopar), which was involved in the compulsory eradication  of thousands of hectares of coca; the former Drug Police  Division (Dipog); the Illicit Drug Traffic Investigative  Division (Dintid); the Antidrug Division (Dirandro), which later  became the Antidrug Division (Dinandro).    Even today repressive actions are still prevalent. The  number of actions has risen since July 1992 when the government  established the Internal Operations Front Command (COFI) which  falls under the jurisdiction of the Armed Forces. This is the  top organization, responsible for the planning, implementation,  and control of the struggle against drugs and terrorism.    In the last few years, in addition to repression, the  authorities have introduced the strategy of alternative  development. This program seeks to replace economies based on  coca farming with the alternative farming of legal crops and an  improvement in the standard of life in coca-producing regions.    The Peruvian Government has acknowledged the prevalence of  the economic and social problems that encourage trafficking. It  paid particular attention to alternative farming but its results  in practice have been almost nil. Neither the Institute for  Alternative Development (Idea), nor the Autonomous Authority for  Alternative Development (Aada) were ever implemented.  Considering the antidrug draft bill grants ``the highest  priority'' to the alternative development program, there are  great expectations that this time around, this program will  finally be implemented.</p>

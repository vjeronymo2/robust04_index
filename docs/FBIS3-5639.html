This is one of Japan's undisguised attempts to  secure large quantities of plutonium for itself so as to produce  nuclear weapons at any time and become a nuclear power.    Japan's nuclear armament maneuvers are accelerating to a  very  dangerous stage. According to data, Japan, which has stockpiled  26 tonnes of plutonium, will increase its reserve to 100 tonnes  by 2010. This is a huge amount, enough for over 10,000 nuclear  bombs.    Japan has developed not only elements and technology for the  production of a nuclear bomb, including the electronic  destructive device, but also devices for long-range nuclear  transportation. This has been proven by the fact that Japan  developed the large long-range H-2 rocket, which can be used as  an inter-continental ballistic missile in February 1994.    The world believes that it is only a matter of time until  Japan will produce nuclear weapons. A Western paper reported  that Japan may have already produced them. In fact, Japan could  become a nuclear power in a very short time whenever it is  determined to do so. These facts clearly show to what a  dangerous stage Japan's nuclear armament has come.    What cannot be overlooked is that Japanese authorities and  politicians, who are promoting full-scale nuclear armament, are  playing mean making an issue out of the so-called nuclear issue  of ours. Former Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone recently raved  that the UN Security Council should keep the possibility of  imposing economic sanctions open in case we refuse special  inspections. Japanese Foreign Minister Hata said the pressure  for inspection on our military facilities will increase and  urged that measures be taken to dispel suspicion over nuclear  weapons development.    As everyone knows, there is no mention of "special  inspection" in the recently announced agreement reached at the  DPRK-U.S. contact in New York. In any regard, Japan is not in a  position to intervene in the resolution of the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula. The reason the Japanese reactionaries  have recently started playing mean by becoming more feverish in  the special inspection commotion is to impede the settlement of  the nuclear issue and find a pretext for the lawful promotion of  the nuclear armament, which has reached the danger line.    It is the most vicious and shameless intention of the  Japanese reactionaries that they are picking on others while it  is themselves who are accelerating the nuclear armament. It is  not difficult to estimate how enormous the effect on the peace  of Asia and the world might be when the Monju fast breeder  reactor begins operating and large quantities of plutonium are  secured for the manufacture of nuclear weapons.    Some Japanese reactionaries even insist on becoming a  military power and dispatching more of the Self-Defense Forces  overseas saying that Japan lost World War II because it was  weak. It is obvious that our country may become a nuclear  victim when the neighboring Japan, which is making every attempt  to realize its old dream of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity  Sphere, is even armed with nuclear weapons.    The denuclearization of Northeast Asia cannot be realized  when Japan is arming itself with nuclear weapons. The  North-South joint declaration on denuclearization will be  invalid, and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will  be virtually meaningless.    It is not a coincidence that the people of Asia and around  the world, including our people, are showing grave concern over  Japan's nuclear armament. It is a common desire of humanity to  live in a peaceful world free of nuclear threat. People across  the world should block and destroy Japan's maneuver to smoke  nuclear clouds, running counter to mankind's wish.    The Japanese reactionaries must correctly realize the dear  price they must pay for their maneuvers for nuclear armament and  nuclear power and immediately abandon their criminal nuclear  ambition.</p>

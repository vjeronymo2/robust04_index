At the same time,  Mr. Papandreou reiterated that the dialogue with Skopje could  resume only if the conditions set by the Greek Government are  met, adding that the splitting up of Skopje means a Balkan war.  Our political correspondent Angeliki Angelopoulou has the  following report.    [Angelopoulou] It appears from Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou's statement, which he made during his return flight  from Brussels, that the Greek side is awaiting a U.S. initiative  for the solution of the Cyprus issue.    Asked if a solution is being planned, Mr. Papandreou gave  answered in the affirmative and added that he does not know  exactly what the solution is. He said: President Clinton  personally considers the problem most important and he has  already contacted the Turkish side to facilitate the process  being promoted by the UN Secretary General.    The prime minister stressed: The problem has now also become  important for Turkey. He also made it clear that no invitation  had been extended for him to visit Ankara and said: Mr. Hikmet  Cetin invited me unofficially. Papandreou added: A lot has to  be done in order to start.    The prime minister described the negotiations on the Skopje  issue as a dialogue in suspense and reiterated that the  negotiations cannot continue unless the conditions set by the  Greek Government are met. He added: We will explain this to  Cyrus Vance if he proposes a resumption of the negotiations.    Mr. Papandreou also said that he is very satisfied with the  results of the NATO summit and noted particularly that,  following hard negotiations, the decision to undertake military  operations in Bosnia was in the end not adopted.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "There Is No Fascist Danger"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- Foreign concern at the presence of  "neofascists" in the government "results from a distorted image  which our country is conveying of itself abroad. The fear  others have of us is our own fault." This is the opinion of  CNEL [National Council for Economy and Labor] Chairman Giuseppe  De Rita, who believes that "it is absurd to think that extremist  movements of the [German] Republikaner type are making any  headway in our country. Those who judge us from the outside  have misinterpreted [National Alliance Secretary] Gianfranco  Fini's attempts to constitutionalize the Right. The way that  information has been presented in the Italian media has resulted  in an element of distortion of reality. The picture that  foreign countries have of Italy is precisely that which our  national press and television networks have transmitted across  the borders. It makes no sense," De Rita added, "to speak of a  return of fascism, when only 1 percent of Italians profess to be  fascists." Furthermore, in this period "we are witnessing an  impoverishment of the middle stratum of the ruling class. There  are increasingly fewer people who are prepared to take an  interest in politics. The new government is having to `scratch  about' more than the previous one. [Clean Hands Judge] Di Pietro  himself has declined [Prime Minister-Designate] Berlusconi's  invitation. Why should he have joined the Viminale's [Interior  Ministry] bureaucracy considering that he enjoys much more  autonomy conducting investigations, and that he is more popular  than [Mayor] Giuliani in New York?"</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Japanese executives sacked in bribery probe THREE EXECUTIVES at a leading Japanese construction company, Hazama, were stripped of their posts yesterday after having been arrested as part of a public prosecutors' office investigation into the alleged bribery of a regional mayor. The dismissal of Hazama's chairman, president and senior managing director by its board came as fresh controversy arose over requests by Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, to banks for funds to fight a general election on July 18. Several business leaders have criticised Mr Hayashi's requests to the banks, and Mr Tadashi Okuda, the chairman of the federation of bankers' associations, was forced to defend the industry's separate provision of Y10bn (Pounds 60.7m) in loans to the LDP election campaign. Mr Okuda said the loans, from eight commercial banks, were justified as the LDP was a party that would maintain a 'parliamentary democracy and a free economy'. However, he warned it would be an abuse of position for Mr Hayashi to expect increased funding because he had become finance minister. The requests by Mr Hayashi have been queried by the Keidanren, the federation of economic organisations, which said they could lead to 'misunderstandings'. Meanwhile, the Japan Association of Corporate Executives yesterday said companies should consider a cut in LDP donations to release funds for new parties. Official donations to the LDP are estimated at Y13bn a year, but unofficial and illegal donations are thought to be many times that figure. In the Hazama case, prosecutors continue to question Mr Toru Ishii, mayor of Sendai, in the north, alleged to have received Y100m from four construction companies in the expectation they would be hired for public works projects.</p>

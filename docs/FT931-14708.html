			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong falls after China statement PACIFIC Rim markets saw mixed performances yesterday, while Tokyo was closed for a national holiday, writes Our Markets Staff. HONG KONG ended a four-day rally as investors reacted to another hardline statement by China on Hong Kong and to profit downgrades for HSBC Holdings. The Hang Seng index closed 18.36 lower at 5,871.80, up 6.2 per cent on the week, in turnover of more than HKDollars 3bn. The dip in HSBC - which accounts for 15 per cent of the Hang Seng index - also pulled the overall market down. The stock fell 50 cents to HKDollars 60.00 while Hang Seng Bank rose 50 cents to HKDollars 57.00. AUSTRALIA was lifted by strong blue chips. The All Ordinaries index closed up 17.0 at 1,524.5, a gain of 1 per cent on the week, in turnover of ADollars 259m. News Corp advanced 74 cents to ADollars 28.44 after a strong overnight performance in the US. ANZ gained 5 cents to ADollars 3.08 after forecasting good earnings in 1993. Foster's rose 8 cents to ADollars 1.34 on the sale of 10 per cent of its Canadian brewing operations to Miller Brewing, the US group. BHP, which has a majority shareholding in Foster's, advanced 20 cents to ADollars 13.12. SINGAPORE closed higher on selective buying. The Straits Times Industrial Index rose 14 to 1,572.40, up 1 per cent on the week, in volume of 78.2m shares against 84.5m on Thursday. Malaysian companies traded over the counter continued to ease on expectations of a slowdown in the Malaysian economy. SEOUL closed slightly higher after fluctuating narrowly during the day, with buying of small-capitalisation shares more than compensating for a sell-off in financials and big manufacturers. The composite index closed 1.06 higher at 693.29, down 1.6 per cent on the week, in turnover of Won616.8bn after Won724.5bn. TAIWAN ended well off its day's high on profit-taking after surging in early trade on expectations of a cut in the stock transaction tax. The weighted index, which was up more than 80 points at one stage, ended 17.27 higher at 3,314.83, for a gain of 4.5 per cent on the week. Turnover rose to TDollars 16.8bn, the highest since last October, from Thursday's TDollars 11.8bn. MANILA fell on profit-taking with the composite index closing 8.0 lower at 1,312.55, barely changed on the week. Losers led gainers 28 to 11, with 25 issues unchanged as turnover declined to 129m pesos from Thursday's 140m pesos. KUALA LUMPUR closed off the day's lows as some investors returned in the afternoon on renewed rumours that interest rates were to be lowered. The composite index closed down 2.32 at 617.49, 1.9 per cent lower on the week. Sime Darby rose 16 cents to MDollars 4.68 on news that Malaysia Mining Corp had sold 27m shares in the group at MDollars 4.50 each. BANGKOK closed higher, buoyed up by the market leader Bangkok Bank. But other big banks came under selling pressure after their recent advance. The SET index rose 5.38 to 943.59, up 2.5 per cent on the week, in turnover of Bt8bn. Bangkok Bank, which reported higher 1992 after-tax net profit on Thursday, gained Bt3 to Bt112 and was the most active stock of the day. Thai Farmers Bank and Krung Thai Bank both lost Bt4 to Bt808 and Bt354 respectively. NEW ZEALAND was slightly firmer in low volume, with the NZSE-40 index closing 8.12 higher at 1,517.17. Turnover stood at NZDollars 9.7m. Telecom was unchanged at NZDollars 2.35, Carter Holt Harvey rose 5 cents to NZDollars 2.65 and Brierley rose 2 cents to NZDollars 1.05. BOMBAY rose in spite of scattered trouble in parts of the city, rocked by Hindu-Moslem clashes which have claimed over 500 lives. The BSE index rose 65.87 to 2,525.54 as professionals said that the market had discounted the riots, that no one was selling, and that expectations of a favourable budget next month had lifted sentiment.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver price plunges below Dollars 5 an ounce Silver yesterday plunged below the psychologically-important Dollars 5 a troy ounce level, giving a salutary warning about what can happen when investment funds, having driven metal prices up with a buying spree, decide to quit the market. Taking its cue from an overnight slump in New York, silver closed in London at Dollars 4.90 1/2 , its lowest since January. It had lost 17 cents or more than 3 per cent of its value in one day. Analysts suggested that the sudden drop was another phase in the funds' recent involvement in the market. This started in the early months of 1994 when, encouraged by suggestions that supply and demand for silver was coming back into balance, speculative funds bought futures and physical silver heavily. It was said they were targetting at least Dollars 7 an ounce. In the event they were not able to breach Dollars 6, but the spot price for silver - used mainly in photographic papers - averaged Dollars 5.38 an ounce in the first nine months compared with Dollars 4.19 in the same period of 1993. The key elements keeping prices down in the face of the funds' splurge were selling by producers when the price went above Dollars 5.50 and the price-sensitivity of buyers in India, the biggest silver investment market. The CRU International consultancy group estimates that in the first nine months silver imports to India fell from 2,000 tonnes last year to 1,150 tonnes, a drop of 42.5 per cent. Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch, pointed out that the investment funds had not only been unwinding their paper positions in recent weeks but also selling physical metal. New York Commodity Exchange stocks had risen by 14 per cent to 265.7m ounces in the third quarter. This made the market vulnerable to concerted selling, particularly from funds that rely on computer-based trading. Mr George Milling-Stanley of Lehman Brothers also said the fundamental picture suggested silver should not go much lower and a price of Dollars 4.90 was reasonable. However, 'the funds showed when they drove silver up towards Dollars 6 that they can overcome the fundamentals for a time and if they continue to sell short they could send it lower'.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): Caution urged as the China factor continues to unsettle Hong Kong PACIFIC rim stock markets saw mixed results in the last quarter, with the weakness in Japan offsetting rises in the markets of south-east Asia, which remains one of the few areas showing firm economic growth. While investors who placed funds in the Hong Kong market at the beginning of October saw a 2.7 per cent fall in dollar terms, the market has been one of the best-performing on a year-on-year basis, with the FT-A World Index for Hong Kong rising 25.4 per cent. The China factor continued to cause volatility on the Hong Kong stock market during the quarter. The Hang Seng index rose to an all-time high of 6,447.11 in November, on hopes of economic benefits flowing from China's embrace of market economics. However, proposals by Mr Chris Patten, the governor, for greater democracy in the colony after its reversion to Chinese sovereignty angered Beijing, which in December warned that it would not honour contracts made by the Hong Kong government with other parties which had not been approved by China. The Hang Seng has managed to come off the 4,950 level, its December low, and China has tried to assure investors by announcing that it would honour contracts which span the transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty in 1997. But uncertainty over the political situation still looms over the market. At the beginning of the year, the Chinese government, while maintaining an uncompromising opposition to Mr Patten's plans, said obligations would be honoured. Hong Kong now awaits debates over Mr Patten's proposals in mid-February, and whatever the outcome, promises more volatility on the stock market. Mr Philip Mok, strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Hong Kong, advises investors to remain on the sidelines for the time being, although he expects a positive resolution in the next six months. Japan's 3.5 per cent fall dragged the dollar-based Pacific Basin index of FT-Actuaries down 2.9 per cent on the quarter. Excluding Japan, the region gained 1 per cent. The Tokyo market gained briefly after the Japanese government implemented emergency measures to restore confidence in the market in August, but later slowly lost ground on faltering volume. Most investors are reluctant to commit funds to the stock market as a bottom for the economy has yet to be seen. Corporate earnings are expected to fall as much as 30 per cent for the current year ending March, and the government revised downwards its annual economic growth forecast to 1.6 per cent, refusing to project the timing of a rebound. Fears linger that Japan may have not yet have seen the worst, with some analysts predicting a sharp deterioration of confidence in the country's ailing banking sector this quarter. Financial authorities are expected to revive a directive, issued last August, preventing banks from selling stocks to realise profits ahead of the March year-end book closing. Investors may be well off staying clear of the Tokyo market this quarter, as, in spite of brief euphoria over the crown prince's engagement during the first week of trading this month, Japanese stocks have dwindled on low investor interest, and have seemed to set the mood for the time being. Meanwhile, the Australian stock market saw dull trading amid uncertainty over the continuing weakness of the economy and a fall in demand from overseas investors. The FT-Actuaries index rose a mere 0.7 per cent on the quarter, while falling 16.4 per cent from the previous year. Malaysia gained 4.5 per cent as the country's 1993 budget, reflecting the government's commitment to align fiscal policy with monetary policy to check inflation, encouraged investor sentiment.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (4): Hunger strikers' faith may deter foreigners - Though there are fewer disputes than in past years, labour relations remain tense Visitors to the Federation of Korean Trade Unions in Seoul these days will find their nostrils assailed by a thin, acrid smell redolent of sick rooms. A series of crude primary colour posters gives details of the hunger strike taking place on the sixth floor. Here, in a large bare conference room, a handful of men lie around, reading comic books and computer manuals. One worker, in a suit, has not eaten for 20 days. 'It is very painful but I have a strong faith that we will win,' he says. If the strikers' 107 colleagues who were fired for union activities are reinstated, faith will have proved a more powerful adversary than the FKTU and President Kim himself. But either way, the outcome will give little faith to foreign investors, who cite Korea's turbulent labour relations as a reason to avoid equity participation deals in the peninsula. Mr Lee Jun-wan, general secretary of the FKTU - which, he says, takes in 1.4m of the country's 1.8m organised union members - adds his support to the strikers. The dispute, affecting workers at the automobile insurance arm of Tongpu, one of Korea's 30 biggest chaebols or conglomerates, has been going for over a year and is, he suggests, a symptom of the stronger power wielded by the chaebol's head, Mr Kim Jung-ki, a relative of President Kim. A court ruling early last month found Mr Kim not guilty, and the president is powerless to overrule the decision. Mr Lee says: 'FKTU offered to solve this problem. President Kim ordered the Ministry of Labour very strongly to solve this problem. But there is still no solution.' Despite Mr Lee's protestations as to the FKTU's strength, the hunger strikers on the sixth floor suggest otherwise. If those lethargic figures represent hope to anyone, it is to the Korea Council of Trade Unions, a new illegal union that plans to give FKTU a run for its money from next year. KCTU, owing no loyalties to government (unlike FKTU, which reaps some W7.5bn from government for educational purposes), claims it will more truly represent the workers' interests. It will certainly have a more militant edge, and stands to put a spanner in the works of labour relations which Mr Lee believes could be entering a more peaceful, non-violent era. Korea has been a crucible of labour strife and disputes since 1987, when the Great Workers' Struggle erupted. A strike involving about 1m workers, it lasted from June to September and was one of the factors behind the emergence of a new democratic trade union, set up in January 1990. However, government pressure weakened the new union, and a more loose-knit, organisation sprang up to fill the gap: the Korean Congress of Independent Industrial Federations (KCIIF). KCTU seeks to bring together KCIIF and the dissident Korea Trade Union Congress (KTUC), which was formed by the Democratic party. Its proponents believe it will win over 600,000 members. Mr Shin Eun-cheol, the chain-smoking executive secretary of the KTUC, says: 'The union movement is still powerful. We are facing a challenge so if we work well the union maintains its strength but if we fail to meet the challenge then we may also be ruined.' The government still has uneasy relations with unions that do not come under FKTU. KTUC says some 300,000 workers have been dismissed for union activities: there is even a Struggle Committee for Dismissed Workers' Reinstatement. Former KTUC president Pan Byung-ho remains in hiding - allegedly with a Dollars 1m price on his head - after lecturing union leaders during the 52-day Hyundai strike last summer. Even the government steers clear of putting a brave gloss on labour relations. An official at the Ministry of Labour says: 'The major problem is how to succeed in completing this year's wage negotiations between labour and management. In some enterprises we are afraid there could be labour disputes which will cause strikes. 'It is not only a question of wages. Workers in some big enterprises are making various demands, such as workers' participation in management. That is why management feels it is very difficult to succeed in signing labour contracts.' Two years ago, in deference to workers' demands, the government set up an 18-member labour reform study committee, which duly came up with a clutch of recommendations. The labour ministry insists: 'We are going to try to make these amendments, but it is very difficult to say now what the timeframe will be.' However, some changes to labour policy have been effected under the civilian government, and statistically labour strife is on the wane: from 3,617 labour disputes in 1987 to 200 last year and just 26 'small scale' disputes in the first five months of 1994. Wage rises have been negotiated at an average 8.7 per cent (the consumer price index stands at around 6 per cent); and almost half of the 5,500 biggest companies' wage negotiations had been concluded by June 9 - more rapidly than in previous years. In the same period last year 35.7 per cent had been concluded. The new government swooped on labour policy shortly after coming into power. The prompt was economic rather than social: increasing international competition and a slack domestic economy were eroding profit margins and highlighting gross inefficiencies within the workplace. Productivity growth was failing to keep pace with spiralling wage increases. But the hunger strikers' action shows that Korea still has much work to do on the labour front. As Mr Lee Hahn-koo, president of the Research Institute, says: 'I don't think we are safe from disturbances. There's still some unrest. The workers are not so rational in Korea.'</p>

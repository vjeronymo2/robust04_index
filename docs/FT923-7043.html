			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: JC Penney in communications joint venture J. C. PENNEY, the fourth biggest US retailer, yesterday said it expected to form a joint venture with GTE Spacenet and Capital Cities/ABC to provide a wide range of communications services to retailers. The announcement comes only a day after Sears and IBM said they were merging their voice-and-data networking businesses into a new service company. The J. C. Penney venture, Advanced Retail Communications, is expected to start operating in 1993. It will deliver television, audio and data services to shopping malls and other retail locations using a combination of digital satellite broadcasting and earth-based transmission networks. The partners expect to draw on Penney's high-speed data network in the US and GTE's existing satellites, while Capital Cities/ABC will look after the programming needs of large retail chains and smaller independent retailers.</p>

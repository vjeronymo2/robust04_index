			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Smokers win legal aid action A group of smokers who claim they were harmed because five tobacco companies allegedly failed to warn them of the dangers of smoking yesterday won a battle in their fight to obtain legal aid. Mr Justice Popplewell in the High Court quashed a decision by the Northern Area Legal Aid Committee which refused to give the go-ahead to 28 test-case actions. These related to 227 claims potentially worth more than Pounds 20m. The claimants have accused Gallaher, Rothmans, Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and British-American Tobacco of failing to minimise the dangers of smoking or give adequate warning of the risks. The judge said there had been a misunderstanding leading to the committee not hearing argument on behalf of individual applicants and remitted the matter to be heard by a fresh committee.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / World Trade News: Tokyo urged to open paper trade to competition MR John Georges, chairman and chief executive officer of International Paper, the world's biggest paper company, yesterday urged Japan to open its paper trade to foreign competition, to help develop international trade and allay the mounting frustrationof the US Congress. 'The paper and wood products industry is one of those areas where Japanese industry has to open up. Consumers will benefit from theremoval of barriers,' he said. Addressing a conference on the world pulp and paper industry organised by the Financial Times and the European Paper Institute, Mr Georges said the world paper industry was suffering from a cyclical downturn and general slowdown in the global economy. But 'when I look to 1993 and beyond, I am very bullish about the industry's future.' The Polish Ministry of Ownership Transformation has appointed Hambros Bank to advise it on the restructuring and privatisation of the country's pulp and paper industry. Hambros will help draw up a sector-wide strategy for developing Poland's 40 paper companies.</p>

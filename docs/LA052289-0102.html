			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> POPE APPEALS FOR HELP FOR LEBANON  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II has appealed to U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de  Cuellar and 16 heads of state to take urgent steps to prevent the destruction  of Lebanon, the Vatican said today.  </P> <P> Vatican officials issued the text of a May 15 letter in which the Pope said the  "very existence of Lebanon is now in danger."  </P> <P> He told the heads of state of Israel, Syria and other Middle East nations that  Lebanon is undergoing an intense and painful process of destruction. "We find  ourselves facing a threat to the entire order of international life. It is a  moral threat all the more sorrowful because a weaker state is subject to the  violence of those stronger than itself," he said.  </P></p>

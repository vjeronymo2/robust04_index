			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Brussels set to block aid for Klockner mill The European Commission is preparing to block subsidies from the city-state of Bremen to Klockner-Werke's steel mill, a move which could plunge the region even deeper into recession. Brussels has just received the German government's response to a request for more details about last November's sale of the steel mill. Sources yesterday described the reply as 'absolutely unsatisfactory'. The Commission is likely to open a formal state aid inquiry within the next 10 days into the city-state's plan to inject DM200m (Pounds 78m) of cash into the mill. It is then almost certain to outlaw the subsidy, which was aimed at maintaining the loss-making mill's annual crude steel production of 3m tonnes. Private German steelmakers had expressed outrage at the November deal, under which Klockner-Werke agreed to sell 75 per cent of the mill for a symbolic DM1 to a consortium led by the city-state. Only this week, Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel chairman, warned that the rescue would make a mockery of the European Union's call for capacity cuts and subsidy limits. One source said: 'It would be absurd to allow a state aid here, when we have been actively pursuing cases against other companies.' The collapse of the deal would be a bitter blow for Bremen, which, after Saarland, is the state with the highest rate of unemployment in west Germany. The steel mill and the shipyard, which depends on the mill, are its biggest employers. Klockner would probably not suffer directly, although it would have to seek an alternative buyer. It could turn to Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch, Germany's two largest steelmakers, and Usinor-Sacilor of France. Their rival offer, under which most of the plant would be closed, was rejected in November.</p>

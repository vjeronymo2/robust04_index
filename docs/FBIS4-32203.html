			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial in two installments by Ion Cristoiu: "The </F> Dissolution of the Opposition"]  <H5>  [17 Jun p 1] </H5>   [Text] One day last week [14 June], the representatives of  the opposition gathered at the Ilie Nastase Club -- which is  also called, by anyone who wishes to seem more  nationalist-oriented, the Dacia Club -- to discuss the PNTCD  [National Peasant Christian- Democratic Party] proposal to  commence procedures to suspend President Ion Iliescu for the  anticonstitutional statement that he made during his visit to  Satu-Mare. As is customary among today's Romanian politicians,  the four-hour congregation of gentlemen representing their  parties was held behind closed doors. Under the stale-water  circumstances of our recent domestic political life, the PNTCD  proposal had a similar effect to that of throwing a rock into a  lake covered by duckweed. The surface of the lake, which used  to be smooth and lacking any trace of the slightest swell, now  suddenly began to churn and roar. It was discovered that  beneath the layer of mud, there were some diverging points of  view, even philosophies, dormant, just like the frogs in the  pond. Obviously, as soon as the press got wind of the  opposition's closed-doors meeting on the issue of suspending the  president, the journalists flocked in front of those doors  eagerly awaiting the news. What on earth could they have been  talking about for such a long time? What colossal blow is the  opposition preparing against Iliescu, giving them sufficient  reason to whisper, so that not a single word could be heard  outside through the keyhole? Every now and then one of the  members of the congregation would come out and head for the  bathroom. They were walking with such gravity that none of the  journalists dared to approach them or ask them any questions.  Each of the journalists was simply paralyzed at the thought  that the politician in question was carrying a huge load of  secrets to this designated place and his deep concentration not  to drop it made him move like a sleepwalker. Heaven forfend that  anyone should pull his sleeve! On would run the risk of seeing  him collapse to the ground and wriggle convulsively! After four  hours of waiting, the doors were eventually kind enough to open.  The assumed coup perpetrators stepped outside and, having been  authorized to open their mouths, told the journalists what had  been decided inside, after so much mystery. In the beginning,  before entering the hall, the politicians had seemed to be  raging, extremely furious about the president exceeding his  constitutional prerogatives. To this the journalists had added  other elements as well (the fact that the meeting was held  behind closed doors and its unusual length, exceeding four  hours), so that after they came out of the conference hall,  everyone expected them to announce draconian measures to punish  this constitutional criminal. Everyone assessed that, compared  with the steps to be announced, the PNTCD's previous proposal to  suspend Iliescu would seem like gently tapping Iliescu on the  shoulder. After the opposition representatives finished their  announcement, everyone was totally baffled. After four hours of  discussions, they decided to punish the president by writing a  letter to him, inviting him to come to Parliament to tell them  the story of what happened in Satu-Mare. Not a single word  condemning Iliescu for stepping from the path established by the  Constitution! They even renounced the PNTCD proposal to begin  gathering the signatures of members of Parliament needed to  begin the procedure of suspending the president. The  participants in this glorious congregation reached the  conclusion that, owing to the great distance separating  Satu-Mare from Bucharest, they had not heard very well what  Iliescu had actually said. Curious as they are, they now  invited Iliescu to hear from him personally what had happened.  For over four hours the mountain quivered and trembled with all  its might, so that the walls of the club were shaking and the  very fish in the pond were becoming nervous, until eventually it  gave birth to a little mouse! Nothing was easier for Cotroceni  [seat of the president] than replying to this puerile  provocation with a gesture that reminds one of a slap given to  someone who is following much too closely. The haughty  representatives of the opposition were presented with a text  that actually repeated what the president had stated in  Satu-Mare. His excellency did not even bother to convey it to  them personally, but rather preferred to send it to them via  television, an institution that, as is known, actually works  like a post office box by which Iliescu sends his letters  without even having to pay the postage.    The ridiculous decision reached at the Nastase Club has  baffled many people. However, it did not puzzle those who have  been keeping an eye on what is happening within the opposition.  Those observers were not at all surprised to see that the  representatives of the PD [Democratic Party] and the CDR  [Democratic Convention of Romania], instead of seconding the  PNTCD initiative, rather considered it sufficient to address an  timid invitation to Iliescu, asking him to explain his  statement. All this clearly signals -- more clearly than  anything else -- a process that has recently been going on in  our political life: the dissolution of the opposition. It is a  very slow, sometimes contradictory process, as are all political  phenomena that are still hidden from the eyes of public opinion,  but that stand a good chance of eventually reaching completion.    About this, however, in our next issue.  <H5>  [18 Jun p 1] </H5>   [Text] In the previous issue of our daily, I pointed out  the childishness of the decision taken after a four-hour meeting  of the representatives of the opposition that intended to  discuss President Iliescu's statements made in Satu-Mare. The  PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party] proposed  initiating the procedure to have the president suspended from  his office. After having examined that proposal, the  representatives of the PD [Democratic Party] and the CDR  [Democratic Convention of Romania] rejected it and preferred to  issue a declaration by which Ion Iliescu was invited to come and  personally offer explanations to parliament. Doubtlessly, such  a flabby decision -- which was possibly taken so that no one  could say that they had wasted four hours just chatting -- was  the result of a compromise. The PNTCD's proposal had caused  various reactions, some of them were even violently against it,  among the representatives attending the meeting on the shores of  the lake. In order to avoid a brawl among them -- as brawls may  be admirable among street cleaners, but totally unaccepted among  intellectuals -- they eventually reached a obtuse conclusion  upon which all of them could agree: To call the president to  parliament. Abiding by this ridiculous stance, the opposition  parties' representatives then elaborated a solemn letter sealed  with numerous signatures, which they subsequently sent to  Iliescu. Yesterday afternoon, via his spokesman, the president  replied that he is no mood to go from Cotroceni to Metropolitan  Hill [parliament headquarters] to offer explanations. An  arrogant reply given to an arrogant invitation! The opposition  parties' diverging stance regarding the president's Satu-Mare  declarations was not the sole instance in which they held  conflicting opinions recently. There have been other issues as  well, in the judgment of which some of them went to the left,  while others went the right: Such were the proposal to take  [Prime Minister] Nicolae Vacaroiu and [Finance Minister] Florin  Georgescu to court on penal charges [for having failed to  elaborate the 1994 state budget in due time], the issue of  reinstalling monarchy, the draft law on [the legal status of]  the nationalized dwellings, or the no-confidence motion against  the government. There have always been divergent opinions among  the opposition. However, they have never been so absolutely  divergent and, above all, they have never found expression in  contradictory action. Formerly they used to manifest themselves  by the different personal opinions that were expressed. Now,  however, those discrepancies have also manifested themselves in  deeds. During the debates on the law on the nationalized  dwellings, the CDR walked out of parliament hall, while the PD  representatives remained seated. The unity crisis did not  merely show in contradictory actions, but it also went as far as  discrediting each other. The PL-93's [Liberal party '93]  proposal to initiate a no- confidence motion is being  continuously postponed from one CDR conference to the other.  Its coalition partners say neither yes, nor no. The prefer  ambiguity. This new turn taken by the divergence among the  opposition parties has its origins in the profound rift existing  among them regarding the strategy they think best with respect  to the current ruling coalition headed by Ion Iliescu. One part  of the opposition wishes to return to the radicalism that  preceded the amiable phase during which they held negotiations  with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania]. The other  part considers such a move to be an enormous mistake. The  latter are pleading in favor of a policy of compromise. Of  course, this rift is also visible within the CDR itself, namely  between the PNTCD--PL-93 pole, on the one hand, and the PAC  [Civic Alliance Party]--UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in  Romania] pole, on the other. However, in the CDR's relations  with the PD, this rift has already developed into a deep  crevice. Following the [1992] elections, Petre Roman's party  [the PD] was, over a certain period of time, an untamed enemy of  the PDSR and Ion Iliescu. In Romania's parliament, the PD  deputies represented the spearhead of the opposition. Compared  to their dynamic and audacious way of acting, the stance adopted  by the rest of the opposition seemed to be akin to the shyness  of untouched brides. Recently, however, the PD has changed so  much that one can hardly recognize it. It is not just the fact  that Petre Roman's party has lost its former radicalism, but it  has also become a fervent advocate of the compromises and even  of the harmony that should exist between the opposition and the  rulers. Intelligent as they are, the PD leaders do not lack  reasons that they keep bringing up to convince their opposition  partners, and generally, public opinion, of the rightness of  their surprising softness. Within the broad process of trying  to find out the real reasons for their softness, some malevolent  observers even linked it to the safes in which the General  Prosecution is keeping the files of the corruption cases  initiated against certain PD leaders. Others explain this abrupt  faintness of the PD by the fact that its leader, Petre Roman, is  travelling abroad most of the time, rather than being at home.  No doubt about it, the future will disclose the true nature of  the reasons that made the PD change in such a baffling way.  Until then, however, two things are already certain: a) The PD  will have to face the consequences of this compromising policy.  For instance, left alone in the parliament hall during the  debates on the nationalized dwellings, it was unable to have  even one single amendment of its own passed. The majority of  the opposition was "not amused" seeing this "constructive"  stance adopted by the PD. b) The dissolution of the  opposition, as far as CDR--PD relations are concerned, is  already a visible process. If the CDR fails to perceive this,  that process may spread to the relations among the CDR member  parties as well.</p>

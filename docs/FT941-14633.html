			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Mexican finance group reports 35% advance Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival (Banacci), Mexico's largest financial group, reported a 35 per cent increase in total profits to 3.59bn new pesos (Dollars 1.16bn) last year, after a big increase in gains from money-market and equity trading. Banacci's profits include 861m pesos of unrealised gains on securities trading. Banacci said that adjusting for income tax and profit sharing, profits would be Dollars 3.21bn, 21 per cent up on 1992. The profits of Banacci's subsidiaries - which exclude the group's unrealised gains from securities trading - reached 2.68bn pesos last year, just 1 per cent more than last year. Banamex, the group's bank and largest subsidiary, reported total net income of 2.36bn pesos last year, 2.5 per cent lower than 1993. For the fourth quarter, Banacci reported profits, including unrealised securities gains, of 1.36bn pesos, 39 per cent up on the same period last year. Banamex achieved profits of 626m pesos, compared with 743m pesos in the same quarter last year. It blamed Banamex's drop in profits on Mexico's weak economy last year, lack of liquidity and its aggressive increase in provisions for loan losses. Last year Banamex provided for 2.97bn pesos for loan losses. Mr Stefano Natella of CS First Boston said Banamex's results were positive, particularly the growth in fee income, the increase in margins, and control of costs.</p>

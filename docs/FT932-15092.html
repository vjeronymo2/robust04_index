			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Letter: Price close and finance in place Sir, You indicated ('Concerted action urged on exports', April 6) that Thames Water lost a contract in Buenos Aires because we had not arranged export finance in time. The facts are that we came a very close second on price to our French competitors. Our bid was fully compliant and we had all of our financing agreed in detail. International activities are tough enough without attempted own goals by newspapers. Michael Hoffman, group chief executive, Thames Water, 14 Cavendish Place, London W1M 9DJ</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Gatt 'to boost world income by Dollars 213bn' SUCCESSFUL completion of the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation would add Dollars 213bn (Pounds 138.3bn) a year to world income by the year 2002, according to a four-year joint study by the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, released this week at the World Bank/IMF annual meeting in Washington. The lion's share of these gains - about Dollars 190bn - would come from the Uruguay Round's proposed 30 per cent cut in tariffs and subsidies for agriculture. The remaining Dollars 23bn would come from average 30 per cent cuts in tariffs on industrial products. By highlighting the gains that would come from reform of farm trade, the report throws the gauntlet down in front of France in particular, whose government has threatened to block agreement on the Uruguay Round unless its interests as a leading exporter of subsidised farm goods are better protected. The report's authors insist the findings present a conservative estimate of potential gains from trade reform. They take no account of gains from liberalisation of trade in services. Nor do they take account of the 'downside risk' of trade conflict if the Uruguay Round talks fail. The study also emphasises that the Uruguay Round amounts to no more than partial reform of the distortions linked with protectionism. 'If all trade distortions stemming from subsidies and tariffs were completely removed in all regions, we estimate the total (annual) gains in the year 2002 would measure Dollars 477bn,' said Mr Ian Goldin, senior economist at the World Bank, and co-author of the report. Mr Goldin notes that the largest income gains would occur in regions with the largest distortions - notably the EC, the European Free Trade Association countries of Norway, Sweden, Austria, Finland, Iceland and Swizerland plus Japan, and the Asean grouping of Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines. Losers, in contrast, would mostly be poor net food importers, in particular those in sub-Saharan Africa. The study praises the 'remarkable courage' of developing countries, whose recent commitment to painful economic liberalisation 'is now threatened by the failure of the industrialised countries to take reciprocal measures'. It highlights the contradiction that industrial countries are those blocking successful completion of the Uruguay Round, even though it is these same countries that stand to gain most from reform. Of the Dollars 190bn that would be gained from reform of farm trade, the study finds that Dollars 120bn would be reaped by OECD countries. In addition, 64 per cent of the gains from tariff cuts in manufactures trade would go to OECD countries. Almost all gains from liberalisation of services would go to the OECD. The report also attacks the alliance forged between environmental lobbies and protectionists, arguing that it is protection, not free trade, which endangers the environment - especially in agriculture. * Trade Liberalisation: What's at Stake, by Ian Goldin and Dominique van der Mensbrugghe, published jointly by the World Bank and the OECD Development Centre.</p>

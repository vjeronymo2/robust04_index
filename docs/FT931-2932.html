			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Spring Ram asks for its shares to be suspended FEARS about the 1992 results of Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms company, surfaced yesterday as the group asked for its shares to be suspended ahead of Monday's scheduled announcement. The fast-growing company, which seemed to defy the recession, said it would release further information soon about the 1992 results. Attention focused on a possible disagreement with the auditors, Arthur Andersen. The group has in the past brought out its audited annual report on the same day as the results announcement. The audit was expected to be particularly thorough after revelations of false accounting at Spring Ram's Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary last November. Profits at Balterley had been overstated by Pounds 5.6m mainly through the inflation of stock values and sales. The company has since gone to some lengths to reassure them that Balterley was an isolated incident. The share price, which had sunk to 89p after the Balterley debacle, was suspended yesterday at 129p - catching shareholders and analysts by surprise. After the suspension, analysts were raising all the questions that were asked at the time of the Balterley debacle. The questions include ones about stock valuations and high stock levels, the timing of sales, depreciation, and the treatment of government grants. The group's financial and management controls have also been called into question. There are no non-executive directors. The Balterley issue was dealt with mainly by finance director Mr Stuart Greenwood, with chairman and co-founder Mr Bill Rooney coming to London to reassure institutions. Until yesterday, analysts were forecasting 1992 pre-tax profits at Pounds 37m-Pounds 40m. Spring Ram, founded in 1979, became a glamour stock as it built sales to Pounds 194m and pre-tax profit to Pounds 37.6m in 1991. After flotation in 1983, its market value grew from Pounds 11m to a peak of Pounds 651m last May. Lex, Page 24</p>

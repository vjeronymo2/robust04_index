			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Robert Fox article: "NATO Must Not Reinforce Failure of </F> Fantasy Policies"]    [Text] As NATO considers today the widening of air strikes  against Serb forces in Bosnia, the generals and diplomats might  ponder the comments made in June 1944 by Air Marshal Sir John  Slessor, the RAF C-in-C in Italy, on the limitations of airpower.    "It cannot by itself," he wrote to Gen George Marshall,  "defeat a highly organised and disciplined army, even when that  army is virtually without air support of its own."    NATO commanders might come to a similar conclusion about the  chances of bombing the Bosnian Serb fighters into desisting from  attacking.    The chances of NATO aircraft being able to pick out  well-prepared gun positions and supply dumps are limited,  judging by the record of the air strikes on Gorazde.    Widening the area of attack to Gorazde, Zepa and Srebrenica  is likely to lead to further bloodletting and revenge on the  thousands of refugees trapped there.    It will also render the task of UN troops and international  aid operations impossible.    "It is like being half pregnant," said the first UN  commander  in Bosnia, Major Gen Lewis MacKenzie.    "You cannot have a UN force on the ground which is half  humanitarian, half interventionist."    Gen MacKenzie said he hoped the debacle of Gorazde "would  pour a bucketful of cold water over the UN Security Council,"  encouraging its members to pass resolutions for policies which  were feasible, and which its member governments were prepared to  support.    The notion of the Muslim safe areas was a policy always  waiting to be exposed, according to some in the military.    "It was a wheeze dreamed up by the Americans with the French  without the slightest notion how this was to be implemented on  the ground," said a British officer this week.    While NATO shifts and muddles through the arguments for air  attacks to protect the Muslim enclaves, the Serbs appear to have  shifted the agenda and appear to be coming to one of the main  items on the programme.    As the butchery of civilians continued inside Gorazde,  Bosnian Serb forces were reported yesterday to be renewing their  offensive on the corridor in the north and east of Bosnia  between Brcko and Doboj, connecting Serbia with Serb-held areas  in northern Bosnia and Croatia.    The Serb forces -- and now analysts make little  differentiation between those in Bosnia and those based over the  border in Serbia -- seem bent on fulfilling the forging of  Greater Serbia. This would cover a huge arc of Bosnia; and  perhaps stretches of the Dalmatian coast.    The new Serb offensive threatens a war spreading to Croatia  and with Muslims and Albanian nationalists in Macedonia and  Kosovo -- the wider war in southern Europe.    Yesterday, Mr Warren Christopher, the U.S. Secretary of  State, warned of just such a scenario.    Moscow's proposal for a summit to discuss stopping Serb  aggression should be taken seriously -- because it is based less  on self-promotion, too often the vice of the West European and  American leadership, than fear.    More Serb conquests would mean more Muslim refugees with  nowhere to go. The Muslim cause in Bosnia, Kosovo, Albania and  Macedonia, would become an emblem of the new European anarchy.    The Russians fear their battle will be taken up by the  Muslim  peoples on their southern borders, abetted by weapons, money and  terrorist training from Iran, Pakistan, and North Africa.    Faced with such consequences, European soldiers and  diplomats  are worried about the half-hearted gestures at policy from  America, a reflection of the weakness of the Clinton team.    The bloodbath of Gorazde shows that the time for quick-fix  policies is over.    The UN cannot get out, nor can the Bosnian Muslims forces be  armed -- both will take too long, and both risk further disaster.    The NATO delegates deliberating today must allow themselves  space to devise real policies they can deliver. They must avoid  reinforcing the failure of fantasy policies such as protected  Muslim safe havens.</p>

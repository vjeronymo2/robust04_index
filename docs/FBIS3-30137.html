			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Aris R. Ilagan] </F>   [Text] The right wing Young Officers Union (YOU) accused  the government yesterday of insincerity and unpreparedness in  the ongoing talks with the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa  (RAM) [Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance], resulting in a  deadlock in the peace negotiations.    In a statement signed by Captain Magtanggol Santos, YOU  spokesman, the group accused the government of resorting to  propaganda tactics in discrediting the rebel movement. "Some  people tend to believe or, in fact, delude themselves into  believing, that we have agreed to participate in the peace  process because, according to them, we are already a spent  force, weak, marginalized, irrelevant, and needing only a  graceful exit to save our face," Santos said. "This is  self-serving government propaganda line. The fact is, we are  now ahead and right at the center of our people's hearts and  minds," he said.    Since the signing of the preliminary cease fire agreement by  the representatives of the government led by Defense Secretary  Renato S. De Villa and the RAM last 23 December, the peace  negotiations between the two parties "have not even reached a  substantive portion of our talks because of the unpreparedness  of the government to set up the grievance mechanism and  seriously discuss the issues," he said.    Government representatives in the peace talks with right  wing  rebels have called on the RAM-YOU leadership to return to the  negotiating table for the resumption of the talks.    In their message for the 8th anniversary celebration of the  EDSA [Epifanio de los Santos Avenue] Revolution the YOU called  on the leaders of the government and the civilian sector to  reflect since the country is still suffering from economic and  social difficulties.    They also criticized the national leadership for its alleged  failure to curb graft and corruption and lavish government  expenditure. The YOU faction of the right wing group is  believed to be composed of junior officers who took part in the  failed December 1989 coup.</p>

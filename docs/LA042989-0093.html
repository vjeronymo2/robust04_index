			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARL'S JR. JUMPS OUT OF THE FAT, INTO LIGHT OILS  </P> <P> Carl's Jr. is getting an oil change.  </P> <P> The fast-food chain announced this week that it is testing cholesterol-free  french fries, zucchini and onion rings in its 30 San Diego restaurants. The  outlets are cooking all of their fried products in a blend of corn and soybean  oil, rather than an animal-vegetable blend, a saturated fat that generally is  considered less healthy.  </P> <P> If enough customers sink their teeth into the lower-fat food, the Anaheim-based  chain says it will switch to vegetable oil in all 490 of its stores.  </P> <P> The test program makes Carl Karcher Enterprises, operator of Carl's Jr, the  latest fast-food chain trying to capitalize on consumers' supposed growing  desire to eat their way to better health. Over the past year or so, just about  every fast-food chain has at least tried offering low-fat, no-fat or  cholesterol-free menu items.  </P> <P> Heightened consumer fears about how much fat is in food persuaded Blimpie --  the chain known for its submarine sandwiches heaped with cold-cuts and  mayonnaise -- to announce this week that it will test salads and a low-cal  version of its sandwiches in Georgia this summer.  </P> <P> Long John Silver, which has long sold deep-fried, battered fish, has added a  broiled variety to stores in many locations. And within the past year or so,  McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell and Hardee's all have switched to frying at  least some of their menu items in vegetable shortenings.  </P> <P> "It's a definite trend in the industry," said Howard Hansen, a restaurant  analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York. With American demographics  generally shifting toward older customers, fast-food chains "have to widen the  menus and offer what could be perceived as healthier items," Hansen said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Change at the Colonel's  </P> <P> The down-with-cholesterol movement has become as much an effort to keep up with  the competition as to bring in new customers with new offerings.  </P> <P> The Colonel's Kentucky Fried Chicken, for instance, this month will start  testing char-broiled chicken in the Southwest to attract the calorie-conscious  as well as to avoid losing market share to competitors such as El Pollo Loco or  El Pollo Asada.  </P> <P> El Pollo Loco Corp. of La Mirada now claims 21.9% of the convenience restaurant  chicken market in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> While the market for char-broiled chicken is comparatively small now, Kentucky  Fried doesn't want to get grilled by the competition. "Clearly, we wouldn't  want someone to come in and preempt the segment," said Gregg Reynolds,  spokesman for Kentucky Fried Chicken. "It would be stupid for us to be caught  unaware."  </P> <P> Being a late-comer to the crusade may have, in fact, cost Carl's Jr. some  sales. "It's too early to tell. We really won't know until the end of May when  the test is finished and we see" if people prefer the less-fatty foods, said  spokeswoman Patty Beckman. The hamburger chain was late to jump on the  bandwagon because it needed time to make the switch for all of its fried  products.  </P> <P> But if the lower-fat items catch on, the results can be dramatic.  </P> <P> Hardee's, the nation's third-largest fast-food burger chain, for example, has  seen sales climb 25% since June, when it began frying its chicken, turnovers,  fries and fish in a 100% vegetable blend of soybean and peanut oil. The company  traces the gain to the switch from beef tallow, a saturated fat that raises  cholesterol levels in blood.  </P> <P> But healthier products do not always guarantee fatter profits.  </P> <P> At Carl's Jr., the cooking oil switch means tampering with a formula that its  customers know. "People will be able to taste the natural flavor of the potato  more now," insists Beckman.  </P> <P> Perhaps. But McDonald's and Burger King both say they have resisted using 100%  vegetable shortening -- which can cost 30% more than an animal blend -- to cook  fries because their customers prefer the taste of the fattier foods.  </P> <P> Wendy's International Inc. found that out the hard way. The hamburger chain  four years ago offered a "Light Menu" with such items as tuna-stuffed tomatoes,  only to find that customers wouldn't buy it. Instead, the chain discovered that  people buy based on taste -- and don't always purchase what they say they  prefer.  </P> <P> Take Sande Ippolito, 38, of Huntington Beach, who exercises to keep fit and  tries to avoid fast foods: "You're not going to sell me a Blimpie light," she  says. "If I'm being sinful enough to eat an eclair, I don't want to know that  it's light. That doesn't help me at all."  </P> <P> What's more, say health professionals, low-cholesterol fast-foods are not all  that much healthier for you, unless you eat fried foods in large quantities.  </P> <P> "If you hang out" at a fast-food restaurant on a daily basis, yes, you're  probably going to be more benefited by a change in cooking oil more than  someone who only eats there once a week," said Carol Floyd of the American  Heart Assn. National Center in Dallas. "But we'd prefer people not consume  deep-fried items. Period."  </P> <P> </P> <P> dFAST FOOD IS SLIMMING DOWN  </P> <P> BURGER KING: Switched two years ago to 100% vegetable oil for chicken products,  French toast, and onion rings. Still uses a blend of beef tallow and cotton  seed oil for fries.  </P> <P> McDONALD'S: Switched to vegetable oil for fish fillets, McNuggets, pies. Still  uses animal/vegetable fat blend for fries and other potato products.  </P> <P> EL POLLO LOCO: Working on new recipe for lower-fat beans. Menu shows items  prepared according to American Heart Assn. recommendations.  </P> <P> KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN: Has used vetegable shortening since 1939. About to  test-market grilled chicken. Experimented with -- and rejected -- roast  chicken.  </P> <P> TACO BELL:Switched to a vegetable oil and stopped frying its taco shells in  coconut oil in 1987.  </P></p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Booker disappoints market with slight fall to Pounds 32.6m BOOKER, the food distribution and manufacturing group, yesterday disappointed the market when it announced a slight fall in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 32.9m to Pounds 32.6m. The dividend is unchanged at 7.5p. The shares fell 22p to 325p on the news. Mr Jonathan Taylor, chief executive, said there was no sign of an end to recession and trading conditions were 'very tough'. However, he regarded the figures as 'reasonably robust'. The group was responding to conditions by cutting costs and improving efficiency. 'We must see the environment of today as the one we confront tomorrow and the day after, and must size ourselves accordingly,' Mr Taylor said. During the period Booker increased its bad debt provisions by 36 per cent to Pounds 8.4m, though Mr Taylor said this had been done on a conservative basis. There were also some one-off costs such as Pounds 1m for closing a delivered food depot at Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, although in total these were about Pounds 300,000 more than in the comparable period. The figures covered the 24 weeks to June 13, a change in the reporting period. In the six months to end-June, the old basis, pre-tax profits were estimated to have been Pounds 36m against Pounds 37.8m. Group sales rose 4.2 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn and operating profits fell 1.6 per cent to Pounds 43.6m. The interest charge was Pounds 400,000 lower at Pounds 11m. Pre-tax profits would have been Pounds 1.6m higher but for the weakness of the dollar. Profits were translated at Dollars 1.85 to the pound compared to Dollars 1.62 the previous year. Pre-tax profits from the food distribution division fell from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 12.7m. Catering customers in particular were hit by lower consumer spending. Since the period ended sales growth has weakened. The agribusiness division, which includes chicken and turkey breeding, salmon farming, forestry and mushrooms, suffered a dip in profits from Pounds 9.7m to Pounds 9.4m. The turkey business returned to profit, and an upturn in salmon prices is beginning to come through. However, the mushroom business had not recovered as much as hoped. There were delays in shipping product from Daehnfeldt, the seed business. Profits from fish and prepared foods jumped from Pounds 7.1m to Pounds 9.1m. The factories were working at high levels of capacity and sandwich sales were good as people eating out traded down. Earnings per share dipped from 11.56p to 11.34p as the tax rate increased from 21.6 per cent to 22.4 per cent. Mr Taylor said that the group's borrowings should be lower at the year end than at the end of 1991, when gearing was 76 per cent. COMMENT Booker deserves a small prize for broadly maintaining profits when some other food related groups are suffering declines, but the second half will be more of a test. Forecasters are picking Pounds 100m as a round number, against Pounds 103.9m last time, which would give a p/e of about 9.4. The yield on a maintained dividend is 8.9 per cent, although cover is a bit thin at 1.6 times. The rating is fair enough as things stand, but Booker's shares will never perform well until it shows it can turn its well-rehearsed potential into reality. A hard act in a recession, but one Booker should be doing more to perfect.</p>

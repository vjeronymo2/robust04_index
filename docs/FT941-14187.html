			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Technology: Danish banks put a stop to abuse - Worth Watching Danish banks have introduced a digital signature security system which will cover all the country's banks by the end of this year, writes Hilary Barnes. Called Telesec, it is designed to prevent the abuse of office banking systems in which money is transferred electronically, by ensuring that senders and receivers are always identified. The software-based system was developed by Cryptomathic, a small company owned by research staff from Aarhus University. Telesec uses advanced cryptographic solutions, based on mathematics.

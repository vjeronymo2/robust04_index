			<p>CSO     [Text] Seven companies of the Toyota Group such as Toyoda  Automatic Loom Works announced the March 1994 settlement of  accounts on 12 May. The seven companies had a decrease in income  and decrease in profits across the board, but with thorough cost  reduction, they have begun to produce rationalization results on  the highest level of the past and except for Toyoda Machine  Works which has a high percentage of machine tools, secured a  profit. This term, however, with the prolonged slump in the auto  market and parts purchase pressure from overseas, the various  companies of the group are being pressed for further  rationalization. Compared to other groups such as Nissan Motor,  Toyota has a little more experience in rationalization, but  competition upon which their survival hangs is beginning within  an operating environment that is nothing but grim.    The effect of rationalization especially contributed to the  increase in profit factor in the March 1994 settlement of  accounts. With the 9 billion yen of Aisin Seiki heading the  list, the 8 billion yen of Toyoda Automatic Loom Works and the  6.8 billion yen of Toyota Body stand out. All have recorded the  highest level of the past. The ordinary profits for the three  companies were respectively 10.5 billion yen, 14.5 billion yen,  and 3.5 billion yen, but without the rationalization effects,  they would have fallen to a deficit or just barely a profit. The  other four companies also produced the highest rationalization  effects of the past.    At Aisin, which tweaked out 9 billion yen, the company-wide  cost reduction actions which began in November 1991 have reached  their peak. They have reviewed the quality and cost of their own  company's products such as clutches and brakes, and developed  production method assistance actions for suppliers and  thoroughly developed activities with globalization, etc. as the  pillar seeking markets. As a result, they have realized 2.5  billion yen by successive decreases in production processes, 2.4  billion yen by purchasing and other reforms, and 2.2 billion yen  by cost reductions.    Toyota Body, which invested close to 50 billion yen in  Inabe-cho, Mie Prefecture, and completed the Inabe plant in  December 1993, made a thorough review of production processes in  the plant construction. Except for the buildings, prospects are  that they can cover the majority of the depreciation costs by  rationalization. In 1995 when the new plant is in full  operation, a rationalization effect of 1.2 billion yen will be  produced.    Not just the Toyota group, but the various parts and  assembly  companies affiliated with automakers such as Nissan and Mazda  have been earnest in cost reduction actions. There is no big  difference in the target levels for cost reduction, but as  opposed to voices heard from groups other than Toyota which say,  "It is fine if we attain half the target value ordered by the  parent company," they are desperate at the Toyota group, saying,  "If we do not decrease costs more than the level requested by  Toyota, no profit of our own will be produced." In addition to  Toyota itself giving detailed guidance to the various companies  of the group on rationalization measures, there has been an  atmosphere of fear within the group of being dropped and they  have been thorough to the extent of "not providing tea during  conferences and even using the back of paper." This  consciousness is generating the large amount of the  rationalization effect for the Toyota group.    Toyota is further demanding that the various companies in  the  group reduce costs 15 percent in a three-year period starting in  1994. For this reason, the various companies will continue to  proceed with rationalization such as a review of production  processes and product development even in the March 1995  quarter. The amounts are estimated to be less than the previous  term across the board, such as 8.5 billion yen for Aisin and 5.3  billion yen for Toyoda Automatic Loom Works. That is because  "there are few new products this year incorporating  rationalization effects from the development and design stage"  (Toyoda Automatic Loom Works), and the effect of cost-reduction  actions within existing product groups is gradually lessening.    Moreover, even with rationalization, once there is a high  yen, an exchange loss is generated due to the high yen, such as  the 6.5 billion yen in the March 1994 quarter for Toyoda  Automatic Loom Works, and the surrounding environment is grim  such that a rationalization effect is canceled.    Cheap import passenger cars have appeared, and imports of  parts by automakers will increase further in the future. While  prices are dropping and quantities are decreasing, auto parts  manufacturers are plunging into an era when it is too much to  handle by rationalization alone.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / French pilots suspend strike Pilots at Air France have suspended a strike planned for today and tomorrow and will continue to negotiate with management at the loss-making state-owned airline about ways to reach productivity targets. Air France said that all flights would consequently operate normally. The SNPL, SPAC and SOMAC pilots' unions at the airline said they had agreed to re-enter discussions on contested proposals to achieve a 30 per cent productivity increase by 1997. The unions had accepted the productivity targets but rejected management proposals to achieve them. In particular, they opposed a reduction in flight bonuses. The productivity targets are part of a rescue package being implemented by Mr Christian Blanc, the airline's chairman. He says they are a central element in curbing losses at the company, which reached FFr8.48bn (Pounds 1.03bn) last year.</p>

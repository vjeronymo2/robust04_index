			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Unilever to merge food concerns UNILEVER, the UK-Dutch consumer products group, is to merge its British food service businesses into a single company, resulting in the loss of 220 production jobs over three years. About 140 of the lost jobs will be lost at Bromborough, Cheshire, and the remainder at Needham Market, Suffolk. Unilever said it hoped to create about a dozen new jobs in sales. Craigmillar, a division of Unilever's subsidiary Van den Berghs &amp; Jurgens, will be combined with County Fair, part of Birds Eye Wall's, and the food service division of Brooke Bond Foods.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / 'No' vote by French would split EC, warns Mitterrand A FRENCH vote against the Maastricht Treaty in the September 20 referendum would break up the European Community, President Francois Mitterrand warned yesterday. A French 'no' vote to European union 'would break Europe, because there would be no more impulse', Mr Mitterrand told a television interviewer during the annual Bastille day celebration. 'It would put an end to 45 years of French foreign policy . . . A French refusal would seem like a negation of everything.' France's position was decisive, because 'it had a driving role' in European construction. The passion with which a normally cool Mr Mitterrand pleaded for Europe yesterday reflects the rising political temperature in France as the pre-referendum campaign gets under way. On the surface, the government need not worry, because opinion polls suggest 60 per cent are in favour of Maastricht, compared with 40 per cent against. Yet French opinion can be very volatile and the government is anxious the electorate should not misuse the referendum to vote against Mr Mitterrand, whose popularity is at a low ebb. 'I have never said that if you vote for Europe, you vote for me . . . I am not concerned in this affair, neither with the yes nor with the no,' he said yesterday. Mr Mitterrand also attempted yesterday to mollify truckers and farmers, whose recent protests against government decisions have been mingled with anti-European feeling. He understood truckers' tough conditions and farmers' fear of falling prices and accepted the right to demonstrate. Yet 'the state had to make itself obeyed,' he explained, in reply to a question over the use of force to shift roadblocks. Because of the Maastricht vote, Mr Mitterrand suggested it was unlikely he would hold a referendum this year on plans for constitutional reform. In November, he said these could give the French parliament extra powers, reduce the seven-year presidential mandate and introduce an element of proportional representation into general elections.</p>

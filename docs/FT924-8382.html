			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Oceana swings Pounds 158,000 into red OCEANA Consolidated, which has interests in stockbroking and finance, swung into the red in the six months to end-September. The pre-tax deficit for the period amounted to Pounds 158,000, against a profit of Pounds 115,000 last time. The outcome was struck in spite of an increase in operating income from Pounds 4.35m to Pounds 4.79m and a rise in net interest receivable to Pounds 115,000 (Pounds 86,000). Trading throughout the period fluctuated widely, the company said. The first quarter included the election, and business was at record levels. The second quarter, in contrast, was marred by exceptionally low trading volumes, reflecting uncertainty about the economy. Losses per share were 2.43p (earnings of 1.47p).</p>

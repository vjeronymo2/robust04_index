			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Beijing seeks veto over HK air pact An air services agreement between Cathay Pacific Airlines and China Airlines, Taiwan's flag carrier, seems likely to become ensnared in the long-running dispute between China and Taiwan about reunification. It is unclear what attitude Beijing will take to the renewal of the agreement which expires in April next year. Although the accord is between two companies, China has indicated to the Hong Kong government that it wants to approve the terms. Taiwan's Nationalist government refuses to permit direct contacts with the mainland. Most of the island's trade and communications with the mainland are routed through Hong Kong. More than 1m visits a year to mainland China by Taiwanese businessmen and tourists could be affected if China refused to recognise the agreement. Renegotiation is China's first concrete opportunity to exercise economic leverage on the Taipei government. It might use the aviation accord to force the pace of discussions about direct links across the Taiwan Strait. Air services between Hong Kong and Taiwan are not governed by a bilateral government agreement, but by an inter-company one last renegotiated by Cathay and China Airlines in April 1990 and valid for five years. This agreement permits both airlines to fly between Hong Kong and Taipei, and Hong Kong and Kaohsiung, a large port in south-west Taiwan. The airlines want to renegotiate the pact for a further five years. But China has told the Hong Kong government informally that it wants to see the terms of any agreement, as it will span the 1997 transfer of the colony's sovereignty to China. According to a senior government official: 'The Chinese are concerned about what arrangements go through 1997 and they do not expect to see something agreed, that does go beyond 1997, without their blessing'. Although the agreement between Cathay and China Airlines was a matter between two private companies, in reality it would need China's endorsement to have any force after 1997, the official added. The Taiwanese government has said it wants to continue using Hong Kong as a buffer between the island republic and the mainland. But it has said it will develop Subic Bay, the former US naval base in the Philippines, as a transshipment port if Beijing denies it access to Hong Kong.</p>

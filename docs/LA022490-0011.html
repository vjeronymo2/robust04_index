			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAMYAT, ISRAEL AND SOVIET JEWS  </P> <P> One ugly aspect of the Soviet Union's greater toleration of political pluralism  has been the emergence of far-right groups whose stock in trade is  hatemongering and fomenting ethnic strife. Perhaps the most notorious of these  is Pamyat, a Great Russian nationalistic movement whose anti-Semitic advocacy  evokes chilling reminders of Russia's recent past. Now, reports a Soviet  weekly, the Moscow prosecutor's office has begun proceedings against Pamyat  under a section of the criminal code that forbids agitating to restrict the  rights of others. The case, if it's pursued, could provide a key test of how  minority rights will be protected in the new Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Tens of thousands of Soviet Jews, however, don't want to wait for the results  of that test. Instead, they want out, and quickly, a desire strengthened by  recent violence and threats directed against Jews in Moscow and other major  cities. The natural destination for these people is Israel, which is eager to  welcome them. But flights out of Moscow are booked through next fall and the  Soviets, yielding to Arab pressure, now refuse to ratify an agreement for  direct air links between Moscow and Tel Aviv. It should be noted that Arab  pressures increased markedly after Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir let  go with some loose talk that seemed to suggest new immigrants might soon be  flooding into the occupied West Bank.  </P> <P> History forbids ignoring anti-Semitic threats from Pamyat, or dismissing the  rising sense of foreboding among Soviet Jews. In the uncertain Soviet political  climate, accelerated Jewish emigration should be facilitated to the maximum  extent possible. But the agitated political climate in and around Israel must  also be taken into account.  </P> <P> The U.S. position has long been that moving Israelis onto the West Bank --  including new Soviet immigrants -- undercuts opportunities to negotiate any  Israeli-Palestinian political accord. This is the correct position to take.  Possibilities do exist for speeding up the flow of Jewish emigrants from the  Soviet Union, and certainly there are places in Israel proper where they could  be housed. Those prospects might be helped along considerably if the Israeli  government would make unequivocally clear that new immigrants would not be  settled on the West Bank.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALESTINIAN GROUP PROTESTS USE OF 'NAZI' LABEL  </P> <P> While reading "Honoring Those Who Remember," I had some strange thoughts. The  article was about the Simon Wiesenthal Center's national tribute dinner and the  awards given to 14 recipients for their works for Holocaust remembrance.  Actors, writers, producers and directors were honored for their reminders of  the horrors of the Holocaust.  </P> <P> My thoughts wandered to the many efforts made to stop the public from seeing Jo  Franklin-Trout's, "Days of Rage: The Young Palestinians." I wondered about the  many people at the banquet and what they thought of this selective censorship.  Obviously writers, directors, producers and actors, because of their work,  should oppose censorship and support freedom of expression.  </P> <P> I could not help wondering if anyone present at the banquet understood and  sympathized with the Palestinians who are, in the final analysis, also victims  of the Holocaust. The struggle continues and only the players change. The  oppressed become oppressors and fail to recognize their roles and the parts  they play.  </P> <P> FLORENCE RICHARDS, Whittier  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> TRUCE DECLARED AT APARTMENT COMPLEX  </P> <P> Residents and management at the Lincoln/Moody apartments have announced a truce  less than a month after tenants publicly complained about conditions at the  apartment complex.  </P> <P> Speaking at the council meeting last week, resident Brad Barnette said that  owners of the property had solved all the problems.  </P> <P> "I think it is a moot issue at this point," Barnette said. "Everything has been  taken care of. We are very pleased, especially with the maintenance."  </P> <P> On Oct. 9, a group of tenants came to the City Council asking for help. They  complained about unsafe stairways, lack of running water and cockroach  infestations.  </P> <P> The council investigated and gave the owner, California South West Management  of Santa Monica, until Nov. 2 to address the complaints.  </P> <P> Milton Yates, an attorney representing the owner, said he thought most of the  cited conditions had been dealt with. "Maybe with the exception of the  balconies," he said. Some residents' balconies had been propped up with wooden  beams for added security. Yates said the balconies would not collapse, as  residents had feared.  </P></p>

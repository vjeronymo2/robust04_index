			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Major to launch Tories' Scottish fight-back THE PRIME MINISTER will today launch the Tories' fight-back in Scotland with a clear warning to the country's electorate that the survival of the union with the rest of the UK is 'more important' than party politics, Ivo Dawnay writes. Mr John Major will use a campaigning speech to Tory parliamentary candidates in Glasgow to rally them behind a 'fight for the union', stressing that Scottish Conservatives must speak with one voice to get their message across. Downing Street said he would repeat his warning, made earlier this month, that the advocates of devolution or independence had told the people 'the prize but not the price'.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / PNG claims control over Bougainville PAPUA NEW Guinea yesterday claimed to have re-established central government control in 80 per cent of the secessionist island of Bougainville, which has been in rebel hands since police and army units withdrew in 1990, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. Mr Rabbie Namaliu, the prime minister, said the government expected to regain control of the remaining rebel areas in the Kieta and Arawa districts by the end of the year. Military beachheads have been established recently on Buka Island, to the north of Bougainville, and at Siwai, in the south. However, Mr Namaliu said the re-establishment of government control in the remaining rebel-held areas would be achieved 'by talking, not with the barrel of a gun.' He said Mr Francis Ona, leader of the rebel Bougainville Revolutionary Army, had requested a resumption of peace talks, which have been held intermittently over the past two years. 'I have said we are prepared to resume on the condition that secession is not included for discussion,' Mr Namaliu said.</p>

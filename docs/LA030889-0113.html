			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEWIS MAILERS NOT FORGERY UNDER LAW, ATTORNEYS SAY  </P> <P> Lawyers for Assemblyman John R. Lewis asked a Superior Court judge Tuesday to  dismiss felony forgery charges against the Orange County Republican, contending  that the state's forgery statutes do not apply to Lewis' involvement in sending  campaign letters bearing a phony signature of former President Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> The motion, filed by defense attorney Clyde M. Blackmon, will delay Lewis'  arraignment until at least late April.  </P> <P> Blackmon contended in the motion that the crime of forgery requires an intent  to defraudsomeone of money or property rights. Even if Lewis caused the fake  Reagan signature to be placed on thousands of campaign letters sent to voters  in 1986, Blackmon argued, the assemblyman's action did not "involve deprivation  of any tangible right to money or property."  </P> <P> He compared the Lewis case to a 1987 case in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled  that the term "fraud" did not refer to such intangible rights as the right to  honesty in government.  </P> <P> "The necessary intent to defraud cannot be found based on a mere intent to  influence the judgment or opinion of the voting public," Blackmon wrote.  </P> <P> W. Scott Thorpe, who is prosecuting Lewis for the state attorney general's  office, would not comment directly on the defense motion. But he said his  office believes the forgery charge will withstand the challenge.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Statute Applicable'  </P> <P> "We believe the intent to defraud the public, in this case the voters, is  covered by this statute," Thorpe said. "We think the forgery statute is  applicable to his conduct."  </P> <P> Lewis, 34, of Orange, was indicted Feb. 6 by the Sacramento County Grand Jury  on one count of forgery for his role in mailing the letters, which were sent on  behalf of six Republican candidates for the Assembly in 1986. The White House  denied that the endorsements were authorized by Reagan or any of his aides.  </P> <P> Before returning the indictment, the grand jury heard testimony from nine  witnesses, including political consultants, direct mail specialists, and staff  members of the Assembly Republicans' campaign committee.  </P> <P> The transcript of those secret proceedings, which under state law could have  been made public Monday, has been sealed while Lewis' lawyers argue their  contention that its release would endanger his right to a fair trial.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge James Morris, who is handling the pretrial maneuvering in  the Lewis case, ruled Tuesday that the transcript should remain sealed for at  least one more week.  </P> <P> The attorney general's office and lawyers for the Los Angeles Times and the  Sacramento Bee argued against sealing the 350-page document. In papers filed  with the court, the prosecutor and the newspapers contended that the publicity  surrounding the case would not significantly deplete the large pool of jurors  available in Sacramento County.  </P> <P> The transcript is expected to be politically damaging because it is likely to  provide an insider's look at the GOP campaign operation. The same witnesses  interviewed by the grand jury told state investigators that Lewis and former  Assembly Republican Leader Pat Nolan of Glendale instructed their staffs to lie  to White House officials looking into the incident.  </P></p>

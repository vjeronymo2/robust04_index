			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Slavoljub Susic] </F>   [Text] The massacre at the Sarajevo market last week and  the quick accusations that the Army of the Srpska republic  committed this appalling act which resulted in the NATO Council  ultimatum along with a serious threat of raiding Serbian  positions, unambiguously confirm the assessments by military  analysts that the territory of the former Yugoslavia as planned  by AVNOJ [Anti- Fascist Council of National Liberation of  Yugoslavia] has obviously been assigned the role of an  experimental training ground for the creators of the so-called  new world order. It goes without saying that just as in any  experiment in which one does not implement the known methods and  procedures, so in the one on the territory of the former  Yugoslav federation one ignores valid norms of international law  and universally accepted principles of the UN Charter, the  Helsinki Act of the CSCE, the Paris Charter for a New Europe,  and other international conventions.    The most recent foul massacre of innocent civilians in  Sarajevo -- carried out according to an already used scenario  and with a strong media campaign against the Serbs who are  accused without any proofs -- has been planned with a view to  postponing peace negotiations indefinitely and forcing the  Serbian side to make new concessions to the Muslims. As we  already know, this has been used as an excuse for the world  centers of power to exert pressure on the Serbs again, which was  also demonstrated at the aforementioned NATO meeting in Brussels.    It is no coincidence that Manfred Woerner, secretary general  of that only remaining military-political alliance, was given  the honor of triumphantly announcing one more ultimatum to the  Serbs on the model of the one from the distant 1914. It is not  surprising as it is coming from the German Woerner. He would  like to settle the debts from the wars gone by. However, we are  asking what we have done to our European allies and the United  States to make them constantly threaten us. Perhaps by being on  these regions for centuries, we are standing in the way of their  cartographers who would like to delineate new spheres of  interest on the already multicolored political map of the  Balkans. And interests -- as their slogan says -- are stronger  than distant war alliances and friendships.    One should not therefore be surprised when current U.S.  President Clinton frequently stresses that he harbors true  fondness for better positions of the Bosnian Muslims, in which  he is supported by a large group of oil-rich Islamic countries  and France, Great Britain, and, of course, Germany, not to  mention others.    By reading more carefully the announcement of the NATO  Council of 9 February, which obviously encroaches onto the  powers of the UN Security Council, one notices an ultimatum-like  demand issued to the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw heavy weapons to  20 km from the center of Sarajevo in 10 days starting from 10  February 1994 at 2400. The demand to Muslim authorities is to  put their heavy weaponry under UNPROFOR [United Nations  Protection Force] control within the same deadline and, as it is  written, to refrain from attacks along the existing lines of  confrontation in the city.    Further on, it is pointed out that heavy weaponry of any of  the sides which is found within the forbidden zone will be  exposed to air strikes by the NATO forces which will be carried  out in close coordination with the UN secretary general and in  conformity with the decisions of the NATO Council.    Even such as it is, this document could be a step toward the  calming down of the clashes. However, the experiences they have  had so far warn the Bosnian Serbs to be cautious, because who is  to guarantee that the Muslims will not again stage a performance  for the world media so that the command of the NATO southern  wing may order air strikes at the Serbs? The Serbs will in that  case not sit with their arms crossed and head bowed but will  respond according to their own possibilities which, as even the  potential attackers admit, are not to be underestimated.    Some time at the beginning of last year, one could read in  the MOSCOW NEWS the statement by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev on the occasion of the demand by the Western partners  for Russia to take into account the pressure by Muslim countries  when assessing these partners' behavior towards the  Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. If we agreed with the very  possibility of pressure by the countries that see the Bosnian  Muslims as their clients, then it is easy to imagine the  formation of a group of Christian countries, with a division  into a Catholic and Orthodox groups within it. Then the third  world war as well can really begin in Sarajevo.</p>

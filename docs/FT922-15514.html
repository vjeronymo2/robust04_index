			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Letter: More in the cabinet Sir, David Marsh's report, 'True Blue shires' (March 28), is wrong. John Biffen is not the only member of Mrs Thatcher's 1979 cabinet standing for re-election. What about Michael Heseltine and David Howell? Michael Jopling and Norman Fowler were also 'invited to attend' the 1979 cabinet, although not full members at the outset. David Howell, parliamentary candidate, Guildford constituency, 63 Woodbridge Road, Guildford, Surrey GU1 4RD</p>

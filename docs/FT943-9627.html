			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Arts: Hampstead Theatre wins Ramsay Award The first Peggy Ramsay Foundation Award, all Pounds 50,000 of it, has gone to London's Hampstead Theatre. It will enable the theatre, and its director Penny Topper, to put on a no-expense-spared-production of Rona Munro's new play The Maiden Stone. Peggy Ramsay was the draconian theatrical agent who numbered most of the leading playwrights of the past generation, from Orton through Ayckbourn to Hare, among her clients. When she died in 1991 she left an estate of over Pounds 1m 'to benefit writers in need of assistance.' The trustees of the foundation decided to give a substantial sum each year to a new play, to enable it to have the best possible production. Six selected theatres sent in scripts of planned projects and Hampstead won. On average a new play at Hampstead costs Pounds 35,000 to put on, and the small stage means that the cast rarely exceeds six. Munro's play, which is still a work in progress, is an ambitious project involving a troupe of travelling players in the 19th century whose wanderings take them to a remote village in the north of Scotland. The extra money will be spent on costumes and sets, and on training up the large number of children required in the cast. By the time it opens early next year the Hampstead stage will be buzzing with all the flair that money can buy.</p>

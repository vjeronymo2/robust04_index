			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAY WELL  </P> <P> In full-page ads this week in the Hollywood Reporter and Daily Variety, actor  Carroll O'Connor not only thanked friends and fans for their support during his  recent surgeries but also offered lifesaving advice. "When your good doctor  tells you to take the latest kind of cardiograph, and the latest is miraculous  in what it can reveal about your heart, don't postpone, don't evade, don't  content yourself with the fact that you're feeling swell. The new cardiograph  may prove you're right, and if it does, fine! Celebrate! And stop smoking!" As  for his own heath following coronary bypass and gallbladder surgeries in March,  he wrote, "The old pump is delivering, for the first time in many years, full  volume at full strength. I look forward certainly to better health in general,  and even, possibly -- though I hate making big promises -- to having a  pleasanter personality." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

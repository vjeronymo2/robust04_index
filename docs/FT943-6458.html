			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / The Markets: Mismanaging trade policy - Economic Eye For president Clinton, the chief objectives of foreign policy are economic; the goal is increased exports; and the benefit of those exports is 'good jobs'. Along with these simplistic goals goes an equally simple approach. The administration wants results, above all from Japan. Senator Joseph Biden has defined the US attitude with disarming candour. 'I don't want to compete,' he has stated, 'I just want to win.' This quotation jumps out from the pages of a splendid new pamphlet on the defects of the US approach to trade with Japan.* The fire of the author, Douglas Irwin of Chicago University, is directed at what his teacher, Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University - the economist who has argued most persuasively against the new results-oriented approach - labels 'voluntary import expansions' (VIEs), by analogy with voluntary export restraints. The starting point should be whether a special policy for Japan is justified at all. Does it matter that Japan has a current account surplus of 3 per cent of gross domestic product, or that Japan has a bilateral surplus with the US of some 1 per cent of US GDP? Exports of surplus savings from a rich country like Japan seem far more defensible than for the equally rich US to import scarce capital. It is also quite wrong to argue that current account surpluses mean there must be protection and vice versa for deficits. On that basis, Japan must be more protectionist now than when it used to run large deficits. Obviously, it is not. The anguish over bilateral deficits is particularly ridiculous. The purpose of creating a multilateral trading system after the second world war was, after all, to allow such bilateral deficits and surpluses. Nevertheless, it is a commonly held view that the Japanese bilateral surplus is gravely damaging the US economy. As the chart demonstrates, if the US is being damaged, Singapore and Hong Kong should already be ruined and even Taiwan should be tottering. Yet these are among the most successful economies on earth. It seems more plausible, on the evidence, to argue that running a large bilateral deficit with Japan is the surest route to an economic miracle. Then there are all those complaints about Japanese obstacles to imports. As Professor Irwin notes, the new US results-oriented trade policy rests on two arguments: that Japan's is an unusually closed market and that 'trade policies requiring specific, quantitative outcomes are necessary to overcome or to compensate for hidden barriers'. The first premise is exaggerated and the second 'altogether inaccurate'. Japan does import relatively few manufactures in relation to GDP. In 1992 only a half of its imports were manufactures, compared with 82 per cent for the US and 79 per cent for Germany. But sophisticated econometrics does not support the belief that its imports are smaller than might reasonably be expected, given its size and lack of resources. The statement from Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, that 'Japan's markets are closed by any measure the US may choose' is, insists Prof Irwin, 'completely absurd'. Grant, for the moment, that Japan is closed, not because the people prefer to buy domestic products, which is their business, but because of obstacles created either by the government or by the structure of Japanese business. Would results-oriented policy be the right way to proceed? The answer, argues Prof Irwin, is no. 'VIEs are managed trade in the worst sense of the word. They do not make economic sense, they detract from the goal of liberalising the Japanese economy and they undermine the objective of an open, non-discriminatory world trading system.' They are open to capture by lobbies and are almost certain to be discriminatory. The most potent objection, however, is simply that the proposed solution will make the chief problem worse. Since the principal obstacle to imports is alleged to be collusion among Japanese companies, the aim must be greater competition. Yet the only way to make a VIE work is by cartelising an industry, or putting it under direct government management, or both. Take, for example, the seminal case of the semi-conductor pact of 1986. The Japanese government has since discovered that what it recognised as an expectation by US business - a 20 per cent market share for foreign producers - is regarded as binding by the US government. In trying to impose its will on domestic producers, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has also created such ill-will that it has apparently resolved never to adopt market-share targets again. Until now, it has stuck to its guns. But the clock may be running out. By September 30, a resolution needs to be reached in negotiations on telecommunications and medical equipment. In the absence of success, the US may impose sanctions. On that day, the US must also reach a decision on which areas of Japanese trade policy are to be found 'unfair' under section super-301 of its trade law. All this puts a great deal of pressure on the Japanese to concede. What should they do? Ideally, the entire US-Japan conflict needs to be placed within the new world trade organisation. If that proves impossible, the Japanese must at least reiterate the essential point: 'yes, we are prepared to discuss our policies; but never again will we make commitments on behalf of private Japanese firms.' *Douglas A Irwin, Managed Trade: the Case against Import Targets, Washington DC: American Enterprise Institute, 1994.</p>

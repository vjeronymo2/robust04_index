			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Bentsen gives yen further impetus THE US dollar fell sharply against the yen yesterday, reaching a record low after US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told reporters he wanted to see a stronger yen. In Tokyo the dollar had already touched Y119.23, its lowest point ever, with the Japanese authorities showing little sign of trying to break its rise against the US currency. But Mr Bentsen's apparently offhand remark, which he did not elaborate on, weakened the dollar still further to Y118.15. Traders said that if the dollar-yen rate broke through a floor of Y118.0, that could trigger further selling down to a new level of Y115. The yen has strengthened throughout the week, apparently on rumours that a meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers in London on February 27 might try to engineer an appreciation of the yen to choke off the rise in Japan's trade surplus with the US. Mr Bentsen said the US would be in a much stronger position to 'restore its rightful leadership' of the G7 because President Bill Clinton's programme of increased taxes and cuts in federal spending would set a better example of economic policy. Worries that the Clinton economic programme might undermine the US recovery have also weakened the dollar in Tokyo this week. However, the surge in the yen is also likely to be due to Japanese companies repatriating funds from abroad to improve their finances before books close on March 31. Most Japanese companies are facing their third year of declining profits. Mr Mamoru Ozaki, the Finance Ministry's vice minister and most powerful bureaucrat, said there was no need for policy changes to address the strengthening of the yen. The Japanese government would be happy for the yen to appreciate gradually, in part because this might help to correct the trade surplus. But senior officials at both the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan rule out any concerted effort by the G7 to manipulate exchange rates to reduce the surplus. The long slowdown in Japanese money supply growth may be reaching its end, according to Bank of Japan figures published yesterday. The broadly defined money supply fell by 0.3 per cent in January from a year earlier, the fifth consecutive month of contraction. However, the rate of contraction has eased considerably in the past few months from a 0.6 per cent fall in October and November and 0.4 per cent in December. The bank's measure of broad liquidity, meanwhile, grew by 2.5 per cent from a year before, an unchanged rate from December. Currencies, money markets, Page 13</p>

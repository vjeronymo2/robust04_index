			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Bundesbank to abandon short-dated paper sales The Bundesbank is to stop issuing short-dated paper, so-called Bulis, because of a conflict between its conservative policies and the government's desire to liberalise Germany's under-developed financial markets. The last auction of the six-month maturity Bulis will take place in September, the bank said yesterday, adding it did not want to foster 'short-termism' in financial markets. The surprise move followed the loss of its long struggle to prevent the launch of money market funds in Germany. By scrapping Bulis the Bundesbank has made sure the funds, which normally invest in short-term government and corporate bonds, have at least one less investment opportunity. Money market funds are short-term investment accounts which offer ordinary savers a chance to 'play' money markets by buying or selling units in large managed funds at will. They became legal on August 1 with the introduction of laws bringing local financial markets more into line with international competitors. Commerzbank, Germany's third biggest commercial bank, has from the outset run an aggressive mass advertising campaign explaining to Germany's traditionally conservative savers: 'In comparison with your deposit account, it means top interest rates and maximum liquidity.' The Bundesbank had blocked the funds' introduction for years because of the volatile effects they can have on money supply data, and concerns that its grip on monetary policy might be weakened. Long-term lending and saving policies are the cornerstones of the Bundesbank's statutory mission to preserve the stability of the D-Mark. Money supply is its main inflation indicator. The government, however, has pressed on with updating legislation blamed for hampering Frankfurt's efforts to compete on a global basis. The latest move stemmed from a Bonn initiative in 1991 to bring 'Finanzplatz Deutschland' in line with international standards. The Bundesbank's pointed statement made plain that the withdrawal of its objections to money market funds in May, after parliamentary approval became inevitable, had been merely a formality. Its reservations 'basically continue to apply', it said. 'The Bundesbank therefore prefers not to offer investment facilities itself (Bulis) for money market funds nor to encourage a trend towards short-term maturities in the financial markets.' In a sharp reminder to government and other public-sector borrowers, the bank said it 'assumed' they would support its long-term policy and continue financing their budgets with long-term securities. 'The bank might not be enthusiastic, but I think they can live with it,' said Mr Peter Pietsch, a senior economist at Commerzbank.</p>

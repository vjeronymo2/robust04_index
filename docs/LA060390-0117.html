			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> SPEAKERS THREATEN BOYCOTTS, LAWSUITS TO KEEP LOCKHEED  </P> <P> Nearly 2,000 Lockheed Corp. workers rallied at a Burbank union hall Saturday to  kick off a campaign aimed at persuading officials of the aerospace company not  to leave Southern California.  </P> <P> A steady parade of union leaders and politicians -- including Mayor Tom Bradley  and state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) -- urged Lockheed employees to  stick together and threatened the company with boycotts and lawsuits if it  follows through on plans to relocate.  </P> <P> "We're mad as hell, and we're not going to take it any longer," Roberti said.  "If Lockheed leaves we're going to make sure it's the bitter end of that  company."  </P> <P> Saturday's rally marked the beginning of a community campaign to prevent  Lockheed from leaving.  </P> <P> "This is not just a labor movement. This is a community movement as well," said  Charlie Brown, president of Aeronautical District Lodge 727 of the  International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the union that  represents many Lockheed employees.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley told the workers he would "be in this fight until the bitter,  bitter end."  </P> <P> The aerospace company announced on May 8 that it was pulling much of its  operation out of Burbank and selling nearly all of its 320 acres there.  Lockheed also announced that two major aircraft it had been proposing to build  at its Palmdale facility -- the Advanced Tactical Fighter and the P-7A -- will  instead be built at its plant in Marietta, Ga.  </P> <P> As many as 4,500 workers are expected to lose their jobs in the cost-cutting  reorganization. Lockheed officials have not said what will happen to those  employees.  </P> <P> "Lockheed may think they'll make a profit by moving to Georgia, but someday  that's going to come back and bite them -- and you know where," said Pete  Beltran of United Auto Workers Local 645.  </P> <P> The crowd, many of whom wore red to symbolize their anger at Lockheed, roared  with approval. It was not an event at which Lockheed officials were entirely  welcome.  </P> <P> Several crowd members wore T-shirts emblazoned with a skunk and the slogan  "Lockheed Stinks," in a reference to the company's super-secret Advanced  Development Co., nicknamed the "Skunk Works."  </P> <P> Monico Zamora, 31, a Lockheed maintenance supervisor, said his job is uncertain  from month to month. He remained optimistic, however, that workers could  convince the company not to pull out.  </P> <P> "We can still save something here," he said.  </P> <P> Eric Mann, international representative for the United Auto Workers urged the  audience to fight for one goal.  </P> <P> "You have a right to your job," he said. "I don't want to hear for a year. I  don't want to hear retraining. I don't want to hear severance. I want to hear  Lockheed must stay. . . . You should have only one demand: Stay in L.A."  </P></p>

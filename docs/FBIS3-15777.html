			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Text] The situation on the Tajik-Afghan border remains  complex. Over the holiday a number of provocations were carried  out against the Russian border guards and the subunits of the  CIS collective peacekeeping forces. Here is a characterization  of the situation on the border with Afghanistan and in  Tajikistan as a whole by Colonel General Boris Pyankov,  commander of the collective peacekeeping forces.    [Begin Pyankov recording] Unfortunately there has been a  sharp intensification of the confrontation between the regions,  and there is an attempt to employ strong-arm methods. More and  more often there are very brutal terrorist acts. People are  being killed for different reasons.    Regions are in conflict, and various forces are in conflict  within the regions themselves. At the same time we sense that  there has been a sharp increase in the pressure on the  Tajik-Afghan border and on the border guards above all from the  Afghan side. For the time being, of course, the weather  conditions have been a restraining factor. It is mountainous  terrain, and everything is still covered with snow. The passes  are closed, and paths are difficult to traverse. In these  conditions, however, violations or attempts to violate the  border are occurring almost daily. The situation is  particularly grave in the Pyandzh border detachment's strip,  where border violations and attempts to break through are  occurring almost daily. The situation is complex too in the  Sarygor area, where the well-known 12th and 13th border posts  are located.    Unfortunately new symptoms have appeared. Whereas previously  we had been noting cases of attempts to cross the border by  relatively small groups, bands, and detachments armed with small  firearms, we now have cases of border posts, the positions of  peacekeeping force subunits, and Tajik populated localities  being bombarded by mortars and artillery from Afghan territory.  [end recording]    The command of the peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan thinks  that the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border may have further  deteriorated by mid-March. According to the military, a  considerable number of specially trained Tajik opposition  fighters have already amassed in the Afghan border areas. Many  of these detachments are equipped with Stinger portable  anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, and mortars.</p>

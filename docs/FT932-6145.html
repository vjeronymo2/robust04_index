			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drug stocks pull the market down WIDER consideration of the appointment of a new chancellor of the exchequer in the UK appeared to do nothing to shake the view of the London stock market that little immediate change in domestic economic policy is likely. There was no shift in market forecasts by the leading securities houses, although one commented that, 'Mr Lamont's memoirs should make interesting reading, especially if he publishes very shortly.' Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, is expected to meet his test later this year when his budget will show whether he has been tough enough on public spending. Long-dated government bonds fell by nearly a full point yesterday, but market strategists maintained that it was much too soon to regard this as a judgement on the government re-shuffle. An extremely poor opinion poll showing by the Conservative party in its southern England heartland reinforced the political pressures on the government. The equity market, however, continued to react to Wall Street, which fell sharply yesterday as it moved into its new session with a loss of 25 points on the Dow Average. The London market, which had been moving narrowly during the early part of the session, extended its losses later. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,840.7, down 14.6. Lack of support also hit the FT-SE Mid 250 Index which lost a further 4.2 to 3,165.4. But trading volume was generally unimpressive. Seaq volume dipped to 577.3m shares from Thursday's 660.5m, with non-Footsie business providing about 66 per cent. Retail business worth Pounds 1.37bn in the previous session confirmed the recovery in genuine customer investment interest. The rally in brewery and consumer stocks seen on Thursday was reversed yesterday. Pharmaceutical stocks ran into pressure on renewed worries over the Clinton administration's healthcare policies. The final day of trading in its present shape of ICI, Britain's blue chip chemical group, passed ingloriously. Over the week, the first leg of the two week trading account in equities, the FT-SE Index has gained 28.5 points or about 1 per cent. Although doubts on the progress of the recovery in the domestic economy have continued, UK equities have benefited from Wall Street's progress to new peaks - hence London's unhappiness when the Dow opened on the downside yesterday.</p>

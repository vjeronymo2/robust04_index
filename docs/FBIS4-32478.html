			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Evgeniya Drumeva: "Czech President Havel Visits </F> Sofia"]    [Text] Sofia, June 23 (BTA) -- President Vaclav Havel of  the Czech Republic arrived on a one-day working visit to Sofia  at noon today. He is accompanied by the Minister of National  Wealth Management and Privatization Jiri Skalicky and First  Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra.    Mr. Havel was welcomed by President Zhelyu Zhelev with full  military honours.    Immediately after the ceremony, the two presidents had a  nearly one-hour-long session. They said after the meeting that  their conversation had been very useful. The two briefed each  other on the development of political processes, the processes  and prospects of democratization, the progress of economic  reform in the two countries and exchanged views on foreign  policy problems, stressing the situation in the Balkans.    The two countries' integration with the West European and  Euroatlantic structures was also on the agenda. "On this point,  our views are identical, and we arrived at the conclusion that  we must not compete but help each other for an earlier  integration of each of the countries," the Bulgarian head of  state pointed out.    "Probably the most important thing on which we agreed again  was that our countries have the same political organization and  foster the same values... We also agreed that the countries  which managed to shed communism should also walk on the same  road and cooperate, exchange experience and possibly coordinate  their positions in the directions I listed (European and  Euroatlantic integration), but this cooperation should by no  means be institutionalized. For even the slightest sense that  the post-communist countries are setting up some sort of  community would create the impression that instead of aspiring  to join the European community, they are aspiring to divide it,"  President Havel said. In his view, what matters most is to have  continued working contacts between these countries.    "We devoted a considerable part of our conversation to the  Balkans, on which we turned out to have identical views," Mr.  Havel said. "I set forth our firm assessment of the presence of  1,000 Czech Blue Helmets in the territory of former Yugoslavia,  which we believe is extremely important and extremely useful for  the maintenance of peace and the pacification of the area,"  President Zhelev indicated, adding that "the Czech Republic is  far from that region, it has no immediate territorial, minority  or any other problems with ex-Yugoslavia so as to be suspected  of self-seeking motives." "We discussed the risks to which this  area is prone, especially in Kosovo, the risks to Albania should  events take an adverse turn," Dr. Zhelev also said.    Russia and "our ambivalent attitude to it," as President  Zhelev put it, was also discussed. The sides noted their  support for the democratic forces in Russia and their  "categorical distancing from all retrograde forces which are  trying to take advantage of the difficulties: neofascists,  neocommunists and ultra nationalists, who seek to isolate  Russia," Dr. Zhelev said. Both sides are pleased with Russia's  formal signing of Partnership for Peace without setting  conditions for a privileged status within the North Atlantic  Alliance, President Zhelev pointed out.    Asked about the similarities and differences in the two  countries' democratic processes, President Havel said that both  countries have created all prerequisites for development of the  democratic system. "Clearly, the Czech Republic is leading  among the post-communist countries because 65 percent of the  property there is already private. I think the main reason for  this process is the unity of democratic forces in the Czech  Republic, something of which we cannot boast, at least for the  time being, and I think this is the main reason for Bulgaria's  overall lag in the reforms," President Zhelev said for his part.    In parallel talks, Czech Privatization Minister Jiri  Skalicky  conferred with the Executive Director of the Privatization  Agency Reneta Indzhova, and Deputy Minister Vondra with  Bulgarian First Deputy Foreign Minister Valentin Gatsinski.    Later in the day, President Havel is expected to meet with  Bulgarian intellectuals for the presentation of his book "Power  of the Powerless."    This is Mr. Havel's second visit to Bulgaria after April  1992, when he arrived as president of Czechoslovakia to sign a  Treaty of Friendly Relations and Cooperation between the two  countries.</p>

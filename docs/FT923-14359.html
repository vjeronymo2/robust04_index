			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US challenges claims of 'non-subsidisers' CANADA AND Australia, two countries that consider themselves 'non-subsidisers' in the world wheat market, both provide indirect subsidies through their wheat boards and government farm programmes, according to a new report issued by the US General Accounting Office. The GAO said the governments of both countries have on occasion reimbursed their wheat boards for annual losses. In 1985, when the US introduced an export subsidy scheme to counter similar European Community subsidies, the Canadian government reimbursed its board for a Dollars 19m loss. In 1986-87, the government paid Dollars 140m to compensate for the board's shortfall in the 1986-87 season when wheat export prices plummeted. The marketing boards, said the GAO, offered different prices to different customers and seek to capture new markets by selling grain at lower-than-posted prices. Canada supports farmers with freight subsidies, crop insurance and guaranteed minimum prices. Australia has a rural family farm adjustment scheme and farm input subsidies. Both have export credit guarantee programmes, enabling them to take on riskier markets. According to figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in 1990 Australian government assistance provided wheat farmers with 11 per cent of their income. US and EC wheat farmers received 44 and 46 per cent of their income from government programmes. Canadian wheat producers received from 43 per cent.</p>

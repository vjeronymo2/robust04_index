			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said this evening that  if the massacres in Rwanda continue, France will send soldiers  to Rwanda:    [Begin recording] [Juppe] Either the cease-fire is  respected,  or else the massacres go on. If they go on, then we cannot  continue to tolerate this situation, and France would in this  case be prepared to mount -- with others, with its European  partners or with African states -- an operation to save the  people.    [Reporter] How could such an operation be mounted?    [Juppe] You must surely understand that I am not going to  spell it out for you here. France decided this morning to say  that it is prepared to take part in such an operation, and we  are now studying the modalities of implementation. [end  recording]    Bernard Kouchner, former minister of humanitarian action,  left for Rwanda yesterday evening. He wants to encourage  dialogue between the different factions.</p>

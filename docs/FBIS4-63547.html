			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk hoped that the  Ukrainian and Crimean parliamentary delegations which would meet  on Tuesday [24 May], would find a solution to the Crimean issue.    However, the only possible way is not to alter the status of  Crimea or the territorial integrity of Ukraine, Kravchuk told  journalists on Sunday when he was present at a Cossack  celebration in the city of Pervomaisk in the Nikolayevsk Region.    Kravchuk emphasized that territorial integrity was the  borderline which must not be violated. This holds for Crimea as  well, Kravchuk stressed.    He also said that the crisis could be solved as soon as the  Crimean parliament cancels its decision to reinstate the 1992  constitution which introduces dual citizenship and relations  with Kiev based on agreements.</p>

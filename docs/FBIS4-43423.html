			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl praised the  reconciliatory role of Moscow's State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin  in Russian politics. According to government spokesman Dieter  Vogel, during talks with Rybkin in Bonn Kohl also stressed  Germany's "energetic interest" in the continuation of the  democratic and market economic reform process in Russia on the  basis of stable framework conditions.    The two politicians agreed "that bilateral relations are  free  from fundamental and insoluble problems." This positive  starting point should be used and further developed in the  interest of the two countries and all of Europe.

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Arts: Hugh Masekela - Jazz Miles Davis described the young South African who had come to his attention in the 1960s as follows: 'Hugh had his own approach to playing the trumpet . . . had his own sound. Every time I saw him I told him just to keep on doing his thing rather than trying to play what we were playing over here. After a while I think he started listening to me because his playing got better.' Davis followed Masekela's progress with interest, in the 1960s when studying at the Manhattan School of Music. Prior to that he had studied at the Guildhall in London after John Dankworth secured him a place there. He, like a number of his fellow black jazz musicians, including Dollar Brand and Dudu Pukwana, had been forced to leave Johannesburg in 1960 by the strictures of apartheid. And like them, just as Davis advised, Masekela has retained the distinctive musical colours of the townships to combine variously with his bebop, big band and funk influences. Now 65, and back in South Africa again, the trumpeter's recent recorded output has been characterised by a toughening up in both African and 'western' funk attitude. Starting a two week stint at Ronnie Scott's on Monday, Masekela sounds in great form. The young band, which consists of keyboards, electric and bass guitars and drums, acts as a metronomic rhythm section to Ngenekhaya Mahlangu's rasping tenor sax and the leader's explosive flugelhorn. Masekela sings too: a hoarse, shouted declamation which subsides abruptly into lilting harmonies filled out by the band. Indeed, it is a pity that dancing isn't possible in the main room at Ronnie's - it is too full anyway - because Masekela's jubilant highlife tinged numbers do more than tap feet. The sweet tunes with their clattering cowbells and chipping rhythms are irresistible. Masekela squeezing sparks out of the horn to the encouragement of an ullulating audience is electrifying. The close, with Masekela tragically intoning the story of the Gold Train, is a lesson in how to build up a song for maximum effect. London is lucky to have been a spiritual home to musicians like Masekela during the bad years. While it seems likely that the death of apartheid will mean that we in London will see less of Masekela, more of South Africa's unfettered dancing-in-your-head jazz will surely come our way from those he is now free to encourage.

			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BASKETBALL REGIONALS;  </P> <P> DIVISION III GIRLS;  </P> <P> TRAKH'S WILDCATS REMAIN ON TRACK  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda High School, fresh off a 69-40 victory over Atascadero in the  Southern Section 3-A title game Friday, faces the unknown tonight in the first  round of the Division III Southern California Regionals.  </P> <P> The Wildcats play host to Our Lady of Peace at 7:30 tonight.  </P> <P> "I don't know a thing about them," Brea Coach Mark Trakh said.  </P> <P> Our Lady of Peace (19-6), of the San Diego Section, was the City Central League  champion and is having its most successful season.  </P> <P> Our Lady of Peace lost to University of San Diego High School in the section  Division III semifinals. It was the first time the school had advanced to the  section tournament, let alone to the state tournament.  </P> <P> Its leading scorer, Tammy Tavares, is averaging 17.7 points but was held to  just six in the loss to USDHS last week.  </P> <P> The winner advances to the semifinals Thursday against Reedley (Central  Section) or Ramona (San Diego).  </P> <P> Brea would figure to have the upper hand against Our Lady of Peace. The  Wildcats have won playoff games by 51, 46, seven and 29 points -- an average  margin of victory of 33.3 points.  </P> <P> While the 3-A title was nice, Trakh has turned the Wildcats' attention toward a  state championship.  </P> <P> "We've won 3-A titles before," he said. "We've never won a state title. That  would be the goal now. I think it's always been our goal."  </P> <P> Guard Aimee McDaniel, who had 25 points in the 3-A final, has been hot in the  playoffs and averages 15.3 points a game to lead the team.  </P> <P> Jody Anton, Tammy Blackburn, Cindy Gunn and Jinelle Williams, Brea's other  starters, have contributed solid games in the playoffs.  </P> <P> "The kids have been consistent all year," Trakh said. "Balance is the key.  That's what happened in the Atascadero game. Everybody contributed."  </P></p>

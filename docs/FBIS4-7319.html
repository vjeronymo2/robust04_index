			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 27 KYODO -- A China-Mongolia  treaty to be signed during Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit from  Thursday [28 April] will include a provision by which the two  countries vow nonaggression against each other, Mongolian  diplomatic sources said Wednesday.    The sources said that in the China-Mongolia Treaty on  Friendly Relations and Cooperation, which will replace an  earlier bilateral treaty dating from 1960, each side will pledge  not to join military or political groups directed at the other.    Nor will they conclude any agreement with a third country  which threatens the other country's sovereignty or security,  according to the draft treaty.    The treaty, to be signed Friday between Li and Mongolian  Premier Punsalmaagiyn Jasray, further says that neither country  will allow a third country to use its territory to threaten the  sovereignty or security of the other, the sources said.    Mongolia normalized ties with China in 1989 after years of  hosting Soviet forces hostile to China.    Li will be arriving in Ulaanbaatar for a two-day visit after  visiting the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.</p>

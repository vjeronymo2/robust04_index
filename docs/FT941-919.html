			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Business Travel: False start at the stop - Daniel Green has reservations about the Heathrow bus service Catching the bus into central London from Heathrow airport might seem like a good idea. A taxi costs at least Pounds 30, while, by the Underground, the journey takes up to an hour - or more if you need to change at stations where platforms are several minutes' walk apart, such as Green Park. Moreover, the only view from the Tube is either of London's western suburbs or the inside of a tunnel. And stations still have too many staircases for travellers with heavy cases. The Airbus, on the other hand, which is run by London Buses, offers a choice of routes going directly past the capital's main hotels. It does not stop in the suburbs, so travelling times compare favourably with the Tube's. Perhaps best of all, there are splendid views from the upper deck of what is essentially a converted London bus. The ticket costs Pounds 5 single, Pounds 8 return. This sounds ideal for the business executive on a budget. But when I tried it last month, on returning from a trip to Paris, I found that this was not the case. The pick-up points at Heathrow are fairly easy to find, especially at Terminal Four. Each of the two services - one to Victoria bus station, the other to Russell Square - is scheduled to leave every 20 minutes or half hour, depending on the time of day, so it is worth checking the timetable to avoid a long wait. On the day I was travelling, however, the timetable proved irrelevant. A businessman, two Japanese women and I waited at the Terminal Four stop until 10 minutes after the scheduled departure time. I approached a man with 'Airbus' emblazoned on his jacket. He replied: 'I don't know, mate. I started here two days ago.' Further pressure eventually persuaded him into a booth with darkened windows and, apparently, a telephone inside. He emerged with the comment: 'The bus'll be here in about 10 minutes.' It was not. After a struggle to get him back into the box, he said: 'It'll be here at 25 to the hour.' This was the next timetabled slot. That time passed, however, and still nothing happened. One hour after we had arrived at the bus stop, the four of us decided to take the Underground. London Buses insists that the Airbus service has had a reliable 14 years in service and gets 'very few complaints'. It concedes that it should find a way to inform waiting passengers of delays. Until it does so, business passengers, especially those with appointments, should not take the Airbus. And if you are travelling from central London to the airport and need to make your check-in time, consider buying a good newspaper and travelling by Tube.</p>

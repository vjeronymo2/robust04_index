			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Patten faces hard week Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, has arrived back in the colony after an official visit to Australia to be promptly greeted by warnings from China about his plans for political reform. The criticism from Beijing came as a prelude to an important week for Mr Patten and his proposals for democratic reform in Hong Kong. The first of two bills enshrining his plans for limited democracy in Hong Kong will be voted on in the Legislative Council (LegCo) on Wednesday. On Friday, he is expected to publish a second, more controversial, bill which provides for more democracy. Alongside the publication of his second bill, the government is also expected to issue an official account of the failed negotiations between Britain and China on the issue of Hong Kong's political development. These negotiations ended last November after 17 rounds of talks had failed to produce any agreement. On Wednesday, LegCo is likely to pass Mr Patten's first bill unamended, government officials believe.</p>

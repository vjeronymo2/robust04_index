			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Ministers fail to act on debt mountain - Late payments The government will have disappointed thousands of British businesses in failing to take immediate action to tackle the Pounds 50bn mountain of overdue commercial debts. The government wants more time to examine the issue, despite a vociferous lobbying campaign - particularly by small businesses - aimed at pressuring ministers into introducing legally backed penalties for late-payment. Although the chancellor acknowledged that failure to settle on time could mean 'the difference between survival and failure' for many UK companies, ministers remain unconvinced about the value of legislation. A consultative document setting out the arguments for legislating to introduce a statutory right of interest on late payments was published yesterday by the Department of Trade and Industry. Interested parties will have until the end of March 1994 to respond. But the document makes clear that ministers still have reservations about the value of statutory interest. They have consistently pointed out that while legally backed penalties for late payers exist across much of Europe, the late payment problem still persists in most countries. There are also concerns that late payment penalties could themselves threaten the solvency of small companies hard-pressed to pay on time. As a result, the consultation paper also examines the alternative arguments for supporting a voluntary approach to the issue, in which government and big business are expected to lead by example. The Confederation of British Industry, which says late payment threatens the survival of one in five companies, has introduced a prompt payers code.</p>

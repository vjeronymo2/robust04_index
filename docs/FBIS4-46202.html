			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by unidentified spokesman of the party of </F> Democratic Kampuchea issued on 20 May; place not given -- read  by announcer]    [Text] I. A grenade was reportedly thrown into the  Malaysian embassy in Phnom Penh on the night of 18 May 1994.  The report said the grenade attack is related to the issue of  foreign military aid to the two-headed government.    II. The two-headed government has accused the Khmer Rouge  [KR] of throwing the grenade.    III. The spokesman of the party of Democratic Kampuchea  [PDK] vehemently and utterly rejects the above-mentioned  abominable and despicable accusation by the two-headed  government, which is the out-and-out puppet and tool of the  communist Vietnamese and the alliance of the mischievous  superpowers with the U.S., France, and Australia as the  ringleaders.    IV. The public opinion inside and outside the country, the  Cambodian people, and people in the region have all known,  heard, and seen clearly that the two-headed elements -- puppets  of the communist Vietnamese and the United States -- are the  traitors who have sold out the nation and unhesitatingly killed  the Cambodian people. These two-headed elements are the cause  of terror in society and of insecurity throughout Phnom Penh,  including theft, robbery, murder, vice, the path of ruin and  immorality, corruption, prostitution, AIDS, and so forth.    All these have emanated from systematic preparations, plans,  and activities of the communist Vietnamese, communist Vietnamese  puppets, and remnants of the evil allies.    V. The Cambodian people want national reconciliation and  peace. The two-headed elements only act in contrast to what the  people want. King Norodom Sihanouk has warned if the war dies,  peace will survive. The answer from the two-headed elements is  war, war, and war! After suffering serious and bitter defeats  at Anlung Veng and Pailin with all strategic forces and all  kinds of weapons smashed and arms, tanks, and artillery left  behind on the battlefield, they have loudly called on their  partners to provide arms aid to the two- headed government for  carrying on the war to further kill the Cambodian nation and  people.    The Cambodian people have gone through many tests and  trials.  They will definitely not allow the traitors, foreign lackeys,  arch corrupt elements, and evil allies to suck their blood and  rule the roost at will. The current of people's desire for  national reconciliation and peace is enormous and mighty. By  going against this current, all of you will definitely perish  like salt dissolved by water and candle burned away by fire.    [Dated] 20 May 1994    [Signed] The PDK spokesman</p>

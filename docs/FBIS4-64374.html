			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by K. I. Angelopoulos: "The Difficult Balance </F> Between the United States and the European Union"]    [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's talks in the  United States and the statements that followed sealed the  impressive "turn" of Papandreou's foreign policy. Even before  last October's election, his associates already knew that the  PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] leader believed  developments in the Balkans had brought Athens closer to  Washington than to Brussels.    After 10 October 1993, the prime minister saw that the  majority of the European Union [EU] partners negatively viewed  his return to the European scene. Their stance on the  "Macedonian" issue became even tougher, something that  disappointed and angered a significant part of the Greek popular  opinion. So, although the U.S. State Department decided to  recognize FYROM [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] and  the U.S. Pentagon considered that a military "umbrella" for the  neighboring republic was necessary, Papandreou chose to trust  the U.S. Balkans policy and tried to bring the Greek stance  closer to the U.S. strategy and diplomatic approach in the  southern Balkans.    In the United States, the prime minister did not hide his  satisfaction at the White House's "understanding" of the Greek  problems. Addressing Greek-Americans, Papandreou did not  hesitate to state publicly his bitterness and disappointment at  the lack of EU "solidarity." In his statement after talks with  U.S. President Bill Clinton, the prime minister "acquitted" the  United States of beginning the Yugoslav affair and clearly  implied that the responsibility lies completely with the strong  members of the EU. All of this comes at a time when Greece holds  the six-month EU presidency and Papandreou is preparing to chair  the EU summit in Corfu in June.    The prime minister's preference for the U.S. policy did not  just appear on the Greek political scene after 10 October 1993.  Former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis' government had  originally favored the Balkans' policy of former U.S. President  George Bush. It was during the time (1990-91) the U.S.  leadership was opposing the division of Yugoslavia. Greek  political "attraction" toward the United States has since  increased. At the same time disappointment has escalated at the  policy adopted by the strong countries in the EU and the way  they intervened in military clashes in the former Yugoslavia.  The "turn" toward the United States is now a fact. This  development, however, leads to a basic question: What are  Greece's relations with the European Union today and what does  the government believe they will be in the future? Will the  issue of Skopje prove to be "fatal" for Greek-EU relations?  What will happen in connection with the "harsh" conditions for  Greece stemming from the Maastricht Treaty?    It is a fact that the EU is not in a position to formulate a  common foreign policy. It is also a fact that the majority of  EU members do not share Athens' view regarding the Balkans.  From the beginning of this great crisis in the former  Yugoslavia, Greece found itself "isolated" from the community,  not only because there was rejection of Greek views and  arguments, but because the strong EU members did not wish to  allow Athens to take any initiative in the Balkans. With their  stance adopted from the beginning, the strong partners showed  that they did not want Greece to be considered, even  occasionally, as an EU "spokesman" in the Balkans.    The Germans, British, French, and Italians clearly  demonstrated that the "new order" in the Balkans is "their  business." But is it possible for the prime minister to  withdraw the country's foreign policy from the European Union  without endangering it and link it to that of the United States?  Can he do that at a time when in the economic sector --  especially during a great crisis in the national economy --  Greece depends greatly (if not decisively) on communal funds  within the framework of the Maastricht Treaty, which Papandreou  has accepted?    The prime minister appears willing to take the "risk" and  search for solutions to the country's critical foreign issue  within the framework of the U.S. foreign policy's designs and  pursuits. In the United States Papandreou surely found  interlocutors that were better than the ones he meets in the EU.  What will happen next? How will the EU partners react to the  "turn" in the prime minister's foreign policy? Will Athens  manage to create a balance between Washington and Brussels? And  what could happen tomorrow if Clinton's Balkan policy proves to  be unstable or changes some of its basic points?    Papandreou's bet is difficult and certainly does not lack  interest. Only the future will show whether his risky political  choice is justified. Right now it does not seem to contradict a  large part of the Greek common view. However, the danger of  inflating an "anti-European" feeling is visible today. We do  not believe it is unreasonable to raise the issue at this point  as to whether strong "anti-Europeanism" would be beneficial to  the national interests.</p>

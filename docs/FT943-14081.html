			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Van plant case rejected The European Court yesterday rejected a complaint by the French holding company Matra-Hachette against plans by Ford of the US and Volkswagen of Germany to build a minivan assembly plant in Portugal. Matra-Hachette, which builds Espace minivans for French car maker Renault, argued that the Ford-VW joint venture should not have been cleared under European Union competition rules because its capacity of 190,000 units a year will dominate the EU market. Rejecting the complaint, the court ruled that Matra-Hachette did not provide sufficient proof of its claim. The court last year rejected another action brought by Matra-Hachette against an EU decision to approve subsidies to the Ford-VW plant.</p>

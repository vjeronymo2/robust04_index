			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: Gillette buys Polish razor unit for Dollars 1.5m GILLETTE has agreed to pay Dollars 1.5m for the Wizamet razor blade factory, in Poland's latest privatisation deal. The US group has also promised to invest Dollars 7.5m in the lossmaking plant which once monopolised the domestic market. Half of Wizamet's output is exported. Wizamet, which has suffered from competition from imports in the past three years, is in Lodz, a textile centre which has been particularly hard hit by the recession. Gillette is the first large western company to come to the town, whose industrial tradition dates back to the early 19th century. Poland's privatisation revenues next year are set to reach Zl 8,800bn (Dollars 578m), of which half will come from foreign investors and public share offers.</p>

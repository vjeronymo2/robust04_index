			<p>BFN     [Text] The joint Russian-American military exercises slated  for early next month in southern Russia in the area of the city  of Orenburg have been cancelled. This was disclosed today by a  spokesmen for the two sides.    Vladimir (Nikonorov), a spokesman for the Russian Defense  Ministry, said that the cancellation was not his ministry's  fault but was due to the resolution adopted by the Russian  parliament's lower house, the State Duma. In his words, the  Russian Government yielded to the pressure, although the idea  itself had not been rejected.    Spokesman for the United States embassy in Moscow, Michael  McClellan, said the joint exercises are postponed and work is  currently underway to determine a fresh date. He expressed hope  that these would still take place in Russia elsewhere, possibly  in autumn.</p>

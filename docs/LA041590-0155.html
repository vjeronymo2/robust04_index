			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARRIS' DEFENSE NEVER RESTS;  </P> <P> LAW: ATTORNEY CHARLES SEVILLA, WHO WON STAY OF EXECUTION FOR THE CONVICTED  MURDERER, STANDS OUT AS AN EXAMPLE OF DEDICATION, HIS PEERS SAY.  </P> <P> Attorney Charles M. Sevilla started smoking again last month, just the way he  did in 1982, the last time his client, Robert Alton Harris, faced an execution  date.  </P> <P> Sevilla hadn't puffed on even one cigarette since Harris was spared -- with  four days to go -- eight years ago.  </P> <P> But by the week before April 3, the day the state of California had announced  that it would execute Harris for two murders, Sevilla's office turned into what  he called a "smoke chamber." That week, he and three others in his office  pulled three all-nighters, pumping out fat legal briefs for federal courts in  San Diego, San Francisco and Washington in bids to save Harris' life.  </P> <P> Not only did they have to do the lawyering, they had to field relentless phone  calls from the media, suffer crank calls from the public, and cope with death  threats.  </P> <P> "It was a crazy, crazy experience," Sevilla, 45, said. "I felt, 'This is  insane. This is not the way a law system should work.' "  </P> <P> Sevilla, who is in private practice in San Diego, said he was left exhausted  from an "emotional roller coaster" ride -- and yet he was back at it again last  week, filing another lengthy brief Friday on Harris' behalf with the U.S. 9th  Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.  </P> <P> The latest filing was made possible by the last-minute reprieve Sevilla earned  for Harris just two weeks earlier from 9th Circuit Judge John T. Noonan. That  reprieve, as well as the diligence that helped bring it about, have already  enhanced Sevilla's formidable reputation as one of the best appellate lawyers  in the state.  </P> <P> But in standing up for Harris, Sevilla has performed another service, his  attorney peers say. In an era of lawyer-bashing -- and in the face of public  opinion that is overwhelmingly against his position -- his zealous advocacy  stands out as an example of dedication to the profession and commitment to the  client, according to other lawyers.  </P> <P> "He's the best appellate lawyer I know, that I've ever had contact with -- on  the other side, that is," said Louis R. Hanoian, a deputy attorney general in  San Diego, who has been matched against Sevilla in the Harris case.  </P> <P> Sevilla's successes include a win in the U.S. Supreme Court just six years out  of law school. In that 1975 case, Sevilla successfully argued that the federal  Constitution requires U.S. Border Patrol officers to have probable cause -- or  a strong suspicion that a crime is afoot -- to search a car at the San Clemente  checkpoint on Interstate 5.  </P> <P> Besides Harris, Sevilla's current clients include Roger Hedgecock, the former  mayor of San Diego convicted of campaign financing violations. His appeal,  which centers on a claim that the verdict was tainted by a bailiff's alleged  jury tampering, is pending before the California Supreme Court.  </P> <P> "I talked to lawyers around town, saying, 'Who would you recommend for appeal  work on my case?' " Hedgecock said last week. "To a person, they recommended  Chuck Sevilla."  </P> <P> Last fall, he was listed as one of the most respected lawyers in California in  a statewide survey published by California Lawyer magazine. And he has been  named one of the best lawyers in the country by Town &amp; Country magazine.  </P> <P> "What he is extremely gifted at is weaving facts into legal arguments and  getting the absolute most impact he can out of the facts he is dealt," said  Hanoian.  </P> <P> Another thing, said Michael McCabe, one of the two other lawyers who have been  working with Sevilla on Harris' behalf, is that Sevilla "has absolutely no  concern for his own time. None whatsoever. He'd rather work than eat or sleep."  </P> <P> Sevilla, said San Diego criminal defense attorney Elizabeth Semel, "epitomizes  what law is about."  </P> <P> "Time and time again I get calls from parents, the prominent parents of some  young person who's gotten into some horrendous trouble -- conservative,  law-abiding people -- and when their son is in trouble, they don't look for Joe  Sleaze," Semel said.  </P> <P> "No," she said. "They want Chuck Sevilla. They want the best advocacy for their  child. All of those derogatory comments they may have made in general terms  about technicalities, all those criticisms, are thrown to the wind when someone  close to them is in trouble.  </P> <P> "And that's what the public has to remember. That today it's Robert Harris,  tomorrow it may be someone they love."  </P> <P> Sevilla is uncomfortable with praise for his skills.  </P> <P> "The thing I can say about myself is I hope I strive to be competent," he said.  </P> <P> All things considered, he said, he'd rather be a basketball star. His office  sports two photos of him playing pickup hoops with former UCLA and professional  star Bill Walton, one of which displays Sevilla getting off what he calls his  "awesome three-quarter-inch jump hook" in front of Walton.  </P> <P> There won't be any basketball for a while, however. The day the U.S. Supreme  Court declined to overturn Noonan's ruling, Sevilla -- racing for the phone --  ripped knee ligaments he had stretched during a playground game.  </P> <P> He needs surgery but, until there's a window in the Harris case, he doesn't  have time for it. Meanwhile, he said, "It hurts."  </P> <P> Sevilla was reared in San Jose. He vividly remembers the day in 1960 when he  was a sophomore in high school and Caryl Chessman was put to death at San  Quentin.  </P> <P> "My English teacher, who I liked a lot, the day Chessman was executed, he had a  radio on," Sevilla said. "I could see it affected him a lot and I got this idea  that, hey, this hurts people. It hurt him and he didn't even know Chessman."  </P> <P> After going to San Jose State, Sevilla earned his law degree in 1969 from Santa  Clara University, then took an advanced legal degree in urban law in 1971 from  George Washington University.  </P> <P> For the next five years, he worked at Federal Defenders of San Diego Inc., an  agency that represents poor people charged with crimes in federal court. He  moved to Los Angeles in 1976 to work for the state public defender, which  handles appeals in the state courts for indigents.  </P> <P> After a few years, he and his wife, Donna, returned to San Diego. Sevilla  joined his former boss at Federal Defenders, John Cleary, in a private  practice.  </P> <P> When he was with the state public defender, he said, he began helping McCabe  with Harris' case. By 1983, when Sevilla joined forces with Cleary, he "had a  commitment to (Harris)" and "never seriously considered staying out of the  case."  </P> <P> The reprieve that was earned for Harris, Sevilla insisted, is as much the work  of the two other primary attorneys on the case -- McCabe and Michael Laurence  of San Francisco -- and his office secretary, Cindy Campbell, all of whom  worked with him through the nights. "It's truly been a team effort," he said.  </P> <P> Yet the whole thing is a waste, he said. "If they took a tenth of the money we  spent on the death penalty and channeled it into helping the surviving members  of the family of the victim with care to make the transition -- if a  breadwinner is gone, to help out with sustenance -- that makes a lot more sense  to me than what we're going through now," he said.  </P> <P> Another money issue -- how much he is getting paid for representing Harris --  has been filled with misunderstanding, he said. He makes $75 an hour on the  case -- that's up, as of last fall, from $40 an hour. He said it is hardly a  "moneymaking operation" in the inflated universe of lawyer salaries, commonly  $100 to $200 an hour.  </P> <P> "The reality is that if (representing Death Row inmates) was a moneymaking  operation, you'd have lawyers . . . lined up out the door of the (California)  Supreme Court looking for those appointments," he said. "Instead, we have,  what, 40 or 50 people who are up on Death Row without counsel."  </P> <P> There are "so many reasons" to be opposed to the death penalty, Sevilla said.  For one, the "fact that (politicians) are so gung-ho for it and use it as a  sales technique to sell their candidacies is a wonderful reason for people to  have some suspicion about what this is all about."  </P> <P> "Second, the fact that government administers this ought to terrify anybody out  there about the fairness of a system in which the government is so instrumental  in selecting who's going to get it and who's not."  </P> <P> The Harris case itself points out "the advantage of these things winding their  way and taking some time," no matter how much that frustrates the public, he  said. The case shows that "we have an imperfect system and if you're going to  have a penalty which requires perfection, like the death penalty, you'd better  give it time to work out."  </P> <P> Until the case is over, one way or the other, Sevilla said he expects it to  continue to produce the same mix of "rewarding" and "nightmarish" moments.  </P> <P> Sevilla said he had been confident that Harris would prevail in his latest  appeal -- that he would win a hearing on the new claims that various mental  disorders played a part in the 1978 killings of two San Diego teen-agers and  should have been put before the jury that sentenced Harris to die.  </P> <P> As soon as he won the chance to try for that hearing -- on April 2, when the  U.S. Supreme Court affirmed Noonan's reprieve -- Sevilla quit smoking.  </P></p>

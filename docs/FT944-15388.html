			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Macedonian polls confusion The muddle over results in the first round of Macedonia's presidential and parliamentary elections, still unresolved more than 48 hours after the polls closed, is creating confusion among voters and increasing anger in opposition political parties. The electoral commission, headed by a constitutional court judge, which supervised Sunday's presidential and parliamentary vote, yesterday cited 'technical difficulties' for not being able to announce results from as many as 83 out of 120 constituencies in the former Yugoslav republic. According to unofficial returns, President Kiro Gligorov, seeking re-election through a direct vote, held a commanding lead over his nationalist challenger, Mr Ljubisha Georgievski, while the governing Alliance for Macedonia claimed its candidates were ahead in more than half the constituencies. But the prolonged delay in producing official results is likely to reduce support for the Alliance at the run-off poll on October 30. Both the main opposition Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation, the hardline nationalist party, and the free-market nationalist Democratic party set up last year have complained of ballot box fraud and are threatening to boycott the second round of the elections.</p>

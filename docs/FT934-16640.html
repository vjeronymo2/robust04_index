			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Bonds: France Telecom opens 13-year maturity with FFr2bn offering The French franc sector of the international bond market was active yesterday as France Telecom and the Kingdom of Sweden raised FFr3bn between them. Other features included a Dollars 500m seven-year issue from Telecom Argentina which was heavily-oversubscribed, and exchangeable bond offerings from Pennzoil, the US oil company, and Cir, the holding company of Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian industrialist. France Telecom opened a new maturity in the French bond market with its FFr2bn offering of 13-year Eurobonds. The bonds were priced to yield 16 basis points over the interpolated yield curve between the French government bonds due 2004 and 2008. Joint lead manager CCF said that the low re-offer price of 98.53 indicated that France Telecom might re-open the issue at a later date. There was strong demand for the bonds in Germany and Switzerland. Sweden insured itself against a rise or a fall in French interest rates with its FFr1bn offering of callable Eurobonds. This structure has been used extensively in the Eurolira sector in recent weeks. The bonds have a life of 10 years but are callable after two years. The bonds were priced to yield 35 basis points over the 6 3/4 per cent French government bond due 2003 but yielded 90 basis points over two-year government notes. Lead manager CCF said around a third of the issue was placed with domestic investors and the rest elsewhere in Europe. Supranational, corporate and institutional investors were the main buyers. Demand for Telecom Argentina's issue was such that it was able to raise double the amount it had originally planned as well as complete its borrowing needs for this year. Lead manager Chase said the issue was the largest from a Latin American corporate borrower after Cemex's Dollars 1bn five-year issue which was launched in May. It was therefore likely to become the benchmark for other Argentine private-sector borrowers seeking to access the Eurobond market. More Latin American issues are expected in the next few weeks, including a Dollars 100m three-year offering from Perez Companc, Argentina's largest private oil producer. Pennzoil and Cir tapped current demand for convertible paper with exchangeable bond offerings designed to re-finance their equity holdings in Chevron and Olivetti, respectively. Lehman Brothers, which arranged both deals, said Pennzoil's 10-year Dollars 250m offer appealed to investors seeking defensive holdings. The issue is callable after five years, giving investors an exposure to the oil sector and the dollar. Cir's L282bn issue offers exposure to a recovery in Olivetti's share price. The five-year deal was priced at a discount of 81.50 and yield to maturity was 6 1/4 - 6 1/2 per cent.</p>

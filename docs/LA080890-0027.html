			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASIAN IMMIGRANTS IN PACIFIC RIM  </P> <P> According to Gibson's article there are many Chinese moving businesses from  Hong Kong to the United States, Canada and Australia. Most are immigrating to  these countries along with their companies.  </P> <P> A few stay in Hong Kong to live.  </P> <P> Michael Hsiao says in the article: "Double bookkeeping is universal," and that  the basic idea is to avoid taxes." But he also added an ancient saying. "If you  have wealth it is best to keep it a secret."  </P> <P> According to Lee A. Iacocca a way to increase our revenue is to tap foreign  companies who do hundreds of billions of dollars worth of business every year  but pay virtually no income tax. He suggested a business transfer tax which is  a value added tax.  </P> <P> A 7% business transfer tax could mean a net increase of $42 billion a year for  Washington, with no tax increase for Americans or American business.  </P> <P> SYLVIA BROLINE NORMAN  </P> <P> Kingsburg, Calif.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Michal Uzemblo, commercial attache of the </F> Embassy of the Republic of Poland in Ukraine, by Vitaliy Kvitko  in Kiev; date not given: "The Possibilities of Polish-Ukrainian  Trade and Economic Cooperation Are Far From Exhausted"]    [Text] 50 Bogdan Khmelnitskiy Street, Kiev. This is  the location of the Trade and Economic Department of the Embassy  of the Republic of Poland in Ukraine. It is headed by Commercial  Attache Michal Uzemblo. Our BIZNES correspondent met with Mr.  Uzemblo and asked him to describe the state and prospects of the  development of Polish-Ukrainian trade and economic  relations.    [Kvitko] Mr. Uzemblo, it is far from your first year in  Ukraine, and you are well acquainted with our economic  situation. Tell us, please, are there practicable prerequisites  for an increase in mutually profitable cooperation between our  countries?    [Uzemblo] Ukraine has been an independent state only for  three years. It is natural, therefore, that you have had this  whole time to surmount the well-known difficulties of the  formation of statehood. In addition, Ukraine inherited from the  former USSR quite a complex and unregulated economy, and the  economic relations that had operated for years both with  countries of the former USSR and with the participants in the  disintegrated Council for Economic Mutual Assistance (CEMA), one  of the biggest partners among which was Poland, were disrupted.  The command levers of the control of cooperation, which had  frequently flouted considerations of elementary advantage,  ceased to operate, and commodity turnover between our countries  declined.    Account also has to be taken of the fact that by the time  Ukraine had acquired its sovereignty, Poland had already  implemented a number of economic reforms en route to the market.  This meant that trading as before was no longer possible. You  yourself will realize that perfectly understandable  considerations of advantage, without which a real market is  inconceivable, came into play. The decline in commodity turnover  was perfectly natural, therefore. A payments crisis, when  Ukrainian enterprises were unable to pay for supplies from  Poland in hard currency and your national currency rapidly  declined in value, was superimposed in addition. The situation  was rescued neither by commodity-exchange transactions nor  so-called barter....    Nonetheless, I would like to mention that at the interstate  level Poland was one of the first to sign with Ukraine, in May  1992, a treaty on good-neighborliness, friendly relations, and  cooperation, which laid the legal foundations for a  qualitatively new system of relations between our states within  the framework of the process of transformations in Central and  East Europe.    Today economic relations between Ukraine and Poland are  regulated, aside from the said treaty, by:    1) the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation of 4  October 1991.    2) The Convention on the Avoidance of Dual Taxation and the  Prevention of Income and Property Tax Evasion of 12 January 1993.    3) The Agreement on the Mutual Promotion and Protection of  Investments of 12 January 1993.    4) The Agreement on Interregional Cooperation.    An Intergovernmental Commission on Trade and Economic  Cooperation, whose activity is contributing to the further  development of bilateral economic relations, was formed on the  basis of the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation and the  protocol of 12 January 1993.    [Kvitko] And how productive has the commission's  contribution  to bilateral cooperation been?    [Uzemblo] You know that we do not have the right to dictate  to our entrepreneurs with whom they should conclude deals. But  at the government level the parties have agreed for the  establishment of efficient mutually profitable cooperation to  promote a resumption of relations between enterprises and to  support their development at small and medium-sized business  level, to contribute to the creation of joint ventures, and to  establish a system of mutual notification of the parties of  legislative instruments in force in their countries that  regulate financial, legal, customs, and economic matters.    The commission has been quite productive, I believe.  According to Polish customs data, commodity turnover increased  from $337 million in 1992 to $386.8 million in 1993. In  addition, the practice of joint entrepreneurial activity is  characterized by the fact that Poland is in first place in terms  of the number of joint ventures on the territory of Ukraine.  Their number has risen to 580. The exports of these ventures  constitute $22,980,900, and imports, $18,092,100. According to  figures of the Ministry of Statistics of Ukraine,  Polish-Ukrainian joint ventures constitute 17.8 percent of the  total number of those operating in the country.    [Kvitko] Nonetheless, use is, most likely, being made of far  from all possibilities for the development and expansion of  cooperation. And the reason is by no means a lack of interest in  Ukraine among our Polish partners. What can you say in this  connection?    [Uzemblo] Polish business has a tremendous interest in  Ukraine. Proof of this is not only the first place in terms of  the number of joint ventures but also the fact that  approximately 50 of our firms have opened and registered their  offices in Ukraine. In addition, Polish entrepreneurs are  readily participating in many exhibitions which are being held  in Ukraine and actively inviting their Ukrainian partners to  exhibitions and fairs in Poland....    But the fact that there has yet to be in Ukraine the total  liberalization of foreign economic activity, economic and  financial stabilization has not been achieved, and your national  unit of currency has not become even internally convertible is a  reality also.    Given the least signs of stabilization in Ukraine, the  Polish  entrepreneur would respond appropriately. And our Ukrainian  partners are well enough aware of our possibilities. This  includes agricultural production and also machinery and  equipment for food and light industry, wood processing and  furniture production, medical equipment, the manufacture of  medicines and veterinary preparations, and much else. What I  have listed, I believe, is merely a small particle of the  possible interaction of our enterprises and entrepreneurs....</p>

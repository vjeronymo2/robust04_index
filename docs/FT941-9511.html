			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / The US Strikes Back: American way of serving leads to success - FT Writers on growing evidence that the US is top of the world in services sector competitiveness Five of the largest US local telephone companies have announced in the past few months plans to cut more than 55,000 jobs, so as to improve their efficiency as new rivals enter what was a monopolistic business. A combination of technological change, government deregulation and the fierce US competitive spirit is slimming the US telecommunications industry greatly. It is leading the world in the introduction of advanced, inter-active, multi-media communications systems. The upheaval provides a strong piece of circumstantial evidence to support the contention that the US has a significant competitive edge over most other nations in many service industries, telecommunications among them, and that in some sectors the gap may be widening. Claims of US superiority are open to dispute, since all international comparisons of competitiveness are fraught with statistical pitfalls - nowhere more than in the services sector, where output and productivity are much harder to measure than in manufacturing industries. Even so, there is plenty of circumstantial evidence, ranging from the increasing threat that US airlines present to European national carriers, to the popularity of McDonald's hamburgers and Walt Disney films around the globe. A report published 18 months ago by the McKinsey Global Institute, an arm of the McKinsey management consultancy, has given statistical backing to the theory. McKinsey conducted detailed case studies of five industries around the world  -airlines, retail banking, restaurants, retailing and telecommunications - and concluded: 'The US service industry has been fairly dynamic, and has led the way to improved US productivity overall, compared with Europe and Japan.' Most studies of global competitiveness focus on manufacturing industry, partly because it is much easier to measure its productivity, partly because goods are more internationally traded than services, and partly because highly visible sectors such as cars and computers tend to be regarded, rightly or wrongly, as yardsticks of a nation's industrial health and thrust. Yet service industries account for more than 60 per cent of US employment and roughly a quarter of US exports. Furthermore, the sector's productivity has an important effect on the competitiveness of manufacturing industry, whose production costs include a significant services element. Among the McKinsey study's findings are: Labour productivity in the US retail banking system, in 1989, was 32 percentage points higher than that of Germany and 36 points higher than that of the UK. This was due partly to greater US deployment of information technology, such as automated teller machines. The US general merchandise retailing industry had higher productivity than other leading economies, in terms of labour productivity, capital productivity and total factor productivity. In labour productivity, the gap ranged from just 4 per cent in the case of Germany to 50 per cent in the case of Japan. The US restaurant industry had productivity levels slightly lower than that of France and somewhat higher than that of Germany, while the airline industry has significantly higher productivity than that of Europe. In telecommunications, the US has a higher capital productivity than Japan and the main European countries, though its labour productivity is no better than that of Japan and France. However, the report was compiled before the current upheaval in US telecommunications - and that may be giving the US an edge in labour productivity in a sector which will be particularly important as the world enters an age of multi-media, inter-active communications. Mr Alex Mandl, head of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's communications services business, points out: 'In the next three to five years, the (US) consumer will have the ability to access, through a computer or TV screen, video services, conference services, entertainment services . . . . There's no other country moving as quickly in that direction.' What accounts for the apparent US lead in services? The main reason cited by McKinsey is simply that 'competitive pressures on companies operating in the US are greater than in other countries.' First, the US has a more entrepreneurial spirit than many other nations. Its businessmen seem unusually willing to take risks and financial markets to back them. Take MCI Communications, the long-distance communications group which played the key role in breaking AT&amp;T's monopoly of the long-distance phone market. It began in the late 1960s as a tiny upstart serving the St Louis-Chicago market. Second, the US began to deregulate its service industries earlier than other nations. Airlines were de-regulated in 1978, when new entrants were allowed and carriers were freed to choose the routes to fly and the fares to charge. In 1984, an anti-trust court settlement forced AT&amp;T to spin off its local operations and face full competition in the long-distance market. Mr John Young, former chief executive of computer group Hewlett Packard, says: 'With hindsight, the break-up of AT&amp;T was a huge benefit for this country. The only way you learn to compete is by competing.' Third, the US services sector faces the threat of foreign entrants, attracted by the size and relative openness of the market, while it is increasingly looking overseas for growth as its domestic market matures. Mr Stephen Roach, an economist at the investment bank Morgan Stanley, cites increasing global competition as a main reason why the US services sector at last seems to be getting a productivity benefit from its investment in information technology, which he estimates to have totalled Dollars 862bn (Pounds 588m) over the past decade. 'The long-awaited payback in information technology is finally happening,' he says. 'Back-office consolidation is breaking out with a vengeance in banking, airlines and elsewhere . . . . Paper-pushing middle managers are getting replaced by machines. Sales workers, empowered by point-of-sale computing, are taking on a lot of additional functions, such as inventory control.' However, the US has no grounds for complacency. Other countries are also stepping up their investments in information technology, while a wave of service industry de-regulation and/or privatisation is under way in continental Europe and Japan. The opening of those markets will give US industries new fields to conquer. But competition, leading to greater European and Japanese productivity, could narrow the apparent US lead in services.

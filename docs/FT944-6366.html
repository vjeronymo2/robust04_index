			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Best Travel goes into liquidation Best Travel, the UK's seventh-largest tour operator, went into liquidation last night. It was the travel industry's biggest collapse since Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group failed in 1991. Plans by Airtours, the second-largest tour operator, to purchase Best Travel's brand names failed yesterday. Mr Nick Lyle of accountants Touche Ross, who were appointed liquidators, last night strongly criticised the Association of British Travel Agents for what he alleged was its failure to ensure that at least some of the Best Travel business was saved. The Civil Aviation Authority said the collapse would not affect the 3,000 Best Travel holidaymakers currently abroad. The company has a Pounds 14m bond, which will be used to repatriate customers abroad and ensure those who have booked holidays are compensated. Although rumours about the health of Best Travel had been circulating for weeks, the first firm indication of trouble came yesterday morning when Ambassador Airways, the company's airline, was put into liquidation and its fleet of six Boeing aircraft grounded. Mr Lyle said the aircraft had played a significant part in dragging the rest of the company down. He said the cash requirements of the airline during the winter months would have been high. Mr Lyle said he was instructed on Saturday to try to find a buyer for Best Travel. He approached large tour operators over the weekend and found Airtours the most positive. He said an agreement was reached that Airtours would buy Best Travel's two brand names, Cypriana and Grecian Holidays. Mr Lyle said that while this would not have saved Best Travel itself or the airline, it would have ensured that customers who had booked holidays could continue to go on them. Airtours' payment for the brands would also have increased the amount available for Best Travel creditors. Mr Lyle said the amount would have been 'several million pounds'. He said, however, that when the deal was taken to Abta for its approval, the association replied that it could not reach enough members of its Tour Operators' Council yesterday. Abta said the council would be meeting tomorrow. Mr Lyle said, however, that this was too late and Best Travel went into liquidation. He said: 'The whole transaction has been frustrated by the unresponsive approach of the people who regulate the travel industry.' Airtours declined to comment. Abta agreed that it had told Airtours yesterday that it would not be able to reach enough members of the 20-member Tour Operators' Council to reach a decision. The association added, however, that Airtours did not require the council's approval to purchase the brands. All Abta could do was decide whether holidays sold under the brands would be accepted into its jurisdiction. Following the introduction of new consumer protection laws, Abta no longer has the power to prevent companies selling holidays which fall outside its jurisdiction.</p>

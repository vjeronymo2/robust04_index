			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Gerrymandering charges 'still hold' Nothing about the strength and nature of the charges of gerrymandering brought against 10 current and former Westminster councillors and officials has changed, the inquiry into the case was told yesterday. In the first of the closing submissions to the inquiry Mr Andrew Arden, acting for the group of residents who first aired the gerrymandering allegations, said nothing the accused had said or argued at the seven-week public inquiry would get them off the hook. The district auditor, Mr John Magill, had accused the 10 of wasting Pounds 21.25m by selling homes at a discount to draw likely Tory voters into marginal wards. The inquiry was adjourned until Tuesday.</p>

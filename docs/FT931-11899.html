			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Republicans told to shift on abortion MR Haley Barbour, the new Republican national chairman, said at the weekend the party needed 'its head examined' if it continued to make opposition to abortion the cornerstone of its political platform. Mr Barbour, a Washington lawyer-lobbyist from Mississippi who served in the Reagan White House, was elected to the position on the third ballot of the party meeting in St Louis on Friday night. In an acceptance speech on Saturday, he repeated warnings to the religious right wing of the Republican party delivered by the outgoing chairman, Mr Rich Bond. But, in an implicit criticism of the Bush administration, he said the party should not be dominated by the Washington elite and must rebuild its 'bottom up' grassroots strength. The power of the right wing is rooted at the local level and it was very much in evidence in St Louis, even though Mr Barbour, his personal opposition to abortion notwithstanding, was not its first choice as chairman. Mr Bond's speech was virulently condemned by hardline conservatives, who noted, pointedly, that he had presided over last August's nominating convention, which had focused so much on traditional family values.</p>

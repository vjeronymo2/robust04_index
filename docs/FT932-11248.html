			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / GPA to talk with holders of bonds GPA GROUP is to negotiate with its bondholders after its board yesterday discussed new restructuring options including a plan aimed at swapping more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in unsecured debt into equity. The financially troubled aircraft leasing company is expected formally to start talking with its bondholders at the end of the week. The decision effectively marks the end of its current restructuring plan which excluded the possibility of asking bondholders to make concessions. However, GPA's failure to raise new equity at Dollars 1 a share means its lenders will not allow it to pay the Dollars 220m of bonds that mature in May and June. Its banks are now expected to give it a further temporary waiver of breaches on its banking covenants on Friday on the understanding that talks with bondholders take place. One lead banker said: 'GPA realises it has to do a deal with its bondholders, which will close the door on the future possibility of raising money from the capital markets.' In a separate move the group is expected to promote Mr Phil Bolger, who runs the leasing business, and Mr Patrick Blaney, chief operating officer, to its main board. Lenders to the group are concerned a split could occur between middle management, which is effectively running the business, and senior directors involved in the restructuring. While some bankers would like to see the early departure of Mr Tony Ryan, chairman and founder, there has been no co-ordinated pressure from lenders for a change in GPA's top posts. The group had hoped to make one further attempt to raise equity from new investors after most banks agreed in principle to defer Dollars 1bn of debt repayments until 1996. However, the few outside shareholders who expressed interest in taking new shares said GPA should seek concessions from bondholders. General Electric has been in discussions with GPA about the possibility of buying assets and taking warrants to subscribe for new shares at a later date. But the US company has not been willing to take part in the convertible preference share issue on GPA's terms. Lex, Page 18</p>

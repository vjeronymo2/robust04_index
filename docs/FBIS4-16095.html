			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, passions raged outside the U.S. embassy in  Moscow. Members of the Liberal Democratic Party and other  citizens picketed the embassy to protest against NATO's bombing  in Bosnia. Red and St. Andrew's flags fluttered over the crowd,  while the U.S. flag was torn up by the pickets, and despite  attempts by the militia to save the United States' national  symbol, the remnants were burnt. Previously, there had already  been demonstrative burnings outside the embassy. On Tuesday, a  $1 bill was the victim of fire.    The POSTFACTUM agency has reported new information about  today's protest. According to it, the law and order bodies  arrested (Zhukov), a representative of the Russian-Serbian  Friendship Society; and (Kosimov), the first deputy chairman of  the Russian National Assembly, was beaten up.</p>

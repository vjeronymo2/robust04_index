			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow, 14 Apr -- The Russian side is particularly  concerned by reports that in authorizing the "first use of  direct air support in response to the Bosnian Serbs' attack on  Gorazde," the UN secretary general's special representative said  that this authorization "is valid for two weeks from being  given." This was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy  Karasin, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's press and  information department.    "The special representative does not, in our view, have such  powers. The Security Council has not empowered him to do this,"  the Russian diplomat said.    Russia does not support any proposal to simplify the  procedure whereby the United Nations requests "air support" from  NATO, Grigoriy Karasin said. According to him, the Russian  Foreign Ministry could not fail to notice an article published  in THE NEW YORK TIMES on Wednesday which maintains that, by  bypassing the Security Council, the United Nations has allegedly  taken a decision, in essence, "to water down this procedure."  "Judging by this report, an obvious attempt is in evidence to  downgrade the adoption of such an important decision to the  level of not simply Akashi, the UN secretary general's envoy,  but even to refer it to the military - to General Bertrand de  Lapresle, commander of the UN forces in former Yugoslavia," he  remarked.    If the NEW YORK TIMES's allegation is based on reality, then  a situation is emerging as a result of which the UN secretary  general's control over key decisions concerning the UN forces'  activities in former Yugoslavia can be lost and the prestige of  the Security Council and of the United Nations in general can be  damaged, Grigoriy Karasin stressed.    The NEW YORK TIMES report is causing serious worry in Russia  and requires urgent clarifications by the UN Secretariat, the  Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA will, in general, rely on the criteria applied under new source permitting programs (40 CFR 51.165(b)) to determine when a source category contributes significantly to violations of the NAAQS in a PM&hyph;10 serious nonattainment area. The criteria will also be applied spatially and temporally in the same way it is under new source permitting programs. <FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See ``Interpretation of `Significant Contribution,''' memorandum from Richard G. Rhoads to Alexandra Smith, December 16, 1980, OAQPS Policy and Guidance Notebook, PN 165&hyph;80&hyph;12&hyph;16&hyph;007. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, a moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area may be reclassified as serious based on evidence that the area cannot practicably attain the NAAQS by the statutory attainment date or evidence that it has failed to attain by that date. The evidence, whether modeled or measured, will generally indicate the standard (24-hour or annual), the day, and the location of the predicted or monitored violation. Therefore, under this policy, a source category (see footnote 33) will be presumed to contribute significantly to a violation of the 24-hour NAAQS if its PM&hyph;10 impact at the location of the expected violation would exceed 5 &mu;g/m3. Likewise, a source category will be presumed to contribute significantly to a violation of the annual NAAQS if its PM&hyph;10 impact at the time and location of the expected violation would exceed 1 &mu;g/m3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedures for identifying source categories that continue to significantly affect the air quality of a serious area (even after RACM (including RACT) are implemented) and procedures for identifying the appropriate mix of control measures applicable to those source categories are discussed below in subsection E. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. BACM Analysis Independent of Attainment Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The overall structure and purpose of title I of the amended Act, the standard suggested by the word ``best,'' and the differences in the statute between the requirements for BACM as compared to those for RACM, lead EPA to believe that, unlike RACM, BACM are to be established generally independent of an analysis of the attainment needs of the serious area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted earlier in this section, the overall structural scheme throughout title I of the Act is to require the implementation of increasingly stringent control measures in areas with more serious pollution problems, while providing such areas additional time to attain the applicable standards. These tougher measures are deemed necessary in cases where it appears that less stringent controls will be insufficient to reduce emissions in an area to the level of the NAAQS. As described above, the fact that the Act requires the application of control measures that are ``reasonable'' in moderate PM&hyph;10 areas and control measures that are ``best'' whenever it is determined that a moderate area cannot ``practicably'' attain or actually fails to attain the NAAQS and is therefore reclassified as serious, strongly suggests that BACM is intended to be a more stringent standard than RACM. Thus, it is reasonable to interpret the statute as requiring a different analysis for determining BACM from the practice of analyzing RACM according to what is reasonable in light of the overall attainment needs of the area. Moreover, when comparing the terms ``reasonable'' and ``best'' as applied to control measures, the word ``best'' strongly implies that there should be a greater emphasis on the merits of the measure or technology alone and less flexibility in considering other factors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, for PM&hyph;10 areas reclassified as serious before the moderate area attainment date, States have up to 4 years, under section 189(b)(2), in which to submit their serious area attainment demonstration. However, under section 189(b)(2), States have only 18 months after reclassification from moderate to serious to submit their plans requiring the use of BACM for those same areas. Thus, for such areas, Congress provided a difference of as much as 21/2 years between the required date for submitting BACM plans and the date by which to submit a new attainment demonstration satisfying the requirements of section 189(b)(1)(A). This pronounced difference in timing for the serious area submittals described above is to be contrasted with the timing for submittal of similar provisions for moderate areas. Under section 189(a)(2), both the RACM plans and the attainment demonstration for moderate PM&hyph;10 areas must as a general matter be submitted at the same time. The fact that the Act requires BACM to be adopted and implemented by an appreciable time before the attainment demonstration is required, for areas that are reclassified before the moderate area attainment date, suggests that Congress intended that BACM determinations be based more on the feasibility of implementing the measures rather than on an analysis of the attainment needs of the area. <FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>  Therefore, the steps described below for making a BACM determination are intended to be carried out independently from the analysis to determine the emission reductions that would be necessary to attain the NAAQS by the statutory deadline. If the attainment demonstration for the area subsequently shows that BACM will bring the area into attainment before the statutory deadline, then the plan provides for expeditious attainment of the NAAQS. However, if the BACM are not adequate to provide for attainment of the standards, then the State must submit additional measures with the attainment demonstration that will result in attainment of the standard by the statutory deadline or apply for an extension of the attainment date by demonstrating that the specific conditions of sections 108(e) and 189(b)(1)(A)(ii) have been met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA believes this interpretation of the Act is reasonable, even if, as to areas which are classified in the future as serious PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas because the areas have failed to attain, the date BACM plans must be submitted and the date the serious area attainment demonstration is due should happen to coincide. There is no rational basis for interpreting BACM differently depending merely on when an area happens to be reclassified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

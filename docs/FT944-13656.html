			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Baxter sales growth to be lower than expected Baxter International, the US medical supplies and healthcare group that completed a financial restructuring a year ago, said yesterday that future sales growth would fall short of its earlier expectations, writes Richard Waters. The company said the outlook for the US healthcare market meant it would not reach its forecast of growth 'in the high single digits'. It added, however, that it would still meet earnings targets by holding down costs. Baxter, like other hospital suppliers, faces pressure from big private hospital groups like Columbia/HCA and National Medical to cut prices.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Chemicals industry claims ecological points The UK's chemicals industry yesterday attempted to improve the sector's environmental reputation by publishing figures demonstrating its improving ecological and safety record. The Chemical Industry Association released data showing that discharges by its members of red-list substances - materials that are particularly toxic in water - had fallen every year for the past four years. The survey, of 340 chemical manufacturing sites representing 76 per cent of sites owned by association members, showed that red-list substance discharges fell from 360 tonnes in 1990 to 167 tonnes last year. The number of sites reporting no such discharges increased from 189 to 207. The association's figures are part of the industry's Responsible Care campaign, aimed at improving environmental performance and then communicating that to the public. A recent survey by Cefic, the European Chemical Industry Council, showed that the UK population mistrusted the chemical industry more than any other country. Mr John Holloway, chairman and managing director of Exxon Chemical and chairman of the Chemical Industry Safety, Health and Environment Council, said: 'There is no doubt that opinion about the chemical industry in this country is poor. We are not liked. But we are working hard to deal with that.' Recent research by the association suggested only 29 per cent of population has positive feelings towards the chemicals industry. Mr John Cox, association director-general, said he would not be satisfied until that figure had risen to 50 per cent, a level achieved at the start of the 1980s. The association's figures published yesterday were not all moving in the right direction. Environmental expenditure fell last year as the industry struggled with the recession. It dropped from Pounds 1.013bn in 1992 to Pounds 956m. Capital spending on the environment fell from Pounds 293m to Pounds 268m. This reflected a fall in overall capital spending which has fallen two years running from Pounds 2.19bn in 1991 to Pounds 2.09bn in 1992, and Pounds 1.915bn last year. The association said environmental capital spending had been maintained at a steady 14 per cent as a proportion of overall capital investment. Environmental operating costs also fell, down from Pounds 720m to Pounds 688m, reflecting a decline in manufacturing volumes. Mr Richard Robson, group environment communications manager at Imperial Chemical Industries, said no clear pattern could be observed in the amount of special waste disposed off-site. This increased from 299,000 tonnes in 1992 to 358,000 tonnes in 1993. This followed a fall from 316,000 tonnes in 1991. Special wastes are substances that need to be disposed of with particular care. However, Mr Robson said the figures could not be compared because of an increase in the number of sites reporting data.</p>

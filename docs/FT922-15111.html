			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: Hong Kong halts Evergo taking associate private THE Securities &amp; Futures Commission, Hong Kong's corporate watchdog, yesterday scored an important victory over one of the colony's most controversial corporate raiders when it successfully intervened to stop Mr Joseph Lau's Evergo International from taking private its associate Chinese Estates. The SFC said it had appeared before the Supreme Court of Bermuda on Tuesday and requested it to overturn the approval by Chinese Estates' shareholders of Evergo's bid because of irregularities in the conduct of the vote. Mr Ermanno Pascutto, an executive director of the SFC and chairman of the Hong Kong Takeovers Committee, said the commission's successful intervention in the Bermuda court would bolster confidence in Hong Kong's system of regulation. He pointed out that about 40 per cent of Hong Kong's listed companies were registered in Bermuda and that concern had been expressed that they might have been trying to escape regulation by being so domiciled. Chinese Estates' shareholders in February approved a scheme whereby Evergo could acquire the 50.4 per cent of the company it did not already own. Shareholder approval had to pass two tests - a majority of voters had to approve the scheme and their combined shareholding had to account for at least 75 per cent of the stock under offer. The SFC found that 527 of the 644 shareholders who voted held just 4,000 shares in the company - the smallest dealing size allowable on stock exchange trades. Of those, 491 appeared on the company's share register at the end of August last year, just before Evergo bid for Chinese Estates. 'The voting pattern for the meeting suggests, and our inquires so far lend weight to the suggestion, that one person did orchestrate both a splitting of shares into. . . lots and the purchase of (those) lots,' the SFC said.</p>

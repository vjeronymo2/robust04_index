			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Ecuador finally backs reforms for public sector THE ECUADOREAN Congress has finally approved public sector reforms vital to President Sixto Duran Ballen's economic programme, after nearly eight months of deliberations. A last-minute attempt by the opposition to reopen debate on the contentious package - passed last week and now awaiting the president's signature - is unlikely to win the necessary two-thirds majority. The law is central to reducing the size of the public sector, privatising state-owned enterprises, opening key sectors of the economy, and deregulating numerous economic activities. Its passage was hampered by the government's lack of a majority, its unpopularity in the country and the slow procedures of Congress, which sits for only three days a week. Companies owned partly or entirely by the state may now be sold, liquidated, or merged with other companies. Strategic sectors of the economy hitherto reserved for the state - such as the petroleum industry, mining, electricity, telecommunications and water utilities - will also be open to the private sector through concessions, although the defence industry remains reserved. The liberalisation of foreign investment regulations in January and the reform of the securities market in May have already made such areas easier for foreign investors. However, Congress restricted the use of debt-to-equity swaps for privatisations in key sectors and introduced an anti-trust clause to prevent state monopolies being superseded by private monopolies. Despite having created the legal foundation for privatising much of the public sector, the current administration may manage to tackle only a fraction of the 167 enterprises involving public investment, nearly half of which are entirely state-owned. There is still considerable opposition to privatisation by bureaucrats and workers in the bloated state apparatus, and the government will face strikes and tough negotiations. The new law has given the president executive powers to reform or eliminate inefficient and superfluous enterprises. But more specific legislation will be necessary to regulate private enterprises operating in new sectors. The executive placed 26 bills before Congress last month. Without a clear majority, it may take the government some time to get these passed. 'If we can privatise a few big companies during the term of this administration, we will have accomplished something,' said Mr Carlos Larreategui, under-secretary of public administration. The government's strategy is to tackle the big and controversial companies first. The smaller ones, he added, will then become easier. Public entities will be trimmed of excess staff through offers of settlement payments to employees who have worked in the same institution for at least two years and who resign voluntarily. The revenue from the sale of public entities will have to be reinvested in education, health, housing and other basic services.</p>

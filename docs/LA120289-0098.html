			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ONE COUPLE'S SWEET SMELLS OF SUCCESS  </P> <P> Antiques dealer Sue Ann Elmore found some handwritten potpourri recipes in an  old trunk and they inspired a whole new career.  </P> <P> That was 14 years ago, according to an article in the current issue of  Victoria, and the idea for Woodbine Herb Co. of Charlottesville, Va., was born.  </P> <P> "I was mesmerized," she said of finding the potpourri recipes. "It seemed as  though I already knew the recipes, as if a long-lost friend had returned."  </P> <P> Right from the start she knew instinctively which oils and spices worked well  with various herbs and flowers.  </P> <P> "All of a sudden the chemistry began to click in my mind," she said. "It was  like being able to start reading music without any formal training."  </P> <P> Herbs are a family enterprise for Sue Ann and Jim, her husband, who follow true  18th-century methods in making their potpourris.  </P> <P> Whole flowers, untreated herbs and spices are gently layered, then natural  fixatives such as orrisroot, frankincense and myrrh are added to absorb the  fragrance and hold it for years.  </P> <P> The Elmores grow some of their own ingredients, and import such exotica as  myrrh beads, bundles of Batavian cinnamon and hand-woven Indonesian Baleka  baskets that double as pomanders.  </P> <P> Although Sue Ann occasionally mashes comfrey leaves into a poultice to salve  poison ivy or creates herbal blends for her pantry, it is the mixing of  fragrances that gives her the greatest pleasure.  </P> <P> "You need a knowledge of the chemical properties of herbs as well as a good  nose to create a successful blend," she said.  </P> <P> For example, Woodbine bath herbs, a mix of mint and roses, are formulated to be  both rejuvenating and relaxing because "bathing is a time to unwind as well as  to renew the senses."  </P> <P> History inspires Sue Ann's potpourri. Sold under private labels at Monticello  and Mount Vernon is a carefully measured blend called "Mr. Hamilton's  Favorite." It also is Jim Elmore's favorite and combines rosebuds, lavender,  cornflowers and spices.  </P> <P> The Elmores' potpourri business has outgrown their yard, but they remain  devoted gardeners. At home, 60 to 70 different herbs are nurtured along with  unusual tomatoes and other vegetables.  </P> <P> Since mint is a favorite, orange mint, spearmint and peppermint, wonderful for  teas, and pineapple mint, for fruit salad, grow in the garden and spill over  into the yard.  </P> <P> "Mowing mint only helps propagate it," Sue Ann said. "And when you walk on it,  it's so fragrant."  </P></p>

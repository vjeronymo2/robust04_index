This is the end of the message sent by the head of state to  Giovanni Spadolini [speaker of the Senate], and to Giorgio  Napolitano [speaker of the Chamber of Deputies], along with the  decree dissolving the Chambers. "Unmistakable facts made it  necessary to dissolve the Chambers," the president wrote.  Scalfaro mentioned in particular the referendum of 18 April  1993, when an overwhelming majority of voters demanded new  [electoral] rules, and the 1993 administrative elections, which  showed there had been deep changes in relations among parties.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Europe dances to a new tune FOLLOWING Denmark's spanner in the Maastricht Treaty's works, there is no doubt that the Euro-melody of the month is 'subsidiarity,' and that European Commission and national officials are vying to see who can sing the best descant. But not everybody gets the tune right. Subsidiarity means the Community should keep out of decisions better taken at a national or regional level. So magic a word is it that the incoming UK presidency of the EC suggests spelling out what it means in a bid to help resolve the treaty crisis. In Strasbourg on Wednesday, Commission president Jacques Delors pinned his colours to the subsidiarity mast, and no Commission official will discuss cod quotas or capital adequacy without detailed exegesis of this purported recipe for reconciling European people with European Union. In Luxembourg on Tuesday, for instance, a somnolent meeting of EC fisheries ministers jerked into life, when they were told they had agreed that 'in general' member states would be responsible for ensuring their fishermen did not cheat on quotas. 'In general'-ism is out; the Vikings are erasing weasel words from the Euro-record. Yesterday, transport commissioner Karel Van Miert announced new plans to integrate Europe's transport systems, a key component of Maastricht. His presentation was,with ostentatious genuflections to subsidiarity, part of the now daily spectacle of Brussels pulling in its horns. 'What I do want to say is that no decision has been taken to carry out this work,' he said. 'That is up to the national authorities. What we are supplying is the framework.' Or: 'If you want to go ahead with motorways, would you please take into account this framework, which will be of benefit to the whole Community.' It was all going well, saying please and all, until one ecologically-correct questioner asked whether sponsoring motorways wasn't a slap in the face to the Rio Earth Summit. Mr Van Miert patiently explained that the poorer, 'cohesion' countries - the southern states and Ireland - could not reasonably be denied their wish for German-style motorways. 'It would be unfair to cohesion countries like Denmark ..' the commissioner went on: 'Sorry, sorry,' he stuttered to tumultuous laughter; 'a slip of the tongue.' Quite.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour accuses SNP of 'toytown economics' - Scottish Separatism LABOUR yesterday launched a strong counter-attack on the Scottish National party, with Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow Scottish secretary, accusing it of 'toytown economics' and 'blatant fraud' in putting the case for Scotland's becoming independent. Mr Dewar's attack, which was dismissed by the SNP as 'blind panic', is part of Labour's attempt to head off what it fears will be a surge in support for the nationalists, prompted by last week's opinion poll showing that 50 per cent of Scots wanted some form of independence. Last weekend a separate poll showed a drop of 9 points to 38 per cent in support for Labour in Scotland compared with a month before, with the SNP up 5 points at 26 per cent. Mr Dewar said the SNP was being dishonest in claiming that living standards in Scotland would immediately improve with independence. 'There is no certainty that we would be able to maintain the level of public services and infrastructure that Scotland needs' with independence, he said. Revenue from North Sea oil, on which many of the SNP's economic calculations were based, was in relative decline and now yielded less than 1 per cent of the total tax take in Britain. 'It is madness to float a major constitutional change on the basis of wildly optimistic assumptions about an inevitably time-limited asset,' he said. If there were a differential in interest rates between Scotland and England, what would stop capital flowing south, Mr Dewar asked. 'Investors from what was Britain will indeed come to Scotland but for cheap loans and nothing else.' In the short term, people working for Scottish defence contractors such as Yarrow shipbuilders and GEC Ferranti would risk losing their jobs. UK Civil Service departments that have been relocated to Scotland would be withdrawn, he said. 'Scotland is not a country incapable of sustaining independence,' he said. 'Labour argues it would not be the best way forward.' The government refused to be committed to a firm date for establishing a Scottish further education funding council in the Commons last night. Mr Michael Forsyth, Scottish Office minister of state, said it would be wrong to to go beyond introducing a new clause to the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Bill giving the government freedom to decide when such a body should be set up. Although he described the new provision as a 'concession' to views expressed by Labour MPs at an earlier stage of the bill, the opposition front benches questioned its value. Mr Anthony Worthington, a Labour frontbench spokesman, asked: 'Is this a sop or an indication that the minister has accepted the case for a funding council?' Mr Forsyth told him: 'If we through a funding council would be entirely inappropriate we would never have put this provision in the bill.' He denied that the government planned to merge the further education funding council with the higher education funding council. A Labour amendment seeking to ensure that the Scottish further education funding council would be established on April 1 1994 was defeated by 254 votes to 178, a government majority of 76.</p>

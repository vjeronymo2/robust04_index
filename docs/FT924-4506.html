			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Labour doubts on sale of PSA arm to Tarmac LABOUR YESTERDAY expressed concern over the sale of the Property Services Agency's projects division to Tarmac, the construction and building materials group. Mr Doug Henderson, a local-government spokesman, has tabled a series of parliamentary questions requesting details of any meetings that may have taken place between Tarmac and the PSA board before the sale took place. The issue has arisen because of concern about what the government agreed to pay Tarmac to take over the projects division, which had a number of problem contracts and was in danger of closure. Mr Henderson said in a letter to Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, that the government had disclosed that Tarmac had been paid or guaranteed Pounds 120m of public money to take over the division. He requested information on whether an additional Pounds 130m had been promised to Tarmac in settlement of disputes arising from the construction of the Trident base at Faslane, in Scotland and Howell Grange Prison in Leeds. Tarmac said that the responsibility for managing the Trident contract had been left with the Ministry of Defence as part of the sale agreement. Any settlement, therefore, would be the responsibility of ministry and not Tarmac. It also denied that it would receive Pounds 120m from the purchase. It said that that had been made clear in a parliamentary answer given Mr John Redwood, environment minister, on November 25. 'Initially we will receive Pounds 54.9m to cover unpaid bills owed by the PSA and to meet the cost of putting the business on a commercial footing. A further Pounds 10m to Pounds 20m could be paid to cover contingencies such as redundancies for some of the workers taken on under the sale.' Confusion has arisen because the government also has to meet the cost of redundancies of former PSA workers who have not been taken on by Tarmac. The company will take on 850 of the division's 1,900 workers. The cost of redundancies of workers not employed by Tarmac has been estimated by Mr Redwood at between Pounds 30m to Pounds 35m. In addition, the government has agreed to guarantee future redundancy payments of former PSA workers in the unlikely event of Tarmac going bust in the next five years. Ministers have also agreed to provide money to bring pension-fund benefits for former employees in line with what they would have received if they had remained in the public sector. Tarmac emphasised that none of that money would be coming to the group and was entirely the responsibility of government.</p>

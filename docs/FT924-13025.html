			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Harmony accounts qualified THE AUDITORS of Harmony Leisure have qualified the accounts of the loss-making pubs and restaurants group, after bankers demanded a substantial reduction in the company's overdrafts and loans. Hacker Young said Harmony's Pounds 1.66m banking facility, reduced from Pounds 2.7m in the year to March 29 1991, would be extended until October 1993 on condition there was 'a phased reduction in the group's overdraft requirements in January 1993'. Barclays is understood to be seeking a six figure debt reduction at Harmony, which incurred a 70 per cent increase to Pounds 3.68m in pre-tax loss on turnover of Pounds 6.44m in the 52 weeks to March 29 1992. Mr Robert Dawson, the newly appointed non-executive chairman who replaced Sir Stanley Grinstead earlier this week, disclosed 'that the long term future of the company could well be as part of an enlarged grouping'. A number of potential bidders are thought to be interested in the property assets, which include several well-known pubs and hotels in London and the south east. No formal talks have yet begun. A group of shareholders, meanwhile, is seeking the removal of the directors at an extraordinary meeting likely to be held next month.</p>

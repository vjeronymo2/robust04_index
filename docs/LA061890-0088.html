			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> GROUP TRIES TO HELP LEUKEMIA VICTIM, 4  </P> <P> Four-year-old Dennyelle Von Bargen needs a bone marrow transplant to fight off  leukemia, but with no medical insurance, her mother could not imagine how she  would pay a hospital bill that doctors estimate could run to $150,000.  </P> <P> Four local businessmen who learned of Dennyelle's plight, however, are hoping  to make a difference with a carnival planned for Saturday in Fountain Valley's  Mile Square Park.  </P> <P> "Our goal and our plan is to do something like this every six months," said Dan  Gibbons, one of the event's sponsors and a Huntington Beach businessman. Local  vendors have donated food, drinks and prizes to be given away at the carnival,  he added.  </P> <P> The carnival, which will feature about 20 games and booths from noon to 4 p.m.,  will be the first fund-raiser by a fledgling foundation being formed by four  friends. They plan to call it "I Make a Difference" and intend to devote the  organization to raising money for individuals rather than causes such as cancer  or AIDS, Gibbons said. The other group members are Dan Vogelzang, Sam Kuri and  Doug Sakurai.  </P> <P> "It's wonderful," Dennyelle's mother, Karmen Von Bargen, said of the carnival  plans, adding that they may help to save her daughter's life.  </P> <P> Von Bargen was preparing to move to Oregon with her three children in late  April when her daughter's leukemia was diagnosed and the child was  hospitalized. Without the transplant, Dennyelle's chances of survival are 30%  to 40%, doctors say. With it, the odds will improve to 60%.  </P> <P> And if the money can be raised to pay for the procedure, Dennyelle's brother, 2  1/2-year-old Justin, will be called upon to give of himself as well. He will be  the bone marrow donor.  </P> <P> "He knows he's going to help sissy out, but he doesn't understand everything,"  said Karmen Von Bargen, who is staying with friends in Garden Grove along with  Justin and another daughter, Autumn, 7.  </P> <P> Dennyelle, a bouncing ball of energy with a fondness for saying "No" and "I  don't know," does not seem bothered by her situation. In isolation at Childrens  Hospital of Orange County in Orange, she is surrounded by toys and family  photos and has earned an affectionate reputation among the hospital's nurses as  a "wild child."  </P> <P> The transplant procedure, scheduled for next month, involves high doses of  chemotherapy to induce remission in the leukemia and kill Dennyelle's bone  marrow, Dr. Felicity Hodder said. Bone marrow collected with a needle from  Justin's hip bone will be filtered into a blood transfusion bag and returned  through a tube in Dennyelle's chest, Hodder added.  </P> <P> The bone marrow will circulate through Dennyelle's blood stream and then, if  all goes well, settle in the right spot and begin to replenish her own supply.  Bone marrow makes blood cells, which are defective in leukemia cases.  </P> <P> Gibbons said the group hopes the carnival will raise at least $20,000. SHANNON  SANDS  </P></p>

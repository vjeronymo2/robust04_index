			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk visited two  international exhibitions on 28 April, arranged on the grounds  of the National Exhibitions Center--INMED-94 and CONSIMED-94.  The head of state paid considerable attention to goods  manufactured by Ukrainian enterprises participating in the  exhibitions and noted that they were making significant efforts  to represent Ukraine worthily worldwide.    Journalists asked the head of state to comment on some  aspects of political life in Ukraine. He was asked, in  particular, to make more specific his stance on the upcoming  presidential election, which is known, as well as to state what  the president would do if the new parliament disagreed with his  arguments. Kravchuk said the following:    [Begin Kravchuk recording] First, you do not know my whole  position. I always emphasize the following: No matter what our  assessment of the situation in Ukraine is at present--either  mild or strong--there is constitutional chaos and constitutional  crisis, which is a fact because Ukraine is perhaps the only  former Soviet Union state that has not adopted its constitution  or formed new real bodies of judicial power in four years--i.e.,  let us say, any branches of power. Even Belarus, it seems, has  already finished recently and has adopted a Constitution.  Belarus is holding elections after this, with the structure of  power, branches of power, and system of power having been  determined expressly and clearly at the constitutional level.  We, unfortunately, have not gotten this far.    We have been busy all the time but have never gone all the  way. We did not finalize the issue of a local executive power at  a specific time in the past. We formed presidential structures  but also began granting executive powers to representative  bodies. Thus, instead of, let us say, softer, gradual transition  from diarchy to the centralization of, shall we say, executive  power, we have constantly been causing diarchy to worsen.    Now, if you are carefully following speeches, you can hear  the accents and voices: Power must be in one pair of hands.  This is so. Let me raise the question, however: Where exactly  in one pair of hands? If it is Kiev, one can assume, for  instance, that executive power is transferred to one pair of  hands, either to the president or to the Cabinet of Ministers.  To do this, however, changes to the Constitution should be  made. Power in one pair of hands in Kiev, however, does not at  all mean that it is in one pair of hands in Ukraine, because  what is being proposed now--forming power at the regional  level--in villages, towns, cities, rayons, and oblasts--is on no  account taken care of by the argument or the formula of power in  one pair of hands. Power will be in a hundred pairs of hands.  Whereas power would be in one pair of hands in Kiev, there once  again would be no vertical structure of power locally, and once  again there would not be what we have wanted to achieve.    So, the interesting thing is this: If the president has the  whole of power, (?himself being in Kiev) as some propose, this  now sounds more like a presidential republic. But where? At  the center. What kind of power is there locally? It is  representative, soviet. Once again, the diarchy would be laid,  which is exactly what all of us are saying.    That is why this is exactly what I am talking about: To  begin  with, one should make a decision with regard to these problems,  make a decision at the constitutional level. When I am talking  about elections and when I am saying that I will ask the new  parliament to make a decision, it is not that I would like to  shift responsibility to someone else.    I would only like the new parliament to confirm whether it  agrees with what we have done over the past four years. I have  in mind the Supreme Council, and not only the Supreme Council  but the executive structures as well. I do not remove the  responsibility from anyone, for it dots the i's and crosses the  t's and says that we have to begin, to get down to the final  solution of this issue by means of the election, having formed  all the institutions at the constitutional level or at the level  of some law on power.    We have to begin the adoption of laws because the following  situation may arise, which I have spoken about more than once:  The president is elected according to this law, and he is the  head of state and the head of the executive power, and the power  structures are not determined. Everything will begin all over  again.    Well, look at our Constitution. Take Article 97 of the  Constitution and Article 114--two articles only, to say nothing  about the other articles--and you will see nothing there but  contradictions and discrepancies. That is a fact. Therefore, I  appeal to the new Supreme Council with a proposal to consider  all this. It will be its right, its power. I am not  encroaching on anyone's powers--this is clear--to make its final  decision and have its say, because the 12th Supreme Council has  already passed on the responsibility, and this Supreme Council  is assuming it. This is how it should do this. Such is my  stand. I hope that this is a normal stand, that it complies  with all the norms of legislation and the creation of a  law-governed state. If the Supreme Council fails to confirm or,  for example, confirms the decision of the old Supreme Council,  it will thus again initiate this chaos. In that chaos, it will  be necessary to make decisions concerning both the presidential  election and the election to the local bodies of power. I will  also have to make a decision. Before the Supreme Council holds  its session, I am following the road of law, legitimacy, and  observance of the Constitution. If this is absent, I also have  the right as the president now to make a decision concerning the  election. That is to say, I have not yet made a decision before  the Supreme Council session. I will make a decision after the  Supreme Council session. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> CHICANO STUDIES MAKES COMEBACK ON CAMPUSES  </P> <P> When he was a student at Santa Monica High School, Elias Serna's goal was to  become an engineer and "make lots of money."  </P> <P> There had never been much of it around the Serna household. "My mom is a single  mother who raised us by herself," the young man explained.  </P> <P> Since going to college, however, his goals have changed dramatically. Now his  main interest is pursuing a career through which he can serve his community,  possibly as a teacher.  </P> <P> Serna, 20, attributes the change to his exposure -- for the first time -- to  Latino teachers who have served as role models, and to the study of the history  and literature of Mexican-Americans through the Chicano studies program at UC  Berkeley.  </P> <P> "I've learned a lot about being Chicano and the importance of going back to  your community to help," he said. And Serna said he is not alone, that despite  the trend on college campuses emphasizing careers for personal advancement,  most of his Chicano friends have also developed a strong commitment to their  community through the lessons of Chicano studies.  </P> <P> The enthusiasm of Serna and his friends for Chicano studies mirrors a rise in  popularity of the programs, not only at UC Berkeley, but at universities across  California and the Southwest.  </P> <P> Enrollment in Chicano studies programs has doubled on some campuses, and  classes are drawing large numbers of non-Latino students for the first time.  Beginning in 1991, UC Berkeley plans to require that all undergraduate students  take an ethnic studies class, and other UC campuses are considering similar  requirements.  </P> <P> The growing demand for the classes, coupled with increasing public attention to  the state's Latino population boom, has focused renewed interest on the field  of Chicano studies. The state Legislature has called for an increase in hiring  of Latino and other minority faculty members, calling their representation on  public university campuses "dismal."  </P> <P> Emboldened by these encouraging signs of change, Chicano professors are pushing  for an expansion of existing programs and calling for a recommitment to the  1960s ideals that spawned the Chicano studies programs.  </P> <P> "Our research should address itself to the pressing problems of our community,"  said Tatcho Mindiola, director of the Mexican-American Studies Program at the  University of Houston and a leader in the National Assn. for Chicano Studies.  He added that the mission of Chicano studies remains "to challenge the status  quo" and improve conditions in the Latino community.  </P> <P> Historian Rodolfo Acuna, founder of the Chicano studies department at Cal State  Northridge and honored by the association earlier this year as a model of  academic excellence and community activism, credits Chicano studies with  keeping the Chicano middle-class mindful of its responsibility to the broader  Latino community.  </P> <P> Comparing the role of Chicano studies to that of black universities and  churches in nurturing a community's collective conscience, Acuna said Chicano  studies "has kept our history alive."  </P> <P> He added that the university programs provide those who share a concern for  Chicano community issues "a place where they can go and get support and where  their ideas can ferment."  </P> <P> A legacy of the 1960s Chicano protest movement, this activist tradition began  when Chicanos barged their way into American academia and insisted on staying  -- on their own terms.  </P> <P> Their insistence on looking at the world through Chicano eyes has admittedly  set some of the scholars apart from the Euro-centric mainstream of academic  life that emphasizes academic "objectivity." But Chicano scholars argue that  the so-called objectivity of previous Anglo scholars has often misrepresented,  denigrated or ignored Latinos.  </P> <P> "We've institutionalized our courses and wrested control over what is said  about us," Mindiola said. "It used to be all in the hands of Anglo scholars;  now the majority of research on Chicanos is done by Chicanos."  </P> <P> Most of the work of Chicano scholars has been in the social sciences, but  increasingly there are contributions coming out of the humanities, in such  fields as literary criticism and theory, according to some scholars.  </P> <P> Others point to a blossoming of literary works and of research by Chicanas  about women. The area of public policy research is another expanding field,  with such work as UCLA Prof. David E. Hayes-Bautista's book, "The Burden of  Support," which deals with the state's changing demographics and their economic  implications.  </P> <P> The Chicano studies resurgence of recent years followed a decade of  retrenchment, marked by dwindling enrollment, budget cuts and denial of tenure.  </P> <P> A Times telephone survey of a dozen universities in California shows that  enrollments at most of the campuses fell to their lowest points during the late  1970s and early 1980s, beginning their recovery only in recent years.  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount University is typical in this regard. It had 229 students in  the 1975-76 school year, but enrollment dropped to 91 by 1984-85. Last year,  more students than ever, 288, took Chicano studies.  </P> <P> At Cal State Northridge, 4,399 students were enrolled in Chicano studies last  year, making it the nation's largest program in this subject.  </P> <P> And while enrollment is clearly on the increase, other studies show that most  campuses have only a handful of Chicano studies professors on staff.  </P> <P> According to a report released earlier this year by a joint legislative  committee calling for increased hiring of minority professors, while Latinos  make up about 25% of the state's population, they are only about 3.4% of all  tenured faculty in the University of California system. This is only a slight  improvement over 10 years ago when the figure was 2.6%.  </P> <P> The report challenged the universities to work harder to recruit more minority  faculty, as well as students. It warned that the state "is threatened with a  permanent underclass" unless higher education better serves minorities.  </P> <P> UC President David Gardner has long advocated developing a faculty more  reflective of the state's population, according to Rick Malaspina, a spokesman  for Gardner. However, the number of available minority candidates has been  limited, Malaspina said.  </P> <P> Still, Chicano scholars are critical of what some call the intransigence of  university officials in facing the realities of a changing society.  </P> <P> "Universities should be the social conscience of society, the leaders. But  they're not," said Adaljiza Sosa Riddell, director of the Chicano studies  program at UC Davis. "To the extent that universities are moving on this issue,  it is because they are being pushed by Chicanos."  </P> <P> Times researcher Tracy Thomas contributed to this article.  </P></p>

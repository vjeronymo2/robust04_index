Super-secret details of the  operation were cited. Let's turn to those articles and reports.    THE WASHINGTON POST, March 20, 1975    "The wreckage of a Soviet submarine that sank in the Pacific  Ocean has been detected on the ocean bottom. The U.S. Central  Intelligence Agency salvaged one third of the submarine in the  summer of 1974. A ship with drilling equipment that was built by  Billionaire Howard Hughes was used to do that."    DPA Agency, March 21 1975    "The U.S. CIA discovered two torpedoes with nuclear warheads  on board the Soviet submarine that sank in 1968. `Remarkable  material' was obtained as a result of operations conducted to  salvage the submarine. Both torpedoes were raised to the surface  and were loaded into a specially equipped barge to conceal it  from foreign ships. The operation that was undertaken to salvage  the submarine will be continued in the future. If it is  successfully completed, the CIA will have all of the codes,  ciphers and diagrams of submarine command and control machines."    And everything began with a tragedy.  <H6>  "Your Son Has Been Declared Dead..." </H6>   On February 24, 1968, the submarine with conning tower  number  574 went out on combat patrol from the Mogila basing facility on  Kamchatka. It was a diesel with three underwater-launch  ballistic missiles with high-power nuclear warheads and also  with two nuclear torpedoes. Captain 1st Rank Vladimir Kobzar,  whom the command authorities characterized as an experienced,  competent and strong-willed submariner, commanded the submarine.    For 12 days, the crew carried out the assigned missions of  undetected patrolling (the submarine planned to return to base  on 5 May 1968) but it did not establish communications on March  8. On that day, PL-574 should have transmitted a radio test  message -- a short signal, but...    Retired Rear Admiral Viktor Dygalo, who in 1968 commanded  the  large unit to which PL-574 was assigned, recalls what happened:    "In accordance with the combat order, Vladimir Kobzar  regularly sent reports to headquarters on the course of the  cruise. But on March 8 we were all alarmed -- the submarine did  not respond to the radio test message that was transmitted by  Pacific Ocean Fleet Headquarters as a communications check.  Indeed, this did not provide grounds to suggest a tragic outcome  of the cruise -- rarely did those kinds of reasons prevent a  commander from establishing communications.    "But the message did not arrive. This was serious grounds  for  alarm. All the more so that, according to intelligence  information, the American submarine Swordfish, which had  sustained damage, had arrived at the Japanese port of Yokosuka  at approximately the same time. During this submarine's entry  into Yokosuka, the Americans had taken unusual security measures  and only American personnel were involved with the repair work.  The thought arose about a collision underwater. We began to  urgently prepare a search and rescue operation.    "Aircraft, surface combatants and auxiliary ships were sent  out into the ocean. The depth in the search area was 5,000-6,000  meters and the distance from Kamchatka was approximately 1,230  miles. However, a two-month search in the area where we assumed  the submarine could have sunk ended unsuccessfully. An analysis  of the oil spot that was found indicated that it was solar oil  and diesel oil. Consequently, the submarine had sunk."    Several versions on the loss of PL-574 were advanced and  exist until the present time. The most well-founded version is  the one that Admiral Viktor Dygalo has described. The American  nuclear submarine Swordfish, which was tracking PL-574, had  unintentionally rammed it. At the time of the collision, PL-574  was traveling at periscope depth in the "diesel operations  underwater mode," under RDP as the experts say it, and was  "deaf" due to the diesel's noise. Swordfish maneuvered to a  close distance and presumably struck the upper portion of  PL-574's conning tower when PL-574 was turning to a new course.  PL-574, with a flooded central compartment, went to the bottom.    PL-574 took the lives of 98 Soviet seamen to the ocean  depths. Moscow was silent about the catastrophe. Killed in  action notices were sent to the relatives which stated: "Your  son, husband, or father has been declared dead..."    They were silent about the catastrophe. Nevertheless, the  United States had learned about it, and not only about the fact  itself, but about the precise location of the submarine's loss.  They had photographed the sunken submarine. The photographs  showed: The submarine was lying on the ground on an even keel  and practically without a list. The Americans had a real  opportunity to obtain many of the Soviet Navy's secrets -- the  United States Navy's primary enemy at sea.    The cipher machine was of special interest. U.S.  intelligence  personnel almost always experienced difficulties with Soviet  codes and even a seven-year-old machine could be utilized to  decipher thousands of Soviet messages that had been transmitted  when the Cold War was in full swing in the 1960's.  <H6>  Project "Jennifer" </H6>   Practical realization of the idea to salvage the lost Soviet  submarine took the form of a CIA operation code named "Project  Jennifer" which was frequently designated "Project J" at the  CIA. The operation began to be conducted at the beginning of the  1970's with the full support of President Richard Nixon and was  a deep secret. Billionaire Howard Hughes, owner of airlines,  electronics companies, and oil drilling enterprises, was  assigned an important role. He partially financed the operation.    The technical executors designed two special ships to raise  PL-574: The Glomar-Explorer ship-platform and the N V-1  pontoon-floating dock. A characteristic detail: Even during the  final assembly of the ships, the engineers-builders could not  understand their function.    In October 1970, Soviet intelligence in the United States  managed to establish that the U.S. intelligence services had  taken steps to look for the sunken Soviet submarine and had sent  a special ship to the area where the submarine had been lost.  <H6>  A Secret Ship </H6>   Surveillance established that the ship had dropped anchor  and  had lowered pipes to a depth of approximately 5,000 meters.    The ship, which was being painstakingly observed by Soviet  seamen, belonged to the firm Glomar and was one of its nine  specialized ships that were designed to drill shelves in coastal  areas of the World Ocean. It had been leased by the CIA for  decoy maneuvering and the firm's managers and crew did not have  any idea about the true nature of Operation Jennifer.    Direct implementation of Project Jennifer began later. The  Glomar Explorer left the shipyard in July 1973 for ocean tests.  It was sighted off the coast of Nicaragua, where it was assumed  Howard Hughes lived at that time, in the autumn of that same  year. Opinions were expressed in the Western press that the  "secret ship" was conducting a search for manganese at depths  from 10,000 to 16,000 feet. And already in the summer of 1974  the ship was sighted near the Hawaiian Islands in the area where  the Soviet submarine had been lost. The "secret ship's" crew  totaled 170 people. All crew members were CIA  employees-contractors.    In June 1974, the crew of the Glomar Explorer undertook the  first attempt to raise the Soviet submarine. This was witnessed  by crew members of a Soviet intelligence ship.    The "Chazhma" ship measurement system was sent to the  Hawaiian Islands at the beginning of March 1975. It shadowed the  Explorer for a week. According to the commander's report, the  ship was screwing and threading pipes.    The fleet intelligence directorate obtained authorization  from the fleet commander to send the MV-136 Ocean Rescue Tug  with a surveillance team from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy to  organize uninterrupted shadowing of the "secret ship". They  "observed" the Explorer for ten days -- as before, it was  involved with "screwing pipes".    And suddenly... A sensational explosion in the foreign  press:  "The U.S. CIA had raised a sunken Soviet submarine from the  bottom of the Pacific Ocean".    Using the pipes that had been extended to a length of five  kilometers, the dock-pontoon with claw-shaped underwater  gripping devices was dropped to the very bottom of the ocean.  The television cameras that had been installed on it permitted  the operators to see in detail everything that was occurring in  the ocean's depths. Soon the most important moment arrived for  the specialists -- the seizure of the Soviet submarine. It  occurred successfully. The salvage began, but...    When the dock-pontoon had completed 99&percnt; of the  journey, the  submarine broke into two parts at the point of the puncture. The  stern section slipped out of the gripping devices and rushed to  the bottom of the ocean with the bodies of the majority of those  who had perished and with the ballistic missiles.    The missiles with the nuclear warheads floated away from the  CIA, however. On that day the agency's experts considered the  goal to be half-attained. In their hands was the first  compartment with the torpedoes and the second, commander's  compartment with the cipher room.    The Explorer and the dock-pontoon left the area and headed  for Honolulu. They planned to raise the stern section with the  missile compartment later. Near Honolulu, in a range that had  been closed to ship navigation, the deceased seamen, who had not  been affected by decay for seven years --there is no oxygen at  great depths -- were extracted from the nose section of the  submarine.    As the Project Jennifer plan had stipulated, the submariners  from PL-574 were reburied in the ocean according to the ritual  that was accepted in the Soviet Navy.    They delivered the hull of the submarine, from which the  dead  had been removed, to carefully guarded Redwood City Bay (near  San Francisco). The two nuclear torpedoes, surviving documents  and other equipment were extracted from it there. The American  press reported that the submarine's design features were  painstakingly studied and were assessed as "quite interesting".  <H6>  The Kremlin and White House Were Silent </H6>   However, the U.S. intelligence service's primary goal was  not  achieved --there were no ciphers. That's how it turned out.  Let's turn once again to the recollections of Retired Rear  Admiral Anatoliy Shtyrov:    The reason was unexpected both for the Americans and for us  too: During plant repair and modernization at Dalzavod  (Vladivostok) in 1967, PL-574 Commander Vladimir Kobzar  "displayed rational initiative" -- for the appropriate "reward",  more precisely, for spirits and an awl, as they say it in the  navy -- and transferred the organic cipher room from the second  to the fourth compartment, having thereby widened his  commander's cabin.    The press prevented the future continuation of the  operation.  The CIA couldn't keep the operation secret. A curious incident  prevented that.    A band of gangsters from Los Angeles learned that there were  documents in the office of Billionaire Howard Hughes, the  possession of which would yield millions of dollars. The police  recorded the raid on the office. A sea of reporters arrived with  the police. One of the documents ultimately ended up in the  press.    The White House and the Kremlin simply did not react to the  reports about the Soviet submarine for a long time. The White  House's silence was understandable. The attempt to salvage the  Soviet submarine would have involved consequences similar to  those that had occurred during the incident with the U-2  aircraft piloted by Powers.    As for the Kremlin, the Soviet government never publicly  reported the submarine's loss.    In fulfillment of a CPSU Central Committee decree, the  commander-in-chief of the Soviet Navy issued an order: Ships  would conduct combat alert duty in the area of the loss of  PL-574 and would prevent salvaging of its remaining portion from  the bottom of the ocean, even if they had to bomb the area. That  type of combat alert duty was conducted for six months.    The measures undertaken played their role. To avoid  complicating relations with Moscow, Washington rejected further  submarine salvage operations and the appropriate instructions  were issued to the CIA leadership. Operation Project Jennifer,  an operation which still has many secrets, came to an end.</p>

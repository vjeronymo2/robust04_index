			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / As They Say in Europe: Singing those old Danube blues - James Morgan on an outbreak of imperial nostalgia in Austria Just as Europe has been in a state of flux in the last five years, so has Europe's attitude towards itself. The present influences the past, old myths retire and entirely new myths rise to take their place. The myth that has taken the biggest battering is familiar to students of modern history: that of plucky little Serbia striving for national independence and providing the heartland of South Slav unity. In 1914 Serbia took on the Austro-Hungarian empire which replied in such a manner as to unleash the first world war on an unsuspecting Europe. The events of the past couple of years have led to a steady rewriting of that version of history. This is not the result of a plot on the part of revisionists. Instead, huge numbers of people, informed and ignorant, assume that what is apparently so obvious today was always true: the Serbs are motivated by insane great-power ambitions which they periodically visit on their luckless neighbours. One sees old film footage of June 1914 reinterpreted as the innocent Archduke Franz-Ferdinand goes to the doom so irresponsibly plotted by Serbian terrorists. Sarajevo, then as now, becomes the site of Serb savagery, or stupidity. New books tell us of the glory that was once Bosnia, not an administrative convenience as the three people who had heard of the place had supposed, but a true nation of cheery peasants of different faiths and unbounded freedom, a Balkan beacon in fact. This new European history has been seized on by the Austrian press. For months now there has been a wave of interest in the history of Bosnia which enjoyed 40 years of benign rule from Vienna from 1878. Newspapers publish conversations with those who remember the good old days, and the demands of those too young to remember but who would gladly return Bosnia to a resuscitated empire. It is a bit like the tales of India one used to read in the British press recounting the natives' supposed nostalgia for imperial rule, but carries greater force. Thus the other day the Kronen Zeitung, a Vienna tabloid, ran the headline, 'How Bosnia was once part of Austria]' It concerned an exhibition at the Ethnographic Museum in Schloss Kittsee on the Hungarian border. Bosnian history is now integrated into the Austrian concept 'our glorious past'. The paper publicised the occasion as a last chance to see its culture before it disappears. The day before, the main broadsheet, Die Presse, reported on another exhibition that has run this month in the National Library in Vienna. It is in fact a reproduction of what was supposed to be a permanent war exhibition which opened in August 1915. The idea at that time was to provide both a running commentary on the war and a focus for patriotism and enthusiasm. Today's version consists of ephemera - battlefield postcards, children's drawings, posters and propaganda. Of particular interest, and some pride, to the reporter was the evidence of native ingenuity in the way everything was pressed into service for the manufacture of ersatz materials: fruit stones for oil extraction and women's hair for making belts. The Great War is becoming one of those rather neutral historical events, not as meaningless as the War of Spanish Succession to the modern student but a bit like the Crimean War is to the British. I have lived in Vienna on two occasions, many years apart, and in neither of those periods was it done for the media to make too much of Austria's glorious colonial past or the achievements of its peoples in the Great War. Nostalgia is the lifeblood of the city but it has concentrated, publicly, on imperial-and-royal pomp and, privately, on the Third Reich ('We could go all the way to Bratislava on one tram without any border controls.') Today the empire itself is often perceived as a model for the troubled south-eastern corner of Europe. But history is not about to repeat itself. In spite of the integration that is taking place - Austria is the largest foreign investor in Hungary (Dollars 4bn in 1992) - Vienna's eyes are firmly fixed on the west. That is a result of the cold war and the Euro-frenzy in the wake of the positive referendum result. Meanwhile, the nation is fed up with its one-time colonies and does not much care for their peoples. Last week there was a meeting in Austria of governments which will join the EU in January and those of the central European candidates. The European Commission was there and the emphasis was on the opening to the East. Die Presse doubted that Austria was really going to play its expected role of intermediary on behalf of its eastern neighbours. It will not be an easy role. The four main parties are at odds with each other, as usual. 'Poles, Czechs, Slovaks and Hungarians no longer speak with one tongue . . . so the turn-of-the-century deadline for widening the EU is unrealistic,' it wrote. Nostalgia is all very well, but if there is to be a resurrection of the Empire, it will be without Austria. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

He was  speaking to No'omi Segal at a reception in Jerusalem.    [Begin Peres recording] Well, it happened before we started  the negotiations. From time to time there were confrontations  in Lebanon. It is not an entirely new phenomenon. But I hope  that the responsible parties will act properly, including the  Syrian party, to stop it.

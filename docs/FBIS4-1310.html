			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban April 26 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Tuesday [26 April] he had  been in contact with Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]  Chairman Judge Johann Kriegler about the crisis in the voting  process in Natal, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation]  radio news reported. He said numerous calls had been received  from IFP voters in many areas complaining about voting  procedures.    Mr Peter Miller of the IFP's electoral office in  Pietermaritzburg said an IFP member, who had refused to accept a  ballot paper without the party sticker, had been told to sign it  at the bottom.    Only when he refused to do that, was he given a proper  ballot  paper with an IFP sticker.</p>

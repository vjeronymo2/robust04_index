			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Johnston Group back in black With pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.41m, Johnston Group, the construction and civil engineering company, was back in the black at the end of the six months to June 30. Last year's losses were Pounds 393,000 at interim stage, Pounds 2.6m at the year-end. Turnover increased 5 per cent to Pounds 67.7m (Pounds 64.2m). Losses at Johnston Construction were much reduced, but it had 'some way to go' before providing a satisfactory return, the company said. California-based Johnson Sweeper Company was taking longer to break even than planned. However, improved turnover and margins led to increased profits in the construction materials division. Earnings per share were 12.91p compared with losses of 4.62p. The recommended interim dividend is 3.5p (1p).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- Former U.S. President  Jimmy Carter crossed through the heavily fortified border  village of Panmunjom Wednesday on his way to Pyongyang for talks  with North Korean leader Kim Il-song, hoping to find a solution  to the nuclear crisis without the United Nations having to  resort to sanctions.    He met with Deputy Premier and Minister of the National  Unification Board (NUB) Yi Hong-ku earlier in the morning before  heading for Pyongyang via Panmunjom.    Carter also met with President Kim Yong-sam and Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu Tuesday.    The former U.S. leader is scheduled to meet with North  Korean  President Kim Il-song Wednesday evening and will likely convey  the international community's concern over Pyongyang's  replacement of nuclear fuel rods and abrupt withdrawal from the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA].    He also plans to inform Kim Il-song of Seoul's and  Washington's firm position that if Pyongyang does not accept  IAEA inspections, United Nations sanctions are inevitable.    Carter, however, is likely to emphasize that if North Korea  guarantees nuclear transparency, it can improve its relations  with the United States and receive economic support from various  countries, a diplomatic source said.    The former president plans to stay in Pyongyang four days  before returning to Seoul via Panmunjom Saturday to brief  President Kim Yong-sam on the results of his talks.    He will later hold a press conference to discuss his meeting  with Kim Il-song before departing from Seoul.</p>

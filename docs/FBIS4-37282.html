			<p>BFN     [Text] Kabul, June 18 (AFP) -- Afghan Prime Minister  Golboddin Hekmatyar has called for preliminary peace talks, to  coincide with a ceasefire and the reopening of blockaded  national highways, a government official said Saturday.    Shams, the deputy foreign minister, said Hekmatyar had  agreed  Friday to attend a special conference to decide the future  leadership of Afghanistan, but had called for a preliminary  peace meeting first.    According to last year's Islamabad and Jalalabad peace  accords, the terms of office of both Hekmatyar and his rival  President Borhanoddin Rabbani expire on June 28.    "We need to do something before this date in order to avoid  a  power vacuum," Shams noted.    A senior pro-Rabbani commander, Ismael Khan, the governor of  Herat Province, met with Hekmatyar outside Kabul on Thursday and  invited the prime minister to attend a leaders' conference in  Herat to explore ways of ending the ongoing power struggle,  which has provoked steady fighting in Kabul since January 1.    "The preliminary meeting is to decide among other things  about this venue, but Hekmatyar has no objection to Herat,"  Shams told AFP, adding that he was to meet Hekmatyar later  Saturday to finalise details of the proposed preliminary meeting.    But with time running out fast, and with no announcement by  Rabbani that he will step down at he end of the month, observers  here said the odds were against either Hekmatyar's "preliminary"  meeting or the proposed leaders' conference taking place.    Meanwhile, Kabul was quiet Saturday after heavy fighting  late  Friday in the south and west of the capital.    Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami faction guerrillas based in south  Kabul's Darulaman Palace said they were observing a ceasefire  from Saturday but reported heavy fighting Friday night between  Hezb and the Shiite Harakat-e Eslami faction, which is allied to  Rabbani.    To the west, near the now deserted Kabul University, the  other Shiite faction, Hezb-e Wahdat, which is nominally allied  to Hekmatyar, fought with pro-Rabbani troops overnight,  according to residents.    Heavy weapons' fire was traded for more than eight hours,  but  there were no immediate reports of casualties.</p>

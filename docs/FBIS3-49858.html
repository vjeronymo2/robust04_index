			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dragan Colovic from Geneva] </F>   [Text] At exactly 1410 a joint statement was signed here  in Geneva on the beginning of the process of normalization of  relations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] and  Croatia. This important document was signed by Vladislav  Jovanovic and Mate Granic, foreign ministers of the FRY and  Croatia, respectively. The signing ceremony was attended by  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Montenegrin President  Momir Bulatovic, Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic of  Srpska, and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman.    It has been decided that as the first step toward the  normalization of relations between the FRY and Croatia the two  governments open representative offices in Zagreb and Belgrade.  The joint communique states that the opening of the  aforementioned representative offices will improve relations and  facilitate contacts between the two states, as well as  contribute toward mutual trust and the process of normalization  of Serbian-Croatian relations in the interest of peace,  cooperation, and stability in the region. The representative  offices of the FRY in Zagreb and of Croatia in Belgrade will  commence work on 15 February.    It appears that the signing of the aforementioned statement,  which implies the beginning of the normalization in relations  between the FRY and Croatia, is so far the only tangible result  of the very difficult two-day negotiations in Geneva. The  negotiations will continue this afternoon.    Here is what Federal Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic  stated after the signing of the joint declaration, especially  for Belgrade Radio:    [Begin recording] [Jovanovic] The document that has just  been signed is an important event and document because it  sanctions the positive efforts made by the FRY and the Republic  of Croatia in the current peace process in a positive way,  especially with regard to the settlement of the Bosnian crisis.  This document also stresses their determination to establish  closer bilateral contacts, to establish direct communication  links in the form of offices, and we are convinced that this  will help the (?establishment) of peace and the prospects for  the political settling of all outstanding issues in relations  between the two countries and the broader region of Yugoslavia.    We hope that this statement will have positive effects on  the  (?situation) and the settlement of the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, because (?it represents) a sign of political  goodwill and unity in the efforts of political factors to  politically overcome the problems that require exclusively  political solutions and not solutions with force.    [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, how do you assess the two-day talks  in Geneva?    [Jovanovic] They are very complex, very slow, and contain  many anachronisms, especially by the Muslim delegation, which  has obviously come here with the intention not to sign peace but  to make it more complicated, that is, to make its realization  more difficult. This is the most negative moment in the work so  far. On the contrary, however, there are continuous efforts,  efforts made by the cochairmen and the Serbian and the Croatian  sides. Thanks to this, one could say that there are still some  chances of saving the peace process this afternoon and evening,  and if we can be optimists without having much reason to be, to  bring this process closer to an end.    [Colovic] Thank you Mr. Jovanovic.    [Jovanovic] Thank you. [end recording]</p>

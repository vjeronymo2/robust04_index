			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CATHERINE WHEEL  </P> <P> In his review of "Harry and Catherine" (Book Review, Feb. 25), Richard Eder  writes: "The message -- that if you are truly your own woman, even a manly,  tender, utterly respectful man with such extras as passion, wit, originality  and a small but huggable potbelly may not fit -- is not really anti-feminist.  But it is very mournful."  </P> <P> Human development is distinguished by the quest for autonomy. Men have  throughout history sought autonomy, and sought it through power-over.  </P> <P> As a result of the 20th-Century feminist transformation, women are now seeking  autonomy, but generally not through power-over. They are seeking it through  radical independence and generative solitude.  </P> <P> The challenge for Catherine -- of "Harry and Catherine" -- is to affirm the  "manly," tender, utterly respectful person that is Catherine, with such extras  as passion, wit, originality and a small but huggable potbelly thrown in. This  historic venture is not -- from a woman's standpoint -- "very mournful". It is  deeply celebratory.  </P> <P> DIANE R. HOLMAN  </P> <P> LAGUNA BEACH  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ACTRESS FLIES TO AID CONDUCTOR  </P> <P> Actress Ruth Warrick's intervention in the firing of symphony conductor Ulf  Bjorlin could have come off the pages of a soap opera script.  </P> <P> Warrick, who plays the gracious but vindictive Phoebe Tyler Wallingford on the  soap opera "All My Children," flew into Palm Beach on Friday to defend the  dashing, white-haired Bjorlin, recently fired as conductor of the Greater Palm  Beach Symphony.  </P> <P> Warrick told reporters at Palm Beach International Airport that she had  commissioned Bjorlin to compose a symphonic work based on the medieval love  story of Abelard and Heloise.  </P> <P> Bjorlin was fired in May after the debut of his composition "Portrait of Raoul  Wallenberg," which premiered in April in Palm Beach and Boca Raton.  </P> <P> Warrick co-starred with actor Cliff Robertson in the Swedish-born conductor's  production, which honored the Swedish diplomat credited with helping 100,000  Jews escape the Nazis during World War II.  </P></p>

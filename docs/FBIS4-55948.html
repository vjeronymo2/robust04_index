			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 23 (CTK) -- Election polls have  indicated that three stable preelection political blocs --  ethnic Hungarian, left-wing and national -- exist in Slovakia,  today's tabloid NOVY CAS says.    The Democratic Left Party (SDL) has distinguished itself by  a  stable organizational structure which made it possible to easily  form a strong bloc. This will include the Slovak Green Party,  the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia (SSDZ) and the Farmers'  Movement, the daily reports, adding that "this is simply a  professional political matter with a minimum risk."    The Hungarian bloc is united by the idea of national demands  and fear of Vladimir Meciar's return to power. This fact may be  reflected in greater parliamentary representation of the ethnic  Hungarian parties than two years ago, the paper states.    The national bloc may be the most complicated, but its  popularity is the highest, the paper notes. In addition to the  HZDS (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia), it assembles the  Slovak Farmers' Party and the nationally-orientated Slovak  National Party (SNS) and possibly the Christian Social Union  (KSU), the daily says.    The HZDS is stabilized not only with respect to popularity,  but also by its desire to regain power. However, the SNS is  searching not only for its identity, but also for an internal  foe. "It cannot offer the voter anything but a picture of the  domestic and external foes of Slovakia," the paper says, adding  that this tension in the national bloc cannot lead to  undervaluing its "force in the struggle for posts and seats in  the parliament," the paper notes.    The bloc of the "noncollectivist" parties is united by the  struggle against Meciar and by an effort to remain in government  even after the elections, "but it is divided over how to achieve  the objective." This has resulted in its division into the  centrist bloc (the Democratic Union, National Democratic  Party-New Alternative (NDS-NA), the bloc of the Christian  Democratic Movement (KDH) and the Permanent Conference of the  Civic Institute, and finally the bloc of the Democratic Party  (DS) and the Party of Slovak Entrepreneurs and Tradespeople  (SZP), the paper reports.    The elections are "in the offing," but the answer to the  question of how the mentioned right-of-the-center parties will  convince most voters about the force of their noncollectivist  policy within a short time is still unknown, the paper notes.    The Slovak right fared badly in the latest Federal  (Czechoslovak) June 1992 elections -- apart from the KDH no  party of this side of the spectrum got into parliament, the  left-wing PRAVDA says.    The paper points to DS Chairman Pavol Hagyari's effort "to  unite on the right everything which can be united" in order to  prevent the 1992 situation from being repeated. However, "the  result of this effort does not correspond to the exerted  effort," the paper notes. The DS, which has come into life by  gradual merging of the right- wing parties, has not crossed in  May the five-per-cent limit necessary for getting into  parliament, the paper adds.    The KDH offer of an "open list of candidates" implies one  seat for the DS in every constituency. "If they accept the  offer, a loss of face is looming, if they do not, they can lose  themselves because the failure in elections will make them  politically marginal figures," the paper notes.    The ostensibly accommodating KDH offer to the right-wing  parties would actually result in "their virtual demise," the  independent NARODNA OBRODA comments on the issue.    Along with the SSPZ the DS showed at the past weekend a  different way to uniting the right: They formed a joint  electoral bloc, the daily reports. This has one advantage -- it  maintains the identity of the political parties, at the same  time showing who and what structure is entering it, the paper  adds.    The KDH on the one hand, and the DS with the SZP on the  other, have presented two strategies paving the way for a single  objective -- taking advantage of every right-wing vote, the  paper notes.    "Hagyari has evidently forgotten the situation of two years  ago when the Slovak right was routed," SLOVENSKY DENNIK, close  to the KDH, says. The DS has entered the electoral competition  with a bold statement that the DS-SZP bloc has almost opened its  way to the parliament, the paper adds.    "This is a fatal error at the expense of all Slovakia which  even now will not be able to abandon the way of state  paternationalism (combination of paternalism and nationalism),  bureaucracy, and leftist fairy-tales," the paper concludes.</p>

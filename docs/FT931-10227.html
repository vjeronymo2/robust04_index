			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Schering reports fall in profits to DM262m SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals group which is undergoing a strategic re-orientation, yesterday reported a fall in pre-tax profits to DM262m (Dollars 158m) for 1992, down from DM274m a year earlier. Turnover fell 2 per cent to DM6.27bn from DM6.36bn. The group said profits had been hit by the downturn in German agrichemical business combined with the reduction in state subsidies for Berlin. This had been offset by the profit contribution from the sale of the group's industrial chemicals, natural substances and galvanising technology businesses during 1992. Schering sold the first two in November for DM660m to Witco of the US. Last month, it transferred its electro-plating business to Elf Atochem of France. The disposals accord with its strategy of concentrating on pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals and abandoning areas where it does not have market leadership. Schering said its pharmaceutical sales rose 6 per cent to DM3.91bn despite adverse exchange rate effects. Sales in the agrochemicals division dropped 16 per cent to DM1.27bn. There was no comment on the outlook for the 1992 dividend.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRS FORMS LIST MEDICARE SURTAX  </P> <P> Internal Revenue Service tax packages that are being mailed to millions of  Americans contain instructions to pay the special surtax for Medicare's  catastrophic health care program even though Congress repealed the surtax  retroactively, Rep. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles) said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Roybal asked the IRS and the Social Security Administration to send out a  special mailing advising taxpayers to ignore the line calling for calculation  of the surtax, which would have been owed by Medicare beneficiaries.  </P> <P> The IRS forms were printed before Congress voted last month to repeal the law.  President Bush signed the repeal legislation Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I am deeply concerned that the basic forms still instruct Medicare  beneficiaries to pay the . . . surtax and will confuse many Medicare  beneficiaries," Roybal said in a letter to IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg  Jr.  </P> <P> "While I understand that you are planning public service announcements . . . I  am concerned that this may be inadequate," Roybal wrote to Goldberg. "I would  suggest that you, along with the Social Security Administration, consider  sending information directly to Medicare beneficiaries notifying them of the  repeal."  </P></p>

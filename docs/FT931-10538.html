			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Treasury targets invalidity benefit THE Pounds 5.5bn budget for invalidity benefit emerged yesterday as one of the Treasury's first targets for savings as the government prepared to embark on its strategic review of spending on the welfare state. Whitehall officials confirmed that a 'bottom-up' scrutiny of spending on education and on law and order would join the analysis of social security and health budgets in the first stage of the spending review. Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, will start the process this week in preliminary meetings with Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, and Mr John Patten, the education secretary. Mr Lilley signalled at the Young Conservatives' conference in Southend that he is prepared to consider a fundamental shift towards the private provision of social security benefits, using the current system of 'contracting out' of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps) as a model. But as the implied attack on benefits prompted disquiet among MPs in the centre and on the left of the Conservative party, a Treasury minister offered assurances that there was no immediate threat to the core of the welfare state. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said on BBC radio that the government would respect the commitments on pensions and state benefits given before last year's general election. His comments were echoed by ministers in the main spending departments who insisted that the state retirement pension and child benefit were 'sacrosanct' until the next general election. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, said wide-ranging questions would be asked during the review but added: 'That is a long way from decisions having being taken.' There were suggestions that Mr Portillo and Mr Lilley - both leading members of the rightwing No Turning Back Group - wanted to use the review to 'hijack' the future direction of the Tory party. Other ministers, however, warned that the tax increases now regarded as inevitable in one or other of this year's two Budgets would be 'saleable' to rightwing Tory MPs only if they were accompanied by cuts in welfare spending. Mr Lilley indicated that one scheme under study was for individuals to make their own provision for disability in employment, allowing them to 'contract out' of the state invalidity benefit, which is projected to cost about Pounds 7bn annually by 1995. The same principle could be extended to unemployment benefit although the sums involved, about Pounds 1.5bn a year, are smaller. The Treasury has been pressing for faster savings by making invalidity benefit subject to income tax. This idea was discussed by ministers last autumn but dropped because of the likely political furore. But, with public borrowing threatening to reach Pounds 50bn next year, some ministers believe that the government must take unpopular decisions to underpin its credibility with financial markets. Mrs Bottomley told the Southend conference that she wanted more private-sector involvement in healthcare. 'The private and voluntary sectors should be regarded as partners not pariahs,' she said. The search for savings in the Home Office and education budgets meanwhile is expected to focus on the potential for breaking the link between police pay and average earnings, on increased privatisation of prison services and on a nationwide closure programme of undersubscribed schools to reduce the number of surplus places.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Light thrown on gold mystery INTERNATIONAL MONETARY Fund statistics just released throw fresh light on the mystery of how Belgium's central bank earlier this year disposed of 202 tonnes of gold from its reserves - equivalent to 11 per cent of annual output from all the western world's gold mines. It appears that the Bank of International Settlements, commonly known as the 'central bankers' banker,' helped Belgium sell the gold through the market over a period of time. The Belgian gold sale, revealed in June, raised fears that other central banks might follow suit, with a potentially devastating impact on the gold price. One senior bullion dealer said yesterday of the new evidence provided by the IMF: 'You could choose to view the sales as bullish, as the market appears to have absorbed the gold. Or it could be the nudging open of the central bank flood gates, which would be overwhelmingly bearish'. An analysis of the latest IMF figures by Reuter appears to support the theory that central banks are gradually selling down their gold holdings. It shows that central bank gold reserves have fallen to their lowest level since at least 1961. At the end of June reserves stood at 35,344 tonnes. However, some dealers pointed out that the statistics provide only a 'snapshot' of the situation at a particular moment and that the IMF figures could not be wholly reliable because the fund took reports from its members on trust. 'The IMF misses a lot,' said one trader. Nevertheless, the IMF data gives a clear picture of the Belgian gold sale via the BIS. In the space of one month - between April and May - there was an unprecedented fall of 133 tonnes in the BIS gold reserves. There was a smaller, 27-tonne, drop between March and April, a month when the gold price was 'fixed' in London at a six-year low of Dollars 334.75 an ounce. BIS gold stocks, which fell to a record low level of only 43 tonnes in May, rebounded to 220 tonnes in June. Meanwhile, Belgian gold reserves fell by 202 tonnes between May and June. There was no corresponding rise in the reserves of other central banks, indicating that the sales had mostly been absorbed into the market rather than taken on to another bank's books. Dealers said all this suggested that Belgium had given the BIS early warning that it wanted to sell its gold and that the BIS had dribbled the metal through the market over a period of time which it was still impossible to estimate. Once the gold had been sold, the BIS topped up its reserves with the Belgian gold. As for the implications for the gold price, Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, said last night: 'This is cold coffee because the market reacted to the Belgian announcement in June by going better. There is nothing in the IMF statistics to produce an immediate price reaction. But the market will still want to cogitate about the longer-term considerations.' Central Bank holdings are still equivalent to about 12.5 years' gold demand.</p>

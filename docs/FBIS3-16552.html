			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anatoliy Safonov: "Closed Cities Given New </F> Names"]    [Text] Not everyone knows that under a Russian Federation  Government directive the former closed city of Arzamas-16 was  given the official geographical name of Kremlev City at the  beginning of this year. It is here, in Nizhnyy Novgorod Oblast,  that the Russian Federation nuclear center is located, and it is  here that its honorable scientific leader, Academician Yuliy  Khariton, who recently celebrated his 90th birthday, lives. He  was the first to be awarded the title of honored citizen of the  city of Kremlev.    Other former closed and numbered cities have also received  official names: Krasnoyarsk-26 is now Zheleznogorsk,  Krasnoyarsk-45 is Zelenogorsk, Penza-19 -- Zarechnyy,  Sverdlovsk-44 -- Novouralsk, Sverdlovsk-45 -- Lesnoy, Tomsk-7 --  Seversk, Chelyabinsk-70 -- Snezhinsk, and Zlatoust-26 --  Trekhgornyy. So, address your letters according to the cities'  new names. According to data from the newspaper ATOM-PRESSA --  the publication for workers in Russia's nuclear power sector and  industry -- there are over 700,000 people in former closed  cities located on the sites of enterprises in the nuclear  munitions complex. The largest of these -- the city which is  now Seversk -- has over 100,000 inhabitants.    Right now, the production units located in these cities are  experiencing enormous difficulties. The size of the state order  has fallen sharply, insufficient budget funds are being  allocated to implement conversion programs, and there is a delay  in paying workers' wages. The sector also has its share of  unemployed -- over 3,000 people are receiving unemployment  benefit.</p>

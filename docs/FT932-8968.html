			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / How to Spend It: Hire education for DIY idiots - From chainsaws to scaffolding, the local hire shop can provide tools for every job. But watch out for snags TO EXPERIENCE the truly unbridgable gap between fantasy and reality, stop dreaming about that film star and head for your nearest tool hire shop. These emporia of (mainly) manly interests enable anyone instantly to become anything from a scaffolder to a chainsaw-wielding lumberjack. But, before you hire, be prepared for extreme disappointment and even severe personal injury. A friend hired a miniature trench digger, which looked wonderful: a sort of scaled-down cross between a Caterpillar and a JCB. He climbed into the machine, accelerated a little too viciously and flipped it over. He is still paying off the loan he required to finance a year-long relationship with a chiropractor. My local hire shop is on the school run and, every morning, I see Transit vans being filled with those bits of equipment that jobbing builders cannot afford. I do not know the injury rate among the chaps in these battered Fords, but the shop does a good trade. And I assume the tools are brought back by people who have succeeded not only in using them correctly but also have managed to protect themselves from terrible injury. At weekends, the customers change. Volvo estates line up, and men who look as though they have never lifted anything heavier than a Biro load equipment with which they intend to improve their homes and gardens. I am one of these men, and I believe everything I read in the brochure. "Makes old wooden floors look new . . . combines operator comfort and control with an outstanding performance' . . . 'for easy removal and fitting of engines' . . . 'designed to break concrete and other hard materials . . . with minimum operator fatigue,' And so on. The fantasy that grips weekend hirers is so strong that, even after a number of expensive and possibly injurious mistakes, we return to try another tool we hope will bring that unattainable improvement to our lives. A few weekends ago, I spent an entire Saturday stuffing garden cuttings into the dangerous and noisy mouth of the chipper/shredder, said to be capable of turning 3in-diameter branches into instant sawdust. 'Whenever there is a requirement for large-scale garden waste disposal,' sang the brochure, confidently, 'this powerful chipper/shredder will cope.' The reality was that it did wonderfully on dry branches but any organic matter with a moisture content higher than about 30 per cent caused great problems. First, the little petrol motor spluttered, smoke rose from the hopper, and hidden blades chattered like demented monkeys caught in the bowels of the machine. Then, with a great cough, it would die, forcing me to dismantle various bits and clear the gunge. After nearly an hour of noisy failure, I was left with a mere handful of shreddings. The bill to learn that garden shredders, no matter how powerful, are not suitable for damp waste came to about Pounds 60 (hire, VAT, insurance, delivery and petrol). I should have known better. On previous forays with hired equipment, I have failed to sand a floor (entirely my fault), failed to polish a floor (also my fault), and failed to knock down a wall with a bucking bronco device that I could hardly pick up when switched off, let alone press against the bricks when alive. The problem is two-fold. First, it is silly to think that you can do a job quickly and elegantly without some experience in using the tool you have hired. But, second, the hirer should be obliged to explain the true abilities of the tool. To take my case. most garden waste in the middle of winter is pretty damp, and it is no good flogging a shredder without warning the ignoramus waving his credit card that the machine does not like wet leaves. This need is becoming even greater as hire shops start to look for more business from weekend idiots. HSS Hire Shops now stock patio heaters - a sort of umbrella affair with an element that radiates heat so that we 'can enjoy outdoor entertainment in comfortable warmth.' They also have candy floss-makers and gas cylinders to blow up 200 balloons. HSS has acknowledged that, if it intends to pursue the leisure side of the market, it has to be understanding about people's failures. The new HSS brochure offers a money-back guarantee if the hired contraption does not work as described. I've got my money back and now have my eyes on the Mini Crawler Excavator and Dozer. Its 'tear-out force' is a mammoth 1.2 tons and it costs only Pounds 110 a day (plus VAT, transport and insurance). All I need now is to find something tough to work on.</p>

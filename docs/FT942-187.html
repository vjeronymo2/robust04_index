			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Pirate videos 'pay for terrorists' A senior Northern Ireland policeman warned yesterday that pirate videos are an important source of funding for terrorists in Northern Ireland. Det Chief Supt Derek Waites of the Royal Ulster Constabulary anti-racketeering squad told a London conference that the terrorists - who raised about Pounds 10.5m a year to fund their activities - took Pounds 1.5m a year from pirate video sales. 'The reality is that the easy profit from video piracy turns a popular entertainment into bullets and bombs,' said Mr Waites. He said the RUC had already seized more than 100,000 illicit videos in Northern Ireland. Recent co-ordinated seizures in the Irish Republic had involved a further 100,000. The RUC experience was outlined at a conference organised by the Federation Against Copyright Theft, an all-industry body designed to stamp out piracy. Mr Nick Hill, the federation's chairman, said the video market in the UK for sale and rental was now worth Pounds 1bn a year. 'What is not so well known is that the illegal video market is a major source of funding for organised crime as well as costing our business in the region of Pounds 250m a year,' said Mr Hill. Raids have uncovered as many as 180 linked video machines capable of turning out thousands of illicit copies a week - 20 per cent of them non-certificated, illegal videos which have never been submitted to the British Board of Film Censors. Often the illicit cassettes are sold at car boot sales or at about 7,000 unregulated markets regularly held in the UK. Mr David Groom, a barrister who has prosecuted a number of large-scale piracy cases, said that in virtually every case there were links with organised crime and pornography. Sometimes there were links with terrorism. He believes that the present punishments under patents-and-designs copyright legislation - a maximum of two years in prison - are inadequate given the scale of the problem. He now uses the Forgeries Act, in cases where counterfeit labels and packaging have been seized, to try to obtain stiffer penalties. Mr Reg Dixon, director-general of Fact, and a Metropolitan Police detective for nearly 30 years, called for it to be made an offence to knowingly purchase a counterfeit video. At the moment it is an offence to buy a genuine video of Aladdin knowing it to have been stolen but not to buy a cassette that you know has been illegally copied.</p>

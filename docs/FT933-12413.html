			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Nigerian military closes papers NIGERIA'S security forces have closed down five newspapers, including one owned by Mr Moshood Abiola, the unofficial winner in last month's elections, which were annulled by President Ibrahim Babangida. They also closed the local broadcasting corporation in Ogun state, Mr Abiola's home state. The closures follow comments by Mr Uche Chukwumerije, information minister, that the government would not allow the recent barrage of criticisms in the traditionally robust press to continue. The military regime is under growing pressure to hand over to a democratically elected civilian regime, but its attempt to re-run elections before the scheduled handover on August 27 has been boycotted by Mr Abiola's Social Democratic party, leaving only one party in the race. Nigeria has a large and relatively unfettered private-sector press, mainly based in Lagos. Since the law courts have been stripped of all power over the handling of the transition programme, and with Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti and two other leaders of the Campaign for Democracy detained in Abuja without trial until September, the press is one of the few focal points for opposition to the government. The independent press has mainly reflected growing public belief that the military regime has no intention of handing over power. However the most influential and respected independent daily, the Guardian, is not affected by the closure. The most damaging reports have been in the weekly news magazines, which have produced detailed analyses of the motives behind the stalling of the transition programme and of the divisions within the military hierarchy.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Private View: Refugees from a city where the wrong badge means death NATIONALITY, race, religion: sometimes these labels seem to serve only as a pretext for murder, or for war. Mebrura is a Moslem, her husband Majo a Serb. They are well-educated, middle-class refugees from Sarajevo, the besieged capital of Bosnia- Hercegovina. Mebrura Muminovic was born in Banja Luka in northern Bosnia, has an Arab name and comes from a Slav family that converted to Islam hundreds of years ago under the Turkish occupation. She has visited a mosque only once. She used to think of herself as Yugoslav. Now she calls herself Bosnian. Emotionally, she feels English. As a child she was required to declare her race: Serb, Croat or undecided. 'I came back from school and asked my father: 'What shall I say?' He said: 'Who do you sit with?' I said: 'Duna, a Croat girl.' So I said I was Croat. When I was 12 they asked me again. My mother said: 'Who are you sitting with?' I was sitting with Svetlana, so I wrote down 'Serb'. 'Finally we were able to call ourselves Yugoslavs. So I became Yugoslav for the rest of my life. I couldn't say I was Moslem because that was a religion and we weren't religious in any way.' Her husband interrupted. 'Moslem is an unhappy name. You could never have found a more tolerant version of Islam anywhere in the world than in Bosnia. These people are Slavs. They are not descendants of Turks. They are as pure Slavs as you can be in the Balkans. And all the Moslems, or most of them, consider themselves to be part of Europe. 'But a terrible thing could be taking place. Feeling betrayed, feeling left alone for slaughter, the previously docile Moslems could really become what is called fundamentalist.' Majo Topolovac was born in Sarajevo. The couple met there while working for Bosnian television. In 1969 he secured a four-year contract with the BBC World Service in London, where the pair married and where their two children were born. Because of that, they were able after returning to Sarajevo to evacuate their children in 1991. Mebrura, learning she was on two death lists, escaped last April. Majo, after months living in the TV building under shell and sniper fire, where he filed over 100 reports for the western media, secured a UN pass last August. Today the warring parties are due to meet again in Geneva to discuss the proposed cantonisation of Bosnia-Hercegovina along ethnic and religious lines. For Mebrura and Majo Topolovac, however, this is an ex post facto solution. The civil war, they say, was not caused by racial or religious tensions: those were merely the instruments deployed, with the help of sycophantic journalists, for power-grabbing by a corrupt and opportunist ex-Communist clique. The couple are vociferous in their analysis of the causes of the Yugoslav bloodbath but they seem helpless to comprehend its brutality. They concede, however, that history played some part. Majo said: 'This is what I call the grandfathers' war. You have grandfathers, especially in Serbia, with their grand- children on their knees whispering in their ears: 'We have to pay them back, these Moslems, these Turks, these Croats.' It's their distorted view of history, their unfulfilled hatreds which they learned from their own grandfathers.' His wife said: 'It all really depended on the way you were brought up. In my case, I was told by my mother that her parents were killed in front of her eyes by the Ustashe (Croat fascists) - but I was told only when I was 25 or 26. She could have brought me up hating Croats. She could have brought me up religious. But she didn't' Majo said: 'On my father's side, 42 males were killed in the last war, the youngest a child of two and a half, mostly by Ustashe but also by Chetniks (Serb nationalists). That was because my family were anti-Nazi, anti-fascist  -not really pro-communist but pro-socialist. 'Yet I was never brought up to hate. I was not told that Croats killed my father: it was the Ustashe. It's very important to draw this distinction between ordinary Serbs and these extremists. Even if 100,000 Serbs are involved in this war, what about the other 9,900,000 who are not?' Ethnic tensions were whipped up by propaganda, said Mebrura, in what she called a 'media war'. Objectivity was abandoned, journalists took sides, and the public was fed a diet of preposterous lies - for example, that Moslems had been feeding Serb babies to the lions in Sarajevo zoo. Some of these journalists, Mebrura said, should be tried as war criminals. So who started the war, I asked? 'Ask yourself who hopes to gain from it,' Majo said. 'The old opportunist members of the Communist Party. It was the only way for them to stay in power.' It was an opportunist war exploiting a peasant mentality. 'During the shelling of the water queue in Sarajevo, one magnificent old man shouted up to the hills in Serbo-Croat: 'You peasant]' He didn't despise peasants as such, what he meant was this mean mentality that allows you to shell even a water queue.' 'It's what rural life can do to civilised people,' said Mebrura. 'You call it a civil war. Actually it is a war by uncivilised people against civilised people, by peasant, illiterate crooks and gangsters attacking normal, intelligent, civilised people.' Her husband twisted his head to the side and drew his hand across his throat: 'They are peasants who kill people like killing pigs. In fact, they are trained to kill like that.' Mebrura and Majo Topolovac may be accused of having a partial view. They are a sophisticated and versatile couple. Outside her radio and television work Mebrura has trained as an actress and fashion designer and she paints in her spare time. Majo has written plays and won prizes for his children's stories. They were both admirers of Tito, though not practising Communists. Mebrura said: 'To my mind the only mistake Tito and the Communist Party made was that after the war we should have all declared ourselves Yugoslavs and had our religions if we wanted. It was ridiculous to have to declare your nationality as if it was equivalent to your religion.' Are you sorry Communism collapsed? Majo replied: 'No. I think it was a better alternative than this senseless killing. But no, it was a dead end - as practised there, anyway.' They both agreed that war was made possible by the weakness of the federation after the 1974 constitution that gave republics virtual statehood. It had been launched by opportunist politicians and crooked businessmen as a cover for their corruption, and reinforced by the confiscation of some Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.8bn) of hard-currency savings mostly accumulated by Yugoslavs working overseas. Now they are in exile themselves and drawing the dole in a cheap flat in north London. 'I think I lived here in my previous life,' said Mebrura. Majo, always the more restless and talkative, chipped in: 'We really feel we belong here. We always looked on England as the Old Country. We felt emotionally English. We are terribly pro-British and pro-Royal family. Nationality is what one feels oneself to be deep inside. It's a matter of emotional choice, like choosing one's wife. You just feel it's her. We should never have left.' I asked them whether, therefore, they understood the west's hesitancy about military intervention to break the siege of Sarajevo. 'It's totally incom- prehensible,' Mebrura said. 'In the beginning the situation was so clear that anyone in their right mind would have intervened. If they had silenced the artillery round Sarajevo last April or May that would have stopped the war.' The Serb extremists had already lost the war, said her husband, because they were overstretched and under- manned. They were now hoping to buy time to gather themselves for the push against Kosovo, possibly Macedonia, and later against Albania and Bulgaria. That would draw in Greece and Russia, Turkey and the Islamic nations - we would see an 'Orthodox jihad' against Moslems and Catholics. I pointed out that western governments were unwilling to risk their soldiers' lives in a war their electorates did not understand. Should our soldiers be ready to die under a UN flag? Mebrura answered: 'Nobody likes that soldiers are killed, but soldiers are for that. That's why they have decided it's going to be their job. I wouldn't like any soldier to die, but yes, I think so.' What has this whole experience taught you? 'I think this should be said,' Majo replied. 'Now I know that what is considered to be impossible is actually possible. No one really believed that such atrocities could take place. 'Now I know how thin this crust of what we call civilisation is, how thin and how fragile. We all thought it was impossible in Yugoslavia. We all think it's impossible in Europe. But Hitler was only 50 years ago. 'Civilisation is just thin ice and you can so easily fall through that ice into this murky and turbid water of mutual killing, which is endless if not stopped. This is the main lesson I draw.' Mebrura was reflecting while her husband spoke. She said: 'I am just saddened that cynicism overrules everywhere. I am pretty sure that 100 per cent of the world's politicians know exactly what's happened there. When I say cynical, I mean that for selfish or other reasons they don't do anything to help at least those innocent civilians. Yet how come they suddenly decide they have to intervene again in Iraq?' Do you want to go back? 'No, I don't. It's not my city any more. How can I trust anyone any more?' Do you have no feeling of guilt that you are here, safe? 'I don't feel guilt because here I can disseminate the truth, talk to ordinary people. Anyway, we had to leave. They would have killed us.' Is there nothing for you to go back to even if peace is restored? 'For me not - apart from my family and friends. The country that used to be doesn't exist any more. They have destroyed everything - even our woods where we loved to go mushrooming. They have destroyed even our woods, our beautiful mountains.' Majo spoke. 'It's not Sarajevo any more.' You have no country left to love? 'You have answered it.'</p>

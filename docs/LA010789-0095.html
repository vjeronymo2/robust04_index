			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARENA FOOTBALL CONSIDERS EXPANSION WITH TEAMS IN WASHINGTON, DENVER  </P> <P> The Arena Football League will field six teams in 1989, each playing a 12-game  schedule, and might expand to include franchises in Washington and Denver,  James Foster, league commissioner announced Friday.  </P> <P> Foster said few on-field changes will be made, but the league is trying to  restructure to stop enormous financial losses.  </P> <P> "The concerns are building a better mousetrap . . . and (finding) a better way  to run this football league," he said.  </P> <P> "Sometimes things that look good on paper don't work so well in reality,"  Foster said of the league's structure as a limited partnership.  </P> <P> Terms of the restructuring will be negotiated over the next 3 weeks.  </P> <P> Arena league teams lost "hundreds of thousands of dollars" in 1988, partly  because of problems with schedules, broadcast snags with ESPN and a drop in  publicity, Foster said.  </P> <P> The Detroit Drive won the arena league championship in 1988.  </P> <P> "There is no question there is a spirit throughout this league that people want  this game to continue," Foster said. "It takes a lot of money to make this get  off the ground and fly right."  </P> <P> The arena league played from April through July in 1988, but the 1989 season  will start later to avoid competition with playoffs in other sports, Foster  said.  </P> <P> The 1989 entries will be Detroit, Chicago Bruisers, Los Angeles Cobras, New  England Steamrollers, New York Knights and Pittsburgh Gladiators.  </P></p>

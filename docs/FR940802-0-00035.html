Feedstock Capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The next step in EPA's analysis was to determine whether sufficient feedstocks were available to permit this increase in renewable oxygenate production. According to comments received from agricultural interests, corn is the feedstock for 90 percent of current ethanol production and is expected to provide the vast bulk of the feedstock for new ethanol capacity added in the near term. Of the total 8.7 billion bushels of corn produced in an average year, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  approximately 360 million bushels (approximately 4 percent of average annual corn production) was used to produce an estimated 900 million gallons of ethanol. Therefore, the estimated 490 million gallons of new ethanol demand resulting from today's rule would increase corn demand by approximately 195 million bushels, or about 2 percent. Based on this analysis, EPA has concluded that the feedstock demands for this program can be satisfied solely with corn without significant difficulty. In addition, other feedstocks can be used to produce renewable oxygenates, including waste products from farms, dairy operations, bakeries, and the soft drink industry; from cellulosic sources such as grasses and fast-growing energy crops, and from such sources as municipal solid waste. Based on the diversity and immense supply of these potential feedstocks, EPA has concluded that feedstock supplies are sufficient to support the requirements of the renewable oxygenate program being promulgated today.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> According to information provided by John W. McClelland of USDA, ``Memorandum for Richard Wilson, Director, Office of Mobile Sources, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,'' June 20, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Ethanol Supply and Production Capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current (1993) ethanol operating production capacity nationwide has been estimated by DOE to be approximately 1.15 billion gallons. Data from IRI for 1993 estimates ethanol consumption at roughly 1.25 billion gallons, and EPA received comments from an ethanol producer that 1994 ethanol production was projected to be 1.25 billion gallons. As a result, current ethanol production would be more than sufficient to meet the requirements of today's rulemaking as long as no constraints were placed on the volume of ethanol that could be diverted from existing markets. However, as discussed above, there are several reasons why EPA considers it appropriate to minimize to the extent possible diverting ethanol from existing markets to satisfy the renewable oxygenate program. As a result, EPA examined the amount of current excess ethanol capacity and projected new ethanol capacity to determine the amount of renewable oxygenates that would be available to supply the needs of the program being promulgated today during the initial years of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that the current ethanol production capacity is as high as 1.4 billion gallons per year. One commenter representing the ethanol industry submitted a list of existing ethanol plants and their operational capacity which suggested that current ethanol production capacity is also nearly 1.4 billion gallons per year. Based on this production capacity information and on the current domestic ethanol consumption estimates, it appears that there may be approximately 150 million gallons of excess ethanol production capacity (some of which may currently be exported) currently available that could be used to supply the requirements of the renewable oxygenate program. However, not all of this production could be used to supply ethanol for blending during the winter; only approximately 80 million gallons could be supplied from current excess capacity during the winter months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to current excess capacity, a considerable amount of new capacity is expected to come on-line in the remainder of 1994, 1995, and 1996, according to information supplied by the Renewable Fuels Association and USDA. This information suggests that approximately 305 million gallons per year of additional ethanol capacity is currently under construction and will become available in 1995. (Additional amounts are possible, but more speculative.) Furthermore, plans were being made for another 304 million gallons of annual capacity to be brought on line in 1996, though much of that apparently depended on the outcome of today's rulemaking. USDA estimated similar increases in ethanol capacity over this time period. It should be noted that not all of the additional capacity available in 1995 would be available at the beginning of the year, and not all of it could be dedicated to production only during the winter months as would be required until ETBE production capacity comes on-line. A similar situation would occur in 1996. After considering these factors, EPA has concluded that approximately 93 million gallons of additional ethanol production from new capacity will be available for blending during the winter months to meet the program requirements in 1995, and an additional 157 million gallons to meet the program requirements during the winter months in 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that additional ethanol capacity also may become available from corn processors, many of whom already have feedstock processing facilities in operation and would only need to install the capital equipment necessary to ferment the starch and separate the ethanol. Such processors may be able to install ethanol production capacity relatively quickly. Based on comments received, however, EPA cannot conclude with any degree of assurance that such additional capacity will become available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the foregoing analysis, EPA believes that as much as 173 million gallons of new ethanol production can be made available during the winter months to meet 1995 program requirements and 330 million gallons during the winter months to meet the 1996 requirements. After taking into consideration the 180 million gallons of ethanol currently blended in the RFG markets during the winter months, a total of 353 million and 510 million gallons of ethanol should be available for blending during the winter months in both 1995 and 1996, respectively. As shown in the following table, absent a phase-in and ETBE production capacity, 317 million gallons of ethanol would have to be diverted from existing markets in 1995 and 160 million gallons would have to be diverted in 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

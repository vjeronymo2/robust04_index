			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Bitter harvest of disunity: Divided reformers in Russia have failed to stem the rise of extreme right and left parties The scale of the defeat for reform in Russia is potentially massive - but only potentially. Enough political scope remains for reform to continue, or at least for the achievements of the past two years to be preserved. It depends on the main actors: most of all, on the lead player, President Boris Yeltsin. The incomplete results of Russia's first democratic elections on Sunday show the Liberal Democratic party of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky in either first or close second place in the half of the State Duma, or lower house, chosen by party lists. The Communists are either second or third. A senior aide to Mr Yeltsin forecast early yesterday that the anti-reformists would command double the vote of the reformists, and while the percentages might change, the basic fact would not. Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of Russia's Choice and first deputy prime minister, has already conceded defeat of a kind - chiding himself and the other reformist parties for disunity, and commenting that: 'Frankly, there was something so comic about this figure (of Zhirinovsky), he seemed simply a kind of parody of Adolf Hitler. We didn't fully grasp how serious was his threat.' The threat from the neo-fascists and the Communists is in one sense aggravated because they - especially Mr Zhirinovsky - have no clear programme. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko group, which is likely to be the fourth-largest party in the parliament, and who thus can claim to be the second reformist party, said that 'their programmes are neither for the market nor against the market. They are the most dangerous kind of demagogues.' Mr Zhirinovsky, displaying once more the demonic energy which appears to power him beyond the laws of thermodynamics, peppered the media yesterday with interviews demanding for his party the chairmanship of the lower house, declaring his party's readiness to enter government, and forecasting Russian expansion as far as the Indian Ocean. He must be very pleased. For the past two years he has run an organisation whose only well-known member is himself, and which has never entered into coalitions with other nationalists. His steady belief in his own talents, energy and mission to gain political power, coupled with a machine-gun wit and breathtaking territorial claims, does indeed call up a vision of Adolf Hitler returning for the second time as farce - but a farce which still has the capacity to transform itself back into tragedy. Mr Yeltsin, it would seem, has two alternatives in face of this surge from the extreme right and left. First, he can broadly continue his programme - as Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, yesterday urged him to do by showing 'political will' in face of the nationalist surge. This would mean retaining reformers like Mr Fyodorov, Mr Gaidar and Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister, for privatisation; continuing to support their economic plans; and attempting to steer legislation through parliament by putting together coalitions issue by issue. This is possible, in theory. The passing of the draft constitution has made Mr Yeltsin one of the most powerful elective presidents in the world, with the ability to issue decrees without any let or hindrance by parliament. Apart from his powers, he has shown in the past two years no inhibition about using patronage to buy over those whom he cannot persuade. Further, the composition of the parliament is largely non-party: members of the 178-strong Federation Council, or upper house, are elected from the regions and republics on the basis more of their local status than their ideology. The same, to a slightly lesser extent, applies to the half of the lower house elected on a first-past-the-post system. The impression gained by many foreign observers was, first, that most people were confused by the complex voting papers and, second, they voted on name recognition, not party affiliation. The result is likely to reproduce what was evident in the previous Supreme Soviet - a bolota, or marsh, in which the deputies roll this way and that. The threat is that the marsh hardens in opposition to a president and a government which ignore their wishes. However, Mr Yeltsin's instincts and history may lead him in a second direction, that of the presidential figure who wishes to remain above the conflict by constructing a government which draws its membership from a wider constituency of views than the present one - with ministers either coming directly from the neo-fascist and Communist parties, or reflecting their position. The first signs are that he will go this way. Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Mephistophelean figure who is his press secretary, wasted little time in telling the Interfax news agency that there was much in the fascists' and communists' electoral programmes which 'quite corresponds to the social aspect of the president's policies - that is, the social policy of the state, patriotism, making Russia great'. The latter two appeal to Mr Zhirinovsky, and to Mr Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist leader who has repeatedly said he is a Russian nationalist before he is a communist internationalist. However, Mr Kostikov's bland statement masks the obvious question - how far does Mr Yeltsin's embrace of patriotism have to go before it finds common ground with a neo-fascist party whose leader has claimed Poland and Finland for a renewed Russian empire? Even Mr Zyuganov was quoted yesterday as saying that he did not go down the same road as Mr Zhirinovsky: 'We are realists.' However, a lurch towards a harder-edged nationalism seems inevitable, resulting in harsher treatment of the former Soviet republics to bring them into line. This would confront impoverished Ukraine, in deep debt to Russia and possessing missiles, a naval fleet and a territory (Crimea) which Russia wants, with the terrible dilemma of knuckling under or attempting to withstand a colder blast from the east than it has been used to since Mikhail Gorbachev came to power eight years ago. It would also threaten the fragile relations with Latvia and Estonia, where Russian troops remain; and make clear to the Central Asian and Caucasian states that their leash is still held by Moscow, and that it is shortening. Were Mr Yeltsin to sway in this direction, it is all but certain that the reformers would feel constrained to leave the cabinet, or would be asked to do so. They have had only mixed success this past year; and though Mr Fyodorov has made much of keeping the last quarter's budget within tight limits, he appears to have done so only by cutting or deferring expenditure which will have to be put through in this coming year. Only if they have an even more solid base for support than they have enjoyed so far could they hope to deepen reforms: and they evidently do not have that. Their tone yesterday was mournful: Mr Chubais has been especially emphatic that 'I will not shake fascists by the hand.' The next stage of economic reform was always going to be the hardest. Whether it was to be driven by Mr Gaidar's insistence on tight money, or Mr Yavlinsky's preference for demonopolisation and faster privatisation, vast unemployment is likely to burst into the open as practically bankrupt enterprises go belly-up and cast their workers out to fend for themselves. Giant plants - like Uralmash engineering in Ekaterinburg, the Vaz car plant in Nizhny Novgorod and the Zil truck and car plant in Moscow - are now working short time and juggling with huge debts. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, poised to support and to lend to a reformist government, are now high and dry. A planned timetable of meetings designed to drum up a new surge of aid for Russia, including a summit between Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton in Moscow next month, is now in doubt. There has been a real advance in these elections: Russia has succeeded in adopting a constitution which proclaims it an advanced democratic state committed to private property and the rule of law. But the reality of these grand phrases is still in suspension.</p>

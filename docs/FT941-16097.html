			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Backbenchers wonder who will be next: 'Back to basics' debacle is 'a little flurry', says PM - Criminal justice bill is outlined The prime minister may have dismissed the controversy over his 'back to basics' policy as 'a little flurry', but in the Commons tea rooms and bars backbenchers could talk of little else. As MPs returned to Westminster after the Christmas recess, many were wondering who was going to be the next victim of the scandals that have slammed the brakes on the careers of Mr Tim Yeo, the former environment minister and Mr Alan Duncan, the former parliamentary private secretary to health minister Dr Brian Mawhinney. A throughly fed-up parliamentary private secretary said it was now impossible for MPs to be seen out alone with anyone apart from their wives. 'It's now got to the stage that there could be rumours about my sexuality if I dine out with a male friend. That is not what 'back to basics' was meant to be about,' he said angrily. In the fraught atmosphere, a Scottish Conservative backbencher believed he may have narrowly escaped becoming the lastest casualty when he was photographed by a journalist leaving a lunchtime function with a woman half his age. She was his research assistant. A senior Tory backbencher, a close friend of the MP, said the story illustrated how 'back to basics' was in danger of being engulfed in personal scandals. 'If the media go to that length to catch MPs out, then of course they will find politicians who have erred and we will all look ridiculous.' Tory MPs' views mosly fall into three categories: The moralising tendency. This was best illustrated by Mr David Shaw, the rightwing MP for Dover, who said he was not in favour of witch hunts but warned ministers to examine their consciences before speaking out on 'back to basics'. Mr Shaw, who has attended Republican conventions in the US where the moral majority has held sway for more than a decade, believes MPs cannot divorce morality from politics. 'Many businessmen,' he said, 'would not employ people of low moral standards, employees who womanise or who drink too much. Why should politicians be any different?' A former trade minister, Mr Edward Leigh, appeared to go further in urging the government to 'attack the permissive society funded by the state'. He said there had to be a moral dimension and ministers should 'stick with it' in spite of the uproar over errant MPs' behaviour. The frightened tendency. A nervous backbencher, whose eyes kept darting across the members' lobby as MPs left the chamber following prime ministers questions, urged the government to 'put a lid on this awful pandora's box'. He said the moralising of some cabinet members had given the tabloids the justification they were looking for to report on private lives. 'Where will it stop?' he asked, concerned that reporters are asking too many embarrassing personal questions. The 'prime minister is to blame' tendency. 'The policy is fine' said one querulous minister, 'the prime minister's handling of it is not.' He thought that Mr Major should not have let cabinet members interpret the policy in different ways. Another parliamentary private secretary gave a sigh when asked what had gone wrong. 'If only John Major had the bottle to sack Tim Yeo when it was known he had fathered a child outside marriage we may not have got into this terrible mess.' Some MPs believe the government will survive the crisis as long as there are no more revelations. Others predict the scandal will continue to run unless the policy is redefined. It was left to Mr Leigh to sum up the mood of the pessimists when he predicted the government would get itself together only to stumble into another crisis.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Best June on record for unit trust sales - At a glance Unit trusts had their best June on record, with net sales of Pounds 1.1bn - 50 per cent up on Pounds 726m in May. The June figure was almost 80 per cent higher than that for June last year, when net sales totalled Pounds 610m. Less than half the net sales last month were to the retail sector - the lowest proportion so far this year - with the rest bought by institutions, the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds said. The best-selling sectors among retail investors were UK growth, followed by UK equity income and international growth. Net sales of unit-trust personal equity plans were Pounds 1.11bn for the second quarter, down from Pounds 1.55bn for the first quarter, which is the traditionally busy end-of-tax-year sales period.</p>

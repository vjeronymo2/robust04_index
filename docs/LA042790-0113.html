			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FORMER POLICE CHIEF APPOINTED TO OLD POST  </P> <P> Former Police Chief Robert Collins, 66, has been appointed to his old post in  Monterey Park, replacing Kenneth Hickman, who resigned in March amid a  controversy over control of the Police Department.  </P> <P> Collins, a 34-year veteran of the force, was chief from 1987 to 1989, replacing  another chief, Jon D. Elder, who had left as part of a local political  firestorm.  </P> <P> "He's really well respected in the community and within the police force," City  Manager Mark Lewis said of Collins.  </P> <P> Hickman, a former Los Angeles police commander and one of the nation's few  chiefs with a doctorate, had replaced Collins when Collins retired. Hickman  resigned after the Monterey Park Police Officers Assn. voted no confidence in  him.  </P></p>

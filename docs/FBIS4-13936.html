			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on 22 </F> April, place not given -- recorded in Hebrew with Arabic  subtitles]    [Text] [Rabin] It is inconceivable that a political party  [Likud] which had agreed to return everything in exchange for  peace now claims it is possible to attain peace merely in  exchange for peace. This is absurd, especially in light of the  fact that these people are responsible for returning everything  and uprooting all Israeli presence in order to achieve peace.  Do they believe that by some hocus pocus we will be able to  achieve peace with another Arab country by exchanging peace for  peace? Not even one iota of the Sinai has remained in our  hands. I will do everything to avoid such a price for peace.    [Israel Television in Arabic correspondent Menashe Bakhar]  Are you preparing Israeli public opinion for painful  concessions on the Golan Heights in the near future?    [Rabin] Look, in the negotiations with Syria, Jordan, and  Lebanon we are not talking about interim arrangements. The  letter of invitation to the Madrid conference referred to an  interim arrangement only in relation to the Palestinians. We  are not looking for interim arrangements with the Arab states,  but rather for peace treaties. We have very little territorial  problems vis-a-vis Jordan and Lebanon. With Syria, on the other  hand, we have such problems indeed. I have always said that I  personally, and the Labor Party of which I am a member, are  ready to make territorial compromises. We have always said so,  but previously these statements were not concrete, because Syria  was not prepared to enter peace negotiations. Syria has started  evincing willingness to enter the path of negotiations only in  the wake of the changes in the international balance of power,  the termination of the Cold War, and following the Gulf crisis.  Generally speaking, I can say that Arab parties enter peace  negotiations with us only after they reach the conclusion that  they can get nothing from us by violent measures, whether this  means all-out war or terrorism.    [Unidentified correspondent, in English] Regarding the talks  in Cairo, there has been a lot of optimism about an agreement in  early May. What new progress has been made, and what obstacles  still lie ahead?    [Rabin, in English] There is a progress in the negotiations  in Cairo, less in Paris on the economic issues. Therefore I  believe that we are moving ahead. We are trying to reach an  agreement which is acceptable to us as soon as possible. But I  would not set any clear-cut date. I hope that by mid-May we  might reach an agreement. The real problem is to reach an  agreement in details. We need to go through all the details to  prevent any misunderstandings once it is implemented. The  implementation will take two or three weeks once the agreement  will be signed.</p>

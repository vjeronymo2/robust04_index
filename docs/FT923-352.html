			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / BBC cuts ordered to counter overspend BBC Television yesterday said it was facing a Pounds 20m budget overspend because of 'flaws' in its 'financial allocation process' and that it would have to make cuts in 'housekeeping, premises, capital investment and programmes', Gary Mead writes. Sir Michael Checkland, director-general, has instructed BBC Television to make cuts of almost 3 per cent to stay within its Pounds 700m annual budget. The BBC could not say precisely where the cuts would fall, but it said 'housekeeping, premises, capital investment and programmes' would all be affected, in that order. The corporation would not be drawn on the nature of the defects in the accounting system. 'What we are talking about here is how the money within the television services is shared out across the two networks. It is not producers overspending their budgets,' it said. The government is due next week to publish a green paper on the future of the BBC.</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Fresh row looms over pension funds: Lucas pensioners seek return of surplus; British Rail must repay Pounds 25m LUCAS Industries and British Rail have come under fire for their handling of pension fund surpluses. Pensioners of Lucas Industries have issued a High Court writ against the trustees of the fund, seeking the return of Pounds 150m transferred to the company last November, while British Rail has been ordered to repay Pounds 25m, which it had clawed back from its pension fund. Both organisations took advantage of the 1988 Income and Corporation Taxes Act, which says if pension fund assets exceed its liabilities by more than 5 per cent it must reduce the surplus or lose its tax-exempt status. The question of who owns any pension fund surplus - generally created by heavy investment in the late 1970s followed by booming stock markets in the 1980s - has become increasingly contentious in the wake of the Maxwell scandal. Pensioners feel entitled to some of the money, since it is a form of deferred pay consisting partly of their contributions. However, companies can argue that since they effectively underwrite any potential deficiency, they should benefit from any surplus. The legal change in 1988 allowed Lucas pension fund trustees to change the deeds so some of the surplus could be transferred to the company, said a spokesman for Lucas. The payment of Pounds 150m to Lucas Industries - reduced to Pounds 90m after 40 per cent tax was levied - was approved last November by the Occupational Pensions Board. The transfer allowed the company to announce profits for the six months to January of Pounds 90.2m and an interim dividend of 2.1p. At the time of the transfer, the pension fund had assets valued at Pounds 1.7bn, with a Pounds 600m surplus, now reduced to Pounds 225m. According to a spokesman for Lucas Industries, the trustees acted 'with the support of the trade unions and the vast majority of employees and pensioners.' But Mr Douglas Taylor and 69 other beneficiaries of the fund have issued a summons against Lucas Pensions Trust (the trustees), asking the High Court to decide whether the trustees in fact acted lawfully. British Rail's accounts in 1992-1993 will include an exceptional item of Pounds 25m, which it has to repay to its Pounds 7bn pension fund. At its last pension fund review in 1990, British Rail decided to begin a contribution holiday for the company and staff. When the decision was implemented in September 1991, the holiday was backdated to the start of the financial year in April 1991. In fact, such a claw-back is not allowed under trust law, according to a British Rail spokesman.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the head of the Palestinian  negotiating team, has said that progress was achieved in the  talks but added that some issues remain unresolved. Speaking to  journalists following a session of talks that ended early this  morning in Cairo, Sha'th said the talks would resume on Tuesday  [29 Mar] following consultations by the two delegations in  Tunisia and Israel.    General Amnon Shahaq, who heads the Israeli delegation to  the  talks, speaking following a 14-hour session of talks, said a  joint document was formulated but there are still several points  of disagreement.    PLO sources last night said that Israel agreed in principle  to a limited presence of international observers and the  operation of joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols in Hebron.    [In a related report, Cairo MENA in Arabic at 0755 GMT on 25  March cites Dr. Sha'th as saying: "Considerable progress took  place in the negotiations with the Israelis over the past two  days in Cairo but there are still some points that need to be  worked out."    [The same MENA report adds: "Sources close to the  negotiations say that Israel has agreed to the deployment of 100  Norwegian observers armed with light weapons in Hebron."]</p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 KILLED, 2 INJURED AS CAR HITS POWER POLE IN CARSON  </P> <P> Three young men were killed and two were injured, one seriously, when their  speeding car slammed into a power pole in Carson Wednesday night and split in  half from the impact.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies identified the victims as four male teen-agers and one man  in his early 20s, but did not release their names.  </P> <P> A witness who was jogging in the area told investigators a blue Hyundai was  traveling south at 8:33 p.m. in the 19000 block of Wilmington Avenue at up to  70 m.p.h. when it went out of control and hit the pole, said Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Sgt. Lamar Bleavins.  </P> <P> The driver and four passengers were thrown from the car on impact, he said.  Three of the men were pronounced dead at the scene. The two others were taken  to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Bleavins said, one with serious injuries and the  other with cuts and bruises.  </P> <P> Jogger Louis Evans, 21, saw the car speeding south on Wilmington Avenue. "I  thought they were horsing around," he said. The driver then braked sharply, and  the car hit the utility pole and "twisted up like it was cheap paper," Evans  said.  </P> <P> Elizabeth Poole of Compton said she was picking up cans and bottles along the  edge of James Anderson Jr. Memorial Park, when she saw one passenger thrown  free of the wreckage. He scrambled to his feet and walked back to the car  dazed, she said.  </P> <P> Authorities found the man wandering in the park looking for his shoe, which had  been thrown clear during the crash.  </P> <P> In a separate high-speed traffic fatality hours earlier, a 23-year-old  suspected drunk driver who led sheriff's deputies on an 80-m.p.h. chase through  Norwalk was fatally injured when he lost control of his car and it smashed into  a tree, authorities said.  </P> <P> Ruben Veliz Carrera of Norwalk was pronounced dead at Norwalk Community  Hospital at 2:12 a.m., said Sgt. Robert Stoneman, a spokesman for the Los  Angeles County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Carrera was "weaving erratically" on Alondra Boulevard when deputies tried to  stop him about 12:40 a.m., Stoneman said. About two miles later, he car lost  control of the car, which sheared off a light pole and struck a tree, Stoneman  said.  </P></p>

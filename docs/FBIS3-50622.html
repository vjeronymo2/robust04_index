			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The persistent aggressive language used by some  executive branch members against Congress reveals a lack of  understanding of the process we are undergoing. This was stated  by [National Encounter] Senator Diego Abente, who thus referred  to the defense minister's comment that the president of the  Republic will continue to make "abusive" use of his right to  veto laws.    Sen. Abente said: "The veto is a constitutional tool that  must be used moderately and with prudence. It may not be used  only when the executive branch deems a draft bill  unconstitutional."    Throughout history, this tool has been used in the world  when  the executive branch and congress' interpretations differ on how  to solve a specific problem. [passage omitted]</p>

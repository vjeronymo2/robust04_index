			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Magic Johnson drops plan to resume career EARVIN 'Magic' Johnson, the basketball superstar who has the Aids virus, announced yesterday he was giving up plans to resume his playing career. A statement released by his Los Angeles Lakers team said he was retiring for good because 'it has become obvious the various controversies surrounding my return are taking away both from basketball as a sport and the larger issue of living with HIV for me and the many people affected'. His reference to 'various controversies' reflects growing opposition to his playing by fellow professionals fearful of infection. Johnson, one of the dominant players of his generation, first retired last November after disclosing he had the HIV virus. He returned to play in the US Olympics 'dream team' which won the gold medal in Barcelona and has performed in most of the Lakers exhibition games before the regular season, which begins later this week. On his first retirement he was appointed to the presidential commission on Aids but resigned two months ago, accusing the Bush administration of paying insufficient attention to the problem.</p>

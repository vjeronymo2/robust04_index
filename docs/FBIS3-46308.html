			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511): "How the </F> Sino-U.S. Textile Accord Was Reached"]    [Text] Beijing, 25 Jan (XINHUA) -- Seventeen January was a  day that drew people's attention. It was on this very day that  the tense two days of textile negotiations between China and the  United States were scheduled to end and when the drastic  reduction of China's textile export quota, as announced by the  U.S. Government at the beginning of the month, was to take  effect. International public opinion has believed that the U.S.  unilateral action of reducing China's textile export quota, if  enforced, will trigger a trade war between the two countries  which might result in tense Sino-U.S. relations. Thus, the  success or failure of this round of Sino-U.S. textile trade  talks carried major significance.    The text of the Memorandum of Understanding on the Sino-U.S.  Textile Trade Agreement was subsequently signed by both sides at  1740 [0940 GMT], less than half an hour before the U.S.  negotiators' scheduled flight departure time. The concessions  made by both sides on the premise of preserving their own  interests have averted an outcome not beneficial to either side,  and these have produced results satisfactory to both.  <H5>  Focus and Divergence </H5>   China has been the largest supplier of textiles and garments  to the United States, with an annual export value amounting to  several billion dollars and representing 13 percent of the  textiles and garments sold in the United States. The quantity  of Chinese textiles and garments to be exported to the United  States are subject to the limits of U.S. import quotas to be  negotiated and agreed upon before they are recorded in the  textile agreement.    With the termination of the third Sino-U.S. bilateral  textile  trade agreement on 31 December 1993, China and the United  States, from September through December 1993, held three rounds  of unsuccessful talks in a bid to conclude a fourth agreement.  The focus of disputes was the question of "illegal  transshipments."    The so-called illegal transshipments refer to illegal trade  carried out fraudulently to avoid quota procedures binding both  exporting and importing countries. The United States has  alleged the serious illegal transshipment of China's textile  exports to the United States. For example, China-made garments  bearing the labels of another country or basically China-made  garments transported to a certain country for simple processing  were sold to the United States as local products, thus avoiding  the quota binding China and the United States.    It should be pointed out that such illegal acts were carried  out by a handful of enterprises in China. In fact, concerning  the question of illegal transshipments, the stand, interests,  and regulatory objectives of both China and the United States  coincide. Illegal transshipments have not only upset the United  States' import quotas in terms of protecting its own textile  industry but have also disrupted China's export order, lowered  the prices of its exported textiles, disturbed its export  channels, and resulted in it being unable to guarantee its  product quality.    China and the United States diverged on the following three  major points: First, the United States maintained that about $2  billion worth of Chinese textiles have been illegally  transshipped to the United States, while China held that,  despite the existence of illegal transshipments, the actual  amount was not that high. Second, the United States pressed for  a mandatory reduction of quotas, based on "substantial  information", as a punishment, while China insisted that a  punitive reduction, if permitted, must be based on the facts and  should be examined in consultations to avoid unilateral action.  Third, the United States emphasized that cracking down on  illegal transshipments is the sole responsibility of the Chinese  side, while China pointed out that both sides must be  responsible in a common crackdown because these illegal  transshipments involved not only Chinese exporters but also U.S.  importers and businessmen of a third country who engaged in  illegal activities.    As both sides held fast to their views, no agreement was  reached in the first three rounds of negotiations. On 6 January  1994, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor hastily announced  that if both sides were unable to reach an agreement in the  fourth round of negotiations, the United States would, beginning  17 January 1994, reduce Chinese textile import quotas in 1994 by  25 to 35 percent.  <H5>  Mutual Concession; Mutual Benefit; Mutual Satisfaction </H5>   Representatives of the Chinese and the U.S. Governments  began  their fourth round of negotiations in Beijing on 15 January.  Accompanying the U.S. negotiators to Beijing were  representatives of U.S. textile manufacturers, importers,  retailers, and consumers' associations. Jennifer Hillman,  leader of the U.S. delegation and chief textile negotiator for  the U.S. Trade Representative's Office, said that they were here  to supervise her negotiations.    As both sides were well aware, both parties' interests would  be seriously hurt if negotiations were to break down again.  Hence, from the very beginning, both sides were hoping to reach  an agreement and the atmosphere was frank and pragmatic.    The negotiations were tense and tough. On the first day, Shi  Guangsheng, vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation, invited his American counterparts to dine  and then turned the dining table into a negotiating table,  enabling both sides to better understand the other's flexibility  limit. Negotiations on 16 January, a Sunday, adjourned at 0100  hour in the morning. With talks entering a crucial stage by  noon on 17 January, neither side had the heart to eat a formal  lunch and merely filled their stomachs with hamburgers.    Both China and the United States eventually made the  necessary concessions:    China -- agreed to accept a textile quota reduction of up to  three times the amount of textiles if conclusive evidence proves  Chinese enterprises' involvement in illegal textile  transshipments; accepted major adjustments to automatic  increases of some categories of textile quotas as proposed by  the U.S. side; agreed to factory visits by personnel from the  U.S. Mission in China after obtaining the Chinese side's  consent, permission from the enterprises to be visited, and on  condition that they be accompanied by personnel from the Chinese  side; and agreed to hold consultations over the imposition of a  limit on silk products.    The United States -- renounced the reduction of Chinese  textile import quota by 25 to 35 percent; withdrew the original  discretionary clause in the handling of the illegal textile  transshipment problem; agreed to a 1.63 percent increase margin  for 1995/1996; and agreed to retain the flexible clause on  interchangeability of quotas for different categories of  textiles.    Mutual concessions lead to mutual benefits. The agreement,  reached on the basis of mutual concessions, has helped both  sides avoid major losses. China will not be forced to lower its  annual textile exports worth more than U.S.$1 billion and the  American importers, retailers, and consumers will avoid losses  amounting to tens of billions of dollars as a result of drastic  import reduction of Chinese textiles. Viewing the situation as  a whole, if a fierce trade war were to erupt between the world's  largest developed and developing nations, their economic losses  would be unmeasurable.    This agreement also signifies that, as trading partners, a  party should not ignore the views of another by indiscriminately  and unilaterally handling contradictions and problems emerging  from bilateral trade. As Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign  trade and economic cooperation, told Chief U.S. negotiator  Ambassador Hillman after the signing of the agreement: The best  way to solve problems is through dialogue and consultations on  an equal footing; any attempt to exert pressure will be in vain  and will only lead to a trade war.    Ambassador Hillman also acknowledged that the adoption of a  formula deemed fair to both sides has resolved differences and  led to an agreement satisfactory to both.   <H5>    The Chinese People Certainly Mean What They Said </H5>   The Chinese Government has always attached great importance  to the question of illegal transshipments, a focus of the  Sino-U.S. textile trade talks.    As far as strengthening propaganda and education among  enterprises engaged in export and production and perfecting  legal systems are concerned, the relevant departments have  successively handed down more than a dozen documents, explicitly  banning illegal textile transshipments. Serious actions were  also taken to crack down on such illegal activities. In  particular, the "Provisions on Banning Illegal Textile  Transshipments," jointly formulated and promulgated in March  1993 by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation,  the General Administration of Customs, the State Administration  for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities, emphasized  both prevention and crackdown. Three national conferences were  convened in early 1991 and in early and late 1993 to  specifically thrash out related matters.    On the organizational side, in July 1992, China set up a  group to investigate illegal textile transshipment problems.  With participation by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation, the General Administration of Customs, the  State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export  Commodities, and with Shi Guangsheng, vice minister of the  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, as chairman,  the group led a nationwide campaign against illegal textile  transshipments. Nationwide on-the-spot investigations were  conducted in September 1992 and May, July, and August 1993 to  identify problems and plug loopholes.    In late June 1992, in a bid to strengthen cooperation with  U.S. Customs for joint action, China submitted to the United  States a proposed draft of "the Sino-U.S. Memorandum of  Understanding on the Joint Prevention of Illegal Textile  Transshipment (Draft]." China also instituted investigations  of enterprises suspected of involvement in illegal transshipment  activities and, once confirmed with conclusive evidence, took  stern measures against them, including punishing those who were  responsible and exposing their activities. So far, China has  punished 14 China-based enterprises dealing with export and  production, terminated trade ties with three foreign  enterprises, and closed down a foreign enterprise's office in  China.    It should be pointed out that, after all, Chinese  enterprises  engaged in this sort of illegal activities are extremely few in  number. Of the 69 illegal textile transshipment cases the  United States handed over to China between April 1990 and 16  January 1994 for full investigation, only five out of the 47  investigated cases were confirmed, the rest lacked full or  sufficient evidence.    Vice Minister Shi Guangsheng, leader of the Chinese  negotiating team, emphatically pointed out: This handful of  enterprises, which sought their own benefits at the expense of  national interests, have upset the normal Sino-U.S. trade order;  their illegal acts must be resolutely and sternly dealt with.  From now on, enterprises involved in illegal transshipment will  face quota reductions -- for serious cases -- withdrawal of  operating rights, and -- for those held directly responsible --  legal consequences.    He further urged governments of various localities and  departments in charge of foreign trade to attach greater  importance to this issue and do their part in protecting  national interests. He said that areas found to be involved in  illegal transshipments will face punishment of more than three  times the quota reductions.    The Chinese people certainly mean what they said; when a  promise is made, it will be firmly honored.</p>

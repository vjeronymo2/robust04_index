			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / EC finance ministers agree tighter checks on financial institutions European Community finance ministers have agreed to impose tighter checks on banks, insurance companies and investment firms to avoid another BCCI-type scandal, agencies report from Brussels. The new rules oblige bank auditors to report any wrong-doing they spot in credit institutions and any parent company, whatever its activity. Financial institutions will have to have their head office in the same EC country as their registered office so supervising authorities can control them. The rules widen the list of bodies entitled to access to confidential information on such institutions to barristers and accountants when making official inquiries. The legislation still needs European Parliament approval.</p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIDS VIGIL CONTINUES ON COUNTY-USC PLAZA  </P> <P> On day six of a week-long vigil, about 30 AIDS patients and supporters stayed  camped Thursday on the cement plaza in front of County-USC Medical Center in an  attempt to call attention to a lack of public medical facilities designated for  treatment of AIDS.  </P> <P> Being close with those who are sympathetic to what AIDS patients are  experiencing is what the vigil is about, said David Reid, a member of the AIDS  Coalition To Unleash Power.  </P> <P> About a dozen community organizations have participated, Reid said. For each  day of the vigil a different group designates an overnight watch crew and about  30 people pass the nights together in tents, he said, adding that rallies  during the day and "candlelight meditations" in the evenings have drawn groups  of up to 350.  </P> <P> Since the start of the vigil, talks between ACT UP and county supervisors have  not produced any timetable for when money and facilities will be designated,  Reid said.

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LEAD IN WATER OF EAST COAST SCHOOLS CITED  </P> <P> Despite a 1988 federal law, toxic lead can still be found in many school  drinking fountains in the Mid-Atlantic region, a report said Saturday.  </P> <P> In a recent report, the Inspector General's Office of the Environmental  Protection Agency found that the EPA, states and local school districts are  doing a poor job of implementing the laws, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.  </P> <P> "Our findings confirm that harmful amounts of lead exist in drinking water  provided by schools," the report said.  </P> <P> The study covers schools in the EPA's Region 3, which includes Pennsylvania,  Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia and Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> "We had a law passed in 1988 to protect kids in school from lead, and the EPA  and the states have dropped the ball," said Erik Olsen, a lawyer with the  National Wildlife Federation.  </P> <P> Exposure to the heavy metal can impair a child's neurological development and  learning ability. Contamination has been a problem in some older models of  water coolers that have lead-lined tanks, and the EPA has estimated that as  many as 250,000 children nationwide may be drinking contaminated water.  </P> <P> The report said one unidentified Maryland school district found elevated levels  of lead in 32% of its water coolers, with some found to have lead levels five  times higher than the EPA standard.  </P> <P> An EPA spokesman said the agency has been constrained in enforcing the Lead  Contamination Control Act by a lack of resources and the way the law was  written.  </P> <P> The law sets no penalties that could be levied to require compliance, and  Congress has not allocated money to enforce it.  </P></p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Hurd tells EU to drop grand plans Mr Douglas Hurd yesterday called on Britain's European partners to drop grand ambitions for further institutional change in the European Union and commit themselves to making the present administration work. In a speech directed as much at the warring factions in his own party as at EU members, Mr Hurd said the 12 should set as its first priority 'the integrity and effectiveness of administration in Europe'. The EU should do less but do it better. He called for less legislation, better value for money, a fight against fraud and the even application of EU law. He said governments 'have for too long concentrated on designing future stages of European co-operation'. He told the Belgian Institute of International Affairs in Brussels: 'The people of Europe have the right to expect those charged with the administration of Europe to concentrate not just on the historical importance of the European endeavour but on the nitty-gritty which will decide whether it works.' Mr Hurd called for other EU justice and home affairs ministers to back a new British initiative designed to combat criminal fraud against the Union's institutions. He urged the European Commission and parliament to impose stricter standards of financial control, and asked other governments to 'control the instinct to throw legislation at problems'. The voters of Europe expected mistakes and abuses to be put right. 'The true European vision in 1994 lies in making a success of what we have already agreed and extending that success to other parts of Europe,' he said. Mr Hurd's aides emphasised that the speech was not intended to provide a complete picture of the government's approach to the next stage of European development. The foreign secretary will take up a number of other themes in the approach to the June elections for the European parliament. But the emphasis on pragmatism and the distinct scepticism about European 'vision' were interpreted at Westminster as part of a series of concerted moves to unite the Conservative party around a common stance for June's poll. It was reinforced by Mr John Major who insisted yesterday that the Conservatives would be the only British party in the June elections to fight on a platform opposing greater centralisation of powers in Brussels. He told BBC Radio: 'There is no appetite in the Conservative party whatever for a centralist Europe.' Distancing Conservative MEPs from their alliance in Strasbourg with members of the pro-federalist European Peoples Party, the prime minister added: 'We will fight the election on a distinctly British Conservative manifesto for the future of Europe.' But there were clear signs last night that the attempts to assuage Tory Euro-sceptics had annoyed leading members of the party's pro-European wing. Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, won the support of a number of leading backbenchers in taking Mr Hurd to task for attacking the institutions of the EU. Sir Edward asked: 'What is the point of the foreign secretary being so critical of the Union of which we are members when he has to work with all the other 11 members of the Union?'</p>

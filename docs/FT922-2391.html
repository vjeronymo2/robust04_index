			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Survey of Madeira (8): Smiles on the bankers' faces - Offshore Financial Services OF ALL offshore activity, banking and services have developed fastest. Though the number of banks is still relatively small - there are 20 banks and one insurance company - they have attracted a considerable volume of business. And if the smiles on most bankers' faces is anything to go by, it has been exceptionally good business. No-one will say how much is deposited or what is the amount of funds the banks are managing for individuals and private companies, but most bankers agree that the volume of business has been well above their expectations. Success has brought its own problems. The financial authorities in Lisbon have been concerned that Portuguese resident companies have used the offshore centre to reduce their tax liabilities. The government is planning legislation to close loopholes for resident companies, but this will not affect non-residents. Nevertheless, the issue has delayed other legislation as well as exacerbating tensions between the Madeiran authorities and the capital on the mainland. What local banks fear is that the dispute over taxation could undermine efforts to establish the centre internationally, and bankers stress this is a domestic matter that involves only Portuguese residents. 'All these mutterings about changing the rules are not helpful,' says one banker. For the time being international interest is growing. 'We've had lots of inquiries from Latin America, especially Brazil and from eastern Europe,' says Mr Lino Bento, operations executive at the offshore branch of Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa (BESCL), Portugal's third largest bank. 'For many investors the offshore centre is a door opening on to business opportunities in Europe,' he says. Portugal's decision to bring the escudo into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS), has also encouraged investors because it enhances exchange rate stability. A high proportion of investments also comes from other offshore centres such as Guernsey and the Isle of Man. 'Investors don't want to put all their eggs into one basket, and Portugal's EC membership is an advantage over other locations. Investors tend to start with small investments at first, increasing them as they become more familiar and confident with Madeira,' he says. Other bankers confirm these trends. 'Interest in Madeira is growing, and it is beginning to feature in the international scene,' says Mr Anthony Addis, head of international private banking at Banco Comercial Portugues (BCP). BCP was the first bank to set up an offshore branch in Madeira more than three years ago, and it claims to have the largest share of the offshore business. Its business is divided between private and corporate banking, with most deposits from private clients and lending mainly to the corporate sector. Many clients are drawn from Portuguese emigrant communities in Brazil, South Africa and Venezuela. As with all offshore centres there is always the risk some of the funds may come from illegitimate sources, and Madeira's banks are keen to keep the centre clean. 'It's something we discussed (among the banks), because if there is a suspicion of any money-laundering in one bank, all the banks and the system will suffer, so we check carefully all new clients,' says Mr Bento.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> DEFEAT JEOPARDIZES PLANS FOR CAMPUS;  </P> <P> CAL STATE UNIVERSITY: THE REJECTION OF PROP. 143 COULD INDEFINITELY DELAY  PLANNING OF A FACILITY IN THE COUNTY. MEASURE A'S LOSS PUTS ROAD PROJECTS ON  HOLD.  </P> <P> Voters dealt a devastating blow Tuesday to the development of a California  State University campus in Ventura County and to local transportation funding  to ease clogged traffic on area highways.  </P> <P> Voters in Ventura County and statewide rejected Proposition 143 to provide $450  million for building and maintaining new and existing Cal State and University  of California campuses, throwing into jeopardy the future of a Cal State campus  in Ventura County.  </P> <P> County voters also defeated Measure A, which would have increased the sales tax  one-half cent to raise $500 million over 20 years to improve such traffic  tangles as the Ventura Freeway's Santa Clara River Bridge, which links Ventura  and Oxnard; the Saticoy bridge, which crosses the Santa Clara River on  California 118 through Saticoy; and the intersection of the Ventura Freeway  with busy Victoria Avenue.  </P> <P> Cal State University officials and Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) said  they believed that the $7 million set aside to buy land for a new campus can be  retained. But with no new money for capital programs, officials said planning  and construction of the first phase of an ultimate $300-million campus could be  delayed indefinitely.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't want to predict any opening of a new campus at this point," said  Cal State Vice Chancellor John M. Smart. Smart said that, if the university  goes forward with plans to buy a piece of land for a campus, its funds will be  limited to the $7 million, which will have to cover environmental impact  reports as well as purchase of the property.  </P> <P> "But I would say the objective is still to acquire a site, so that, if and when  the state can afford to construct a campus, the site will be there to do it,"  he said.  </P> <P> In addition to a years-long delay for a Ventura campus, Chancellor Ellis E.  McCune said Cal State may have to halt construction at its new San Marcos  campus, which was due to open to students in 1992.  </P> <P> Hart said he will suggest a special bond election, possibly next year, to  ensure funding for the university's needs.  </P> <P> Ventura County officials predicted that they will have a second chance at  transportation funding as well, probably in the form of another road-tax  measure when the economic mood is brighter.  </P> <P> "We're in difficult times right now, and people are uneasy," said county  Supervisor John K. Flynn, who predicted gridlock in five years without major  work on area highways. "They're saying they don't want to give any more money  to government, because they're not sure it has been managed properly."  </P> <P> Flynn and other officials said the overwhelming defeat of the transportation  tax will place Ventura County in a bad position when the county bids for state  funding for local projects.  </P> <P> "When you go to the state Transportation Department and ask for money, they  want to know how we're going to come up with matching funds," Flynn said.  "We'll say, 'We don't have anything.' And they'll say, 'We don't have anything  for you either.' "  </P> <P> With all precincts reporting but thousands of absentee ballots still uncounted,  104,976 people, or 67.3%, voted against Measure A, with only 51,064 people, or  32.7%, supporting the new tax.  </P> <P> Also, local measures in Moorpark, Fillmore, Santa Paula and Piru that would  have raised taxes for schools, ambulance service, building repairs and library  services failed to garner the two-thirds vote needed for approval.  </P> <P> Ventura County voters rejected Proposition 143 by 88,436 votes, or 55.8%, to  69,961, or 44.2%. Statewide, voters were slightly more concerned with higher  education, defeating the proposition 51.2% to 48.8%  </P> <P> Hart and Cal State University officials stressed the need to move swiftly to  spend the $7 million on a new site in Ventura County, where Cal State has been  trying to buy an acceptable location for four years.  </P> <P> The money, which came from a 1986 bond issue, is thought to be secure until  June 30, 1992. But the Legislature could reappropriate it before then for more  pressing needs, such as upgrades to make buildings earthquake safe, said Bill  Whiteneck, chief consultant to the state Senate's Education Committee.  </P> <P> Of the seven sites now being considered for a possible Cal State campus in  Ventura County, the university would have to exceed its budget to buy at least  three, university officials said at their Oct. 31 meeting in Oxnard.  </P> <P> The Taylor Ranch west of Ventura, property owned by the Donlon family at Wooley  Road and Rose Avenue near Oxnard, and the southern portion of a site straddling  Foothill Road near east Ventura each would probably cost more than $7 million.  </P> <P> Property next to the California Youth Authority near Camarillo, the north half  of the Foothill Road property, land owned by the Lusk Co. and McLaughlin family  near Ventura Harbor, and land owned by the McGrath family near McGrath State  Beach could probably be purchased within the budget, officials and property  owners said.  </P> <P> Cal State University officials would also have to find funds to keep area roads  from becoming clogged with students in the absence of local funding for  improvements to existing county highways.  </P> <P> According to Ginger Gherardi, executive director of the county Transportation  Commission, the roads that will suffer the most from lack of funding include  the Moorpark Freeway, which is already crowded during rush hours; the two-lane  California 118 between Moorpark and the Ventura Freeway; and the narrow  California 33 at the Casitas bypass.  </P> <P> "The issue will come back again, because the reality in this county is there  are not the dollars to build the projects that are needed," Gherardi said.  </P> <P> Gherardi cited Orange County -- choked by gridlock -- as an example. After two  unsuccessful tries in six years, Orange County voters Tuesday approved a  sweeping package of highway transit projects, financed by a half-cent sales  tax.  </P> <P> Pat Baggerly, a member of the Environmental Coalition, which opposed the  measure, said the strong defeat has more to do with growth control than bad  timing.  </P> <P> "People don't want to spend their money on something that's only the backbone  for more development," she said. "Roads are just growth-inducing, everyone  knows that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE NUMBERS  </P> <P> CONGRESS: A26  </P> <P> STATE SENATE: A27  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY: A27  </P> <P> HOW VENTURA VOTED: B3  </P> <P> SCHOOLS: B4  </P> <P> MUNICIPALITIES: B5  </P></p>

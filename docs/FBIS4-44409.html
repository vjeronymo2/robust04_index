			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Yuan Xialiang (5913 1115 5328): </F> "Shanghai's Property Right Exchange Market Starts From Here: An  Interview With Gong Jiemin"]    [Text] Editor's note: The "Shanghai Property  Right Exchange Office" was established this year by approval  document No. 1 of the Shanghai government. As a big and  important step in deepening reform and perfecting the market  system for the elements of production, it is attracting people's  attention. The Shanghai Property Right Exchange Office will  begin with exchanges of collective enterprises' property, and  after achieving this will go on to gradually establish a  large-scale, concentrated, public, regulated and orderly major  property rights market. The "Shanghai Urban and Rural Property  Right Exchange Office" will operate at a high starting point,  with high standards and high efficiency, then gradually will  link up with the domestic and overseas markets, connecting with  the international property rights market. In order to help  readers understand the establishment background, practical  significance and operational form of the "Shanghai Urban and  Rural Property Right Exchange Office, we will initially publish  this special interview.    The Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office  is located in the Yipingxiang Building, at Alley 1277, Xietu  Road, No 14. During the Lantern Festival with its deep  atmosphere of spring, this reporter tracked down and interviewed  the Chairman of the property right exchange office, Gong Jiemin  [7895 0094 3046].    Reporter: Why organize and establish a Shanghai  Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office?    Chairman: The office was established after more  than half a year's preparation and application to the Shanghai  municipal government, and was jointly organized by the Shanghai  Agriculture Commission, Municipal Office of System Reform,  Municipal Bureau of Commerce and Industry, and the Municipal,  Suburban, and County Industrial Bureau. It is another production  element market, following Shanghai's 10 other exchange offices  of securities, metals, agricultural materials, chemical  industry, petroleum, coal, grains and edible oils, automobiles,  construction materials, and technology. Although this market is  a relative latecomer, it is a very important start. It is an  important and big step for Shanghai's establishment of the  socialist market system. It is an inevitable high level market  after conducting further reform of enterprise property rights.  It is a measure which will invigorate the entire situation in  the chess game that is big trading, big circulation in Shanghai.  These could be the reasons why the Shanghai government approved  its organization and establishment in its No 1 document this  year.    Reporter: Why do you say property right exchange  is an important step to further reform?    Chairman: The property right is the property  owners' (enterprise legal person and natural person) rights to  the property. It includes rights of occupation, use (operation),  receipt of profits and control. Property right exchange is a  special marketing activity which takes property rights as the  object of exchanging, with receiving profits from property  rights as the goal.    The Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office  is an exchange office focusing on the whole body of enterprise  property right transmission (taking the enterprise as a single  commodity).    Prior to the implementation of reform and opening, an  enterprise was an attachment to executive organs, not a  commodity. Enterprise assets were non-liquid, property rights  were fixed, a forbidden area for asset flow and reorganization.  With the implementation of further reform, such production  elements as capital, resources, technology, information, and  labor gradually went into the market, and further developed  enterprise asset property rights and some enterprise property  right exchange, finally developing to the advanced market  activity of the total enterprise property right going to the  market.    Reporter: In establishing the office, why did you  choose to start with urban and rural collective enterprise  property right exchange?    Chairman: Enterprise property right exchange is a  complex system. The major reasons for Shanghai selecting urban  and rural collective enterprises to begin with are:    First, property rights for urban and rural collective  enterprises are relatively clear. Enterprises run by teams are  owned by the teams collectively, those run by villages are owned  by the villages collectively, those run by towns are owned by  townships collectively, and in a joint stock system ownership is  by the shareholders. Occupation, use, and division of  enterprises is quite clear in these enterprises.    Second, collective enterprise began and developed with the  market economy. The enterprises' self-operation, personal  responsibility for profits and losses, their self-development,  and self-limiting system were all established and in operation  early on; moreover, they have a stronger internal demand for  exchange of property rights.    Third, it is easier to handle asset and real estate  transferrals for urban and rural collective enterprises, and  they are especially better at placing and absorbing workers than  are state-owned enterprises in cities, so it is relatively easy  to transfer entire enterprises.    Fourth, rural and urban collective enterprises have  developed  rapidly in this era of reform. Most enterprises have a  comparatively short history, a light burden of retired workers,  and are easy to transfer and cut debts, the amount owed to  creditors.    Fifth, at present, urban and rural collective enterprises  have considerable assets: there are nearly 20,000 collective  enterprises in suburban Shanghai, with original value of over 25  billion yuan in fixed assets. The registered capital of over  3,000 foreign-funded enterprises is more than $3.5 billion. So  potentially, the market for transfer of enterprises either in  whole or in part is very wide.    Reporter: Why should property right transferral be  concentrated in a property right exchange office?    Chairman: The governing principle for all market  competition should be public, legal, fair, regulated and orderly  conducting property rights exchange. Carrying out enterprise  property rights exchange by concentrating it in a property right  exchange office helps to break down divisions among regions,  industries, departments, and ownership, to form an intensive and  unified large market, and helps protect enterprise assets from  losses, preserving and adding to their value. Concentrating the  conduct of property right exchange in an exchange office is  valuable in that it provides an information center which can  help enterprises straighten out their reserve assets, and  perfect the allocation of key production elements through  reasonable property right exchange. At the same time, it also  helps to regulate the relationships among enterprises, the  market and the government, and protects the legal rights and  profits of publicly owned capital based on public ownership by  administrative, economic, and legal means.    Reporter: What is the organization and composition  of the Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office?    Chairman: The Shanghai Urban and Rural Property  Right Exchange Office will operate the chairman responsibility  system under the direction of an administrative committee. It  has three offices and five departments: the office of the  chairman, management office, and general office; information  department, overseas department, exchange department, legal  department, and accounting department.    The intermediate organization for enterprise property rights  exchange is the property rights brokering corporation; these are  property rights brokers.    The property rights management corporation attached to the  property rights exchange office is a property rights brokering  corporation established in accordance with national laws, legal  regulations, and temporary property rights management measures  fixed by the property rights exchange office.    The property rights brokering corporation is divided into  three types: in order to guarantee that the exchange market for  urban and rural collective enterprises is concentrated, public,  and regulated, they established brokering corporations at the  district or county level which are based on the management of  urban and rural collective enterprises. This was done to  straighten out exchange and speed up circulation in the property  rights market, by establishing a group of brokering corporations  directly organized or supported by financial organs, big  enterprise groups and foreign trade organs. There will be  planned, situational development of overseas members and members  outside of Shanghai.    Reporter: How will the Shanghai Urban and Rural  Property Rights Exchange Office attain its goal of operating  from a high starting point, with high standards and at a high  level?    Chairman: At the outset of its operations, the  Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office will  conduct "regulation, marketization, and modernization".    Regulation means conducting regulated operations according  to  rules. The exchange office fixes and organizes internal organs  strictly according to the exchange office's rules, the  administrative commission's rules, the exchange office's  administrative methods, temporary management methods of property  right brokering corporations, provisional membership management  articles and founding organizations. Exchanges will adhere  strictly to several proposals concerning property right exchange  submitted by the Shanghai government and the regulations and  orders in the property right brokering corporation's provisional  administrative measures. The whole procedure of registering  sales, evaluating assets, the standard exchange contract and  agreement, any changes in property right and the registration of  these changes will all be standardized documents.    Marketization and modernization mean that property right  exchange activity must be a marketing activity, as well as using  modern tools such as the computer to build up a highly efficient  management system through use of internationally advanced  exchange measures, concluding deals by matching pairs. This  high-standard regulated exchange activity will expand the market  coverage rate, and connect our property right exchange market  with the international property right market.</p>

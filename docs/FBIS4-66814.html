			<p>CSO     [Text] Alapuzha, March 18 (PTI)--The expelled Communist  Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) leader and legislator, Gowri, on  Friday formally launched a new political party--Janadhipathya  Samrakshana Samithi (JSS)--formed to "fight political  corruption."    Inaugurating a JSS convention here, she said the new party  had adopted a red flag with three white stars as its official  ensign.    The JSS, she said, was receiving all-out support from the  people because of their frustration and agony due to the  prevailing degeneration of moral values among political parties  in Kerala and the rampant corruption among political leaders and  officialdom.    Referring to the Dunkel proposals and the new economic  policy  of the Centre, she said these issues marked the establishment of  a new "East India Company" in the country. She, however, said  this was her personal opinion and the party's official  assessment would be made known only after a detailed study of  the Dunkel proposals.    The three-day convention is being attended by over 700  delegates from all over the State besides a large number of Mrs  Gowri's supporters.</p>

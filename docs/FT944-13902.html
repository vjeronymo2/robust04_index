			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / US hails Moscow reform effort The rouble's recent fall has served as a 'wake-up' call for the Russian government, creating an important opportunity for a serious stabilisation programme next year, Mr Larry Summers, US Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, said in Moscow yesterday. After talks with Russian officials about the reform process and 1995 budget proposals, Mr Summers said he would take an encouraging report back to Washington. 'It is clear that Russian economic reform is at an important crossroads and it is clear that the government is charting a course forward,' he said. 'I welcome the clear intentions from all the government officials I met with of a commitment to serious stabilisation.' He warned, however, that the erosion of the tax collection system and the growth of organised crime posed serious threats. Mr Summers said tax revenues were 4 per cent of gross national product less than they were a year ago. 'Reversal of that kind of erosion will be central to the stabilisation effort,' he said, suggesting what was needed was to collect more tax money at lower rates from a broader base. The austere budget proposals for 1995 envisage that further monetary tightening will reduce inflation to 1 per cent a month by the end of the year. The federal budget deficit would also be kept within 8.3 per cent of gross domestic product. One Group of Seven official said: 'What is under discussion is the prospect of a real stabilisation not just a slowing down of inflation. That means more reform and potentially more direct financial support than has come from the IMF so far.' But some western economists warn that the government has talked tough before and bowed to the pressures of the industrial lobby to issue more credits. The 1995 budget is also expected to have a rough passage through parliament and the ability to implement the current proposals is far from certain. Mr Oleg Soskovets, Russia's first deputy prime minister, said yesterday that the government also had to change the 'oil export structure' and revise the taxation system to achieve financial stabilisation. Mr Summers said the recent currency volatility had been a stark warning of the dangers of loosening the economic levers. 'I do not think that there is any question that their monetary and credit policies in late summer were an important contributing factor in the fall of the rouble,' Mr Summers said.</p>

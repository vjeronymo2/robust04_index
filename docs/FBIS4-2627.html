			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 11 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Assistant  Secretary of State Robert Gallucci will leave here tomorrow for  a visit to China, South Korea and Japan, the State Department  announced here today.    Department Spokesman Mike McCurry told a regular news  briefing that in all the three capitals, Gallucci "plans to meet  with government officials to discuss the North Korean nuclear  issue and international efforts to resolve it."    "We will continue what has been a very extensive dialogue  with all three governments on that issue," McCurry said.    Gallucci is the chair of the U.S. administration's senior  policy steering group on Korea.    Asked what he is going to talk to the Chinese about in  Beijing, McCurry said that "they'll talk about everyone's  understanding of the inspections and the report that the IAEA  (the International Atomic Energy Agency) is looking at."    They will also discuss "the diplomatic efforts that have  been  underway at the United Nations," the spokesman added.    Gallucci will join U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry in  Seoul on April 17 and then he will accompany Perry to Tokyo on  April 20.</p>

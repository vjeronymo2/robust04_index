			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Joseph Leddet: "Export ECU to East"] </F>   [Text] The monthly magazine of the French Foreign Trade  Bank, MULTIDEVISES, reported in December on the most recent,  hallucinatory monetary measures adopted in the East:  introduction of the dram in Armenia on 22 November, the tenge in  Kazakhstan on 15 November, the leu in Moldova on 29 November,  and the coupons in Uzbekistan on 15 November; devaluation of the  dinar by nearly 100 percent in the former Yugoslavia on 9  November....    It is impossible not to be dismayed by such a concentration  of decisions, both aberrant on the intellectual and financial  levels and dramatic on the human level.    The creation of a new currency in an upside down economy is  certainly aberrant. A national symbol, the currency is the  incarnation of a country's financial image. When the country is  starting out from zero and the currency is created from thin  air, its fate is settled in advance: it only means a fall. What  is most serious seems to be the role (or rather, the lack of it)  played by Western economic advisers with the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development [EBRD], with the European Union  in the lead, which allow--even approve of and finance--such  absurdities.    These measures are also dramatic on a human level because  they condemn all the populations concerned to galloping  inflation and a vertiginous drop in their standard of living.  Only the happy possessors of strong currencies (the dollar and  West European currencies) are the winners, building fortunes  from an elementary, if not savage, business.    Thus, with the emergence of liberalism, most East European  people are living much worse than before, particularly wage  earners, professionals, and, still more, retirees. Hence the  understandable attraction exerted by extreme rightist and  neocommunist parties advocating a return to an acceptable and  desirable order, as recently manifested by Russian voters.    While there is no miracle solution for such a problem,  certain measures ought to be taken. In economic issues, the  first priority for any country is the currency. The currency of  a country such as Russia, Poland, or Romania is worth  nothing--on an international level, of course--if it is not a  convertible currency. A Western company planning to do business  in Russia would then attempt by all available means to obtain  contracts in dollars or marks; alternately, it would accept a  compensation/barter system with all the risks this entails. This  situation considerably restricts foreign investment in East  Europe.    True, the solution is radical: East European currencies  ought  to be abolished and replaced by a real currency. For various  reasons, we believe it would be opportune to retain the ECU as a  common currency for East Europe, notably from a geopolitical  perspective.    This solution is radical because it means carrying out a  veritable financial transfusion by replacing at a given time the  country's monetary mass with its equivalent in ECU's at a rate  set in an authoritarian way, exactly as West Germany did for the  former East Germany.    This transfusion would have the dual advantage of limiting  the growth of the money supply (which would no longer be the  result of the printing presses), hence to stabilize prices and  create an attractive new market for Western investors as long as  local consumers pay in hard currency. A really productive  economy would thus have a chance to develop among our Eastern  neighbors and local people would benefit from a real purchasing  power.    Obviously, the loss of monetary sovereignty in the countries  concerned would be a disadvantage. But this is what awaits all  of us, the signatories of the Maastricht Treaty, in a few years.    On the contrary, this might be an excellent occasion to  promote the ECU by exporting it to the East in a progressive  manner (for instance, through a test in a country like Bulgaria,  or Hungary, or Uzbekistan). The 1 January 1994 installation of  the European Monetary Institute in Frankfurt comes at the right  time to promote such an experiment....</p>

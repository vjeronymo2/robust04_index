			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREAST-FEEDING IN RESTAURANTS  </P> <P> Once again we are titillated by Ms. Allred's persistent pursuit of media  exposure to keep us abreast of her current court scenario.  </P> <P> My advice to Nicole Kaufman: When next you feel the urge to "do lunch with the  girls," if you can't prepare it at home, order in enabling you all to sit  around chit-chatting while you do your mother-child bonding in the presence of  those who apparently wouldn't object.  </P> <P> Please, having faced babies and small children's unpredictabilities in the  markets, banks, churches, etc., allow my dining experience to remain a respite  from the routine stresses of everyday living.  </P> <P> Finally, is it really in the best interest of babies, with their delicate  immune system, to subject them to the coughs, sneezes, odors, etc., that we  adults can more readily handle?  </P> <P> FRANK W. HOFFMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / School bullying haunts celebrations: Questions raised about the educational system The Christmas lights have gone up to add cheer to the Japanese year-end but, far from being in celebratory mood, the country is gripped by concerns about bullying in its state schools. On Tuesday the nation, already deeply disturbed by the suicide last month of a 13-year-old schoolboy who was the victim of bullying by classmates, was shocked by a second young suicide of the same age, who had also been tormented by his peers. The public outcry over the increasingly cold-blooded bullying that is taking place in Japanese schools has led the government to set up a special cabinet council to look into the causes of and possible solutions to school bullying. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, prime minister, has called on his ministers to review the educational counselling system to determine whether it was functioning properly. Bullying is by no means a new feature of life at Japanese schools nor a phenomenon peculiar to Japan. But the number of incidents which are thought to have been responsible for the deaths of teenagers and the apparently more vicious nature of the bullying has alarmed the public and raised questions about the country's educational system. In its annual white paper on education released on Tuesday, the ministry of education cites that 12 per cent of elementary schools, 33 per cent of junior high schools and 24 per cent of senior high schools reported bullying in fiscal 1992. While the figures show that incidents have been on the decline at elementary and senior high schools, the ministry notes that there has been a rise in incidents of bullying at junior high schools. Mr Kazuhiro Mochizuki, a former headmaster of a junior high school who is now an educational consultant, believes that the strong tendency in junior high schools to judge students according to their academic achievements is largely to blame for the bullying groups which have sprouted throughout Japanese state schools. 'There is a lot of confusion in junior high schools over how best to get students into high schools. In the shadow of all the confusion over academic counselling, I believe 70 to 80 per cent of the children have an inferiority complex and these are the ones who form groups and try to vent their frustration by bullying others,' he says. In most cases victims are gentle children who have an average or above average academic record. At the same time, the emphasis at schools has shifted so much towards academic work that moral instruction and non-academic activities have been neglected. Many critics of Japan's educational system who share Mr Mochizuki's concerns about the weight given to academic achievement blame the system for creating an environment in which children feel they cannot rely on their teachers. 'Teachers are preoccupied with conferences and other matters and have less and less time to spend with the children. That is why the children do not trust their teachers and do not tell them that they are being bullied,' notes Mr Inada Nada, a psychologist and writer. 'If personal relationships are weak, there will be bullying not only at schools but at the workplace as well,' he adds. In many cases where bullying has led to the suicide of young students, the school authorities, including the victims' teachers, claim not to have noticed the bullying. Although some schools have set up special counselling facilities, children who are bullied by their peers tend to keep the reality hidden from grown-ups. This is in part out of fear of retaliation from offenders but also because they are not always taken seriously by adults. In both of the latest suicide cases, the parents of the victims had suspected bullying for some time, but the school authorities did not take any significant steps to try to stop the aggression. In a society where group harmony and conformity are valued over individuality and self-assertiveness, it is often not only difficult for the victim of group aggression to seek help but humiliating as well. Another aspect that has raised concerns in Japan is the growing tendency for bullies to extort huge sums of money from their victims. In the case of Kiyoteru Okochi, who committed suicide last month, one of the most shocking revelations was that his tormentors had forced him to give them a total of more than Y1m (Pounds 6,380) over a period of about two years, according to a letter he left. The money, which Kiyoteru stole from his parents and borrowed from relatives, was spent by the bullies at game arcades and on everything from clothes to food and alcohol. 'Many children today cannot play without money,' laments Mr Mochizuki. The problem reflects a deeper social disorder, he believes. 'Bullying is occurring in public schools which cannot reject any of the children who live in the local communities. In many of these communities, people who have lived side by side for more than ten years do not even talk to each other and it's everyone for himself. In such an environment, how can you expect children to develop a sense of concern for others?' Mr Mochizuki asks. 'The government cannot hope to solve this problem with peremptory measures like setting up councils but will have to look at it from the perspective of local communities and of the educational system as a whole,' he points out. Japan has always prided itself on its social harmony. But ironically, as the country tries to define a new relationship for itself with the rest of the world, it is having to reflect on the effects of deteriorating relationships among its own people at home.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Halifax and Leeds linked in talk of merger Speculation was intensifying last night that talks are under way on a merger between two of the UK's largest building societies. Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest with assets of more than Pounds 60bn, is reported to be in discussion with Leeds Permanent, the fifth-largest society. Any such merger would involve branch closures and job losses as there is significant regional overlap between the two societies which are based in Yorkshire. Leeds has been rumoured as an intended partner because Mr Mike Blackburn, Halifax chief executive, ran Leeds until the first half of last year. Leeds has been without a chief executive since then. A merger between the Halifax and the Leeds would create a society with assets of Pounds 87.6bn and such a large slice of the mortgage lending market that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission might become involved. Halifax refused to comment on the reports last night. It has made no secret of its desire to merge with a smaller society. However, there has always been a question about the benefit of such a merger to the smaller partner such as the Leeds. The speculation comes at a time of increasing competition within the personal financial services sector, leading to increased pressure for consolidation. Just over a year ago merger talks between Leeds and National &amp; Provincial Building Society, the UK's eighth-largest, foundered on a difference of management cultures. In April this year Lloyds Bank launched a Pounds 1.8bn agreed cash bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, the UK's sixth-largest. Halifax has made it clear it would like mutual bank status, and this is one option under consideration in the current Treasury review of building society powers. If Halifax were unable to achieve the freedom such an option would offer it could well seek its members' approval to convert to a plc.</p>

Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> SHARKEY WISHES GOTTI GOOD LUCK  </P> <P> Ray Sharkey, who played a mobster on TV's "Wiseguy," hugged and kissed reputed  crime boss John Gotti at Gotti's assault trial.  </P> <P> Sharkey visited the courtroom Tuesday and the pair later lunched at Giambone's,  an Italian restaurant, the New York Post reported today.  </P> <P> Sharkey, who said he has known Gotti since they were children in Brooklyn,  portrayed the fictional crime kingpin Sonny Steelgrave in the TV series.  Sharkey is researching a movie that deals with the Mafia, his publicist told  the Post.  </P> <P> He wished Gotti, 49, good luck, and Gotti called Sharkey "a good friend of  mine."  </P> <P> Noting reporters' surprise, Gotti said, smiling, "What do you think, Bruce  Cutler is my only friend?" Cutler, Gotti's attorney, is defending him on  charges he ordered the shooting of a union official who allegedly trashed a  mob-owned restaurant built with non-union labor.  </P></p>

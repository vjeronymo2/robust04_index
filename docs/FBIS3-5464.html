Kim's remarks came during a speech at the  commencement ceremony for the Korea Air Force Academy's 42nd  class in Chongwon, North Chungchong Province. The president  said, "North Korea is in a difficult situation, diplomatically  isolated from the rest of the world and suffering from economic  poverty. North Koreans are moving their military power close to  the front line, and their air power can pose a threat to us in  only a couple of minutes."    He asked the graduates not to fail in defending the South's  air space. In modern warfare, advanced weapons decide victory or  defeat very quickly, the president said. Unless the country  boosts its technology to the level of advanced nations, it will  not be able to win an economic or technological war or achieve a  self-reliant military. "In this respect, our national defense  system should be scientific and efficient," President Kim said.    Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, Joint Chiefs of Staff  Chairman  Yi Yang-ho and Kim Hong-nae, the newly appointed Air Force chief  of Staff, also attended the ceremony.</p>

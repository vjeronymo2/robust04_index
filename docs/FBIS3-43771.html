Mr  Mwila denied being the grandmaster of corruption in Zambia, and  attacked the press as the cause of the breakdown of law and  order.    Friday's edition of the independent weekly POST quoted him  as  saying forces working to destabilise the country could, if not  checked, precipitate a military coup.    He criticised the press for encouraging the trend in  lawlessness, recalcitrance, indiscipline and total disobedience  to authority, saying: "You make dictators. Read the signs."  The press had, he claimed, wrongfully published confidential  presidential documents. "Zambian soldiers are not different from  Zaireans, Ghanaians or Nigerian soldiers -- they too could blow  up soon and take this country by force. Don't push us too far."    He rejected charges of corruption, saying he had nothing to  gain from it. Mr Mwila warned Zambians to listen to him because  the press was abusing its freedom and democracy was being turned  into anarchy.</p>

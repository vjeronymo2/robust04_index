			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Observer: Fit to print Tony Blair's gaggle of spin doctors and media managers has gone too far; an absurd choreography surrounds his every step at the party's Blackpool conference. Photographers are allowed only 'authorised' pictures, rather than informal snaps of Blair going about his business. But a scene in the Imperial Hotel, Labour's seaside HQ, has shocked even the most hardened hacks. An elderly newspaper vendor was physically bundled out of the hotel lobby by two Blair heavies. His crime? Daring to sell copies of a tabloid newspaper, which yesterday carried a few risque photographs of a minor aide of Blair's wife. Roll on free speech, eh chaps?</p>

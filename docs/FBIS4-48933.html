			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cao Min: "Labour Disputes Increase 50 Percent"] </F>   [Text] Labour disputes have sharply risen in the past few  years, flooding arbitration committees nationwide with more than  12,000 cases in 1993 alone.    Last year, arbitration committees accepted and heard 12,358  labour disputes, up 51.6 percent from 1992, according to a  Labour Ministry and State Statistics Bureau report released this  week.    More than 92 percent of the cases were settled by the end of  the year.    About 2,800 arbitration committees have been set up at  various levels since 1986, the ministry said.    Meanwhile, half of the provinces, municipalities and  autonomous regions in the country have established labour  supervisory institutions.    The labour unrest is the result of poor management in the  enterprises, especially overseas-funded and private firms,  imperfect laws and lack of labour markets, the ministry said.    Another reason for the increase in disputes is labour  controversy has finally come out in the open.    Disputes in non-government firms rose more sharply than  State- owned ones.    In the past years, Guangdong Province has handled 7.892  labour disputes among which 1,421 happened at non-State  companies.    The employers often hired workers without signing a contract  so they could be fired at will.    Some managers defaulted or embezzled workers' wages and even  subjected the workers to indignities.    China Business Times reported that about 300 workers at a  company in Huizhou, Guangdong, held a two-day strike because  their Hong Kong boss had fallen far behind in payments.    Before the Spring Festival in early February, the company  paid each worker 100 yuan ($11.5) because it was afraid they  would not return.    However, the workers didn't get January and February wages  on  March 15.    The city's labour supervisory department recently imposed a  fine on the boss and instructed the company to pay the two  months' wages immediately.    Strikes have also happened in the foreign-funded enterprises  in other cities.    But some labour disputes were initiated when workers broke  their contracts, the report said.    To protect legal rights of both the enterprises and' the  workers, the ministry is making efforts to research the  arbitration system and set up a nationwide network.</p>

According to Chernomyrdin, the main task in economic  cooperation is to liven up the process, make it faster. He  admitted stagnation in a number of spheres of bilateral  relations and said it should be overcome as soon as possible.  Among such spheres Chernomyrdin named financial relations, the  question of mutual debts, cooperation in military-technical  matters and contacts between border areas.    The Russian prime-minister stated that concrete officials  have been appointed who should work out a mechanism of resolving  these problems by May. The two prime-ministers will meet in May  in Warsaw to discuss the expansion of cooperation the next stage  of which should be control over approved agreements and  decisions.    The Polish prime-minister remarked that there is a practical  foundation now for signing long-term trade and economic  agreements and an appropriate protocol for this year. He said  the absence of a decision on the matter of mutual debts on which  the ministries of finance of the two countries are working  "should not block economic cooperation". Answering a question  about the anxiety caused in Poland by the concentration of  Russian troops in Kaliningrad region the prime-minister said  that the matter should be left for the presidents of the two  countries to decide.</p>

The pamphlet, required under section 406(a) of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, will be distributed to owners and occupants of pre-1978 housing before the commencement of renovations by paid renovators, and will be distributed to purchasers and lessees of pre-1978 housing before sale or lease. The comment period for the pamphlet closed on May 9, 1994. Based on the comments received, and on information obtained during focus group tests in several cities, EPA has revised the pamphlet. In the spirit of maximizing responsiveness to the general public and regulated community, EPA is scheduling a public meeting to augment the publics' opportunity to provide input on the pamphlet. Because of the time constraints imposed by the statutory deadline, however, no additional comment period will be allowed beyond the public meeting date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> : The meeting will take place on August 29, 1994, from 9 a.m. to noon.

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Congressional mandate in section 406(a) of TSCA, EPA has developed a lead hazard information pamphlet, for use in association with several regulations mandated by the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act [Pub. L. 105&hyph;550]. As required by the statute, EPA is developing the pamphlet in consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 406(a) of TSCA also requires that EPA issue the pamphlet for notice and comment. EPA issued a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11119), announcing the draft pamphlet's availability for public comment. EPA made the draft pamphlet available through the National Lead Information Clearinghouse, as well as the TSCA Docket. During the 60&hyph;day public comment period, 69 parties submitted comments. EPA also conducted a series of focus group tests in five different cities, Atlanta, GA, Birmingham, AL, Chicago, IL, Hayward, CA, and Washington, DC. EPA has used these focus tests to solicit general feedback on the presentation of the material from individuals with a high school education or lower. The results of the focus tests, combined with the technical and stylistic comments provided by the public commenters, will help EPA develop a final pamphlet that meets the informational needs of a broad range of readers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Role of Pamphlet <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This pamphlet will be disseminated as a result of several Congressional directives that will be implemented in separate rulemaking initiatives. Section 406(b) of TSCA requires that EPA promulgate regulations requiring each person who performs for compensation a renovation of target housing to provide a lead hazard information pamphlet to the owner(s) and occupant(s) of such housing prior to commencing the renovation. In addition, this pamphlet may be used by other Federal Programs to support their educational and outreach goals and obligations. EPA issued proposed regulations under section 406(b) on March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11108), for a 60&hyph;day public comment period that closed on May 9, 1994. EPA is currently reviewing public comments and preparing the final rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1012 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act (also known as ``Title X'') requires that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provide the pamphlet to purchasers and tenants of housing receiving Federal assistance. These regulations are under development by HUD. Section 1018 of Title X requires that EPA and HUD promulgate regulations requiring sellers or lessors of target housing to provide purchasers and lessees with the lead hazard information pamphlet. EPA and HUD expect to issue the proposed regulations for this rulemaking in late summer or early fall of 1994. Commenters should be aware, however, that comments received on the pamphlet during the comment period for the proposed section 1018 regulation will not be used in developing the final draft of the pamphlet, due by October 28, 1994. Where appropriate, EPA may consider those comments when developing subsequent revisions to the pamphlet, as authorized by section 406 of TSCA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Lead.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 9, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Joseph A.

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Hong Kong to boost car taxes Hong Kong aims to tax vehicle owners to avert total gridlock, government officials said yesterday. Proposals released by the government for public comment include increasing the tax on new cars to 70 per cent of the car's total value from 40-60 per cent now, and raising annual licence fees by 40 per cent. Access to tunnels could be restricted to odd or even numbered plates on alternate days. Quotas for new private cars and removal of tax benefits on company cars are also being considered.</p>

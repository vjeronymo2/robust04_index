			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Rome intelligence clampdown Italy's intelligence services are to be reorganised under a single authority, controlled directly by the prime minister, writes Robert Graham in Rome. This was the outcome of a meeting between President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, senior ministers, defence chiefs and heads of the intelligence services. The meeting had been prompted by mounting evidence that elements of Italy's intelligence community were linked to organised crime and had been behind acts of terrorism. Legislation outlining the new authority is expected to be submitted to parliament in the form of a decree by the end of the month. The two principal existing agencies - Sisde (domestic intelligence) and Sismi (military intelligence) - will disappear. They will be replaced by two revamped organisations.</p>

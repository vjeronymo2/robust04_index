			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unwise route to take to ensure that baggage is on board Sir, Kate Bevan's article, 'Looking after your luggage' (Business Travel supplement, October 10), contained some excellent advice. I would, however, counsel against following the advice of Mark McCormack to get someone to look after your bags while you check in and then take them to the gate as a way of ensuring they do not get misrouted on another flight. Airlines are wise to this one and you would have to be lucky to get away with it. Nor should you. Aircraft cabins have limited space for baggage. And all passengers are entitled to a share of what space there is. More importantly, airlines are required by law to make sure that all such baggage, of whatever weight or size, is properly secured - for your safety.

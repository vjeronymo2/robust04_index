			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / SNP attempts to don the mantle of socialism: James Buxton assesses prospects in the Monklands by-election State ownership is yielding to privatisation everywhere from Poland to Mongolia but its virtues are still being preached in Monklands East, the Scottish constituency which votes in a by-election next week to elect a successor to John Smith. Mrs Kay Ullrich, the Scottish National party candidate, proclaimed last week that an SNP government would renationalise Scotland's gas and electricity - and its water, if it had been sold off. Coal, steel, transport and telephones would also go back into state ownership. These views may not disturb people in Airdrie, the former steel town outside Glasgow which lies in the constituency. But they sound a little strange from a party which 10 days ago won support from thousands of ex-Tory voters to take the North East Scotland seat in the European elections from Labour. In those elections the SNP won a record 32.6 per cent of the vote across Scotland. It is trying to follow up its success by seizing Monklands East, a Labour stronghold where Mr Smith had a majority of 15,712 in 1992. It is not as unlikely a prospect as it might seem. The SNP took the Airdrie South council seat, which makes up 40 per cent of the constituency, in the regional elections in May. It believes it achieved a swing from Labour over the whole constituency of 17 per cent - only four points short of that required to oust Labour in the by-election. But Labour, remembering the humiliating defeat it suffered at the hands of the SNP in the 1988 Glasgow Govan by-election, has moved with almost unseemly haste to schedule the by-election for June 30, allowing little more than two weeks for campaigning after the Euro-elections. It also selected one of its most formidable Scottish figures, Mrs Helen Liddell, former secretary of the Scottish Labour party, manager of many an election campaign and once an executive at Mirror Group's Daily Record. Immaculately coiffed and dressed to radiate power, she is professional to her fingertips and was closely associated with John Smith. But she represents a party which has allowed the word Monklands to become a byword for Labour municipal malpractice. In 1992 and 1993 the local newspaper revealed that Monklands District Council was controlled by a 'mafia' in the Labour party which appointed many of its own relatives to council jobs. The council administers the similarly-sized towns of Airdrie and Coatbridge. But Coatbridge has had capital spending of Pounds 471m in the past three years to Airdrie's Pounds 59m, gaining a leisure complex and a shopping centre. Airdrie people put Coatbridge's advantage down to the fact that they are excluded from the 'mafia' - and that they are mostly Protestant while the people of Coatbridge are Catholic, as are all the councillors. Mrs Liddell admits that Monklands council is 'something of a curate's egg' but, like John Smith, prefers to stay above the issue. Mrs Ullrich has called vaguely for a public inquiry into the council. It has been left to the Conservatives, whose candidate, Mrs Susan Bell, is a leading member of the Tory Reform Group, to highlight the religious divide and associate itself with the Protestants: on Saturday she witnessed the annual march through the town by its Orange Lodge. The Liberal Democrat candidate, Mr Stephen Gallagher, plays down the sectarian issue. Several people on the streets of Airdrie talk of their resentment at the council. 'You see all the building going on in Coatbridge and then you look around here where nothing is happening and it makes you really angry,' says a middle-aged man, adding that the SNP will get his vote for the first time on June 30. Mrs Ullrich tries to portray the SNP as the true socialists, having 'more in common with the Red Clydesiders (Scottish Labour radicals of the 1920s) than today's pinko Labour party.' But she is far less sure-footed than Mrs Liddell. SNP volunteers are coming in from outside the constituency to make up for the lack of an established organisation to match Labour's. But there may not enough time left. The odds are on the SNP coming a very good second. General election: John Smith (Labour) 22,266; SNP 6,554; Conservative 5,830; Liberal Democrat 1,679. Majority 15,712. Candidates: Helen Liddell, Labour; Kay Ullrich, SNP; Susan Bell, Conservative; Stephen Gallagher, Liberal Democrat; Duncan Paterson, Natural Law party; Abi Bremner, Network Against the Criminal Justice Bill.</p>

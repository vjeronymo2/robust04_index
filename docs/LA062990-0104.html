			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERNSON POSTPONES KEY PORTER RANCH HEARING  </P> <P> Los Angeles city officials announced Thursday that a key City Council hearing  on the proposed 1,300-acre Porter Ranch project has been postponed until July  10.  </P> <P> Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the Porter Ranch area, wanted the delay  to "give his constituents more time to review the latest plan," said Ali Saar,  the lawmaker's press deputy.  </P> <P> The hearing had been set for July 3. With the postponement, the Fourth of July  holiday "won't be an obstacle," Saar said.  </P> <P> Opponents of the project had hotly complained that Bernson's original decision  to set the hearing date for July 3 would make it difficult for many of their  supporters to attend because they would be away on long holiday breaks.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Paul Clarke, press deputy for the Porter Ranch Development Co., the  partnership that plans to develop the project, said the hearing was delayed  because the city attorney's office was unable to finish its review of the  complicated package of actions the council will be asked to approve.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles City Council panel voted 5 to 0 last week to support the Porter  Ranch project, which calls for construction of up to 6 million square feet of  commercial-office space and 3,395 homes in the Chatsworth hills north of the  Simi Valley Freeway.  </P></p>

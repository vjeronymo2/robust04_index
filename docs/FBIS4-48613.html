			<p>BFN     [Text] Reports from Lesotho say gunfire echoed overnight  around the capital Maseru as a crisis sparked by a police strike  entered its 12th day today. Sporadic shooting was heard late  yesterday and early today. The crisis deepened yesterday when  talks between the government, the striking police, prison  officers, and the official opposition broke down. Prime  minister, Mr. Ntsu Mokhehle has rejected police demands for a  60-percent pay rise, and said the country cannot afford it. The  opposition Basotho National Party walked out of a meeting with  the government yesterday after Mr. Mokhehle accused the  opposition of being involved in the police strike.    South Africa's Archbishop Desmond Tutu is in Maseru at the  invitation of church leaders in a bid to mediate in the dispute.</p>

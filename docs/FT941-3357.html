			<p>940316 FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: NKK plans to cut 1,300 more jobs NKK, the Japanese steel company, plans a wide-ranging restructuring aimed at reducing employees by a further 1,300 and increasing profits by Y175bn (Dollars 1.65bn) over the next three years. The company, which faces heavy losses this year, says the restructuring is intended to return the company to profit so that it can resume dividends by 1995-96. Earlier this month, it revised its earnings estimate for the year ending this month and said that it expects pre-tax losses of Y25bn. Under the plan, NKK will cut capital spending to a third of levels seen over the past three years, or about Y140bn. The latest job cuts are in addition to 3,200 announced last year.</p>

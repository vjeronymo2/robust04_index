			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: A fuss-pot of instant coffee and a dose of hot air Sir, It can be shown that of 100 units of energy in a North Sea Reservoir destined to make a cup of instant coffee on mainland Europe some 90 units are lost along the way. The energy is drained off in energy production processes, in transportation, in heat rejected by power stations and in transmission losses, and finally (next to the coffee jar) as the energy remaining in the hot over-filled kettle. On the gardening page of the Weekend FT (October 16/17) the article by Robin Lane Fox reminded me of waste on this scale (but unnecessarily so), as he commended to us the processes of dosing our summer garden into the autumn with liquid fertiliser and so achieving October flowering. This drenching in chemicals is to be achieved by a garden hose fitted with a dosing attachment. But most of the liquid fertiliser so applied will end up as a management problem for river and water authorities. We should, rather, be encouraging gardeners to build up a good humus content (in part from re-cycled garden waste) and letting our tens of thousands of garden worms and trillions of bacteria produce the appropriate plant food in solution. Happily, the article on the same page by Bridget Bloom should have furnished a swift-acting antidote, when she drew our attention to the environmental problems arising from lawn care. The potential damage arises through the excesses of the dosing and cropping rituals of fuss-pot gard-eners. Ian C Broadley, Ian Broadley Associates, Corran Armadale Road, Rhu, Helensburgh</p>

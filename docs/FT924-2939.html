			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Advisers with a new idea - Ian Fraser looks at marketing services firms Providing strategic marketing advice to the fast-moving consumer goods sector has been a traditional role of the advertising agency. But changes in corporate marketing budgets and the advent of specialised marketing services companies are steadily undermining the agencies' position. 'More and more clients have perhaps only 10 per cent of their time to devote to advertising and no longer automatically have it at the top of the marketing mix, says Ian McComas, Asda's former marketing director who is now managing director of CIA Communications Management. 'Advertising agencies are limited in their ability to think beyond the scope of advertising,' says Stella Hartley, marketing director of Sears womenswear. 'But with retail brands you have to look outside advertising for a solution to your marketing problems.' The increase in corporate demand for outside marketing advice has been boosted by growing demands on marketing managers' time. 'When you're bogged down in the details of a brand, you don't always have the time to sit down and look at broader strategic issues,' says Craig Duncan, senior brands manager at United Distillers, which has used a marketing services firm, the Added Value Company. 'They have more time to think these things through,' he says. The Added Value Company was formed in 1988 by Peter Dart and Mark Sherrington, both former marketing directors with Unilever, who believed there was demand for a 'marketing agency' capable of offering advice that was strategic, creative and practical, yet independent of any single marketing services discipline. Sherrington believes companies such as his increasingly undermine the role of traditional advertising agencies. 'What they are studiously doing is avoiding understanding how clients are changing,' he said. 'All the areas where they offer no competitive advantage  -like brand development, new brand development, media buying, production - all are gradually being stripped away. All they're going to be left with is the one area where they have competitive advantage, the creative development of advertising.' Duncan, however, believes that marketing agencies will not become dominant. 'It will remain an important and growing but niche area, because it's not always easy to sell senior management the idea that you need someone else to do what is effectively your job.' Sherrington is more bullish, believing that if only there were a few more marketing agencies around, the notion of having a separate brand development budget would gain in acceptability. A recent brand stretching exercise for Wedgwood illustrates how the company operates. The initiative culminated in the international launch of an a range of teas under the Wedgwood name, specifically in Japan and duty free shops. 'It is not a question of trying to do the client's job,' says Sherrington. 'The name of the game is working with them bringing to bear creativity as well as strategy, perspective, objectivity and the ability to cross reference from other markets.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Fuzhou, capital of  east China's Fujian Province, has experienced a rapid expansion  in export-oriented economy over the past years.    According to local officials, in the past year the city  approved the establishment of 1,134 foreign-funded projects,  with contracts involving a promised foreign investment of 3.3  billion U.S. dollars. The two figures represent sharp increases  compared with the corresponding figures of the previous year.    The officials said the total investment, as well as foreign  investment of the approved projects last year both surpassed the  related totals of the past 14 years.    The officials attributed the achievement to the fact that  since last year the city has made active efforts in launching  investment promotion activities at home and abroad, and has made  painstaking efforts to improve its investment environment.    The emergence of foreign-funded enterprises in large numbers  has greatly promoted the development of the export-oriented  economy, said the officials.    Foreign-funded enterprises have developed into the main  contributor of the city's economic growth. For instance, in  1993 foreign-funded firms in the city completed 10.8 billion  yuan-worth of industrial output value, accounting for 48 percent  of the city's industrial output value created by enterprises at  or above township level.    These foreign-funded enterprises last year exported goods  amounting to 730 million U.S. dollars, making up 80 percent of  the provincial capital's total exports.    Many of the foreign-funded enterprises have settled down in  the city's economic and technological development zones, making  these zones into areas of great vitality for economic  development.    As more and more overseas investors have begun to try their  luck in Fuzhou, many of the city's existing foreign-funded  enterprises have also started to enlarge their investment  scales. Last year 128 foreign-funded firms in the city  increased their investment, and the increase totalled 300  million U.S. dollars.    According to the officials, the city has 1,146  foreign-funded  enterprises in operation.</p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / The Markets: How to monitor economies - Economic Notebook It has taken longer than the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, but early next month, policy makers around the globe should be receiving a new rule book telling governments how to monitor their economies. After more than seven years work, the 1993 revision to the system of national accounts (SNA) is about to thud on to the desks of government statisticians. This internationally agreed method of tracking economic growth covered 800 pages of typescript in draft form and will spawn a plethora of national handbooks instructing officials how to apply the new rules. The revised SNA will mark a breakthrough of sorts. It is a further step towards a truly global economy. But many economists and statisticians are also certain to argue that an opportunity has been missed. Although many hundreds of recommendations have gone into the new system, it is still a reworking of a framework first developed in the US, UK and Canada in the 1940s, when manufacturing industry was dominant, and the countries concerned were primarily interested in managing their economies to win, and later recover from, the second world war. The accompanying panel gives a simplified picture of what the SNA tries to achieve. Its aim is to record the nature of stocks and flows that are part of the economic system, applying the same concepts, definitions and classifications to all accounts and sub accounts. It is rooted in the market system, where goods and services are produced and traded for a price. The framework is designed to group transactions and transactors in an accounting system that is meaningful for economic analysis, forecasting and policy. It sets out to answer the question: 'Who does what, by what means, for what purpose, with whom, in exchange for what, with what changes in stocks?' That sounds simple. But, as Mr Joseph Duncan, the chief economist of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and one of America's leading statisticians, has observed: 'The elaboration of the system quickly generates considerable detail.' The 'who' alone covers non-financial companies, financial groups, government institutions, households, which in turn consist either of individuals or groups, and non-profit institutions. The foregoing question also encompasses measures of production, income, saving and investment and wealth. The SNA framework includes domestic and foreign activities, financial and non-financial transactions, and gives current and real, inflation-adjusted measures. Inevitably, trying to fit something as diverse as a national economy into an accounting framework has created peculiarities. Research and development is nothing if not an investment in the future. In the SNA, however, it counts as consumption. The system is especially bad at recording and evaluating investment in human capital such as education. The latest revision, which is the first since 1968, sets out to give more attention to services, and especially financial services, in national economies. One of the more noticeable changes will be the gradual disappearance of gross national product from national accounts to be replaced by gross national income. But there has been no significant change in the boundaries of production. The new SNA will do nothing to assuage feminist economists who have strongly criticised the system, and therefore governments, for largely ignoring the role of women in societies. It does not take account of housework or their unpaid contributions to family businesses and farms, which play a vitally important part in production in developing countries. Environmentalists have long complained that the SNA does not properly reflect quality of life issues such as the costs of pollution. Indeed, pollution, which is destructive, appears in national accounts as a component of economic growth when attempts are made to clear it up. However, because the system covers activities of market significance in a nation's affairs, it does take indirect account of the proceeds of crime. Nonetheless, 1993 SNA revision has a distinguished pedigree. It was worked out by officials from the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. User groups were consulted. A conscious effort was made to involve developing countries in the work. The Soviet Union and its allies took a surprisingly strong interest in the discussions in the late 1980s. Since communism's collapse, the former centrally planned economies have enthusiastically embraced the national accounts system as part of their adoption of market economies. The new system has been harmonised with IMF balance of payments data. It takes proper account of value added tax, which had still to be applied in Europe when the SNA was last revised in 1968. As the new millennium draws near and governments gradually implement the recommendations, economic information will become much more comparable internationally. In theory, this should facilitate co-operation on economic policies in an increasingly interdependent world. However, it is a moot point whether the framework can fairly reflect the complexity of a world in which some nations are experiencing revolutionary changes in social conditions, family structures and the world of work through the application of new technologies to industrial and commercial businesses, while others are struggling to develop beyond subsistence farming. To be fair, the authors of the SNA have recognised its limitations and made provision for nations to overcome some of its inflexibility by setting up 'satellite' accounts. These will enable countries to track developments in health, education, research and development and the environment in a more logical way without overburdening or disrupting the main framework. Indeed, for many national accounts' statisticians, the further development of satellite accounts is a way of developing new techniques that could lead to innovations for the system as a whole. But for that, national statistical offices will need greater financial support from governments than has been the case over the past two decades.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW SNA TRACKS NATIONAL OUTPUT AND WEALTH  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Type of account                 Main items reported  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Opening balance sheet           National wealth in terms of assets,                                 liabilities and net worth, Production                      GDP, value added, Industrial, sector                                 accounts show outputs and inputs etc. Income and its use              National disposable income, consumption,                                 saving: includes types of income and                                 their redistribution Capital                         Capital formation, includes changes in                                 net worth due to saving and net capital                                 transfers Financial                       Acquisition of financial assets,                                 liabilities, net lending and borrowing Revaluation                     Changes in net worth due to changed                                 prices of assets, liabilities Other changes in assets         Covers items such as new discoveries of                                 natural resources, catastrophic losses,                                 uncompensated seizures.

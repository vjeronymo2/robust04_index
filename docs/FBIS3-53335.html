He stressed the need for teaching and  learning the Holy Koran.    In these ceremonies which lasted for more than two hours,  His  Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i described the Muslim Iranian  nation's familiarity with and love for the Holy Koran as a great  divine bounty. He said: Koranic studies are daily increasing  among our nation. The Koran should penetrate the hearts more  than ever before and should be implemented in the society.    Stressing the close ties existing between the Koran and the  Imamate [etrat--Shiite term referring to imams who followed the  Prophet] and the need for the greater reliance of Muslim nations  on these two inseparable entities, the esteemed leader of the  revolution said: Today the slogan of "Koran, Islam, and the  call of God" has spread among Muslim nations. If other Islamic  nations and governments remain together like the Iranian nation  and government and if they rely on the Holy Koran, arrogant  powers cannot dominate such governments.    Referring to the importance of the issue of Palestine, the  esteemed leader described Palestine as a part and parcel of the  Islamic homeland and a land which was the first qiblah  [direction in which Muslims turn during their prayers] of the  Muslims of the world. He said that the influence of the hands  of arrogant powers over the Islamic governments is the main  reason why the issue of Palestine has been forgotten. He added:  The enemies of Islam and Muslims by exerting pressure on Islamic  and Arab governments have taken them out of the arena of  struggle, so much so that these governments discuss minor issues  in their meetings, but the issue of Palestine which is among the  most important issues of the world of Islam is forgotten.

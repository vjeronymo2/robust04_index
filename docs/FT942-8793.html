			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Rough ride for bill on healthcare reform US legislators are facing an uphill task as they begin the thorny task of drawing up a health reform bill. Despite a willingness to make concessions from a few closely involved in the process, a consensus remains as far away as ever. Two of the five congressional committees overseeing the overhaul of the US healthcare system started the formal process of drawing up a bill yesterday. In the Senate labor and human resources committee, Republicans yesterday set out to attack from all sides a proposal from Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, the committee's chairman, which preserves many aspects of President Bill Clinton's plan while limiting the requirements that would be placed on small businesses. But Mr Kennedy's proposal is expected to win support from almost all of his committee's 10 Democratic members, enough to overrule the seven-member Republican minority. In the House of Representatives, Congressman Dan Rostenkowski is not so sure of the backing of all the Democrats on his ways and means committee, which also began a drafting session yesterday. Mr Rostenkowski has warned his members that they must face the uncomfortable choices posed by the reform of health care. The reform raises the prospect of a general tax increase to pay for it if members are unwilling to adopt the employer mandate contained in Mr Clinton's plan, under which employers would have to pay 80 per cent of the costs of health insurance for their workers. The employer mandate has appeared in recent weeks to be sticking in Congress's throat, with Republicans and many centrist Democrats objecting that it would cost jobs by raising costs for businesses. But signals of a possible compromise are emerging, with some senior legislators now willing to accept some form of mandate, so long as smaller businesses are exempted. Senator John Breaux of Louisiana has come up with a proposal that would require large companies to provide health insurance for their workforce but exempt employers with 10 or fewer workers and levying a payroll tax on those with between 11 and 20 workers. Mr Breaux represents a vital swing vote on the Senate finance committee, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by only 11 to nine. The finance committee has so far made less progress than any of the other principal committees towards drafting a bill.</p>

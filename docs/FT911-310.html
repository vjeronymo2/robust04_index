			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Money Markets: D-Mark stays weak THE D-MARK traded among the weaker members of the European exchange rate mechanism last week, despite its slight improvement against the dollar and Japanese yen. Currency trading was subdued, with the early part of the month lacking much important economic news. There were no data on the UK or Japanese economies and the only US figure of any significance was Friday's producer price index for April. Economic news from Germany was not encouraging, increasing the risk that there will be a current account deficit in 1991, after last year's surplus of DM75.5bn. The unified Germany has not yet managed a monthly surplus so far this year. In March the current account shortfall was a substantial DM5.3bn, compared with DM1.5bn in February. A deficit of around DM3.5bn was expected, but payments for the Gulf war increased the figure. A trade surplus of only DM2.8bn, against a forecast of about DM3.5bn, was perhaps more worrying. The size of the problem can be gauged by the fact that the old West Germany had a current account surplus of DM12.2bn and a trade surplus of DM13.8bn in March last year. In the first three months of this year the German current account deficit was DM8.9bn. Demand for goods in the east has sucked in imports and led to a fall in exports, as West German industry has struggled to meet demand. Imports rose 14 per cent to DM159.0bn in the first quarter, compared with a year ago, while exports fell 6.6 per cent to DM165.8bn. This state of affairs, coupled with rising inflation and political instability in eastern Europe is not likely to improve the D-Mark's appeal, particularly if the Bundesbank continues to resist the temptation to raise interest rates.</p>

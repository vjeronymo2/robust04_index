			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / World News in Brief: Oil firms after Opec moves to cut output Crude oil prices started the week stronger after Opec president Alirio Parra indicated that substantial agreement had been reached with Iran and Saudi Arabia on cutting output. Kuwait yesterday signalled willingness to follow suit. In spite of scepticism about whether Opec can achieve its planned 1.5m barrel a day cut in output, March Brent closed 52 1/2 cents higher in London at Dollars 17.875 a barrel.

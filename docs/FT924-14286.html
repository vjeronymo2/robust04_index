			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Markets: The stock price fall may prove justified - Wall Street IF THE Federal Reserve has finished cutting interest rates for the foreseeable future, as a story in the Financial Times suggested yesterday, then this week's nerve-wracking plunge in US stock prices may prove to have been an entirely justified - not to mention welcome - correction in market values. Although the Dow staged a remarkable recovery from its 104-point drop on Monday morning, the index ended the day down 22 points, the losses of the past 6 1/2 days total nearly 120 points, or 3.6 per cent of the average's value. The Dow, as of midday yesterday, was actually below the 3,164 level at which it started 1992. Given the economic and political fundamentals that have framed much of this year's trading - weak growth rates, rising unemployment, depressed consumer confidence, and the growing likelihood that a Republican incumbent would lose the presidency - no one should be particularly surprised at such a poor performance. In some respects, the recent sharp declines in share prices can be interpreted as the final surrender of investors' hopes for a decent economic recovery this year. Anyone who had bought stocks in expectation of further cuts in interest rates, an improvement on the meagre growth rates seen in the first half, and a surge in corporate profits that should normally follow a recession's end, should have been in the vanguard of the sellers this week. A word that cropped up several times in the aftermath of Monday's extraordinary volatility was 'cleansing'. Unpleasant as it may sound, those investors who were selling on Monday, and most of them were institutions, not individuals, administered a much-needed enema to the market. As Byron Wein, chief domestic strategist for Morgan Stanley, put it earlier this week: 'The way the market turned around after losing so much ground in the morning tells you the market has been cleansed. Everybody who wanted to sell has done it.' Some analysts even believe that the low-point reached at 11.30am on Monday of just under 3,100 on the Dow could turn out to be an important new floor for the market. While few suggest stocks are poised for some substantial gains, even less think there is a need for further selling. With next important economic data some weeks away, and the outcome of the election outcome seeming more certain every day, investors' will be switching their attention to corporate earnings, and the third quarter reporting season which begins in earnest next week. There are already signs that profits estimates for the rest of 1992, many compiled in early summer when analysts began to put out cautiously upbeat notices on earnings prospects based on evidence of an upswing in economic activity during the Spring, may need revising. As David Shulman, senior equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, said a few days ago: 'It's back to the drawing board for earning forecasts this year and next." Motor industry analysts are probably scribbling furiously at their drawing boards at this very moment, hastily revising their estimates for Ford, the car maker. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made for the company's planned sale of Dollars 1bn of preferred stock, Ford disclosed that it expects to report a loss for the just-completed third quarter, and that because of economic uncertainty in Europe and the continued weakness in domestic markets, the red ink could spread into the fourth quarter's books. Although Ford also made positive noises about 1993 earnings, the market did not like what it heard, and yesterday Ford shares dropped more than Dollars 3 to Dollars 34 1/2 in the first few hours of trading as investors factored the new development into the company's stock price. Borland International was another company that faced the wrath of disappointed investors this week. The software group's shares fell 25 per cent in two days after several analysts followed each other in downgrading the stock because of what they believed were poor initial sales of Borland's important new spreadsheet product, Quattro Pro for Windows. Borland's share price, however, regained some of that lost ground after the company said early sales of Quattro Pro were better than expected, and protested strongly that analysts were passing judgment on the product too early to draw any meaningful conclusions. In a neat turn of phrase that will probably become popular with many other companies who feel victimised by Wall Street, Borland claimed yesterday it had been a victim of 'pack analysis.'  -------------------------------- Monday      3179.00 - 21.61 Tuesday     3178.19 -  0.81 Wednesday   3152.25 - 25.94 Thursday    3176.03 - 23.78 Friday      3136.58 - 39.45  --------------------------------</p>

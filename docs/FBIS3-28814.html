			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan, U.S. Urged To Talk Calmly"] </F>   [Text] European and U.S. VIP's never fail to make at least  one or two humorous remarks when they hold news conferences.  This sets a mood that permits a calm look even at very tense  situations.    But we did not see even a hint of remarks of this kind at  the  news conference by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who  visited Japan in search of a breakthrough in the framework trade  talks. This reminds us of the severe circumstances surrounding  the Japanese-U.S. summit scheduled for 11 February.    Is there not a clue to solving the dispute? In this respect,  we would like to propose that the Japanese-U.S. vice-ministerial  talks starting on 7 February in Washington be held in a relaxed  atmosphere. We would regret it if the Japanese-U.S.  relationship is impaired by bilateral disputes over such issues  as the trade in autos and insurance services.    To settle the bilateral trade negotiations and ensure that  the Washington summit will be successful, it is essential that  Japan implement the business stimulus package, including an  income tax cut, as soon as possible. A delay in the compilation  of the economic package has greatly influenced the trade talks,  thus forcing the United States to take a more rigid stand.    This is because the U.S. economy is steadily recovering and  because the United States has begun to regain its confidence  about curbing its fiscal deficits and strengthening the  international competitiveness of its enterprises such as its  automakers, which is why the United States is adopting a bullish  attitude. In fact, the United States may well be on its way to  achieving its medium-range targets in the bilateral framework  trade talks.    Japan, on the other hand, is a far cry from its medium-range  target of achieving sustained growth based on domestic demand.  In his talks with U.S. President Clinton last November, Prime  Minister Hosokawa promised that Japan would effect a  business-bolstering package. More than two months have passed  since then. We have to doubt that either the prime minister or  the ruling coalition parties understand the gravity of the  situation.    In addition to the business stimulus package, the government  must rapidly improve the government procurement system and  promote deregulation, both of which the government alone can do  on its own responsibility.    In his talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa and other  important  cabinet ministers, Kantor asked Japan to establish numerical  targets for individual fields as criteria to measure the  openness of the Japanese market. In his news conference, the  U.S. trade representative confirmed that the United States  reiterated its "results-oriented" stand in the framework trade  negotiations and suggested that the United States might impose  sanctions on Japan if the talks proved unsuccessful.    Both U.S. economists and their Japanese counterparts have  expressed objections to the creation of numerical targets. Such  targets should not be adopted because such an action threatens  to bring about managed trade. Moreover, we do not wish to see  the United States threatening the imposition of one-sided  sanctions.    If the United States tries to take advantage of the change  of  Japan's government to press Japan and ignores Japan's past  efforts in completely liberalizing the import of beef and  oranges and increasing government purchases of computers, the  result may be to stir up antipathy in Japan against the United  States. Calm should not be lost.    Japan experienced trade frictions with the United States  during the 12 years of the Republican administration of  Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, but now the atmosphere  in Japan among industry and consumers has changed considerably.  They have come to understand the need to open markets and to  eliminate the price differences between Japan and the rest of  the world. As a result, wider private-sector cooperation has  been promoted between Japan and the United States.    Business enterprises of both Japan and the United States  have  seen further international expansion, and therefore they can no  longer be termed single-nation enterprises. We hope that both  countries' negotiators will not ignore this phenomenon.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-SMOKING ADS  </P> <P> I think it's great to see the start of the state's ad campaign against the  advertising practices of the tobacco industry ("State to Launch Anti-Smoking Ad  Campaign," Part A, April 10). This is a rare case of tax dollars well spent.  </P> <P> But aren't our tax dollars also paying substantial subsidies to the the tobacco  growers? Why don't we just pay tobacco farmers not to grow tobacco in the first  place and save ourselves lots of money all around?  </P> <P> In these times of record budget deficits, declining government services and a  crumbling infrastructure, someone has to be more responsible with our money.  It's time we taxpayers speak up and let our legislators know it's time to start  thinking about the little guy.  </P> <P> ANDREAS CRAWFORD  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

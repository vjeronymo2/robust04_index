			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Several weeks after the proclamation of the  results of the legislative elections which saw the emergence of  a parliamentary majority, Togolese still do not know their  future prime minister. After a long controversy over the choice  of the new head of government, the parliamentary majority,  formed by a coalition of the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR]  and the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD], recently declared  that they have agreed on a name for the post of prime minister.  However, since then the people have been waiting. How does the  Office of the President of the Republic react to this impasse?  Tonight we have invited Koffi Panou, spokesman for the  Presidency of the Republic. He is interviewed by Kodjovi  Gbadayi:    [Gbadayi] Mr. Koffi Panou, good evening.    [Panou] Good evening.    [Gbadayi] You surely heard our colleague Koffiblah's  introduction. Do you have any clarifications to make on this  statement?    [Panou] Yes, certainly, I am going to do that right now. On  the afternoon of Wednesday, 25 March 1994, the head of state  received a letter from the chairman of CAR requesting a meeting  with the two leaders of the parliamentary majority, Mr. Yaovi  Agboyibor and Edem Kodjo, to discuss the condition for the  appointment of a prime minister. The head of state accepted  this request, but he could not get a hold of the two leaders. In  lieu of the meeting scheduled between him and the chairmen of  CAR and UTD to collect their views on the person to be appointed  prime minister, it was through a UTD-CAR joint communique issued  on 26 March 1994 and broadcast on the radio that the head of  state learned that the CAR had officially chosen somebody for  the post of prime minister and that the UTD had agreed to this  choice.    Yesterday, Monday, 28 March 1994, it came to the attention  of  the head of state, through a statement jointly issued by the CAR  and UTD on 26 March 1994, that they had agreed on the following:    1. The person proposed by the CAR for the post of prime  minister and which was agreed upon by the UTD is Mr. Yaovi  Agboyibor.    2. A joint delegation of the two parties composed of (Mr.  Egbor Gahoujor) of CAR, (Georges Ahidame), CAR, (Yao Fegni) of  UTD, and (Atchiabesson Ajavon) of UTD have been charged to  transmit the name agreed upon to the president of the Republic.    The head of state regrets to say that the two leaders of the  parliamentary majority did not deem it necessary to meet with  him so that together they can collect their viewpoints on the  conditions for the appointment of a prime minister, because,  according to the provisions of Article 56 of the Constitution,  the prime minister is not appointed by the parliamentary  majority, but is appointed by the president of the Republic from  among that majority. This calls for a constant dialogue between  the head of state and the two leaders.    It is within this context that, during the recent  discussions  the president had with the two leaders of the majority, the two  leaders were asked to propose several candidates from whom a  prime minister could be appointed in accordance with the  Constitution. Consequently, the president of the Republic deems  it indispensable that consultations should continue to be held  directly between him and the two leaders of the majority.  [passage omitted]</p>

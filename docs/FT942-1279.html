			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: UAL's low-cost division to start flying in October United Airlines, the biggest US carrier, yesterday stepped up the US air fare war by announcing that its new unnamed low-cost subsidiary would start flying on October 1. It said the specialised short-haul carrier would take to the skies with an initial daily schedule of 82 flights spread among 14 routes on the West Coast of the US. It declined to specify the routes, but said seven were served by United and seven were not. Services would be expanded rapidly to 129 flights in November and to 143 flights in December. Fares would be announced later, but would be 'very attractive', UAL said. United's plans for the new airline, dubbed U-2, depend on shareholder approval of its plan to give employees a 55 per cent controlling stake in the parent company in exchange for Dollars 4.9bn-worth of labour concessions. The vote is due on July 12. At least one big institutional investor has said it would vote against the plan. However, if approved, the labour concessions will provide United with the cost structure it needs to fight back against other low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines. United said in addition to low fares, its new operation would feature intensive use of Boeing 737 aircraft with fast turnrounds. But unlike Southwest, it plans to offer first-class as well as economy class, seat assignments at the airport, and in-flight food and drink. United will be the second of the big US carriers to set up a low-cost airline-within-an-airline to compete with smaller low-cost carriers. The first was Continental Airlines with its CALite operation. A third big carrier, Delta Air Lines, has rejected the idea in favour of all-round cost cutting.</p>

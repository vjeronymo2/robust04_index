			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / International Company News: US retailer emerges from Chapter 11 Herman's Sporting Goods, the ill-starred US sporting goods retailer, has emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and plans to expand. Herman's is owned by an investor group led by the New York merchant banks Whitman Heffernan Rhein and Carl Marks. The group bought Herman's in March 1993 and put it into Chapter 11 three days later. Herman's was originally acquired by the UK's Dee Corp (now Gateway) in 1986 for Pounds 278m (Dollars 439.2m), and promptly went into loss as a result of ill-judged expansion. Gateway was taken over in 1989 in the UK's largest buy-out, and attempts were made to sell Herman's. The eventual sale price was believed to have been about Dollars 40m. The new owners have used bankruptcy protection to return Herman's to its stronghold in the north-east states, closing all stores west of Pennsylvania and south of Virginia.</p>

He is deputy chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee  for Defense Sectors of Industry.    [Gundarov] Gennadiy Petrovich, you have devoted all your  life to shipbuilding and you are well acquainted with all the  stages of boom and decline in the Russian Navy's history. In  your opinion what kind of stage is it going through now?    [Voronin] A stage of decline, of course. It takes time to  do what we have to do to overcome this stage in accordance with  the new military doctrine -- with smaller numbers but higher  quality, as the saying goes. But so far there has not been  enough time for the Navy to acquire new qualities, that is for  it to obtain new, high-precision weapons, more modern ships and  command and control systems, and so on. Speaking in broad  terms, we currently have no military equipment program, whereas  in the past we had plans for 10-15 years in advance.    [Gundarov] Just how long do we still have to wait?    [Voronin] We have been waiting for a program for over 18  months. It has now been finalized and signed, but it is not yet  an official document which could be sent to our plants. I think  it will be approved in the first quarter of this year. But the  program is not dogma. Obviously it will still be subject to  amendment, hopefully in the direction of increasing the fleet's  combat strength.    [Gundarov] The press has repeatedly expressed the opinion  that the current reduction in the number of Navy ships is the  consequence not only of the USSR's geopolitical disintegration  and the economic crisis in Russia, but also of mistakes made in  drawing up the preceding shipbuilding programs....    [Gundarov] Everything can be doubted and criticized with the  benefit of hindsight. For example, many people say that we  should not have built aircraft carriers; they say it was too  expensive. But what is cheap? At that historical stage, given  the military doctrine and given the confrontation with NATO and  in particular with the United States, our shipbuilding program  designed to take us through the year 2000 was, I believe,  correct. It was elaborated and approved at collegiums of  various ministries: defense, shipbuilding, and others.    I do not deny that mistakes are made in any business. We  sometimes philosophize that everything should be decided  collectively -- by some kind of oblast committees, soviets, or  collegiums. Nevertheless the role of the individual will, I  think, always influence specific decisions. Recently I went to  America and England and saw how things are done there. There  the role of the individual, judging by what happens, is simply  staggering. Although outwardly it is less noticeable, maybe  because everyone there has more freedom.    [Gundarov] We are now in Russia, where there have always  been people with a preference for certain types of ship. So it  would be interesting to find out which ships you have a  preference for.    [Voronin] I have a preference for the Navy as a whole. I  have carefully studied U.S. naval doctrine. By the year 2000  their combat effectiveness will have increased 100 percent. Not  through the number of ships but through the quality of new  weapons and power-generating systems, in short, through science.  Everything there is resolved in a comprehensive manner. At the  same time it should be noted that many countries have decided to  build small aircraft carriers designed to take 15-20  Harrier-type aircraft. I believe that we too should have these  aircraft carriers in the Northern and Pacific Fleets. They  could be built in St. Petersburg or Severodvinsk. We have the  stocks on which to do that.    But I am concerned by what the Americans are doing now while  we are doing nothing. We have started work to salvage old ships  and submarines. While the United States is practically ceasing  its involvement in salvaging and is converting old ships into  training ships. A ship can be made ready for combat again  within a month or two.    [Gundarov] Do you yourself believe that?    [Voronin] Generally it is hard to believe in something 100  percent. But I know that the work is being done. I do not  think that they will be able to convert all old ships into  training ships, but here we often write off even quite new ships  for scrap.    [Gundarov] For example, the aircraft carrying cruiser Kiev?    [Voronin] Its fate has still not been decided, but it is  predetermined.    [Gundarov] Why can we not take the same road as the  Americans?    [Voronin] We are probably prevented from doing so by a kind  of "special Russian genotype." All the time we are trying to  make economies without investing money in anything. In two  years we have not built a single surface ship. But the problem  of repairing old ships is not being solved either. So far only  the salvaging of submarines has been "stoked up" because  ship-repair plants, which have no other orders at present, have  clutched at this work like a straw.    [Gundarov] What is in store for the Navy in the near future?    [Voronin] We have worked out a program through 2003 in which  we have taken account of the new military doctrine's demands.  The program is based above all on the real situation in  industry. Every plant has a so-called "red" technological line  below which the plant must not go, in order to prevent the  disintegration of production sectors. The illogical thing is  that conversion has proceeded apace, that is, it has been  several times greater than that originally planned. For  example, we have enterprises where the main production decreased  80 percent in one year. In this situation no economic formula  works any more. That is why, when elaborating the economic  program, we took as our basis the task of maintaining  production. But even our minimal program, it turned out, costs  four times as much as the budget available to the Defense  Ministry. I know that the Defense Ministry is currently  battling with the Finance and Economy Ministries. To avoid a  total collapse we have been forced to take a risk: To put new  systems, instruments, and units into production without having  official documents for doing so.    [Gundarov] Are you not afraid that in five years or so  people will at best start criticizing you for building ships  without a program and therefore for making more mistakes?    [Voronin] There is something else that we have to fear:  Being accused of doing nothing. After all, science cannot be  stopped, but what we are doing is not essential. We know how  and on what a potential enemy is working, how a process is  proceeding throughout the world, and what new systems, component  base, and new technologies are being developed. Of course, we  too are compelled to carry out this work, but, it turns out,  with our eyes shut.    [Gundarov] Still, is it not easier to work with our eyes  open, even if on a minimal program?    [Voronin] I do not want to reveal all our secrets. I will  merely note that an enterprise which has been able to get into a  foreign market and make a dollar profit uses it not for its own  social needs but for finding solutions to state tasks, including  scientific developments. We are hard-put to compete with the  Japanese, who already have the fifth generation of radio  electronics in production -- molecular electronics and  biocomputers. But should we not at least keep our finger on the  pulse? Irrespective of whether the new parliament gives money  or not. That is life.    [Gundarov] At the moment Russia has no enemies, politicians  claim. Maybe the need to build new ships intensively has also  ceased?    [Voronin] Sometimes I am asked a simple "peasant" question:  Why can U.S. submarines dart around Severodvinsk while we cannot  do the same near their country? Moreover, the opposing side  refuses to hold any talks on cutting naval forces, considering  itself a great naval power and guarantor of peace. Not only the  United States is looking after its fleet. Work to build up  China's naval forces has now been launched as never before.  Hundreds of representatives of various firms and departments in  that country are coming to us. I have met many of them and  formed the conclusion that they have set themselves the task of  making their country one of the most powerful naval powers in  the near future. Recently I visited South Korea, where I met the  president of the "Khala" [as translaiterated] firm. In 18  months they intend to construct a new state-of-the-art shipyard.  South Korea is currently the world's second biggest shipbuilder  and will probably soon be the biggest. Even that small country  intends to begin building submarines -- diesel submarines for  the time being. While China is already interested in  nuclear-powered submarines. Those two countries' strategy is to  invest colossal amounts of money in their own naval forces. We  have already sensed this during business contacts.    [Gundarov] Do you notice a desire on the part of our  government to maintain Russia's naval might?    [Voronin) ) No. In our country, as is often the case, words  are at variance with actions. Judging from the state orders  which shipbuilders now have, our main customer is foreign rather  than our Defense Ministry: Forty percent of domestic shipyards'  capacities are starting to work for the West.    [Gundarov] In that case, what awaits the industrial complex  which works for the Russian Navy?    [Voronin] We are waiting for the state to settle accounts  with shipbuilders. I will cite just one figure. The state owes  the "Sevmash" production association 130 billion rubles. For  several months we have been promised that this money would be  paid, but the debt has not yet been cleared. Hence the  enterprise has no circulating capital and the production chain  is being destroyed. In short, all this is a string of truisms  about which a considerable amount has already been said.    [Gundarov] Do you have specific proposals as to how to  maintain production?    [Voronin] The matter is complicated by the fact that, on the  one hand, conversion programs apparently exist but, on the  other, they are not being implemented because finance for them  is lacking. Therefore we are not elaborating proposals but  specific subprograms for every plant. They do not have to  choose right now. They are getting to work fulfilling any  orders: Whether they be for peasants, oil or gas industry  workers, or along ecological lines.    [Gundarov] And at the same time shipbuilding technology is  being destroyed?    [Voronin] Yes, from the viewpoint of shipbuilding  construction we are, of course, losing out.    [Gundarov] Maybe this is a consequence of the fact that  there is no Navy lobby in the government?    [Voronin] To some extent I agree with you. There are many  lobbyists of various persuasions. But as far as the Navy goes I  do not see its lobbyists. Yuriy Yarov has a better grasp of the  Navy's problems than others in the government. But  unfortunately he is engaged in resolving other questions. But I  do not sense in certain other people who have reached the  crucible of power any understanding of the tasks facing the  production complex, which in particular provides for the Navy's  needs. This occurs because these people have not passed through  the plant school. The moment has now come when nobody wants to  hear the exhortations of practical people, and they themselves  are called antireformists. But practical people would not have  made the colossal mistakes we are now observing in the  management of industry. The problem of cadres, I believe, is  now the most pressing. Incidentally, I am for reforms, but they  must be carried out in a more evolutionary way.    [Gundarov] What would you do first of all if the situation  in which the Navy found itself depended entirely on you?    [Voronin] It is just the same as asking a mechanic at a  technical servicing center what he would do first of all with a  broken machine. First he would probably have a look at it. If  we start at the beginning, I am convinced that industry could  withstand 5 percent or a maximum of 10 percent conversion.  Foreign experience demonstrates this. As conversion increases  the production process becomes unmanageable, because it comes  into conflict with science and economics. It is therefore hard  to say what should be done first of all when everything has  disintegrated.    Wars are raging all over the world. The situation in the  Near East is complex, and it is becoming acute in Asia. The  brake has been taken off the U.S. Navy. I think I would review  the shipbuilding program and adopt a more careful attitude to  reducing it. Obsolete ships, which are not combat-effective in  a modern war, can be cut. But in fact we are cutting ships  which have been in service only 15 years instead of 25.    Second, whether we like it or not, plants must not be  allowed  to fall below the "red" line. Otherwise no edicts or orders  will save production from collapsing.    [Gundarov] Gennadiy Petrovich, in ending our conversation,  what would you -- the man who is building the Navy -- like to  wish the Navy's sailors in the new year of 1994?    [Voronin] It is hard to find more optimistic people,  although figuratively speaking they have to "fight" every day:  When cruising, on combat service, or on alert status. I would  like to wish that their optimism never deserts them. I am  convinced that better times are ahead for the Navy, because we  have a demonstrable trump card enabling us to be a naval power.  And no political battles can take it away from us.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 14 (YONHAP) -- A meeting of relevant  government officials on Tuesday decided to step up control of  illegal fishing by South Korean fishermen in the Japanese waters.    A source at the fisheries administration said that thanks to  steady control, only 18 cases of illegal fishing in the Japanese  waters were uncovered in the first four months of this year.    The number compares with 374 cases in the corresponding  period of last year.    The source said Tuesday's decision came as illegal fishing  is  feared to swell in the Japanese waters in the high fishery  season of June through August.    Under the intensified control, the maritime police will  assign more patrol boats to potential illegal fishing yards and  will pursue and catch all boats involved, the source added.</p>

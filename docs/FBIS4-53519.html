			<p>BFN     [Text] Private-sector representatives and government  officials clashed hard over the deregulation issue at a meeting  of the "Working Group on Import Promotion, Improvement of Market  Access, and Distribution" of the government's Administrative  Reform Promotion Headquarters (headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata) in the prime minister's office on the morning of 18 May.  The meeting showed very clearly that the private sector wants  deregulation to be carried out while the bureaucrats want to  resist it.    In the meeting, the private-sector representatives openly  complained to ministry bureau directors general: "As long as  government offices act this way, it will be extremely difficult  to achieve any significant results in deregulation that would be  acceptable both at home and abroad."    The government offices' position in trying to defend vested  rights showed up so clearly that the people around the prime  minister were alarmed, saying: "This way, we can never get any  significant plan adopted by the end of June."    The meeting of the day saw five private-sector members of  the  group, which included Professor Tajima of Gakushuin University,  exchange views with director general-level officials from the  Ministries of Finance, International Trade and Industry, and  Transport on topics of controls on commodity distribution,  specifications and permits, and import procedures. It began  with explanations by government officials on the present  conditions of regulation and on the reasons for them. Some of  the officials said: "We will take positive actions [for  deregulation]"; but most of them showed a negative stand,  insisting, "Under the given conditions, we cannot decide for  deregulation."    The private-sector group members reacted strongly against  the  position of the offices resisting deregulation, some saying, "It  is truly regrettable that there is no change in the government  offices' strong attitude toward defending [regulation]. Others  said: "The economy should be free of control in principle. You  must change the attitude of defending regulation, citing Japan's  special circumstances as the reason."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 12 May (EFE) -- The government coalition in  Bolivia is facing the immediate threat of losing one of its  allies and being left without an absolute majority in Congress.    Max Fernandez, leader of the populist Solidarity Civic Union  (UCS), whose deputies guarantee the government's absolute  majority in Congress, harshly criticized President Gonzalo  Sanchez de Lozada after threatening to withdraw his support.    So far the special session of Congress called for 9 May by  Sanchez de Lozada has not been held, because the UCS, in a  demonstration of force, has joined the opposition in boycotting  the president's call.    Sanchez de Lozada "is worse than a dictator" said Max  Fernandez, according to his remarks published by LA RAZON today.    The president "has no reason to tweak my ears, because I am  not anybody's boy. I am a businessman and a person who deserves  respect," said Fernandez, who is the majority owner of the  National Brewery, one of the largest companies in the country.    Max Fernandez announced he will meet with Sanchez de Lozada  in the next few days, assuring that "by God, it will be the last  and definitive meeting between the president and myself."    Sanchez de Lozada, heading the Nationalist Revolutionary  Movement (MNR), won by a simple majority the 6 June 1993  elections.    Thanks to a pact with the UCS, Sanchez de Lozada was elected  president by Congress and was able to form a government  coalition supported by an absolute congressional majority.    On several occasions Max Fernandez has expressed his  dissatisfaction with his party's share of power in the  government, and criticized the president for not consulting with  him on important decisions before implementing them.    As a result of the government pact signed with the MNR, the  UCS heads the Defense Ministry, some secretariats, and embassies.    The other MNR ally is the social democratic Free Bolivia  Movement (MBL), whose seven deputies do not guarantee the  government's absolute majority. The MBL runs the Foreign  Ministry through its president [Antonio Aranibar] who is the  cabinet chief and foreign minister.    The MNR has 52 of the 130 seats in the Chamber of Deputies,  and depends on the 20 seats of the UCS to have an absolute  majority.</p>

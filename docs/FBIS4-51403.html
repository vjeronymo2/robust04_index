			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Guo Baofu (6753 1405 4395) entitled "Deepen </F> Rural Reform And Vigorously Carry Out the Shareholding  Cooperative System"]    [Text] The implementation of the shareholding cooperative  system is a key breakthrough in the rural property right system  as well as a great creation by the Chinese peasants following  the implementation of the system of contracted responsibility on  the household basis with payment linked to output and the sudden  emergence of town and township enterprises. Practice shows that  this system conforms to the development and the changes of the  rural situation; satisfies the broad masses of the peasants's  urgent demands and strong desires for defining collective  property rights, conducting property cooperation, and expanding  the scale of production and management; and accelerates the pace  of having the peasants become fairly well-off.    Just as what we did in those years to carry out the system  of  contracted responsibility for production, we should persistently  proceed from reality to develop shareholding cooperative  enterprises, fully respect the enthusiasm and creativeness of  the masses, give free reins to the development of these  enterprises, adopt different forms according to different actual  conditions, try every possible means to expand the scale of the  implementation of this system and to accelerate the  implementation pace, not stick to one pattern, and not demand  uniformity. To encourage the development of shareholding  cooperative enterprises, we should formulate preferential  policies on developing such enterprises; regard such enterprises  as collective ones; give them preferential treatment in the  scale of management and in the aspects of management, new  product development, technological transformation, capital  input, tax reduction and exemption, industrial and commercial  management, and capital construction; and create conditions for  developing such enterprises.    Now, the shareholding cooperative enterprises in the rural  areas can roughly be divided into four categories as follows:  The enterprises of the first category are set up by pooling  capital from among the people. With township and village  cooperative economic organizations acting as go-between, the  peasants are voluntarily organized to manage the projects  through accurate selections and according to the agreements that  they have attained. Those whose stocks amount to a large  proportion or technicians should be enterprise leaders. The  enterprises of the second category are set up by collectives  with shares. Township and village collectives can become  shareholders by offering land, workshops, equipment, and means  of production as well as investing some money. Peasants can  become shareholders by investing money. Shareholders can enter  plants with capital or make investment instead of labor. All  shareholders can draw extra dividends. The enterprises of the  third category are organized by various sectors. These  enterprises' shares are owned by peasants, enterprises, township  and village collectives, and society. Boards of directors will  assume responsibility for the management of these enterprises.  The enterprises of the fourth category are set up through joint  management and cooperation. As shareholders, urban and rural  institutions and their staff members and workers can cooperate  with rural collectives to develop projects and run enterprises,  break with the bounds of trades, and become shareholders by  offering capital, technologies, land, and other production  factors. Besides the aforementioned four categories, we should  persist in various forms in the course of development, respect  the aspirations of the masses, avoid rigid mediation, and ensure  the sound development of the shareholding cooperative  enterprises.    At the time of vigorously running shareholding cooperative  enterprises, we should focus the change of enterprise mechanisms  on transforming the existing enterprises into shareholding  cooperative ones. Through the forms of converting into stocks  and expanding stocks, we should transform the existing  enterprises into shareholding cooperative ones, further define  property rights, intensify the staff and workers' awareness of  being the masters of enterprises, perfect the enterprise  democratic management and supervision mechanisms, guarantee and  increase the value of enterprise assets, and enhance the reserve  strength for enterprises' development. In the course of  transformation, we should give different instructions to  different enterprises. We should proceed from the increment of  enterprises' property and promote, in a step- by-step manner,  the transformation of enterprises first from those in danger and  with difficulties and those in urgent need of expanding the  scale of production. Practice shows that the following five  enterprise transformation patterns can vigorously be carried  out: First, the pattern of one enterprise with various systems.  The enterprises which are on a larger scale and have larger  amounts of debts and the difficulties in continuing their  management are allowed to have parts of their enterprises with  vitality carry out the shareholding cooperative system. The  rest parts should be auctioned, rent, or managed on a mortgage  or contracted basis. That is, an enterprise can carry out  various systems.    These enterprises' debts should be repaid  year after year by their head plants which rely on collecting  rent and contracted charges. Second, the pattern of measuring  property. The enterprises whose plants are built with  collective investment, whose property value has increased by a  big margin, and whose staff members and workers have made great  contributions as well as those with small profits and capability  to maintain their production should thoroughly conduct  transformation by sorting out and assessing property, defining  property rights, and converting property into stocks and  marketing these stocks to rural collectives, enterprises, and  staff members and workers. Third, the pattern of increment of  property. The enterprises with good economic results, readily  marketable products, and appropriate prospects for development  but in need of more working funds to develop new projects, to  increase new products, and to expand the scale of production and  management should externally draw stockholders and investment to  expand the increment of property and internally define property  rights to staff members and workers. Simultaneously, a portion  of these enterprises' stocks should be controlled by rural  collectives and the rest should be marketed to society. Fourth,  the pattern of transferring property rights. The enterprises  with less property, small profits, or deficits; on a smaller  scale; and without hope to change their situation within a short  period of time under the restrictions of objective conditions  should sort out and evaluate their property, fix prices for  themselves, and market themselves to stockholders so that they  will become shareholding cooperative enterprises without  collective money paid for shares. Meanwhile, rural collectives  should withdraw the money from marketing property rights to  develop another new enterprises. Fifth, the pattern of  shareholding companies. The enterprises with different scales,  economic results, and management forms as well as with certain  difficulties in independent development and that supplement with  one another to a certain extent through cooperation should be  organized into shareholding cooperative companies with key  enterprises playing a dominant role. These companies can rely on  their collective advantages to pioneer markets.    In line with the principles of development before  standardization, of standardization in the course of  development, and of transformation after standardization, we  should standardize the systems governing formulating  regulations, defining property rights, setting up organizations,  exercising management, distributing extra dividend, and making  guaranteeing measures so as to organize, perfect, transform, and  standardize town and township enterprises' shareholding  cooperative systems. First, it is necessary to scientifically  calculate stocks and reasonably define stock rights. According  to the principles of voluntary purchases of stocks, of equality  between shareholders, of shareholders with the same amounts of  stocks being distributed with the same amounts of profits, and  of sharing profits and running risks on equal terms, we should  mainly establish stocks for the rural areas, society, social  legal persons, foreign investors, and individuals. We should  define the total volume of enterprise stocks and the price for  each stock to enable all the staff members and workers of the  newly built enterprises and the enterprises whose increment has  been expanded to buy enterprise shares so as to enhance their  enthusiasm and sense of responsibility to run the enterprises  well and to enable their staff and workers to have both rights  and duties and not only to participate in management but also to  run risks. The staff members and workers of these enterprises  must not get a refund for their stocks. The shareholders who  are not working at enterprises should neither be engaged in  management and policy-making nor get a refund of their money for  shares before expiration of their terms. But, they can be  distributed with fixed amounts of dividends. To ensure that  enterprises have sufficient reserve strength for development, we  should define enterprises' property accumulated by enterprises  themselves and added through state tax reduction and exemption  as enterprise stocks. The profits distributed to enterprises  according to the enterprise stocks can only be retained by  enterprises for use to expand production. That is, enterprise  stocks must not be obtained by any individuals. Second, it is  necessary to perfect organizations, regulations, and systems.  To strengthen the leadership and management of the shareholding  cooperative enterprises, these enterprises should set up the  systems to hold meetings of shareholders and shareholders  congresses. These meetings and congresses can elect and produce  boards of directors and boards of supervisors; define rights and  duties for the boards, methods for producing enterprise legal  persons, management strategies, methods for establishing and  managing funds paid for shares, and major policies on  distribution of profits; formulate enterprise regulations and  systems for management of financial affairs, labor, materials,  and quality to standardize enterprises' activities. Third, we  should take all aspects into consideration and achieve the  distribution of profits. We should focus the standardization of  shareholding cooperative enterprises on distribution of extra  dividends; take into consideration the profits of owners,  managers, and producers; ensure the payment of various taxes to  the state; guarantee that enterprises have sufficient reserve  strength for development; combine the principle of distribution  according to work with that of distribution according to stocks;  and accurately handle the ratios in the distribution of labor  wages. According to the demands for expansion of production,  enterprises should annually obtain a portion of after-tax  profits, convert this portion of money into stocks, and  distribute these stocks to shareholders for use to expand  production. The enterprises that are in the initial stage of  carrying out the shareholding cooperative system are allowed to  carry out the policy on retaining interests and distributing  extra dividends so as to encourage increasingly more people to  buy stocks and to become major shareholders. The interests of  the money paid for stocks should be listed into production and  management costs. Shareholding cooperative enterprises should  be treated as rural collective enterprises, enjoy all  preferential policies, and draw and use various special funds  according to the standards for collective enterprises.</p>

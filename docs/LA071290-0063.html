			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: SIMPLE LUNCH IS SIMPLY DELICIOUS  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Since we have a microwave oven at work, I bake potatoes for my  lunch and have been experimenting with different toppings.  </P> <P> One of my favorites is to put spaghetti sauce, a sprinkle of oregano and some  grated mozzarella cheese in the potato and then microwave it for the required  time. It is simply delicious.  </P> <P>  -- MARTHA, Albuquerque  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I love to make homemade puddings, but cleaning up is a chore. The  pan is awful, requiring scrubbing and plenty of elbow grease. What can I do?  </P> <P>  -- A Reader, Salt Lake City  </P> <P> DEAR READER: Try greasing the bottom of the pan with butter or margarine to  keep the pudding from sticking. Clean-up will be a snap.  </P> <P> Thanks for writing and good luck with your next batch of pudding.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have found a great use for yogurt containers. Each morning I  pack lunches for my three children, and since the bags often get squashed, I  hadn't been putting potato chips or other crushable treats in them.  </P> <P> But now I put chips, cookies and other crumbly goodies in an empty, clean  yogurt container, put on the lid and the treats stay in one piece until lunch  time.  </P> <P> Mothers will appreciate this idea and children will enjoy their crunchier  lunches.  </P> <P>  -- KATHI, San Francisco  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: We love tacos, but do the kids make a mess -- meat, lettuce,  tomatoes, cheese and sauce everywhere.  </P> <P> Now I place a taco in a coffee filter and hand one to each kid. All the falling  food lands in the filter and the kids eat all the taco. Clean-up is a snap too.  </P> <P>  -- J. O., El Paso, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My brother and I have a special way of saving candy. We take a  small jar and label it "rainy day savings" and put all of the extra candy in  it. Later, when we are cooped up in the house because it's either too wet or  too cold to go outside, we take out the jar and have a snack.  </P> <P> It's neat, easy and it makes staying inside more fun.  </P> <P>  -- KATIE and BRANDON, Great Falls, Va.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: When I take a cold coffee mug out of the cupboard in the morning,  I set it on top of the drip coffee-maker when it starts brewing.  </P> <P> By the time the coffee is ready, the mug is warm and that first drink stays hot  a lot longer.  </P> <P>  -- DOTTI, Woodstock, Va.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: As a new mother, I am happy to see that many grocery stores now  have baby seats as well as child safety restraints in their shopping carts.  However, I was appalled when I found the major children's department stores in  our area have no restraints whatsoever in their shopping carts.  </P> <P> You would think stores that cater to the needs of babies and children would be  more safety-conscious. Since they are not, I have been forced to purchase a  safety restraint to use in these shopping carts or in highchairs in  restaurants.  </P> <P> Stores and restaurants that do have restraints in their shopping carts and  highchairs should pay more attention to their condition. Many times they have  parts missing so that using the highchair or cart may imperil a child.  </P> <P> If safety starts at home, businesses should not cause the practice to end the  minute you step in their front door.  </P> <P>  -- CONSTANCE, Toledo, Ohio  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: When I make rice-cereal/marshmallow treats for my grandson, I  save the inner wax paper from the cereal box. I butter it a little, pour the  mixture on it and shape the treats with my hands. Saves messing up a dish.  </P> <P>  -- D. M., Longview, Tex.  </P></p>

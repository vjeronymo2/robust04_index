			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTES;  </P> <P> STAR PITCHER MARK BECK OUT FOR YEAR;  </P> <P> HE REINJURES SHOULDER THAT FORCED WITHDRAWAL FROM OLYMPIC TRIALS  </P> <P> Mark Beck, the Cal State Fullerton pitcher who withdrew from U.S. Olympic team  competition with a shoulder injury last year, is out for the upcoming college  season and will undergo surgery within 2 weeks.  </P> <P> Beck, a junior right-hander, had been rehabilitating the shoulder but reinjured  it while throwing about 2 weeks ago.  </P> <P> Beck, who set a Fullerton record for strikeouts in a season with 162 last year,  was named a preseason All-American by Baseball America magazine.  </P> <P> He had a 10-7 record last season for the Titans, who advanced to the semifinals  of the College World Series.  </P> <P> "We're certainly going to miss Mark this year, but we're still confident in our  pitching staff," Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell said in a released statement.  "We sure hate to lose a player of Mark's caliber, but this just means somebody  else is going to have to step forward."  </P> <P> Fullerton will not make a decision on whether John Sneed, acting basketball  coach, will get the job before opening the position for applications, Athletic  Director Ed Carroll said Monday.  </P> <P> "We have an institutional commitment to affirmative action and an open-search  process," Carroll said. "We are going to go through our regular process."  </P> <P> Carroll, who publicly defined the selection process for the first time Monday,  said the decision is not an indication of Sneed's chances.  </P> <P> Fullerton has begun publicizing the opening and expects to close application  filings by late February. A coach could be named as soon as the day after the  season ends, Carroll said.  </P> <P> Sneed, an assistant under George McQuarn for 8 seasons, was named acting coach  after McQuarn resigned Nov. 3. He has said he is an applicant for the job since  that day. ROBYN NORWOOD  </P></p>

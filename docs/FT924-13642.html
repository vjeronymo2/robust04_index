			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Most taxpayers happy with Revenue ALMOST two thirds of taxpayers are satisfied with the overall level of service they get from the Inland Revenue, according to a survey carried out for the Revenue. The survey, by Research International, found that 65 per cent were satisfied and about 10 per cent dissatisfied. About 20 per cent had no strong feelings either way. The main priority for taxpayers taking part in the survey was for the Inland Revenue to get things right the first time. They were also keen that differences should be resolved quickly. Issues identified by the survey included the lack of authority of staff to deal with specific questions and difficulties in getting through to the right person on the telephone. The survey also found that taxpayers wanted more information about tax, and were often unsure about how their tax was worked out. The Revenue said yesterday that it was looking at measures to strengthen accuracy and improve the telephone service. Further efforts were being made to improve letters, forms and leaflets, and measures under consideration included videos, evening classes and workplace clinics. Plans announced by the Revenue in March would focus customer service on high-street offices modelled on building society branches, with clerical work concentrated in as few as 20 back offices. Frontline staff would be given the authority to respond to inquiries and resolve queries promptly. The survey was commissioned by the Revenue as part of its efforts to improve customer service under the Citizen's Charter. The survey interviewed 1,678 people across the country, including both employees and the self-employed. Further surveys are planned on the needs of particular groups such as employers and pensioners and to monitor how well the Revenue is doing in meeting taxpayers' needs.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Intel Says New Supercomputer Rivals Cray's: Intel Corp. unveiled a  supercomputer that industry analysts said should gain a share of the growing  business but is unlikely to hurt market leader Cray Research. Intel said its  iPSC/860 machine would offer performance to rival the Cray Y-MP supercomputer  at one-tenth the price, but analysts said it was aiming more at commercial  users rather than Cray's traditional research base. Intel said aircraft  manufacturer Boeing Co. had already decided to buy the machine, which will be  available in quantity by March starting at $265,000.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the period prior to January 1, 1995, the first step of the phase-in of the EFT system will be carried out through binding agreements entered into between the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and certain third party bulk data processors (processors) under which the processors have committed to make deposits of Federal depository taxes of certain of their customers by EFT in such a manner as to ensure that the amounts are credited to the general account of the Treasury by the deposit due date. These agreements will take effect beginning in the latter part of fiscal year 1994 and will continue for a period of time into fiscal year 1995. A taxpayer who is a customer of a processor that is a party to one of these agreements may have its deposits that are subject to such an agreement made by the processor pursuant to the terms of the agreement until the expiration or termination of the agreement. However, the taxpayer continues to be responsible for the deposit of those depository taxes that are not subject to such agreement. If a taxpayer whose deposits are being made by a processor pursuant to such an agreement becomes required to deposit by electronic funds transfer pursuant to &sect;31.6302&hyph;1T(h)(1)(ii) of these temporary regulations, the taxpayer is responsible for making deposits by electronic funds transfer of those depository taxes not subject to the agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For periods after December 31, 1994, the temporary regulations require that deposits be made by EFT based on the taxpayer's total deposits of taxes imposed by chapters 21, 22, and 24 during certain ``determination'' periods. If a taxpayer's total deposits of the taxes imposed by chapters 21, 22, and 24 during the determination period exceed a prescribed dollar threshold, the taxpayer must begin depositing by EFT on and after the applicable effective date prescribed in the regulations, unless otherwise exempted. (A taxpayer will become subject to the EFT requirement for the applicable effective date ``January 1, 1996'' by exceeding the threshold amount during either calendar years 1993 or 1994). The phase-in schedule is as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,tp0,i1,s45,r45,r45 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Threshold amount  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Determination period  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Applicable effective date <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> $78 million  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1&hyph;1&hyph;93 to 12&hyph;31&hyph;93  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> January 1, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 47 million  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1&hyph;1&hyph;93 to 12&hyph;31&hyph;93  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> January 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 47 million  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1&hyph;1&hyph;94 to 12&hyph;31&hyph;94  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> January 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50 thousand  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1&hyph;1&hyph;95 to 12&hyph;31&hyph;95  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> January 1, 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50 thousand  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1&hyph;1&hyph;96 to 12&hyph;31&hyph;96  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> January 1, 1998.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20 thousand  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1&hyph;1&hyph;97 to 12&hyph;31&hyph;97  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> January 1, 1999. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The thresholds set forth in this phase-in schedule have been set by taking into account the minimum percentages prescribed by NAFTA, the need for administrative convenience and simplicity, and the potential need for exemptions from the EFT system for certain small businesses. Therefore, the thresholds for the January 1, 1995 and January 1, 1996 effective dates were specifically set to satisfy the statutory minimum percentages. The $50,000 threshold for the January 1, 1997 effective date will result in receipts of depository taxes somewhat in excess of the percentage prescribed by NAFTA. For purposes of administrative convenience and simplicity, this threshold was adopted to require the participation of an entire class of taxpayers, that is, those taxpayers that are classified as ``semi-weekly'' depositors of employment taxes (the taxes imposed by chapters 21, 22, and 24). Finally, the $20,000 threshold for the January 1, 1999 effective date was set to satisfy the statutory percentage while allowing for the possibility that the smallest of depositors will be exempted from the EFT system. As described in paragraph C of this preamble, the IRS solicits comments on the impact of these regulations on small businesses. Based on those comments, the IRS will determine those categories of small businesses, if any, that should be exempted from the EFT requirements, and may adjust the threshold for the January 1, 1999 effective date to bring in additional taxpayers while at the same time accommodating any appropriate exemptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although only the taxes imposed by chapters 21, 22, and 24 are used to determine whether a taxpayer is subject to the EFT deposit requirement, the requirement, once triggered, applies to all federal taxes (not just the taxes imposed by chapters 21, 22, and 24) that the taxpayer is required to deposit pursuant to regulations prescribed under section 6302 of the Code. Once a taxpayer becomes subject to the EFT deposit requirement, the taxpayer must continue to deposit by EFT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At present the IRS has in place a voluntary electronic funds transfer (EFT) system in which a taxpayer may by telephone or computer effectuate an electronic funds transfer through the use of one of two payment options: debit and credit. The debit option is effected by using a Financial Agent of the Department of Treasury. The taxpayer requests the Financial Agent to initiate the transfer of funds from the taxpayer's bank account(s) to Treasury's general account and transmit the related tax payment data, supplied by the taxpayer, to the IRS. The credit option is effected by using the taxpayer's financial institution. The taxpayer requests the financial institution to initiate the transfer of funds to the Treasury's general account and submit the related tax data, supplied by the taxpayer, to a Financial Agent for transmission to the IRS. The EFT system required to be used in connection with these regulations will employ similar options and procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Exemptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6302(h)(1)(B) of the Code, as added by NAFTA, provides that the regulations may contain such exemptions as the Secretary may deem appropriate. The Senate Report accompanying section 6302(h) strongly encourages the Secretary of the Treasury to consider the impact of the regulations on small businesses. S. Rep. No. 103&hyph;189, 103d Cong., 1st Sess., at 61 et. seq. (1993). The report recommends that the regulations should not create hardships for small businesses and that no small business should be required to purchase computers or gain access to any electronic equipment other than a touch-tone telephone. Further, the report urges the Secretary to take into account the specific needs of small employers, including possible exemption for the very smallest businesses from the new electronic funds transfer system. The phase-in schedule included in the temporary regulations defers use of the EFT system by the smallest businesses until at least calendar year 2000. The IRS welcomes comments about the impact of the temporary regulations on small businesses and will consider any suggestions regarding how small businesses should be treated under the regulations in order to implement Congressional intent. Based on the comments and suggestions received, the IRS will determine those categories of small businesses, if any, that should be exempted from the EFT requirements and publish such determinations in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. (See &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Special Analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been determined that these temporary regulations are not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, a copy of these regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Drafting Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> PULITZER COMMITTEE FINALLY DID ITS DUTY  </P> <P> Once upon a time, in fact the last year the Baltimore Orioles won the World  Series, Jim Murray, a sports columnist for The Los Angeles Times, wrote that  "Baltimore, the team, is a lot like the city. Monotonous. It's like watching  nine guys run a lathe. Or mow a lawn. . . . The weather is like the team. Gray.  Colorless. Drab. . . . It would be a great place to stage 'Hamlet,' but not  baseball games. It doesn't really rain; it just kind of leaks. You get the  picture of Baltimore as a guy standing on a corner with no place to go and the  rain dripping off his hat. . . .  </P> <P> "The ballpark looks like the Christians and lions are coming on next. It's not  a ruin exactly. More like a Civil War monument. They forgot to put the roof on.  A plane once crashed in the upper deck here. Some said he thought it was an old  tobacco shed."  </P> <P> And they gave this guy the Pulitzer Prize last week?  </P> <P> You bet they did, although they took their sweet time about it. If the award  had come much later in Murray's career, Willard Scott would have had to make  the announcement. When asked for a reaction, Murray, typically, said he thought  it was great because the award would make it easier for the obit writers.  </P> <P> Actually, he doesn't need the imprimatur of some self-important committee that  should have recognized long ago what everyone in my business has understood for  years. All the obit boys would have to say, sometime in the distant future, is  that Jim Murray was the greatest sportswriter who ever lived and leave it at  that.  </P> <P> The greatest? Didn't he take a stiletto to Baltimore and make like Zorro? Sure.  And it caused quite a stir at the time. What people didn't understand is that  for a city to get the Murray treatment is not unlike Shakespeare writing about  some dead king. It's a kind of immortality. In fact, civic leaders from  Spokane, Wash., a town in desperate need of some immortality, once begged  Murray to add their city to his long hit list.  </P> <P> "The only trouble with Spokane, Wash., as a city," Murray began, "is that  there's nothing to do after 10 o'clock. In the morning."  </P> <P> Murray is different from other sportswriters, which is to say better, of  course. He is unique. He is the prince of hyperbole, who never met a straight  line he didn't like. And no matter how broad a brush he uses to paint his word  pictures, Murray's tend to come out looking like the "Mona Lisa."  </P> <P> At the Indy 500, he wrote, "Gentleman, start your coffins."  </P> <P> When he returned to writing after losing one eye to a detached retina, he  wrote, "Old Blue Eye is back."  </P> <P> He warns his readers not to play cards with a guy named Doc, and when Casey  Stengel died, he wrote, "Well, God is getting an earful today."  </P> <P> He has profiled a thousand athletes, and I swear to you that each one of them,  no matter how famous, has the column framed and hanging on a wall somewhere.  It's a kind of immortality. Other writers fill in the blanks, tell you the  count on the home run, give you the details. Murray, who started out on the  Hollywood beat for Time magazine, has made the games and the people come alive  in his columns for 30-odd years now, sometimes as often as five days a week.  And, finally, the Pulitzer committee had to say as much.  </P> <P> Before Murray, there were only three sportswriters to have won a Pulitzer. All  of them wrote for the New York Times, a great newspaper that cares little about  the games it covers. Murray's award was an award for all of us who do care. It  said that sports was important, or at least as important as drama or opera. It  also said that satire was satire, whether the topic was the Orioles or Dan  Quayle. It said that great writing was great writing, although Murray would  probably have none of that. A gentle, modest man, who has never understood the  fuss made over him, Murray likes to sum up his career by saying it would have  been better to have been a failed playwright.  </P> <P> But Murray writes truth, the essence of any great writer. And like many who  deal in humor, he is at his best when serious, when he tells us of the loving  wife who died or of the slaughter of the Israeli innocents -- and our innocence  -- at Munich. He can even write a great column about moving, if the move is  from the beaches of Malibu to the safe and solid life inland. He wrote: "I will  envy you when I hear rain falling on pavement, and I know you are watching my  storm come in -- long gray veils of rain sweeping in from the tossing seas,  leaving the temples of the mountains with the hoar of mist, what the poet calls  'the compassionate sweet laughter of the rain, the gray-eyed daughter of the  mist above the flawed and driven tide.' Then, and not only then, but mostly  then, will I miss my lovely, lost land, my sunset, my ocean, my 18 Christmases  by the side of my lovely sea."  </P> <P> And on another day, with deadline calling, he could summon up these words: "I  said New York was the largest chewing gum receptacle in the world. . . . I said  Minneapolis and St. Paul didn't like each other, and from what I could see, I  didn't blame either of them.  </P> <P> " 'Is L.A. such a big deal?' they ask. No, it's not. It's under-policed and  over-sexed. . . . It's 400 square miles of slide area. One minute you're  spreading a picnic lunch on the Palisades and the next you're treading water in  the Pacific."  </P> <P> I was once a young writer on The Los Angeles Times, and like all young writers  on The Times, I wanted to be Jim Murray. I tried. You don't know how hard I  tried. Finally, an old hand came to me and said, "Son, there's only one Jim  Murray. Try to be somebody else."  </P> <P> I came to settle for just knowing the man and reading him every day and  understanding what the word "inimitable" means. And when I decided to leave Los  Angeles to come to the Baltimore Sun, Murray came up to me, put his arm around  my shoulder and said straight-faced, "Mike, did they tell you it was  Baltimore?" Honest to God.  </P></p>

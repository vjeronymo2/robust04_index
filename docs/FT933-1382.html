			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Car output up but may fall again CAR production last month jumped by 25.4 per cent to 66,653 compared with August last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders announced yesterday. But the society warned that cuts announced recently would seriously depress output in the final months of the year. Car production in the first eight months of this year rose 8.1 per cent to 927,723 from 858,417 in the corresponding period a year ago. The rise is in stark contrast to steep falls in the rest of western Europe. Mr Geoffrey Whalen, president of the society, warned that car producers were now being hit by the effects of 'the huge fall' in car registrations in continental Europe. 'It now appears likely that, following a number of production cutbacks, the British-based industry will this year produce no more than it did in 1992,' he said. The benefit of higher car sales was being countered by the fall in exports to continental Europe, he said. At the same time, the continuing steep decline in the production of commercial vehicles was 'a source of great concern'. Output of commercial vehicles in August at 5,428 was 56 per cent lower than in the same month a year before, while production in the first eight months of the year has fallen by 29.7 per cent year-on-year to 123,403. The forecast of unchanged output for 1993 was a setback for the industry, which had expected 'a considerable build-up of production' this year, said Mr Whalen. Car output in the first eight months of the year has been boosted by the start-up of production by Toyota and Honda at their new plants in Burnaston, near Derby and in Swindon, and by the rapid build-up of output by Nissan at its Sunderland plant. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has given its support to the Motorfair Show at Earl's Court in London, which has been organised every two years since the SMMT's 'official' show moved to Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre in 1978. There will now be an annual show alternating between London and Birmingham. This year's Motorfair, which has already been renamed the London Motor Show, will take place at Earls Court between October 21 and 31.</p>

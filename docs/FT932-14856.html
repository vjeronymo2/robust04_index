			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Pioneer looks east for profit: The challenges facing ABB's engineering ventures in the former communist bloc Four years after the fall of the Berlin wall, western industry has still not quite made up its mind about eastern Europe. The opportunities are plainly there. But, as most of the pioneers have found, so are the problems. An excellent case study is provided by one of the most successful of these pioneers, the Swiss-Swedish electrical engineer Asea Brown Boveri. ABB now controls about 20 companies across eastern Europe, mostly former state monopolies. They make money, if not yet enough to cover the cost of buying them. They employ some 20,000 people in the region. In five years, ABB aims to double that. Talking to those employees today produces a striking story of a clash of cultures: one driven by production, the other by marketing and finance. In the old socialist system, says the head of ABB's Hungarian operation, 'people had no feeling for money'. But the system also produced a proud tradition of engineering. ABB's new workers were mostly eager to embrace western techniques of management, if only to secure their jobs in a capitalist world. When it came to their technical skills, they were less ready to be pushed around. The German head of ABB Lummus Chemoprojekt, an engineering firm based in the Czech city of Brno, says: 'You need to be sensitive to what people have done for the past 25 years, which is to be good engineers.' The second in command at ABB's Prague head office, an Americanised Czech, puts it more bluntly: 'You can't just say 'wake up guys, everything you've been doing is crap; let's start from the beginning.' ' But the implied antithesis between eastern engineering skill and western business methods is essentially false. ABB's western managers agree in their respect for the technical competence produced by the old system. But when it came to advanced technology, ABB's new eastern companies had nothing to offer. Even the turbines and switchgear they turned out were mostly old-style ABB products made under licences signed in the old communist days. Updating that technology took time. 'From the beginning', says a director of ABB's Polish business, 'our approach was to transfer the software first, the hardware second. We began with a lot of training, for instance in marketing and sales. Then we started the technological transfer. You don't give a kid an expensive toy before he knows how to play with it.' There was a similar gap in factory management. A Polish manager at ABB's huge Zamech plant, at Elblag in northern Poland, recalls the old days. 'We were extremely centralised here. We had one manufacturing plant for everything, with one manufacturing director in charge. Every product was designed in one central design office: turbines, ship's propellers, gearboxes. In one process office, they prepared production sheets for marine products and turbines. We had central purchasing. We had huge overheads. It was a stupid way of doing things.' By another quirk of the system, Zamech had to take raw materials in huge bulk simply to ensure supply - 'minimum deliveries of 10 tonnes of a raw material, even when we needed only 200kg', the manager says. Since ABB took over in 1991, inventories have been slashed from over 200 days' sales to less than 60. The factory area, meanwhile, has been halved for the same level of output. The ABB revolution involved other sensitivities. Mr Pavel Olechnowicz, chief executive of the Zamech plant, says: 'We can change at the top quickly, and we can then educate the shop floor through training programmes. The big problem is those in the middle.' Significantly, Mr Olechnowicz comes new to the job. Shortly before the ABB takeover, the Zamech workers' council decided to get rid of the old chief executive and elect a new one. Mr Olechnowicz was plucked from the humble job of foundry manager to run the whole plant. 'I find it easier to change my mentality than some of my colleagues,' he says. 'I had limited experience of the old system.' Others are less fortunate. Across ABB's eastern empire, one meets senior managers who are clearly struggling to adjust. These men had spent their lives working their way to the top of huge organisations, responsible not just for output but for social life and the surrounding infrastructure. They are now mere production managers, subject to whippersnappers at head office who are young enough to master the new skills of finance, marketing and the English language. But at least the whippersnappers are mostly local in origin. The alternative, imposing western management, seems more problematic again. One of ABB's Hungarian managers spent some months working for a Hungarian-Italian joint venture, and did not relish the experience. 'There were 40 Italians in charge, with 40 interpreters', he says. 'No decision could be taken without at least two Italian signatures. They didn't trust their own staff.' He draws a blunt conclusion. 'Foreign managers don't understand the Hungarian way of life. The workers don't accept them.' Local sensibilities can be offended in other ways. An example much quoted in Hungary is the 1990 takeover of the lighting manufacturer Tungsram by General Electric of the US. The deal proved disastrous, with GE sinking Dollars 500m in a venture which is still heavily loss-making. More important for GE's local reputation, it was also obliged to axe 18,000 jobs from a workforce of 28,000. ABB has proved more adroit. Its method was to negotiate in advance precisely how much of the business it wanted to take on. The ancillary services, down to the works canteen, the barber shop or the haulage business, were left with the state or hived off to management buyouts. Manufacturing employees, from top management down, were picked individually by interview. As an ABB executive puts it, 'we don't take the lazy ones, or the ones who are set in their ways. We leave them to the state.' It might be asked what ABB gets in return for all this effort. That involves a strategic question which goes to the heart of the whole issue of investment in eastern Europe. Is ABB there to develop the local market, or to switch production from its high-cost plants in the west? Mr David Hunter, the American president of ABB's Polish operation, says: 'Originally, much of the idea was that Poland could become the Taiwan of Europe. That's still part of ABB's thinking. But as we get smarter about the Polish market, we see the potential here.' What Mr Hunter has in mind is the rebuilding of Poland's infrastructure, its power industry in particular. 'In power generation, if you include the modernisation of obsolete plant and cleaning up the rest, there's 10 or 20 years of business.' Who will fund that is another question. The problem, Mr Hunter says, is Russia. 'There's a big black hole to the east of us, and if nothing is done about it that could be catastrophic. In that context, Poland has a very low priority. The soft loans from the west will go clear over our heads.' Ultimately, ABB clearly still hopes to switch some production to the east. The process will be slow. With the power generation industry still in recession worldwide and ABB's western plants suffering from idle capacity, now is not the time to make matters worse. Despite that, it is hard not to be impressed by the high spirits of ABB's eastern management. They have seen the western future, and it works. ABB's western competitors might also ponder a simple fact. ABB Zamech made a net profit margin in 1991-92 - on ABB's accounting principles - of some 9 per cent on about Dollars 100m of turnover. Next year's margin is expected to be higher. If that can be achieved when the region is in chaotic transition, ABB could be on to something.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- ESTONIA                        Employees:     30  -------------------------------------------------------------------- ABB Harju Eiekter            Installation ABB Flakt Estonia            Environment  -------------------------------------------------------------------- RUSSIA                         Employees:    600  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Several joint ventures  -------------------------------------------------------------------- POLAND                         Employees:  8,400  -------------------------------------------------------------------- ABB Zamech                   Turbines ABB Dolmel                   Generators Dolmel Drives                Drives ABB Elta                     Transformers  -------------------------------------------------------------------- CZECH REPUBLIC                 Employees:  6,600  -------------------------------------------------------------------- ABB Chemoproject             Process engineering ABB ZPA                      Protection relays ABB PBS                      Boiler &amp; turbines ABB EJF                      Medium voltage switchgear  -------------------------------------------------------------------- HUNGARY                        Employees:    700  -------------------------------------------------------------------- ABB Lang                     Turbines ABB Szerviz                  Service ABB Energir                  Network control  -------------------------------------------------------------------- CROATIA                        Employees:    450  -------------------------------------------------------------------- ABB Power Plant              Turbines  -------------------------------------------------------------------- ROMANIA                        Employees:  1,700  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Energoreparatii              Power plant service  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peruvians feast on guinea-pig and chips - One thoroughbred specimen can now serve four hungry people A QUARTER guinea-pig and chips is an increasingly common menu item in the small towns of the high Peruvian Andes. Nothing remarkable in the protein source - local inhabitants have been eating guinea-pig for thousands of years. A whole animal has traditionally been the portion, as the creatures tend to be small. Now a well-researched programme of genetic improvement plus an imaginative initiative by international aid agency Care are starting to bear fruit - and provide much-needed animal protein in the Andean diet. 'Guinea-pig meat is excellent food value,' says Mr Jose Sarria, head of the research programme at Lima's national agrarian university of La Molina. 'It's higher in protein and lower in fat than beef, pork, lamb or chicken.' The Andean farmers and their families, who are primarily responsible for the millions of guinea-pigs that Peruvians consume each year, know it's delicious. Even though the guinea-pig, or 'cuy' as it is most commonly known in Peru, is first cousin to the rat it has a different number of chromosomes. Mating between the species is impossible, experts assure the squeamish. Cuyes are traditionally to be found scurrying about the dirt floors of Andean kitchens, eating whatever scraps of food and vegetable peelings come their way. Always handy, they get plucked and thrown into the pot whenever there is reason for a party - Andean weddings, local saints' days and visits from relatives are never celebrated without cuy. But this type of small animal management, or mismanagement, has caused genetic deterioration in a species native to the Andes. When animals of all ages and sizes and both sexes run free, in-breeding swiftly becomes a problem, which the exceptionally short biological cycle of the cuy exacerbates. Females can come on heat as early as 25 days old, but they will produce small and often weak litters that their own underdeveloped bodies are incapable of feeding adequately. Standard Andean grasses, maize stalks or potato peelings, while convenient, do not produce what the locals term 'the giant cuy'. Mr Sarria says the improved guinea-pig needs a diet of 18 per cent protein. Even alfalfa provides only a small percentage of that. Finally, traditional management means that a process of inverse selection occurs. For celebrations since the times of the Incas, the best animals have found their way to the table, while the punier are left to continue the race. In the mountains of the Callejon de Huaylas, known as 'Peru's Switzerland' for its eternally snow-covered, 22,000 ft peaks, Care has been sponsoring a cuy breeding programme in conjunction with the regional government since 1989. It is estimated that 45 per cent of local children in the beautiful but poor valley are chronically under-nourished. So far nine local communities are proud owners of a model breeding shed where 400 animals mate, are properly fed, weighed and watched over. Another 70 communities benefit from technical advice at an individual family level. Most of the community projects are run by the 'mothers' clubs' of village women. In the small town of Tingua, a countrywoman shows off her animals. 'See, this one we'll keep for breeding. She has short hair and dark, bright eyes. This one here does not look so good - it will be sold for the pot.' The animals are kept in separate concrete-built 'pens' holding about ten, where they can be better monitored, selected for breeding and quickly isolated if they fall sick. A prize specimen tips the scales at 1.75 kg, the weight of a good-sized chicken. In Cruz de Mayo, another Andean village, high above Caraz, lloking after the community's rotating stock of 400 cuyes is a new job for a villager who admits that he is now 'useless for hard labour in the fields'. He is proud to pass on his new-found expertise, showing how young animals are sexed and separated at one month old. Ten females are put to one male, 'but not until they are 90 days old', he explains. 'That way they make better, fitter babies.' Eighty villagers share management of the Cruz de Mayo 'cuy-house'. There is a rota for cleaning out the pens, for cutting and transporting the alfalfa or maize stalks. A separate room contains a small stock of veterinary products for treatment of occasional skin diseases or parasites. 'A little bit of technical help makes a huge difference,' says Tulio Triveno, Care's local director as he distributes simple illustrated leaflets explaining the basics of cuy care. 'But the cuy is a hardy beast, much more resistant to the tough climate, the altitude and infections than the rabbit.' There's still a long way to go. Ninety-nine per cent of Peru's estimated 22m guinea-pigs are still reared in the bad old ways. Mr Sarria's goal is to raise production to a minimum of eight healthy young per female per year. And it is just possible that this traditional Andean staple could become a delicacy for jaded palates abroad. The cuy is already kept for food in several North African countries and the Agrarian University has recently dispatched samples of the 'improved' animal to Cuba and parts of the US that have large colonies of Peruvian exiles. 'We think that the guinea-pig, kept in most developed countries for laboratory experiments, is a real food option in many countries of the world,' says Mr Sarria.</p>

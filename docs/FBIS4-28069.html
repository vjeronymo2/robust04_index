			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 3 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Cambodia has  given an assurance that it will take appropriate action to  ensure the safety of the Malaysian Embassy in Phnom Penh.    Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the assurance  was  given by Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut  when they met in Cairo last Wednesday.    They are attending the 11th meeting of the Nonaligned  Movement (NAM) in the Egyptian capital.    He told BERNAMA when contacted by telephone from here Friday  that Prince Sirivut expressed regret over the bombing incident  at the embassy and said that the incident would not recur.    On May 19, a hand grenade was thrown into the embassy  compound by unidentified persons.    No casualties were reported in the incident, the first act  of  violence against the embassy since the United Nations-supervised  general election there last May.    Abdullah thanked Sirivut, who is also Cambodia's foreign  minister, and the police for the swift action taken following  the bombing, the motive of which was unknown.    Cambodian authorities also gave security protection to the  embassy staff.    Abdullah said foreign ministers of ASEAN countries attending  the meeting held an informal meeting to discuss preparations for  the ASEAN foreign ministers meeting and Post Ministerial  Conference (PMC) in Bangkok next month.    The informal meeting was attended by all foreign ministers  of  ASEAN except Ali Alatas of Indonesia who was indisposed.</p>

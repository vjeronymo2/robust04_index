			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Thai premier defends shares crackdown THAILAND'S prime minister, Mr Chuan Leekpai, yesterday defended his government's crackdown on share speculators, saying the move was aimed at raising standards on the volatile Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). 'We realised it would have some negative effects,' Mr Chuan told the Financial Times. 'But taking a long-term view, we believed it would raise the stock market to international standards.' The SET index has plunged since charges were filed against Mr Song Watcharasriroj and 11 associates for allegedly manipulating the price of shares in Bangkok Bank of Commerce, the country's ninth largest bank. Yesterday, the index fell 12.10 points to 847.33, down 12 per cent from its year's high of 963.03 three weeks ago. Foreign stockbrokers, pointing to strong corporate profits and annual economic growth of 7-8 per cent, have urged clients to buy while prices are low. The market has been depressed because the government has told stockbrokers to curb the credit they extend to clients to buy shares, and because Thais fear further cases will be brought against speculators by the six-month-old Securities and Exchange Commission. 'We discussed this matter for about three weeks before it erupted,' said Mr Chuan. We had to conclude this was the best way out because the law did not give us any other option. 'We realise that investors still behave like gamblers. They are not interested in dividends. They probably don't know what businesses the companies are involved in, or what dividends are paid. It's only day-to-day trading.' Unlike Mr Anand Panyarachun, his predecessor as premier, Mr Chuan is not a Bangkok businessman. He says he has no shares of his own. Mr Chuan, 54, came to power at the head of an elected five-party coalition after the pro-democracy uprising in May in which 50 people were killed. He promised to stress rural development more than previous governments, but within weeks, is being accused by his opponents of being indecisive. 'Coalitions will always have these problems,' he said. 'I've been in many coalitions, so I'm prepared to face the obstacles. I believe we'll be able to maintain the coalition so it follows the principles of the parties which got together to draft (our) common policy statement. It may be slow, but I think we can continue this way.'</p>

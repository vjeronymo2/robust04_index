			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Appointments: BA man to captain QEII Marcus Buck, until recently British Airways manager for Japan and Korea, is to become chief executive of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London from April 1. The QEII Centre is a government-owned executive agency built to provide secure conference facilities for national and international government meetings. It hosted the 1990 conference of world leaders on the ozone layer and this year it will be the London base for the UK presidency of the EC. The largest purpose-built conference centre in London, the QEII centre also markets its facilities to the private sector. It hosts more of the top 100 company agms than any other London venue and provides a London home for BBC-TV's Question Time. It has been voted best UK conference centre for the past five years. For Buck, 53, it will be his first appointment outside BA and a return to the UK after many years of managing the airline's operations in south-east Asia, Australia and Latin America. He sees many similarities between managing airline operations and a conference centre: 'Both involve elements of travel and accommodation away from home; both must be run as profit centres,' he says. And he plans to improve on its reputation and profitability still further.</p>

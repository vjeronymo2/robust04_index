			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Change to Civil Service attacked MINISTERS will face cross-party pressure today to spell out the limits on plans to delegate some Civil Service management functions. In this afternoon's Lords debate on the bill to allow the management of Whitehall departments, the government faces a move led by Lord Cledwyn, opposition leader in the Lords, and supported by Lord Allen of Abbeydale, a former top civil servant, to set out more clearly the way in which responsibility for Civil Service duties can be handed over to an undefined group of 'Crown servants'. Ministers insist the bill is intended simply to enable personnel decisions to be decentralised - for example to the executive agencies set up under the Next Steps initiative. Civil service unions are concerned, however, that contracting out civil service functions could lead to many tasks currently done by Whitehall professionals such as lawyers, engineers and accountants being transferred to the private sector. The main aim of amendments to the legislation is to confine the management functions to matters relating specifically to pay and conditions. The amendments also define those to whom ministers may delegate the duties as other ministers, civil servants or holders of statutory offices. The government has already had to fend off considerable unease from peers when the bill was first discussed more than three weeks ago. Earl Howe, the government spokesman, was unable to satisfy peers that the move was not a matter of paving the way for widespread privatisation of the Civil Service, and Lord Wakeham, the leader of the Lords, promised to discuss the handling of the bill. The need for those discussions has delayed the progress of the bill, which will not finish its passage through the Lords until the autumn.</p>

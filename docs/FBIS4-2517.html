			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's Article: "Praising `Those Who Are </F> Spiritually Rich'"--Spirit of Wholeheartedly Serving the People"]    [Text] Sun Maofang [1327 5399 5364], political assistant  of the Sixth Department of Internal Medicine, Beijing Military  Region General Hospital, the Chinese People's Liberation Army  [PLA] has drawn nutrition from the Lei Feng spirit on the one  hand and dedicated himself to the people on the other ever since  he put on his military uniform in 1964. Over the past 30 years,  he has been "warm like spring toward his comrades"; while doing  a good job of work at his post, he did voluminous good things  for the masses and was honored as "a person who is spiritually  rich."    Love is the foundation of dedication. The reason why Lei  Feng "put his limited life into unlimited service to the people"  was that he likened the party to his "mother" and socialism to  "the root of life," while cherishing the party, the people, and  socialism with utter devotion. Likewise, Sun Maofang has  unremittingly done good things for the masses, because he has  the lofty idea of "dedicating his love to the motherland and the  people." For scores of years, Sun Maofang's heart has been  filled with devotion to the party and the people, while  regarding the development of the cause of the party and the  people and the happiness of other people's lives as his own  greatest wish. For the cause of the party and people, Sun  Maofang does not care about his personal fame and position and  is willing to serve as a "human bridge." He said: "`Human  bridges' were set up in wartime to wipe out the enemy; in  peacetime construction, `human bridges' are set up to lead to  the four modernizations." To enable five elderly widowers, who  had no children, to live happily in their old age, Sun Maofang  waited on them as if he had been their own son. The elderly  praised him and likened him to their "good son." Some people  believed that it did not pay for Sun Maofang to have taken all  that trouble. However, Sun Maofang said: "It is no easy job  to be a fine son of the people! If the people recognize me as  their good son, that would be the greatest prize for me!" "Head  bowed, like a willing ox, I serve the children." This spirit of  Sun Maofang is commendable and admirable.    Beyond a doubt, a person who dedicates his love to the  motherland and the people is spiritually rich. In our society,  people who are spiritually rich like Sun Maofang are numerous.  Xu Honggang, Bao Qifan, and Jin Zhenghong [6855 2973 3163], who  have been covered by this paper recently, are all spiritually  rich and have lofty ideals and pursuits. There are a far  greater number of people who are working diligently at their  posts in obscurity, dedicating themselves to the people.  However, we may put it bluntly that under the pounding tide of  the commodity economy, there really are many people who have  neglected spiritual pursuits. In their eyes, the Lei Feng  spirit with selfless devotion as its core is outmoded; other  people's sorrows, the rise or decline of the nation, and the  future of the motherland all have nothing to do with them. Only  money, only the individual's private gain is the sole target of  their pursuit. These people might be materially rich, but they  are definitely spiritually impoverished.    "A man must have some spirit." Such a spirit is precisely  the dedication to society and mankind and the spirit of serving  the people heart and soul. This spirit was called for in the  times of revolutionary war as well as in times of socialist  construction. Today, the times have changed as well as the  situation and our tasks. However, "the essence retains its  identity while appearances may wary"; our party's purport has  not changed. The spirit of selfless devotion and serving the  people heart and soul will always be an important source of  strength for the prosperity of our country and nation. Just as  Comrade Deng Xiaoping indicated, in the course of the conversion  to the socialist market economic structure, we must grasp  building of the two civilizations simultaneously, we must do a  good job in building socialist material civilization to make  people materially rich, but do a good job of building socialist  spiritual civilization so that people will become spiritually  rich too.</p>

Liu Shuqing, president of the Chinese Institute of Foreign  Affairs (CIFA), held a working meeting with the delegation this  afternoon, during which the two sides exchanged views on the  improvement and development of Sino-U.S. bilateral relations.    The current visit is designed to explore the prospects of  expanding trade and co-operation in the field of energy, and  exchanging views on a variety of issues such as trade in  military products, nuclear proliferation and issues related to  China's most- favored-nation status.    As CIFA's guest, the delegation is a continuation of a  series  of visits by groups of U.S. Senators who have toured China since  last August, and is the first delegation to visit China since  the Sino- U.S. summit in Seattle between Chinese President Jiang  Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton, a CIFA official said.    Among the delegation are seven Senators, including the  Senate's minority leader, Alan Simpson.    The delegation is the biggest yet to visit China from the  U.S. Senate, the official said, and senior Chinese leaders will  meet it before it leaves for Guangzhou, the capital of south  China's Guangdong Province.</p>

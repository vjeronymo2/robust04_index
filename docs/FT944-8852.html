			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / European monetary union 'feasible by 1997' European economic and monetary union is 'a definite possibility for 1997', the earliest date envisaged in the Maastricht treaty, a senior European Commission official said in London yesterday. Mr Giovanni Ravasio, the commission's director-general for economic and financial affairs, said many European Union member states, 'and maybe even a majority', had the potential to meet the treaty's economic conver-gence criteria by the end of 1996. In a speech designed to give impetus to an early move by the European Union to stage three of Emu with its single currency and central bank, Mr Ravasio said Emu was 'a feasible option for 1997' provided member states kept up efforts to consolidate their public finances. It was perhaps no coincidence that Mr Ravasio chose to deliver his message to a largely pro-EU audience in London, the home of Euro-scepticism. He admitted that many people had struck 1997 as a possible date for Emu from their diaries after the currency turmoil of 1992 and 1993. But at a conference organised by the Federal Trust and Salomon Brothers International, he argued that EU countries were already well on the way to meeting the tough conditions set for Emu in the Maastricht treaty: On inflation, he said the treaty's criteria 'would already be met today' because seven member states are expected to have an inflation rate this year that is no more than 1.5 percentage points higher than the best performing EU country. A majority of member states meets the criterion that their nominal long-term interest rates are no more than 2 percentage points higher than the best performing countries. At least half EU members have experienced relatively stable exchange rates since the crisis surrounding the French franc in August last year. Although cutting budget deficits and debt to gross domestic product ratios constituted the 'biggest challenge' ahead, Mr Ravasio said: 'I don't think it is too optimistic to say that, by the end of 1996, a number of countries can manage to get rid of their excessive deficits.' He made clear that countries' budget positions could not be judged simply by the Maastricht criteria of 3 per cent of GDP for annual deficits and 60 per cent of GDP for overall government debt levels. The treaty allowed exceptions which, if applied to the letter, did not amount to a weakening of the convergence criteria. For example, the commission had decided Ireland was not infringing the EU's excessive deficit rules, because its debt to GDP ratio had declined at a 'satisfactory' pace to an expected 93 per cent this year from 116 per cent in 1987, he said. Mr Ravasio advocated similar flexibility with regard to the Maastricht rule that EU countries should only be ripe for Emu if their currencies had participated without problems in the European Monetary System for two years. Since last August's widening of the bands of the European exchange rate mechanism to plus/minus 15 per cent, he said 'the key element' for the interpretation of the exchange rate criterion was 'de facto stability of exchange rates'.</p>

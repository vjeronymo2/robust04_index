			<p>BFN     [Text] Jericho, West Bank, May 31 (AFP) -- PLO leader Yasir  'Arafat has called on members of the Palestinian Administration  who run Jericho and Gaza to draw up a 100-day emergency plan, a  member of the team said Tuesday [31 May].    Sa'ib 'Urayqat told AFP that 'Arafat had called upon each  "minister" to draw up a separate plan for their own portfolio,  as well as to move to the self-rule enclave of Jericho as soon  as possible.    The PLO chief, who is to head the Authority, is himself  expected to visit here in mid-June.    Twenty of the 24-member team have so far been named, 18 of  whom have confirmed their participation, and 15 portfolios  designated, not including the interior which 'Arafat is to take.    'Urayqat said the authority would rent a plot of land  belonging to the Moslem religious authorities to construct a  building where all the "ministries" are to be housed, with  financial aid from Spain.    When Palestinian self-rule is extended to areas of the West  Bank still under Israeli occupation, the authority will move its  headquarters to Ramallah, a much larger town near Jerusalem, he  said.    'Urayqat also said municipal elections would be held in the  Gaza Strip and West Bank in mid-October, when polling is also  expected to take place for a 100-seat autonomy council.    "If Israel keeps its commitments and withdraws its army from  Palestinian towns and villages...the municipal elections will  take place in mid-October," he said.</p>

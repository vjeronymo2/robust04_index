			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Ukrainian, Russian presidents agree to speedy division of Black Sea fleet The presidents of Ukraine and Russia yesterday opted for a rapid carve-up of the Black Sea fleet following the collapse of an earlier agreement to delay dividing up the fleet until 1995, Leyla Boulton reports from Moscow. 'The two sides from September 1993 will begin the practical formation of a Russian navy and a Ukrainian navy,' said a statement after a summit outside Moscow. The fleet will be split on a '50-50' basis. As a sweetener, Russia agreed to help maintain the port of Sevastopol.</p>

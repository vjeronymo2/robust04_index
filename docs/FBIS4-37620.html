			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, Northern </F> Command commander, by Salman Tawil in Haifa on 22 June --  recorded in Hebrew with Arabic subtitles; processed from the  Hebrew]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Tawil] Would you say the  Hizballah use of Sagger missiles against IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] forces constitutes a new element in their combat tactics?    [Mordekhay] They have used Sagger missiles in the past.  What we do find grave and unacceptable is that some of the  gunfire came from inside houses, from inside inhabited areas in  the outskirts of Tibnin. Their use of the civilian  establishment, the residents, the houses, and the villages to  shoot at us greatly contravenes previous understandings.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An unregistered F/FA product which meets the criteria for grouping only with a currently registered aftermarket additive (and not with a currently registered fuel and/or bulk additive) is not designated as registrable. This does not necessarily preclude an unregistered aftermarket additive from being registrable (since aftermarket additives can group with fuels and bulk additives), nor does it affect the registration status of currently registered aftermarket additives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, an unregistered detergent additive (either bulk or aftermarket) intended for use in gasoline and meeting the criteria for grouping with baseline gasoline fuels and bulk additives will be registrable. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  On the other hand, an unregistered chromium-containing additive (either bulk or aftermarket) intended for use in gasoline will be considered ``new'' rather than ``registrable,'' because there are no currently registered chromium-containing fuels or bulk additives in the gasoline fuel family with which the applicant additive could be grouped. Even if a chromium-containing product had previously been registered as an aftermarket additive for gasoline [e.g., as a ``grandfathered'' product registered prior to the ban of such aftermarket additives under CAA section 211(f)(1)(B)] <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  or as a bulk additive for use in another fuel family (e.g., diesel fuel), the applicant additive would still be considered ``new''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The grouping criteria for the baseline gasoline category are described in Section IV.B.2.a. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Until the 1990 CAA Amendments went into effect, the statutory language of section 211(f) was interpreted as applying only to unleaded gasoline fuels and related bulk additives. Thus, prior to November 15, 1990 (the effective date of the CAA Amendments), aftermarket additives intended for use in unleaded gasoline and containing elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur were allowed to be registered. Under the 1990 CAA Amendments, all types of motor vehicle F/FAs were placed under section 211(f) jurisdiction. [However, section 211(f) provisions do not apply until certification requirements are promulgated for the specific motor vehicle fuel or fuel additive.] All aftermarket additives that were not ``substantially similar'' and were introduced on or after November 15, 1990 were banned. However, this ban did not apply retroactively. Thus, ``non- substantially similar'' gasoline aftermarket additives which had been registered prior to November 15, 1990 have been allowed to retain their registrations. These are so-called ``grandfathered'' aftermarket additives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in the Reopening Notice, EPA believes that the distinctions between registrable and new F/FAs, both in terms of their definitions and their respective compliance requirements, reflect reasonable regard for the public health and welfare without undue interference in the F/FA marketplace. Because registrable F/FAs are defined such that they must be reasonably similar in composition and usage to current F/FAs, their entry into the market will generally not be expected to increase the health or welfare risks potentially related to current F/FA emission exposures, assuming the overall rate of usage does not increase substantially.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's rule implements EPA's policy that F/FAs that may pose new or different health risks to the public should not be allowed on the market until EPA has determined that adequate health testing has been conducted. Because it would cause significant hardships to pull all currently used products off the market until they were tested, products that are already registered may continue to be sold. If these principles were strictly applied ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA refused to register any specific product that does not currently have a registration), there could be significant stagnation in the marketplace_a new company that wanted to sell the same unleaded gasoline that everyone else is selling would be prevented from getting a registration until it had tested its gasoline product. Thus, today's rule allows new registrants to sell products that are similar to registered products in terms of: (1) Expected health effects; and (2) usage (and, therefore, type or extent of exposure) currently allowed by law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an unregistered product can group with a registered product, EPA has determined that the products should have similar health effects. To ensure that usage (and, therefore, type or extent of exposure) is similar to a registered product, under today's rule, a manufacturer cannot rely on registration of an aftermarket fuel additive or on a F/FA in a different fuel family. Considering a fuel or bulk additive to be registrable based on an aftermarket additive registration could significantly increase the public exposure to that F/FA. Generally, aftermarket additives are relatively limited in distribution and usage and, therefore, in exposure. Thus, in seeking a registration for a new product, a manufacturer cannot rely on the registration of aftermarket additives or any F/FA product in a fuel family other than the one for which the registration is sought.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is consistent with Congress' intent in CAA section 211(f)(1)(B) to preclude introduction into commerce of new aftermarket additives which do not fit the ``substantially similar''  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> criteria. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> , <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  Looking only to F/FAs in the same fuel family to determine registrability is also intended to prevent potential increases in exposure to untested products. Expanding the use of an additive from one fuel family to another (e.g., from diesel fuel to gasoline) would significantly increase the overall size of the potential market for the product and thus the potential exposure to its emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See memorandum from James W. Caldwell to Mary T. Smith regarding ``Review of Notifications Submitted Pursuant to 40 CFR 79 for Compliance with the `Substantially Similar' Rule for Unleaded Gasoline,'' available in Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;07, Item No. IV&hyph;B&hyph;07. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The grouping criteria in this final rule (see Section IV) allow aftermarket additives to join the baseline group if they contain no elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur, even if they may sometimes be used by consumers in an amount greater than the gasoline ``substantially similar'' <!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->  restriction of 2500 ppm. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA interprets section 211(e) to support the distinction between registered or registrable F/FAs and new F/FAs. EPA believes that the reference in CAA section 211(e)(2) (A) and (B) to a ``fuel or fuel additive which is registered'' or ``which is not registered'' is ambiguous as to whether it refers to the F/FA product generally or to a particular product-specific registration. Given this ambiguity, EPA believes that it is reasonable to interpret the phrase ``fuel or fuel additive which is registered'' to refer to the F/FAs generally. A contrary interpretation would result in EPA allowing numerous types of unleaded gasoline to be sold under existing registrations, while at the same time denying a registration (until completion of necessary testing) to a new company that wanted to sell the same type of unleaded gasoline that many others now sell. As discussed above, for ``registrable'' products, such an interference in the market would not likely result in any public health benefit. Therefore, EPA believes it is reasonable to interpret the phrase ``registered'' to include both F/FAs that are either ``registered'' or ``registrable.'' ``Registrable'' F/FAs are sufficiently similar in composition and use to existing F/FAs that one would not expect them to have dissimilar health effects; and therefore, it is reasonable to interpret the phrase ``registered fuel or fuel additive'' to include not only those F/FAs that are identical, but also those that can group with existing F/FAs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

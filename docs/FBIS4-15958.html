			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Energy Minister Algimantas Stasiukynas by </F> Diana Medeliene in Vilnius; date not given: "The Search for  the Guilty Between the Poles of Politics"]    [Excerpt] At two recent press conferences held in the  Seimas building many complaints were voiced to energy  specialists.    Energy Minister Algimantas Stasiukynas has told journalist  Diana Medeliene about them.    [Medeliene] What is your opinion on the memorandum of  the Homeland Union concerning the delay in the construction of  the oil terminal?    [Stasiukynas] The accusations by former Prime Minister G.  Vagnorius against the current government contained in the  memorandum look rather strange. He himself had enough time and  possibilities to resolve this problem.    I think that state officials and the public were quite well  informed about the process of choosing the site for the oil  terminal and about the negotiations with Latvia on the  construction of a terminal in Liepaja. However, information is  usually acquired by those who want it.    If the authors of the memorandum had showed some interest in  the conclusions of foreign experts, they would have understood  that most of the statements in this memorandum are incorrect.    Concerning the value of the state enterprise "Nafta," I  would  like to say that the refinery is worth more than the total value  of its equipment and other assets as it can generate profit.  The sale price of analogous West European refineries with  considerably more up-to-date equipment does not exceed $200-300  million, because there is a lack of demand. Therefore,  statements that "Nafta" is a great asset that can save Lithuania  demonstrate that some people are unaware of the current  situation in the world oil market.    Regarding the terminal in Liepaja, the debate on the  possibility of its construction did not interfere with the  process of the oil terminal construction in Lithuania. After it  had become clear that a large oil terminal cannot be built in  Liepaja, we restricted ourselves to the protocol of intentions  which envisions that Lithuanian economic entities can  participate in its construction on a commercial basis. The  statement that Lithuania is depriving itself of finances for the  construction of a foreign terminal is absolutely groundless.    [Medeliene] Energy specialists are being reprimanded  for high prices of energy resources. Society lacks sufficient  information about the way tariffs and prices are set. Maybe, it  is for this reason that each price hike is greeted with new  attacks.    [Stasiukynas] I would like to compare the conclusions of the  Seimas commission investigating the situation in the energy  market with those of experts.    First of all, the trade in oil products. Members of the  commission have claimed that oil products bought from the  Mazeikiai refinery should be cheaper. These products are 15-20  percent more expensive than those bought on the market.  Therefore, the production of the Mazeikiai enterprise is sold  outside the country. The Mazeikiai thermal electric power  station alone has bought petroleum residue from "Nafta" because  the two enterprises are technologically connected. The energy  system experienced losses due to that.    Lithuania has the lowest prices for energy resources by  comparison with other similarly developed countries. This means  that the energy management is not so bad. It is maintained that  the growth of energy prices is the cause of troubles in most  industries and agriculture. However, electricity and heating  prices have risen two-fold over the entire period of inflation,  while those of food, consumer goods, and various services have  increased from three to 10 times. Energy prices will  undoubtedly rise in the future, but at a lower rate.  Incidentally, the energy generated at the nuclear plant is  cheaper, because the plant uses nuclear fuel cassettes  previously bought at lower prices. We will have to pay much  more for them now. In our country, fuel prices account for 86  percent of the total energy costs, while in the West they do not  exceed 40 percent. I would like to stress, however, that the  rise in energy prices must be strictly coordinated with that of  living standards. The steep price rise recommended to us by  foreign experts is unacceptable to Lithuania.    Speaking about prices for supplying centralized heating, I  would like to note that in Europe they are between $40 and $50  per one Gcal [gram calorie], that is, two or three times more  expensive than in Lithuania. I regret that our ministry  employees provided incorrect information about European prices.  In the opinion of World Bank experts and specialists on energy  prices, Lithuania's prices are extremely low, while credits will  be extended to our country when these prices are economically  reasonable. Thus, assessments are quite controversial.  Therefore, the government has set up the Commission for  Regulating Energy Prices on the initiative of the Energy  Ministry, headed by the finance minister, which also includes  representatives of all interested offices and organizations.  Incidentally, the production of state energy concerns is  cheaper than that of private companies.    We also share the opinion that industrial enterprises should  not pay more for energy than residential units. Last year,  residents paid 15 times less (three times this year) than  enterprises. They are unable to pay the total price.  Therefore, we must preserve compensation for another two or  three years.    I would like to stress that the setting of energy tariffs is  a state policy rather than an economic problem of energy  enterprises. One takes into account energy prices in neighboring  states when setting tariffs in one's own country.    [Medeliene] The press and the press conferences in the  Seimas addressed the privatization of energy facilities. There  have been different opinions on this topic. How could you  explain them?    [Stasiukynas] The accusation that there are plans to  privatize a small percentage of the assets at energy facilities  sounds strange. Every economist should know what percentage of  the stockholding at an enterprise accounts for. A very small  portion of these assets should be privatized in the first stage.  Later, enterprises should be turned into stock companies,  issuing their stock, attracting capital for investment, and  accumulating working capital. Such enterprises should further  remain under state control. [passage omitted]</p>

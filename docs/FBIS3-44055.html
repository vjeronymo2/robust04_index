			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by ANC President Nelson Mandela to the ANC </F> "National Conference on Reconstruction and Strategy" in  Johannesburg on 21 January, issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR  Wire Service]    [Text] Comrade chairperson, esteemed members of the  diplomatic corps, fellow members of the National Executive  Committee of the ANC [African National Congress], leaders of our  allied organisations, honoured guests, comrades and friends:    I greet you warmly in this, the year of liberation for all  South Africans.    We have thus characterised the year 1994 to express the  deep-seated hope of all our people that, this year, all of us  will, at last, achieve our emancipation. This year a new birth  will occur.    The physical being that will be its offspring will be like  the new beginning which occurs when the spring rains wash away  the dead leaves of winter and give life to the summer green  which, as an expression of the rhythm of the seasons, blankets  our earth. That new birth will signal the wonder that we have  begun to construct a new social order.    It will say to us and to the world that we, the people of  South Africa have, at last, entered our new age, during which we  shall be called upon to respond to the call of history which  summons us to achieve our own freedom from tyranny, from  injustice, from hunger, from deprivation and from the indignity  and insult of racism and apartheid.    As an expression of its glorious humanism, the new age will,  at the same time as it liberates the oppressed, endow the  oppressor with the gift of emancipation from ignorance, from  fear, and freedom from hatred and bigotry. It will also bless  our country with the reward of its emancipation from isolation  by the community of nations.    We sit at the southern-most tip of Africa as in the eye of a  storm. That storm sweeps across the human habitat. Like the  spring rains, it seeks to drive away the pestilences that  continue to afflict the world of living beings, the universal  malignancies which seem to have found a home in our diseased  society.    Today, our country and ourselves have come face-to-face with  an historic opportunity to transform ourselves. By virtue of the  fact that they will record success, our victories will say to  the peoples of the world that the triumph of all humanity over  the same problems that find concentrated expression in our  country is assured.    As we rise to the challenge of change, the eyes of the  peoples of the world are upon us. These masses are rooting for  us. These millions are willing us to succeed. This moment of  opportunity is itself a product of a struggle waged both by  ourselves and by the peoples of the world. And yet, in the  language of the game of chess, it does not represent our end  game.    Our election victory in April will enable us to take a great  leap forward. But this will be a dangerous leap unless we have  the vision, the programmatic framework, the strength and the  will to bring about fundamental change.    To achieve this requires that we read every sign with great  attention, to plan for every eventuality, to learn the hard  lessons of history, to know our country and to understand the  social forces that make it what it is.    Fundamental change will not occur simply because elections  will have taken place on April 27th. It will come about because  of our engagement of our actuality, inspired by an unrelenting  determination to make an actual and visible change. The greater  the victory of the democratic forces in those elections, the  better will be our capacity to transform South Africa.    But this we must also understand, that the more decisive  that  victory, the more violent the resistance to change might be on  the part of those forces that do not want change.    The first challenge we shall face from these forces which  represent the past which our people seek to repudiate, will be a  determined effort to ensure that our country is unable to hold  free and fair elections. The greatest and most obvious threats  facing us in this regard is violence. We must confront this  problem on all fronts, including those instances where we,  ourselves, might be more the perpetrators rather than the  victims of this violence.    As a movement, we are also faced with an insidious threat.  This is the threat of complacency. Encouraged by the good  results indicated in many opinion polls and by our direct  experience as a result of direct contact with the people, we  might allow the situation to arise where by our activists and  supporters might get convinced that the victory we seek is  already won.    We have to fix this firmly in our minds that every vote  counts. We must ensure that this becomes our actual programme  that we reach out to every voter and work to ensure that every  voter actually votes and votes correctly.    Beyond the elections, we must also realise that we shall  continue to confront threats from those who are implacably  opposed to democracy. We have only to look at what is happening  around us in the region of southern Africa to understand the  possibility of the kind of havoc which can make it very  difficult to build upon the victories of our struggle.    This matter is pertinent to the outcome of the elections,  the  challenge to defend the democratic victory and our capacity to  bring about fundamental change in our country. In our approach  to these and other issues, we must proceed from the fundamental  consideration that our responsibility to our people and to the  peoples of the world leaves no margin of error in the manner in  which we prepare for the democratic transition and implement our  vision of transformation, reconstruction and development.    The vision reflected in many of our documents and statements  must be translated into a policy framework. Over the past year,  many comrades in our movement have been grappling with this  task. Hence this conference will have placed before it the sixth  draft of our strategy, reconstruction and development document.    We will therefore receive and consider a document which lays  the basis for far-reaching change and the achievement of genuine  democracy for the people of our country. For those of us who  are already familiar with the programme, the objectives it sets  might appear relatively easy.    The reality however is that as much as our political  liberation was not easy to achieve, so will not be an easy walk  to arrive at the point of the socio-economic upliftment of all  the people of our country.    We must therefore approach the challenge of reconstruction  and development soberly and with both feet firmly planted on the  ground. That approach requires that we also recognise the fact  that the sixth draft in front of us still requires a substantial  amount of additional work to be anywhere near what we want it to  be.    It however goes without saying that the principles on which  it is based and which it elaborates are very sound and  constitute the framework within which our democratic forces  should approach their work once they become part of the  democratic government. One of the principal challenges that will  face us in that capacity -- a challenge we have to meet to make  our reconstruction programme implement able -- is the task of  redefining governance.    Having studied and criticised the old world, we must seek  out  a new mode of interaction between the people and their elected  representatives, and between the governmental structures and the  popular organisations of the people. To strengthen the bond  between the electors and the elected, we have, for instance,  made certain that the members of our movement had the chance to  participate in the process of selecting those whom they wish to  see as members of the legislative assemblies.    Without seeking to boast, we can say that we stand head and  shoulders above our contenders in the election in the democracy  and transparency of our selection process. We are in the process  of producing a governing team whose skills, talents and  dedication to the public good assures that we are putting  together a winning combination which will inspire the confidence  and kindle the hopes of all our people, both black and white.    This team will enter governance not for power and glory, but  as an act of responsibility to all our people. It will therefore  be ready to deal with the hard questions of our reality, without  seeking to delude the people with empty promises, fully  understanding that the people have a right to know the truth  about what is possible.    Our country has arrived at this exciting conjuncture because  we took good care to build a strong organisation of the people  -- the African National Congress. In the face of what lies ahead  of us, the need for that strong organisation, rooted among the  masses, is even greater. We must, therefore, make certain that  whatever else we do, we must have the strength to continue to  build such an organisation.    This is true of all the other organisations of the  democratic  movement, including the youth and women's movements, the trade  unions, the civics and other representatives of civil society.    What I have been trying to say to this historic conference  is  that in the period ahead we will encounter many hardships. To  overcome them we will need more than good intentions.    We will need strong organisation, effective and accountable  government, a realistic plan whose implementation will actually  change the lives of our people, and a determined effort to  thwart the schemes of those who want to block the emergence of  the new society. Above all, we need the commitment and  involvement of everybody present here today in the common effort  to create a new society and a new nation.    Before I close I would like to address a special word to  those of our compatriots who belong to the organisations that  belong to the Freedom Alliance. We urge them to approach the  current negotiations in a serious spirit of give and take and  with a determination to find solutions acceptable to all the  people of our country and not merely the constituencies they  represent.    We take the demands they have presented very seriously. We  are determined to address them to the best of our ability. We  therefore take the negotiations very seriously and approach them  with an open mind to find mutually acceptable solutions.    We appeal to all of them that they take the same attitude,  understanding that we are not their enemies. What we are is  enemies of racism and oppression. We trust that they too are  enemies of racism and oppression and are therefore open to reach  the necessary compromises which will deliver our country from  the racism, oppression and conflict from which it must  emancipate itself.    In the great effort to create a new society and a new nation  we dare not fail. History and the world will judge us very  harshly if we do not do what is just and correct. We will not  have a second chance.    I wish the conference success, confident that you will  approach your work with all due seriousness and realism.    Thank you.</p>

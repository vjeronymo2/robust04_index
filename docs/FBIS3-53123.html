			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>   [Text] Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for  the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has said the Alliance of  Palestinian Forces [APF] will hold a meeting in Damascus on 19  January to choose a president for the alliance and determine the  term of the presidency of each faction, which will be periodic.    Ghawshah told AL-DUSTUR that the APF's decisions will be  made  unanimously and that any decision that is not approved  unanimously will not be implemented. Each faction has the veto  right.    Ghawshah added that Hamas will present its agenda for the  first meeting after the formation of the APF. The agenda  discusses the role of national conferences, the way they are  formed, and escalating the intifadah and jihad operations inside  the territories.    Hamas will also present a program of action in the Arab and  international arenas by forming a delegation to represent the  APF to visit Arab, Islamic, and foreign countries and explain  the APF's view of political developments in the region and  threats facing Jerusalem and the Palestine question.    It is worth mentioning that the 10 factions which oppose the  negotiations with Israel and seek to thwart the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement last week adopted the name  Alliance of Palestinian Forces.    Answering a question, Ghawshah said: The APF's membership  was confined to representatives of the 10 factions. This means  we have no room for independents in the APF. He added: We have  previously suggested allocating 20 percent of the seats to  independents, but last week the 10 factions in general were for  the idea of accord and equal weight in the Palestinian arena.</p>

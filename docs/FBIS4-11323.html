			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Aissa G. Garcia] </F>   [Text] Havana, 25 Apr (PL) -- When many countries of the  world are coming apart like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, the  language spoken in Cuba is one of family reunification and  normalization of ties between this country and its emigrants.    "The Nation and the Emigrants Conference" concluded Sunday  afternoon with the participation of 215 emigrants from 30  countries. Most of the participants described the conference as  a first step toward the opening of channels of communication  between the two sides.    Although measures were announced to expedite those  relations,  some participants, like businessman and newsman Lazaro Farinas,  felt that the main achievement of this meeting was that it was  held.    Farinas, who always expressed his ideological differences  with the Cuban Government, told PRENSA LATINA he felt very  satisfied with the results of the meeting, "because it allowed  former adversaries to come to talk with the government of their  fatherland without foreign interference."    Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina announced yesterday the  adoption of several measures to expedite the communication of  the emigrants with their country, including the removal of the  requirement for those who leave the country legally to wait five  years before being able to return. It was also decided to  create a department to handle emigrants, edit a magazine related  to the topic of immigration, and allow residents [as received]  to stay at the home of relatives instead of being forced to book  hotel rooms to study in their country of origin.    In Farinas' opinion, the normalization of ties will permit  the "thwarting of Miami's belligerent and violent emigrants, who  are just one part of the community, as well as contributing to  the health of the nation. [no closing quotation marks as  received]    For years, we walked on a path that divided us and we got  nowhere; now we want to explore how to be united in favor of the  Cuban nation, Farinas noted in judging that the conference shows  the viability of normalizing relations despite ideological  differences.    Raul Varandela, a former member of the rebel army's ninth  column who later adopted a counterrevolutionary stance, told  PRENSA LATINA that "Jorge Mas Canosa (head of the ultrarightist  Cuban American Foundation) is now suffering, but we are not,  because this meeting opened up the path we were seeking."    In the opinion of John Cabanas, a businessman who runs a  charter airline, the meeting constitutes a starting point that  will make room for communication and dialogue among relatives  and will identify the problems of the community and their  solutions. Like other participants and observers, Cabanas  termed as very democratic the fact that the authorities allowed  all views and concerns of the overseas community to be expressed.    The fact that those from over there and those here --  government officials included -- talked amiably, even those who  had never been friends, also caught the attention of the  participants, newsmen, and guests.    Orlando Lastre, of the Promankind [Prohombre] organization,  stated, in turn, that those who allowed themselves to be  intimidated by the fear campaign launched by Miami's right-wing  and failed to attend will regret not having participated in this  event in which the groundwork was laid for greater communication  between the two parts of the same nation.    The first decisions adopted at the conference will begin to  take shape tomorrow, as joint commissions will be set up to  discuss topics of common interest, such as immigration and other  concerns of young people, women, artists, and professionals,  without needing to wait for the next conference.</p>

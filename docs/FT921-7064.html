			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Banks take 9.9% stake in Aitch restructure AITCH HOLDINGS, the clothing manufacturer and importer, has agreed a financial restructuring with its bankers and new loans from the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland. Reporting a Pounds 6.9m pre-tax loss in the year to November 30, Mr Michael Green, chief executive, said the group was 'viable going forward' as a result of the restructuring and the repositioning of the shirts business in Northern Ireland. The restructuring leaves the new board and the group's bankers with nearly 17 per cent and 9.9 per cent respectively of the company. Cahoots, a menswear importer, has been sold for Pounds 247,000 cash. Mr Harry Rogers, who reversed Aitch into Munton Group in 1988, has left the board and paid Pounds 681,000 for Naughty Clothing, which designs, sources and imports ladies clothes. In the year to November 30 they incurred a loss after all charges of Pounds 1.2m. Aitch said that the sales would release the substantial working capital. The group will concentrate on developing its shirt and ladies leisurewear businesses. Some Pounds 5.3m of the group's overdraft has been converted into a three-year loan and the IDB of Northern Ireland has put up Pounds 500,000 of new money. The group made an Pounds 8.87m write-off of goodwill as part of a Pounds 10.16m extraordinary charge. As a result, the company will be seeking a reduction of capital. Turnover for the year was Pounds 36.5m, of which Pounds 19.7m related to continuing activities generating a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.08m. Total losses per share were 10.03p.</p>

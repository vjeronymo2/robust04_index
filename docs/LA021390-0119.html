			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> FAMILY FEUD: They're sister schools, but it isn't uncommon for one UC campus to  covet another's staff, as evidenced by Berkeley's interest in Irvine's No. 2  administrator, Chang-Lin Tien. . . . UCI evolutionary biologist Francisco  Ayala, for example, was recruited from UC Davis. . . . But fear of too much  bloodletting led UC system officials to circulate a secret memo a while back  cautioning campuses against internecine bidding wars that would drive up  salaries. . . . Tien, possibly the next UC Berkeley chancellor, may learn his  fate when the regents meet Thursday. Dana Parsons  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Saddam Husayn marking the third </F> anniversary of the Mother of Battles in Baghdad on 16 January --  live or recorded]    In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate: Great  people, valiant men of our valiant Armed Forces, sons of our  glorious Arab nation, friends throughout the world: Peace be  upon you.    Arabs, led by the Iraqis, have, since the formation of the  first human civilization on earth, looked at the universe and  creation as a whole. They have examined both comprehensively  and have discharged their task with responsibility and honor.  If Arabs are preoccupied with any part the universe or  creation, it is in the interest of a more comprehensive outlook  and responsibility. Arabs have never separated life and their  outlook on creation and the universe from any of their  fundamental rules. They never became obsessed with the part at  the expense of the whole. In none of their awakenings have they  relied on the material to the exclusion of the spirit.    Indeed, Arabs have never achieved any state of awakening  based on the material laws of life. Whenever any of the Arabs  swung to the material side, that period was labeled an age of  degradation or intellectual backwardness. In any case, this has  never been a characteristic in which Arabs have taken pride.  They have never taken such a state of affairs as their ideal  or set it as an example. Nor did they call on others to follow  that route. From this perspective and stand, Arabs played the  role they set for themselves or the role chosen for them by God.  Every elevation of the intellect and duty of principle was  inspired by a universal outlook in which there was a balance  between the spiritual and the material, with the spiritual  indeed taking precedence over the material. The legitimacy and  intrinsic value of all material things is reinforced by the  degree to which it is tempered with spiritualism. On such  foundations of the spirit and thought was built the historical,  psychological, and ideological edifice and our perspective on  things. With the help of the God of heaven and earth, and his  wise choice, Arabs were chosen as messengers of humanity to  humanity and their land the cradle of prophets, bolstering the  role of the Arab nation as the gateway for the world's first  civilization.    When idelogy, values, and attitudes are shaped by this  concept of spirit as an attitude and civilization as an entity,  and when people on this blessed earth play their role according  to what crystallizes in their thoughts and accumulates in their  consciences then, the people of this earth will be the first to  understand the relationship between what is material and what is  spiritual. They will also understand the balance between this  relationship and the priority given to spiritual elements in the  course of life. It is necessary to understand the detrimental  effect of material objects on life when they get the upper hand.    We must always be extremely aware of the essential  difference  between those who drown in spirit and those who drown in other  considerations throughout history. Those who drown in the  latter will appear dry or possibly hollow and will repeat the  past. Consequently, they will be tossed about by the wind and  the laws of life, like a dry bush that cannot resist the winds  or extend its roots deep into the earth to grow and reach the  pure air and the useful sun.    Everyone should realize the difference between the world of  considerations and spirit, from which man can proceed to  establish a civilization in which the laws of life prosper, in  which man corrects himself, and in which the laws of the period  develop in the areas of culture, industry, agriculture, art, and  science in light of justice, fairness, and what satisfies God  and the people; and the mere adoption of what has been done by  others without playing any role in the development of what has  been intrusted to man to establish his civilization by absorbing  the accepted laws of his age and interacting with what requires  interaction, and creating what should be created.    All this comes after seeking to win the satisfaction of  Almighty God, to achieve man's happiness, and not to deprive him  of the foundation of his personality in terms of position,  decision, thought, and behavior in light of his history and  heritage in the deepest and most comprehensive way. He should  also create the values of the society of that age and not  imitate what contradicts the pan-Arab and national  characteristics, but imitate that society which has a memorable,  influential role in human life. While this society affects  other nations, it will keep an open mind to the experiences of  those nations with which it interacts. The actions of this  society will be based on its past intellectual, cultural, and  historical bases and its present ideology and creativity.    Breaking away from what is spiritual and moving toward what  is material on the pretext that this is the law of this age will  also lead to one's drowning in what is material. Instead of  being the pillar used by spiritual laws as an influencial means  befitting its time to flourish under suitable civilized  circumstances when possible, according to the laws of this age,  and to balance life and help straighten it up on the basis of  spiritual laws, this trend will lead to to one's drowning in  materialism if it is used as an absolute basis in thought and  action. For it will then becomes an end rather than a means  which, if used properly, will make life and the spirit progress,  and will realize man's happiness through self-satisfaction that  is immersed in faith and through the others' perception of how  to tackle the basics of the laws of life and man's relationship  with his fellow man.    It has been historically proven that Arabs have been the  pioneers in the realm of the spirit, that the realm of the  spirit has chosen Arabs to introduce itself to the world, and  that Arabs were the ones who introduced the world to the realm  of the spirit. They constituted the first human civilization  which shows that they were the first to create the basics of  what elevates life to a level that distinguishes man. The edge  Arabs enjoyed over others in their approach to the realm of the  spirit becomes evident in their ability to put things within  their proper perspective, be it when they tackle the material  world, or through their approach and evaluation of what is or os  not ethical, what is or is not just, particularly when it  concerns their present and future, as well as their past and all  the other human affairs. To clarify things, we say: Can the  United States, or India, for example, be taken as a standard of  measure in the modern world for what is advanced or not, or of  what is more advanced? Why is it that the United State, Japan,  France, or Britain continue to be viewed as the basic standards  of measure by all those who had an edge in production and  invention in the field of technology in a general manner, and on  the basis of the general criteria of a phase such as the one we  have mentioned?    We are certain that the basis for this is that they were  pioneers in the field of invention which gave them an edge in  the field of production.    Even on the basis of this incomplete example from life,  those  who contemplate life and mankind in accordance with a sound  concept would realize and understand the pioneering role Arabs  have played for themselves and others.    Invention, usage of an invention, and accumulated  experiences, are considered a criteria by which others will  judge any stage. Such a stage may be long or short. Why aren't  Arabs, including Iraqis, entitled to clearly view things in  terms of their sources which have a pure spirit, civilization,  ideology, and everything else that measures what is spiritual  and what is materialistic, favoring what is spiritual over what  materialistic whenever it conflicts with and obstructs the  prosperity of what is spiritual?    This clearly shows that one who controls the movement in the  materialistic world is not suitable as an example, or as a  model, or as a judge of others unless he balances his approach  and behavior according to what is spiritual, just, and fair, and  respects the considerations of other nations, and unless he  recalls the requirements of a fair position and not ambitions or  egomania.    From these concepts, and from an understanding of divine  wisdom we can see that mankind has not singled out any prophet,  messenger, heavenly or unheavenly religion. Therefore, in  Amman, in February 1990 we had to face those who called both  covertly and overtly for surrendering to the U.S. unilateral  political control of the world, after the collapse of the Soviet  Union. We wondered whether the United States would act in a  responsible and wise manner toward the world, or whether it  would fall into the abyss of rashness. Thus, it would not  control the world, but would fall from the peak after losing  much of its means to perpetuate its brute force.    Today, this is the world of which we are a part, and you are  also part of it. With a simple look, anyone will see a blazing  world in which the most sacred of sanctities are violated, and  also the highest values of peoples and nations, states, and  international relations are violated. Moreover, he will see  blood flowing like rivers, and injustice climbing up to the  world of evil so that it is almost drowned in it, and hunger  overwhelming a great portion of world peoples. He will also see  that the United States, which is practicing hegemony from its  apex, has quickly found itself--thanks to the desire for  domination and its accompanying mistakes and also due to others'  resistance--displaced from the apex of the material world and  the world of domination and unilateral control which it wished  for in the new world order. The United States has even begun to  decline, even according to the standards of supremacy over  others in the United States' own world.    Every reasonable and mature person has realized that the  world order called for by the former president of the United  States is a call to realize an unruly imperialist wish to give  the United States control over the gates of a big prison for the  entire world. This order was not meant to uphold justice and  fairness, nor to cherish the peoples' sovereignty, independence,  peculiarities, values, spiritual legacy, and right to choose  their own way of life. The United States has been removed from  the zenith. There are no longer any peaks for the United States  to climb. Material peaks cannot be called peaks that promote  humanity. However, the United States might soon start to climb  the mountain to either reach the highest material capability in  terms of influencing the course of events, if it rids itself of  the complex of hubris and the temptation of immersion in  material standards of measurement, which we do not think to be  most likely, or to fall into the final abyss that stands below  it, which we believe to be most likely, based on what we know of  today's world and its deep-rooted history.    Well-known factors, some of which are similar to what we  currently criticize in U.S. policy, caused France and Britain to  climb down to the foot of the mountain in the aftermath of World  War II, leaving the peak to the United States and the former  Soviet Union. When the United States climbs down from the peak  to the foot of the mountain, it will not remain on the foot of  the mountain. Most likely, it will continue its move downward.  And because the material world is not amenable to absolutism,  no one has any guarantees of survival on the peak indefinitely,  by any standards, particularly since the United States did not  reach the peak by incremental and firm steps, nor by fair  entitlement. It reached the peak when a vacuum presented  itself. Hence, it seized the opportunity to fill this vacuum.    Given the terms we have used in our characterization of the  United States, Zionism, their ambitions, the nature of their  alliance, as well its objectives;    Given the fact that all this conflicts with the terms we  have  used to characterize Iraq and the Arab nation, regarding the  disparity in goals, character, positions, and the nature of the  faith embraced by our nation and its eternal message throughout  all ages;    In view of United States' efforts to dominate the world  militarily, politically, and economically;    In view of Zionism's efforts to exploit the world, in  cooperation with the United States at present, and, at other  times, with other powers, in pursuit of the policy of the  convergence of interests and proportionateness of capabilities  to realize joint ambitions, contradiction reached the point of  clashes after the United States found, or, as a matter of fact,  deluded itself into believing that the time was right to crush  the epitome of values the Arabs see as an example to be emulated  in terms of national and pan-Arab dignity, faith, integrity, and  development. Consequently, the conspiracy was unleashed.    After many had given up the duty of rejecting what ought to  be rejected and of accepting what is right and appropriate for  peoples' interests and states' sovereignty, the United States,  Zionism, and those who went into temporary alliances with them  under certain circumstances, miscalculating the seriousness of  such alliances, were encouraged to be dragged to an ill-omened  aggression against the Iraq of the Mother of Battles.    Brothers, international relations cannot be rectified and  stability cannot be achieved through certain parties' desire for  hegemony and control. For, control destroys international  relations and destroys the party that wishes to control. This  has always been the outcome of every attempt in this regard by  all those who established and created leadership on the basis of  the world of belongings and things and their standards, and on  the basis of strength. The international community now needs  the wisdom of the group and collective leadership. Everyone,  especially those who are known to have the balance in their  favor in the material world, should remember that the capability  and wisdom that satisfy God are not exclusively possessed by the  big countries or the big powers. Perhaps wisdom is the last  thing they consider. It does not become part of their lives  until there appear powers that are bigger and more evil and  aggressive than they are. Such new powers may even appear in  their own world, the world they have opted for and through which  they chose to be different from others--the world of material  belongings. In fact, history teaches us that power has not been  a constant asset for big states or big populations. Power does  not indefinitely settle with large armies or states. History  can help us recall further examples that tell us that fatal  strikes against the largest armies and states have not been made  by equal or superior powers, in accordance with traditional  yardsticks of the meaning of power. Rather, such strikes have  been made by powers that possess new yardsticks of power. A  view of the results of what had been originally sought to be  achieved in accordance with the plans and hopes of the states of  aggression against Iraq, and against Somalia later on, will help  provide a sound vision and clear piece of evidence about a major  event which had a profound and comprehensive meaning and results.    On the eve of the 30-state aggression against Iraq, there  were in Iraq targets that suit the capability of the advanced  Western military technology. There were large hospitals for  children and women, and others for the entire people. There  were sophisticated plants, large buildings, water and  electricity facilities, oil refining installations, everything  that is related to oil products, and historical sites. Among  the targets were even residential buildings that loftily tell of  a prosperous age. For the means of destruction, all those  constituted visual targets by firing from a distance.    The aggressors thought that these targets -- as well as  civic and military airports, mosques, churches, academic and  cultural centers, and even radar sites, which attract a familiar  type of their weapons and guide them to their targets -- are  suitable targets according to the standards of an appropriate  target. A target is deemed appropriate in line with the  technical considerations of their weapons, which are  computer-fed.    The aggressors thought that the very fact that Iraq has such  targets, which are appropriate for their weapons which they fire  from a distance -- and the fact that each of these targets is,  of material value, equal or superior to the material value of  the shell they fire at it -- they thought this was enough to  make Iraq bow down to their will. They sought to impose this  evil will on Iraq and terrorize the world through Iraq.  However, when the confrontation took place and consisted, on  their part, of firing from a distance, and considering that the  brunt of it came from the air -- it was the heaviest known in  the history of aggression and war -- the harvest was in line  with what Almighty God had decreed. Certainly, the results were  contrary to their frustrated wishes and contrary to computer  calculations, which were fed by the will of evil minds which  have never entertained good thoughts.    Preparations for the aggression against Iraq lasted more  than  six months, before the frustrated people dared to attack  beautiful Baghdad two and a half hours after midnight on 16  January and early in the morning on 17 January 1991. This  period gave them a chance to collect much information about  Iraq. Thus, the politicians and military found out a basic part  of the information they were interested in, in terms of Iraq's  size, population, the nature of its resources, its development,  and even more private information in geopolitics and military  and economic affairs. They found out, among other things, that  Iraq, regardless of everything, has a small population, small  size, and is a Third World nation according to the standards of  technological and economic development. Those concerned also  knew, through the information disseminated by the West about  Iraq's capabilities and weapons -- portraying Iraq's  capabilities in legendary terms as very destructive -- that the  weapons they had amassed would be enough not only to achieve the  declared and undeclared objectives which the villains made  public or hid in their malicious, senile minds, but also enough  to change the face of the earth and mankind.    This is what military officials and politicians used to say  about the effect of their weapons once they would be used  against Iraq. These included the U.S. secretary of state, who  contributed to the aggression decision. Some of their political  and military officials made statements to the same effect, not  to mention the false and deceptive news blared out by their  media. When they ceased fire upon the orders of the U.S.  President, his allies or the greater part of them learned of the  cease-fire decision from his famous speech in which he announced  a unilateral cease-fire. The decision was made after they had  collided with the Republican Guards southwest of al-Basrah and  after facing watchful resistance whenever they came in contact  with the army and people of great Iraq and with the roaring  magnanimous thunder of our air and defense forces, the missile  forces, the army helicopter gunship cavaliers, and all the  troops and corps of our great army and valiant Armed forces.  Despite the concentration of aircraft of all types and  purposes, which covered the skies of the battle against the  Republican Guards, the failed aggressors realized they would  enter a new stage as a result of that resistance and would face  consequences for which they had not made plans, therefore, the  U.S. President announced the unconditional cease-fire, except  for actions to protect their armies in case they were exposed to  Iraqi fire.    The dust of the first chapter of the conflict with the  regular armies settled down, but the aggression continued  afterward in the form of air attacks on the Republican Guards in  a treacherous breach of the cease-fire--a breach which is  usually noted in the history of the invaders. The aggressors  then stirred their Iran--sponsored chapter of aggression, which  was not less evil or barbaric than their regular aggression  against Iraq, but was in some ways tougher. This was followed by  two more aggressions on 13 and 17 January 1993 and 26 June 1993,  a series of occasional attacks on our air defenses, aircraft,  and other targets were carried out between and after the two  aggressions.    Briefly, the world of regimes and rulers in general, with  few known exceptions, was divided into either keen participants  or indifferent observers. However, after all that has happened,  including the chapter of the severe and continued blockade,  those regimes are now standing astonished, finding no sufficient  explanation in their minds for the Iraqi people's great and  legendary steadfastness. These people and the valiant army of  the Mother of Battles are rightfully worthy of this great and  honorable record. Thus, with the help of God, the militant  Iraqis have managed to bring closer to the minds of those who  went astray or temporarily deviated from the path of guidance  and faith the extent of God's capability. The militant Iraqis  have placed the entire world at the beginning of the road which  will lead it to overcoming the complex of fear that the U.S.  unilateral leadership of the material world has implanted in its  soul. This fear has been so great that they dropped their  weapons, or rather the weapons of infidelity, the moment this  dreadful name was ever mentioned. The first wound that pained  the soul and body of dear Baghdad with the first bomb that hit  its land or any target in it on 17 January 1991 was the actual  beginning of the weakness that has crept into limbs of those  bragging about their strength and looking down on others. With  the first bomb that hit Baghdad, pain and illness afflicted the  bodies and souls of the treacherous tyrants of the 20th Century  and their followers who disregard others, only to be disregarded  by God and their own and other peoples. Thus, in the name of  God, the souls of many states and peoples were healed.    Afterward, there came a supporting experience which revealed  the traits of the free peoples. In view of the subsequent  effects of the atmosphere of the immortal Mother of Battles that  we have already described, and in view of the results that it  had produced, the tyrants belittled the will of peoples and  ignored the will of God. Nay, they ignored all that would  remind them of wisdom. As ever, they discredit the poor and  enslave human beings.    The people of Somalia were starving. Hunger, disease, and  lack of clothing were apparent. They had only God to shelter  them. They had no targets which are appropriate for the weapons  and shells that are fired from a distance, some from thousands  of kilometers. Not a single house in Somalia was equal in  material value to their guided missiles. Also, the Somalis do  not have many public facilities that prompt one to destroy them.    Because the pockets of the treacherous -- who gave the  aggressors the price for the shells with which they struck Iraqi  cities and other targets and Baghdad, the city which preserved  the values of the civilization of the Arabs and the heritage of  humanity which believed in God -- were emptied and could no  longer support or finance a destructive aggression for a long  period with expensive weapons, the devil thought once again of  trying its luck in Somalia. The penetration of the skin and  flesh of Somali children and women, and even men, requires only  light hardware to be fired at a starving people who were  exhausted by hunger and thrown away on sidewalks.    Bearing this description in mind, they thought that they  could horribly insult not only to the people of Somalia but also  to all nations of the world. Perhaps foremost among the people  they had in mind to once again try to influence were the people  of Iraq. This is why they once again belittled other nations.  And God humiliated and disgraced them again and glorified the  people of Somalia, who are starving and without clothes, save  the clothes of dignity.    The villains thought that a people whom they think are  powerless and who do not have an army like that of Iraq would  quickly bargain over their leaders. Perhaps, they thought that  the Somali people would save them the trouble of using their  bullets of death and that some of them would quickly assassinate  their resistance leaders. Damn their ideas, which will only lead  them to further miscalculations and will throw them out of the  realm of honor and respect.    Having been exhausted by their sick ideas, and after their  plans fail to achieve their malicious goals, the Americans left  a country which is not for them. What is worse still in  describing the level of their moral deterioration is that  America, which unfairly and aggressively advocated certain ideas  in Somalia and mobilized others for this purpose, was not  content, in its moral deterioration, by involving its allies.  Its deterioration exceeded all possible limits and previous  actions when it withdrew its troops and asked others publicly to  remain in Somalia. It is strange for some Third World nations  to accept this, while some of them say their regimes represent  Islamic states. Do they not ask themselves about the legitimacy  of staying in Somalia in the form of occupation of aggression,  or in a manner that conflicts with the will of the Somali  people? Do they think that the will of a people that rejects  the presence of an occupying foreigner on its territory  indicates that such a people are in need of foreign protection?    Brothers and friends the world over and in our greater Arab  nation: This is an important aspect of the meanings of the  suffering, bloodshed, and the record of jihad and struggle of  the great Iraqi people in the Mother of Battles. Those who take  a profound look at these meanings can reach conclusions which  please and satisfy a suffering humanity, telling it that the  beginning to the road of human guidance, after a long period of  forgetting its meanings, has appeared. Also, the beginning of  the road to deterioration and collapse of the tyrant has also  appeared.    The experience acquires greater richness, becomes a  catalyst for forward movement, and gains greater significance  when we recall the role of our Palestinian Arab people, who  dwell in our hearts and consciences, as well as each and every  act of resistance and steadfastness throughout the world. The  Palestinian people have taught all mankind that the weapons of  resistance can be found on the ground as well as in hearts,  consciences, and faithful minds. Wherever there is soil, there  are weapons -- namely stones. Whoever loses control of his  territory is bound to get it back. He is bound to find stones  on it to use in resisting tyrants, the occupiers of the  territory and the usurpers of its history and orchards, who have  been humiliating all Arabs and Muslims.    We salute the struggle of the Palestinian people, the stone-  throwing people, the people who have an abundance of inexpensive  weapons, and who are using them in resisting tyrants. These  weapons are of great significance. Compared to arms depots all  over the world, stones are sacred.    We salute the Somali people, and all peoples who have chosen  to resist the evil will, to confront falsehood with right, to  uphold the rights of the poor by the vindication of right, and  to resist their exploitation by those who seek to rob them of  their dignity, resources, and freedom.    O brothers and friends: Given what we are speaking of on  this occasion; the other things that took place in the eternal  Mother of Battles; the great faith-inspired resistance and  gracious patience demonstrated by the great Iraqi people; and  the examples they have set for mankind in general, and Third  World nations in particular; you can now provide a better answer  to the question posed by some regarding the objective the allies  sought by attacking the Iraqi people, while ignoring others, in  their savage aggression of 17 January 1991. In the same vein,  you can also provide a better answer as to why their demons have  failed to enable them to undermine the spirit of Iraq, and why  their evil exasperation has been aggravated further, prompting  them to engage in successive acts of ceaseless aggression,  including the aggression they are mounting on our airspace and  soil in northern Iraq, the aggression they are mounting on our  airspace in southern Iraq, as well as their continued control of  persons whose records are disgraceful and whose minds are evil,  not to mention the unfair embargo they are maintaining against  us. This has been the fate of their acts despite the blows they  have dealt to Iraq. The answer, brothers, lies in all that we  have said, and also in the example set by the Iraqi people in  terms of the significance of their resistance to tyrants, and  also in terms of the significance of the indispensable gracious  patience they have demonstrated so that they may mark for  themselves, for their nation, and for mankind a juncture for  moving toward a better life along the path of genuine and  selfless interaction that is free of greed, tyrannical  inclinations, injustice, and totalitarianism.    O Arabs: Sound beginnings help achieve sound results.  Although we realize that this alone is not enough to achieve the  necessary results of our nation's struggle and jihad under  circumstances similar to ours, the right description of the  state of affairs in any domain that is viewed from a leadership  perspective and determination is something essential and cannot  be done away with in search of suitable solutions and  accomplishments. It is not enough to embark on an analysis to  explain the background of part of our role as Arabs and the  background of our culture, heritage, and constant position as  handed down throughout history.    Accordingly, what we said about the present stage of  development in international and human life and its negative  phenomena, will genuinely help us as Arabs and help our struggle  and jihad and even our pan-Arab action, each according to the  description befitting him whether the concerned Arabs are  mujahidin and strugglers or mere workers in the political  fields, and regardless of the titles under which any of them was  listed when the nation advanced in its role, position, and  results of what was achieved in terms of civilized description  and offer when Baghdad represented the entire Arab nation  through its influence, role, history, and outlook.    This continued until the eye, soul, strength, and  consciousness of Baghdad stopped playing that role or having  that influence when it collapsed after weakness penetrated the  trunk of its tree. That tree became dry and broke into pieces  at the hands of Hulegu in 1258. Before that date, and right  from the beginning of its representation of the modern Arab age,  Baghdad was a splendid example of balance between the spiritual  values and requisites of development on the one hand, and  outlook for a new life replete with virtue, prosperity, justice,  and fairness in a state far more advanced than all others in the  world on the other. Baghdad had thus based itself on the spirit  of new faith and values of noble Islam. It used Islam's  superiority to nourish the material pillar of life, giving no  prominence to material considerations over spiritual or moral  values. This was the case especially when a serious  contradiction was visible and when the wise men of the nation  and those mainly responsible for its banners and soundness of  its direction agreed that it had this negative description.    However, Baghdad maintained its positive description and  role, as we have said. It was not implicated itself in what  past empires did nor in what subsequent empires continue to do.  It has not replaced the role of a leader, guide, rescuer, and  instructor in its relations with the other nations with the role  of a dominator or subjugator. It has not replaced the role God  has ordained for it in the koranic phrase "But give them  preference over themselves, even though poverty was their own  lot" by a role turning its wise leaders into monopolizers. The  concern of its leaders was how to feed the hungry people, help  the poor, and protect virtue even when those to whom care was  extended were preparing to harm Baghdad.    Subsequently, our Arab civilization has not changed or  developed in a manner that would lead it to produce a community  governed and enslaved by material things. Rather, it exploited  material things in the service of higher values. The spiritual  factor remained the cornerstone of the new civilization and  human values. This state of affairs continued until the Arab  empire collapsed. Despite the weakness that preceded its  existence, and despite the flaws that had been recorded against  it and against its leaders, this empire did not develop into a  materialistic state and society. Almighty and all-powerful God  may have ordained that material development be transferred to  the West so that the Arabs would not bear its consequences and  so that they would not deviate from the sound human track, as  did the Westerners for this and other reasons, in terms of their  relations with other nations and peoples and with their own  selves.    The Arabs have not created a materialistic society following  the example of Western development and the exploitation and  tyranny that this development has created. Yet, the Arabs  remained in a state of temporary inertia, looking indecisively  for a role and seeking to revive their past role. At that  stage, the Ottomans tried to play this role and to obliterate  the role of the Arabs. The Arabs did not score any  accomplishment of historic value, and remained this way until  the beginning of the formation of the regional, so-called nation  states. When 'Abd-al-Nasir launched his revolution of 23 July  1952 in Egypt, many of these states were under foreign control  and basically run as part of foreigners' strategies. Even when  national regimes came to power in some Arab countries, confusion  continued among national rulers, despite Arab thinkers' efforts.  Those rulers either relied on irrelevant parts of history and  heritage, or reviewed history and heritage only to cite verbal  examples that are void of any content and never meant to be put  into practice. Rulers did not play any effective intellectual  role to develop parts of our heritage to support our present  requirements. Many, both rulers and ruled, remained unable to  find the sound formula to strike a balance between the  materialistic and the spiritual, between the past and the  present, between leading a religious life and living under  acceptable contemporary laws, between the contemporary life  copied from the West's trivialities and the nature of the  required life, and between the heritage it values and the  requirements of our age to achieve a spiritual and material  civilization. They remained undecided between the rigid texts  on the recorded history of rule and what we should decide  theoretically and practically after absorbing and learning from  the past. They also remained undecided between the importance  of nationalism and the necessity of pan-Arabism. This state of  affairs continued until most of the people, led by most of the  rulers, were divided into either followers and copiers of the  West's trivialities, which left the people without a spirit and  without a role, or into parrot-like copiers of pieces of history  and heritage, without putting their methods to the test or  molding them to conform with the age in which they live.    As for the process of creating by building on tradition, as  an intellectual and practical stand, we find virtually no  examples of this in the policies of any ruler, nor do we find  its application in a serious, comprehensive, and profound manner.    The sons of the nation have, throughout this period,  continued jihad, struggle, and work. Some of them have brought  us other ideas and views on humanity and the experience of other  nations. Some of the sons of this nation, which God chose as a  nation justly balanced, that ye might be witness over the  nations, and the messenger a witness over you [part of Koranic  verse] -- since it is the source of the first regiment that  upheld the banner of Islam until the banners of faith spread  outside the Arab nation -- have adopted communism,  notwithstanding its atheism, under the pressure of social  injustice and intellectual loss.    Regardless of how close or divergent views are between the  sons of the one nation, following the example of other nations  will not achieve progress for our nation. What will do this is  a process of creation that rests on great faith in God and the  higher values of our spiritual heritage. The foremost of these  values are justice, fairness, creating an appropriate atmosphere  for virtue, fighting vice, and making the poor of the nation the  center of the attention of the ruler, since they have a right to  the wealth of the nation, just as they have duties in the  efforts and jihad of the nation. Also, we must provide the  requirements for the cultural progress of the nation, based on  pan-Arab thought and the structure of the pan-Arab society and  faithful pan-Arab state.    Brothers, friends, believers, free people of the world and  bearers of the banner of dignity. You tyrants, covetous, and  disappointed criminals as well: God decreed our liberation  after our suffering, thus he increased our patience and  capabilities, which are protected by his power. God also gave  us wisdom that enabled the people of Iraq to follow the right  path. Let all villains know, however, that the people and  leadership of Iraq, from a position of responsibility and  patience, will not turn wisdom into a prelude for weakness and  despair.    If we were patient over the continuation of the blockade,  which was imposed by the will of the evildoers, despite all the  actions of the tamperers and evildoers; and were also patient  over the continuation of their flights in the southern part of  our dear, deep-rooted Iraq, that violate its airspace and have  been preventing our planes from flying south of the 32d parallel  for some time with the help of some evildoers from Saudi Arabia  and Kuwait; and the continuation of absurdity in the northern  part of our beloved homeland and in the life of our dear people  north of 36th parallel, despite the fact that the nature of  their intentions and weak pretexts were exposed--we will not  relinquish our people in the northern part of the homeland. Nor  will we stand idle toward the continuation of the blockade and  the violation of our sovereignty in southern Iraq.    For all evildoers, masters and satellites, we reiterate  that they must not be deluded once again or miscalculate things.  They should learn from the lessons of the recent past and  comprehend their meanings on bases free of their evil  intentions. Let them fear God and remember that his will is  above theirs and that of their devils. Otherwise, the  punishment of the criminals is an eye for an eye and a tooth for  a tooth. God is great. For all those concerned among the Arab  rulers, we say: All that you have done against the people of  Iraq is something that angers God, his prophet, the believers,  all free Arabs, those who keep their pledges before God, and all  those who work for the nation's glory, loftiness, and happiness,  and for the sake of triumphing for the poor ones and for  supporting the wronged people against the positions of  injustice, corruption, and hunger. I also say that there is  still some way out of this. I tell the wise believers: Will you  do so? I have conveyed the message, and may God be my witness.    O glorious Iraqi women; O zealous and glorious Iraqi men:  You have endured a great deal. You are worthy of the honorable  endurance you have experienced, and of the rewards of such  endurance. But, you still have to demonstrate the endurance  usually required of believers during the last 10 days of the  blessed month of Ramadan. Of course, there are rewards for  fasting during this period in Ramadan. Patience and fasting  during this period further cleanses the mind while the body is  relieved of additional burdens to obtain the satisfaction of the  merciful and compassionate God. Afterward, people celebrate the  great feast, and mark a great victory of the mind, as well as a  great victory over enemies, God willing.    May God answer our prayers, ease our burdens, strengthen our  patience, and grant us great victory. May God protect our  people, Army, and nation from adversity and mischief. May God  grant us victory over the infidels. Amen. You are the  cherisher and sustainer of the world.    We beseech God to bestow his mercy on the souls of the  martyrs who fell in the Mother of Battles and the al-Qadisiyah  battle, and on all of our righteous martyrs, who fell to uphold  honor, the national cause, and principles. We beseech God to  bestow his mercy on the Arab nation's martyrs, who fell along  the path of struggle, jihad, and fateful battles.    Long live our glorious Arab nation. May its message remain  eternal.    Long live Palestine as a free Arab country. Long live  Palestine. Long live Iraq. Long live Iraq. God is great. God  is great. God is great. And may the lowly be accursed.    May God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you, brothers  and friends.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Hang Seng Bank disappoints HANG SENG Bank, the Hong Kong banking subsidiary of HSBC, disappointed market expectations yesterday by announcing a 17.5 per cent rise in first-half net profit to HKDollars 2.75bn (USDollars 354.8m), up from HKDollars 2.34bn in 1992. The figures included a HKDollars 258.9m exceptional profit from the sale of Wing On Bank. Excluding this one-off profit, net earnings grew by only 6 per cent. However, the bank would not say whether the figures included any provision against its exposure to Olympia and York, the troubled Canadian property company. HSBC Holdings operates the largest retail banking presence in Hong Kong, and owns 61.5 per cent of Hang Seng. Hang Seng's earnings were significantly below analysts' forecasts, but they reflect slower loan growth in Hong Kong and increasing competition for deposits. One analyst said: 'It has been bankers' heaven in Hong Kong for the past two years. We are finally returning to a more normal banking environment.' Last year, net interest margins reached peak levels. Hang Seng Bank has a negative outlook for earnings in the near-term future, as a result of its forecast of a slow economic recovery in the US and Europe, and the impact on Hong Kong of China's austerity measures. 'The impact under this scenario would likely be felt towards the latter part of the year and possibly in 1994, leading to further slackening in exports, investment and domestic spending,' the company said in its official statement. The directors recommended an interim dividend of 50 cents a share, up 16 per cent on 1992's 43 cent payout. Hong Kong's rise, Page 29</p>

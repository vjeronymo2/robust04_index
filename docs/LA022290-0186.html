			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NETHERLANDS TIES ITALY, 0-0  </P> <P> Two World Cup soccer favorites, Italy and the Netherlands, met in an exhibition  match Wednesday in Rotterdam but settled nothing in a scoreless draw.  </P> <P> The result was particularly unsatisfying for Italian Coach Azeglio Vicini,  whose team has scored one goal -- against modest Algeria -- in its last five  games.  </P> <P> Each team was missing one offensive threat, Ruud Gullit for the Dutch and  Gianluca Vialli for the Italians, because of injuries.  </P></p>

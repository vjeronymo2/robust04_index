			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Impossible dreams and irrational benchmarks Consistently outstanding portfolio performance is as elusive as ever, but pursued regardless, according to The WM Company. The Edinburgh firm of performance measurers has carried out some detailed analyses of its database of UK pension fund performance in 1993. The hopes of clients and fund managers spring eternal. WM says that in extreme cases it has had to knock heads together to cause certain funds to amend performance targets which had become 'irrational and unrealistic'. They were chasing an impossible dream. Even some of the more common performance benchmarks, such as median plus 2 per cent over rolling three-year periods, appear to imply almost certain disappointment. In most years this result requires top quartile performance, but only 15 per cent of funds achieve this in three successive years. Over several consecutive three-year periods the fall-out is almost complete: even median plus 1 per cent has only been achieved over more than three successive three-year periods by one in a 100 funds. WM's computers have crunched not only the numbers but also some of the illusions of investment management. Does a group of fashionable specialist managers offer a reasonable chance of outperforming a single balanced manager? There is no evidence that the specialists do better, says WM, in fact over the five-year period 1988-92 (inclusive) the specialists' performance was 1 per cent a year worse. Does a highly active manager, buying cheap and selling dear and turning over the portfolio rapidly, add value? Looking at UK equities WM detects that the skills of managers in trading may have added 0.4 per cent a year. It's not much, and the problem is that it has cost 0.8 per cent a year to achieve this modest result. This is, of course, a very familiar picture of the frailty of investment performance. Much is promised and much effort is expended, but little is delivered. Some managers can achieve success for a period of years, but not indefinitely. Often they attract so much new money that they hopelessly dilute whatever skills they originally had. Excellence is barely distinguishable in the statistics, although WM does say that top performance is achieved slightly more often than could be attributed to pure chance. This is a very shaky justification for the almost universal chase after consistent top quartile returns. Meanwhile contracts are awarded on an unrealistic basis. The clients believe  -or are advised by consultants - that they can reasonably hope to choose an excellent manager, despite the evidence of the statistics. The fund managers, on the other hand, often will not win the business unless they accept an almost unattainable target. In fact the more aggressive targets can rebound on clients. Extra performance will in any case involve higher volatility. But there is also the extra risk inherent in the nature of the management contract, in that the manager may embark on a 'double or quits' strategy in order to retain the contract or to get back into a zone where performance fees can be earned. Some of these dangers may have been enhanced in the UK pension fund sector by the peculiar emphasis on peer group performance - that is, on what the average fund has done. Pension funds and their portfolio managers feel trapped into following the consensus asset allocation strategy more or less exactly. WM's analysis shows that very little of the difference between the best and worst performing UK pension funds is explained by variations in asset mix. It almost all results from stock selection - an area where active managers evidently feel under obligation to accept a degree of risk rather than be exposed as closet passive managers. Perhaps this unhealthy obsession with the consensus will now fade away under the influence of the growing maturity of funds and the introduction of a minimum solvency standard, two reasons why in future UK pension funds will have to select assets with more concern for matching the particular liability structure of the scheme. There may be more emphasis on beating an index than on beating the competition. Of course, by statistical definition comparatively few managers could hope to achieve that by a substantial margin either.</p>

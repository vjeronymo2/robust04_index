			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Breyer in strong challenge: US Supreme Court Vacancy PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is thought to be leaning towards Judge Stephen Breyer of Massachusetts to fill the vacancy on the US Supreme Court. The only semi-official word from the White House is the president is considering a short list of two, Judge Breyer and Mr Bruce Babbitt, the interior secretary who had appeared the favoured choice earlier. The prospective removal of Mr Babbitt from the cabinet has upset environmentalists, who rate him highly, Republicans, who think the choice would be too 'political', and some of Mr Clinton's own advisers, who cannot see the point of entertaining a confirmation battle for a new interior secretary. The president's stated criteria for a new justice are broad legal experience, preferably elective office, and 'a big heart'. He is also inclined towards someone he knows personally. Mr Babbitt, former attorney-general and governor of Arizona, fits this bill. Judge Breyer, recovering from a road accident, is in many respects Mr Babbitt's opposite, though both graduated from Harvard law school. Appointed to the federal bench by President Carter, he is, at 54, chief federal appeals court judge for the circuit based in Boston and has spent most of his life in academia and the law. He has good political connections, most obviously with the Kennedy family, and a solid legal reputation as an intellectual, pragmatic jurist sufficient to have won the approval of some Republican senators. Judge Breyer has placed his legal stamp on sentencing guidelines, airline deregulation, fair housing and freedom of the press. If nominated and confirmed, he would be the first Jew to serve on the court since Justice Abe Fortas resigned in 1969.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement from Russian Federation Defense Ministry </F> Information and Press Directorate under "From Informed Sources"  rubric: "Let Us Not Dramatize"]    [Text] On 16 March 1994, PRAVDA published an article by  Major General Viktor Chudov, retired, entitled "Our Strategists  Are Too Unsophisticated." In the article he discussed the  forthcoming Russo-U.S. joint exercises. The article contained a  series of gross distortions. The author of the article, who  does not have true information on the planned exercises, casts  doubt on the military-political expediency of them and, at the  same time, of the whole range of Russo-U.S. relations in the  military sphere.    The publication distorts the scale and nature of the planned  exercises. In particular, the author asserts that the U.S. 3d  Infantry Division and the Russian Armed Forces 27th Motorized  Rifle Division are being drafted into this event in their full  complement. In fact the plan is not to stage troop exercises  involving all the personnel of the two divisions together with  their combat hardware and weapons but merely a command and staff  exercise with a very limited number of personnel (up to 250 men  per side) and vehicles.    Parts of the forthcoming exercise will indeed be rehearsed  at  the Totskiy test range. This is due to the fact that the 27th  Motorized Rifle Division is stationed in the area of the test  range and a center for training peacekeeping forces, the only  one of its kind in the Russian Armed forces at present, has been  created here.    As for the cost of holding the exercise, the United States  is  prepared to bear that in full (up to $2 million). For the  Russian side this is a planned exercise and does not entail any  additional costs.    The main aim of this joint measure is to rehearse questions  of cooperation in the performance of peacekeeping operations.  The forthcoming command and staff exercise should make a real  contribution to the cause of international cooperation in the  settlement of conflicts in trouble spots and to the preservation  of world peace.</p>

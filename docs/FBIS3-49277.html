			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] During a news conference held yesterday, Mr.  Nicolae Manolescu, chairman of the Civic Alliance Party [PAC],  announced that representatives of the parties that are members  of the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] will meet with  Romania's President Ion Iliescu on Tuesday, 11 January.    During the news conference held yesterday by the leaders of  the Democratic Party-National Salvation Front [PD-FSN], Messrs.  Petre Roman and Adrian Severin expressed their worry over the  possibility that Romania might not be among the countries that  would be integrated into NATO first. Romania's integration into  that body would both ensure national security and represent our  country's acknowledgment as a part of the free world, the PD-FSN  representatives said.    The vice chairman of the National Romanian Unity Party  [PUNR], Mr. Ion Gavra, announced yesterday that his party had  requested that the suggestions included in its anticrisis  program should be implemented by the government within a  so-called austerity program that is to be presented in  parliament at the beginning of February.    A communique released yesterday by the Greater Romania Party  [PRM] announces that they learned with deep concern about the  decisions taken by the Satu Mare and Maramures County Councils  on their adherence to the so-called Euro-Carpathian region, an  artificial structure that endangers Romania's security and  integrity. The PRM demands that the illegal decisions of the  two chairmen of the aforementioned county councils should  immediately be annulled.</p>

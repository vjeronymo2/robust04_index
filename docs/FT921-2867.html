			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Observer: On board Good to see that GPA, Ireland's high-flying aircraft leasing company, seems to have come to its senses and realised that it cannot allow Maurice Foley, the 51-year-old president, to bail out of his executive duties only months after it comes to the stock market. If one is going to persuade the world's punters to back this high-risk enterprise, the least that can be expected is that key members of the management team are required to stay on board until the company has proved that it can fly out of the recession. All it needs now is for Tony Ryan, GPA's reclusive founder, to put in an appearance at a press conference and GPA would have the makings of a half- normal stock market debut.</p>

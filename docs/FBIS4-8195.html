			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cajnice, 12 Apr (TANJUG) -- According to the  command of the Bosnian Serb Herzegovina Corps, a paramedic team  was hit in the American bombing raid on civilian targets and  positions of Herzegovina Corps soldiers yesterday instead of  tanks, as NATO representatives claimed.    Milomir Ceranic and Radomir Maljevic, paramedics from Gacko,  were killed on this occasion. Two houses in the Serb village of  Bare, two km south of the Gorazde town center on the right bank  of the Drina river, were also destroyed. [passage omitted]    No one was killed in the attack launched by American planes  on Preljuca [15 km south of Gorazde] but one passenger car was  destroyed. Serb forces' tanks were not hit in this attack  either, contrary to claims by NATO representatives. [passage  omitted]</p>

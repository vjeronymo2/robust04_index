			<p>BFN     [Text] The Lao Ambassador to Thailand, Bounkeut Sangsomsak,  denied reports of an imminent cabinet reshuffle in his country,  and insisted any change was still a long time off.    "Normally a change could be expected every five years, at  the  party congress," Bounkeut said. He said the next party congress  would be held in two years. During the Fifth Lao People's  Revolutionary Party Congress in 1991, party Secretary-General  Kaysone Phomvihan became president of Laos and Khamthai  Siphandon replaced him as prime minister. The ambassador denied  an earlier report that a large-scale change was expected soon in  the cabinet, saying the report was inaccurate. "The change will  not come so soon," he said.    The report said six cabinet posts -- four economic and two  security affairs -- would be affected by the change. There has  been frequent speculation about changes in Laos since the death  of President Kaysone in November, 1992. After his death, there  was one minor cabinet reshuffle in which Somsavat Lengsavat  became foreign minister to replace Phoun Sipaseut.</p>

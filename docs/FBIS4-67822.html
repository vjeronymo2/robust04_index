			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Varlamov] </F>   [Text] Hiroshima April 14 TASS -- Contemporary nuclear arms  are a means of maintaining the world military-political balance.  The only alternative to them is a regime of total international  confidence. This is stated in a report of the Russian  delegation submitted to the 27th conference of the Japanese  atomic industrial forum underway here. The report has been  drawn up by the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy. It believes  that the Russian nuclear complex which is experiencing difficult  times should export more electricity generated by nuclear power  plants and should heavier rely on the export of technologies and  a number of materials. It should be open to international  cooperation.    In view of the unstable situation in the world, while  nuclear  disarmament is in progress, the complex of nuclear arms is under  certain obligations, says the report. More stable, easier  verifiable and predictable strategic arms systems should be  preserved while surplus, morally and obsolete provocatively  dangerous kinds of nuclear arms should be eliminated.    Russia spends up to one thousand billion roubles a year to  dismantle such armaments, according to the information of the  Ministry of Atomic Energy. The basic stocks of arms are worn to  over 50 per cent. A large-scale modernisation is required in  keeping with contemporary demands, also in order to dismantle  and utilise nuclear arms.    The Ministry of Atomic Energy regards as a way out a broader  use of vast scientific and technological potential accumulated  over the decades of the development of the atomic industry.  ``In addition to large state investment, Russia's participation  in the market of high technologies and scientific and  technological progress with drawing foreign capital in  reasonable and mutually advantage proportion would be useful to  all sides,'' says the report. ``The ministry annually receives  80 million dollars of additional financing for scientific and  technological projects. As a result of external financing of  projects carried out at enterprises of the Ministry of Atomic  Energy with the subsequent joint use.''    The new generation of nuclear power and thermal stations  with  fuel recycling and deactivation of waste, including slow-neutron  and fast-neutron reactors with the use of uranium-plutonium fuel  and the uranium-thorium cycle also requires considerable  outlays. These power plants will be much more safer because of  features of their design including an uncontrolled chain  reaction of nuclei. Russia views as an additional source of  investment into the area the expansion of the export of  electricity generated by nuclear power plants, of equipment and  fuel for power plants, including products for the utilisation of  weapon-grade uranium and plutonium, as well as rare-earth  metals, medical isotopes and high-calory fertilizer which are  produced in the framework in the nuclear complex. This  investment will reach one billion dollars this year.</p>

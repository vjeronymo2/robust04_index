			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: Continental fends off Pirelli voting plan RELATIONS between Pirelli and Continental, two of Europe's biggest tyre groups, plumbed new depths of hostility yesterday when Pirelli was out-manoeuvred in its attempt to remove shareholder voting restrictions at Continental. The defeat for the Italian company, which last year abandoned plans to merge with the German group, came at Continental's annual general meeting in Hanover. In front of several hundred shareholders Mr Ulrich Weiss, chairman of the Continental supervisory board, ruled that the voting rights on Pirelli's direct and indirect shareholding in Continental would remain limited to 5 per cent. This was the second time that Pirelli had sought to remove a rule which limits shareholders' votes in Continental to 5 per cent no matter how big that shareholders' stake. Pirelli has 5 per cent of Continental and options over a further 33.4 per cent. However, Pirelli was able to inflict an immediate counter-blow by withholding its support for Continental's move to increase its nominal share capital by DM150m (Dollars 98.6m) as a prelude to a rights issue. For technical reasons, Pirelli was able to vote its full holding on this point and the motion obtained only a 50 per cent vote compared to the required 75 per cent. Mr Weiss's decision over voting rights provoked a furious reaction from Mr Gert Silber-Bonz, chairman of Pirelli's German operations. He delivered a short statement to say that Pirelli was 'dismayed' at the 'absolutely unwarranted decision'. He said Pirelli would challenge the decision and all others taken by the meeting in the courts. The decision - which was greeted with cheers from many small shareholders - came despite a last-minute bid from Pirelli to persuade Continental that its option agreement did not breach the rule which limits votes in Continental to 5 per cent. Mr Weiss, a main board director at Deutsche Bank with responsibility for its Italian operations, told the meeting that Continental's independence would be threatened if Pirelli were allowed to exercise its full voting rights. 'I believe that the elimination of voting rights restrictions is not in the interest of the company at the present time,' he said, 'or of small independent shareholders. If Pirelli made use of its option, it would have control of the company'. Yesterday's events are likely to provoke a prolonged bout of litigation between the two companies. It was in December last year that they abandoned merger talks after more than a year of often acrimonious negotiations. Last year Pirelli won a vote to get rid of the voting restrictions, but this decision was never enacted pending an appeal to the Hanover court. The court recently annulled the decision, on the basis that Pirelli failed to reveal that it spoke more than 25 per cent of Continental's shares. Continental's chairman, Hubertus von Gruenberg, expressed disappointment a the failure of the capital move. He said Continental would consider listing its Contitech unit on the German stock market next year and would also consider other measures to raise funds.</p>

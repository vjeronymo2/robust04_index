			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RILEY'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE QUALITY OF LIFE  </P> <P> So Supervisor Thomas F. Riley's name is to adorn the new passenger terminal at  Orange County Airport. How fitting that this man, who has single-handedly done  more to overpopulate Orange County and obliterate natural open space as an  Orange County supervisor, should be so honored.  </P> <P> As passengers stream out of this new terminal to the inevitable traffic jam in  any direction from the airport, may they pause a moment (there will be many) to  reflect on this man's "contribution" to Orange County's quality of life.  </P> <P> RON ROMANOSKY  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

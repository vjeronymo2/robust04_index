			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Juergen Voges report: "Militant Police Defend </F> Republikaner"]    [Text] Hannover -- Friday evening [11 February] about  2,000 mostly young people protested in front of Hannover's  Stadthalle building against an election campaign event held by  Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber. After a rally, called  by trade unions, Greens, and the Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD], 1,000 Lower Saxon policemen used extremely harsh  measures to put an end to all attempts to block the Republikaner  event.    After a protest march to the Stadthalle, which was  completely  cordoned off, Helga Christensen, Hannover district chairwoman of  the German Trade Union Federation, and IG-Metall district head  Juergen Peters made speeches, pointing to the connection between  mass unemployment and the danger from the right. Hannover Mayor  Herbert Schmalstieg (SPD) said at the rally that it was a  mistake to have leased part of the Stadthalle to the  Republikaner. Schmalstieg regretted that the city's attempt to  ban the Republikaner rally failed because of a decision by the  Administrative Court.    After the rally, calls to block the Republikaner event were  issued by megaphone. Previously there had been individual  brawls between young demonstrators and Schoenhuber fans. Eggs,  fire crackers, and bottles occasionally flew in the direction of  the Stadthalle or the police. The police acted with  extraordinary brutality against the remaining demonstrators. A  mounted police unit galloped into the crowd. Three water  cannons fired at the Republikaner' opponents. Individual groups  of demonstrators were herded together and beaten with  truncheons, even while some of the demonstrators were already on  their way home.    The leftist group Anti-Republikaner Action Alliance later  spoke of "a police operation as Hannover had not seen for a long  time." Gila Altmann, spokeswoman of the Alliance 90/Greens Land  Executive Committee, criticized the police operation as  "excessive and brutal." Within just a few minutes the police  made the first, second, and third calls on the demonstrators to  disperse, so that afterwards they could act against the  anti-Schoenhuber demonstration with all possible harshness. One  cannot speak at all of de-escalating behavior by the police,  which had been agreed on beforehand.</p>

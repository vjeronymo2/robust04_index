			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Veksler] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 28 Apr -- A conference of heads and  executive directors of news agencies of CIS member-states, which  finished today at the ITAR-TASS building, has spoken out for the  need to make efficient use of the unified information space.  Attending it were delegations from Armenia, Georgia,  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine, as well as  representatives from the sovereign states' embassies.    In the opinion of ARMENPRESS director Gevorka Oganesyan,  "the  main result of the meeting is that we have managed to do some  constructive work after the collapse of the Soviet Union. I  recall a similar conference last year, which was quite amorphous  in content and at which those attending had major differences.  But now, at the insistence of a majority of the agencies, a  decision in principle has been made to make really effective use  of the new unified information space. In connection with this,  an appropriate memorandum to the chairman of the  Interparliamentary Assembly was passed."    "Our Republic is developing along democratic lines, freedom  of speech and the press is developing, and naturally we need an  outlet into the international information space," said Akbar  Ryskulov, director of the Kyrgyzkabar agency. "We are ready to  cooperate with any professional news agency that propagandizes  basic human ideals. Furthermore, the more independent we become,  the more we regard information integration as important and  topical for us, and the meeting at ITAR-TASS and the documents  adopted at it will undoubtedly promote the development of this  process."    Boris Petrov, director of ITAR-TASS in St. Petersburg, said  he was deeply satisfied with the course and character of the  meeting and the content of the decisions adopted, particularly  the proposals to create a permanently functioning council of  heads of CIS news agencies. In his view, "the general situation  regarding the creation and building of structures to coordinate  the activity of the CIS has reached a phase that demands the  creation of a similar structure in the information field as  well."</p>

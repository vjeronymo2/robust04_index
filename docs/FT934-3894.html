			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Observer: Mrs Volvo speaks out However hard Volvo's So ren Gyll may protest that he has not betrayed his chairman, Pehr Gyllenhammar, during Volvo's ill-fated plan to merge with Renault, he is never going to satisfy Mrs Christina Gyllenhammar. In a bitter letter in yesterday's Gothenburg Post, Mrs Gyllenhammar accused Gyll of using the merger issue to take over Volvo from her husband. 'You realised that you could use it to get more power - not through something you built up yourself, but through using something someone else had created,' she wrote. 'At no time did you turn to your chairman for his help in discussing and tackling the situation. You blew up the criticism and opposition (to the merger) which would lead to a more certain 'no' at the shareholder meeting.' For good measure, she also took a swipe at 'backward-looking and nostalgic' former Volvo executives, such as former chief executive Gunnar Johansson, who were prominent critics of the merger. Her fury has more resonance than the pique of a wounded spouse. Mrs G's father, Gunnar Engellau, led Volvo from 1956 until he was succeeded by his son-in-law in 1971. In answer to the obvious question, Mrs Gyllenhammar stressed she was not speaking for her husband but felt moved to break a 40-year vow of silence on Volvo matters for the sake of 'my conscience and my family's honour'.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Damascus Syrian Arab Television Network  in Arabic at 1900 GMT on 20 February airs a special program  entitled "Documentary on Syria's Efforts in the Field of  Combating Drugs and Narcotics" produced by the "Interior  Ministry in cooperation with the Syrian Arab Television" under  the supervision of the "Moral Guidance Directorate, in  coordination with the Criminal Investigation Department."    The program starts with a general review of the problem of  drug abuse in the world and the international efforts to combat  the problem. The program notes that "although Syria is not a  country of drug plantation, processing, or production, it  is--because of its location--a country of passage.  Consequently, it is not immune to the threats posed by this  problem. Syria, like other countries, is certainly a target for  the merchants and traffickers of this fatal poison."    The program adds that Syria has signed every international  agreement and protocol on countering narcotics and is linked  with several countries in the world by bilateral agreements on  the subject. Syria is also a member of Interpol, which is a  principal player in the war on drug trafficking, and has played  a key role in formulating the unified Arab strategy on combating  drug abuse and the draft unified Arab law on narcotics, the  report adds.    The program includes interviews with a professor of  international law in Damascus University's Law Faculty who  explains Syria's involvement in the world drive to combat drug  abuse. He notes that a law on combating drugs was issued in  1992 and explains the provisions of that law, which stipulates  severe punishments for producers, farmers, and traffickers of  drugs. The law also stipulates provisions to fight drug-related  money laundering, he says.    In an interview for the program, the director of  Ibn-al-Nafis  Hospital in Damascus says a unit has been set up in his hospital  to treat drug addicts free of charge. Patients, he says, are  treated in strict confidence and no information about them is  divulged to any one.    The announcer notes that the Interior Ministry is providing  every facility to help develop the anti-narcotics agencies to  enable them to fulfill their duties. He says that Syria has  scored major achievements in the fight against drug trafficking  and confiscates and destroys large quantities of various  narcotics each year.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOMOSEXUALITY  </P> <P> This is my reply to Robert J. Jensen's letter (Sept. 17): No, Mr. Jensen, it is  not "ignorant to point out that there is no proof that homosexuals are born  that way." But it is ignorant to ignore studies and facts that claim they,  indeed, are born that way. And now to the politicians with "guts and moral  backbone": If Jensen wants to side with real guts, backbone and common-sense  politicians, I suggest Daniel E. Young, mayor of Santa Ana, and six of his  seven council members.  </P> <P> PETER CLAUSS  </P> <P> OrangeMission Viejo Vote  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At this point, those measures for sources which do not contribute significantly to emissions from the area can be excluded from further consideration as not being reasonable. Three of the public comment measures were excluded as having a minimal impact on PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions and are identified in Appendix B, Exhibits 5 and 12 of the SIP revision. In addition, six of the public comment measures were excluded because they relate to sources not present in the PPA due to its geographic or climatic conditions. These measures are identified in Appendix B, Exhibits 4 and 5 of the SIP revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The next test for reasonableness is the technological and economic feasibility of implementing a measure in a particular area. Two of the public comment measures were deemed to be technologically infeasible in the PPA: congestion pricing and road pricing. According to information contained in Appendix B, Exhibit 4, this conclusion is based on a report developed by an EPA contractor entitled ``Improved Air Quality in Maricopa and Pima Counties_The Applicability of Transportation Measures'' (Cambridge Systematics, Inc., November 1986). This report is included in the docket accompanying this proposed rulemaking. Another measure deemed infeasible for the PPA was to implement tradable travel permits. According to information in Appendix B, Exhibit 5, this measure is considered a long term option due to the magnitude of change required for implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two measures were determined to be economically infeasible. Non-employee parking pricing was considered to be infeasible because businesses impacted by such costs would be put at a major disadvantage in competing with others not affected. See Appendix B, Exhibit 12. Electrification of railroads is not feasible due to the excessive cost of approximately $1.5 million per mile. See Appendix B, Exhibit 5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four of the public comment measures affect emissions associated with aircraft and airports and are already being implemented by Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix and the Federal Aviation Administration. These measures are identified in Appendix B, Exhibits 4 and 12. One measure addresses emission standards for new jet aircraft engines. Adoption of this type of control measure is outside the jurisdiction of the State or local governments and is identified in Appendix B, Exhibit 5. One public comment measure involves the deregulation of private transit. However, according to the SIP revision in Appendix B, Exhibit 5, there are currently no regulations in the PPA that restrict private transit operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the remaining 62 measures submitted during the public comment period, 53 measures are essentially the same as the initial MAG measures and 9 measures were to be addressed in the State's 1993 SIP revisions for carbon monoxide and ozone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised list of possible RACM consists of 79 measures (21 EPA measures and 58 MAG measures). The Maricopa Association of Governments Air Quality Planning Committee (MAGAQPC) further excluded MAG measure  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1 and portions of MAG measure  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2 (described on page 6&hyph;14 of the SIP revision). These measures address broadening the State vehicle inspection and maintenance program ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1) and controls on diesel vehicles ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2). While MAG retained the portion of MAG measure  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2 that addresses the use of number one diesel fuel, the other portions of that measure were excluded from further consideration because they were determined to be economically infeasible. See Appendix B, Exhibit 7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to Chapter 6 of the SIP revision, 43 of the MAG measures were specifically adopted for the State's 1987 carbon monoxide (CO) SIP. As mentioned in the emission inventory section of this notice, exhaust from gasoline and diesel vehicles are also significant contributors to the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment problem. The SIP's emission inventory identifies exhaust from gasoline vehicles as contributing about 20 percent of the total annual PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions and exhaust from diesel vehicles as contributing about 16 percent. These CO measures are included in the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP revision because they could also reduce particulate matter emissions. These measures, identified in Chapter 6 of the SIP revision on pages 6&hyph;18 through 6&hyph;26, are designed to reduce vehicle exhaust emissions through strengthening the vehicle inspection and maintenance programs, requiring cleaner burning fuels in vehicles, relieving traffic congestion, and reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by providing alternative modes of transportation. Many of the CO measures are transportation control measures (TCMs). In a November 14, 1991 conformity analysis of the MAG Transportation Improvement Plan and Regional Transportation Plan, EPA concluded that TCMs with quantifiable emission reductions were in fact being expeditiously implemented. A copy of this conformity analysis is included in the docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the CO measures had already been implemented when the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP revision was being prepared, any reduction benefits associated with them are built into the 1989 baseline PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission inventory and the 1994 projected PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission inventory. Therefore the State has claimed no additional credit from reductions from these measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exclusion of these CO measures from the list of PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  possible RACM leaves 35 measures to be addressed: 21 EPA measures and 14 MAG measures. However, in reviewing the remaining 14 MAG measures, EPA has determined that nine of these MAG measures are nearly identical to the EPA suggested RACM measures. One of the remaining five MAG measures, use of number one diesel fuel, would reduce particulate emissions because it is a cleaner burning fuel than other types of diesel fuel. However, EPA has addressed this type of measure on a national level in a Federal rulemaking. As of October 1, 1993, EPA implemented a new national program of diesel fuel quality control, requiring refiners to reduce the sulfur content of on-highway diesel fuel. See 55 FR 34120, August 21, 1990. As a result of this program, EPA estimates that total particulate emissions from diesel engines could be reduced up to 90 percent nationwide by 1995. The remaining four MAG measures address fugitive dust sources not specifically addressed by EPA's RACM measures. Local cities and towns in the nonattainment area were encouraged to develop regulations or programs to implement these measures, but no local regulations (i.e. regulations adopted by the cities and towns making up the nonattainment area) were included in the plan submitted to EPA. However, as discussed below, Maricopa County has adopted a countywide fugitive dust rule which EPA believes fully addresses fugitive dust sources in the PPA and incorporates the emission goals of these four remaining MAG measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

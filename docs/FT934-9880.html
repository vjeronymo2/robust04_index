			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Japan coalition shaken by poll loss THE FRAGILITY of Japan's ruling coalition was underlined at the weekend when it lost a local election to a candidate backed by the Liberal Democratic party, the former governing party. The seven-party coalition, the most popular Japanese government on record, lost the election for the governorship of Hiroshima Prefecture because it failed to agree on a joint candidate. Only three coalition parties managed to agree on a name, while the remaining four refused to back anybody. As a result, an independent supported by the LDP, Mr Yuzan Fujita, a former member of the upper house of parliament for Hiroshima, won the election by a big margin. He got 392,842 votes to 280,531 for the three-party candidate. This adds weight to indications that the coalition government will lose the next general election if it fails to put up a field of joint candidates. An election is likely towards mid-1994, assuming the government succeeds in getting agreement on plans to reform the political system. The LDP's failure to achieve political reform contributed to its defeat last June. The next test of the coalition's electoral fortunes is due on December 5, when Hiroshima holds a parliamentary by-election to fill the seat vacated by Mr Fujita on his election as governor.</p>

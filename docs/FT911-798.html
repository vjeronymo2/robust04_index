			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (5): Lively Liberal campaign - Angus Foster highlights the two main political groupings THE UNITED Democrats of Hong Kong, led by Mr Martin Lee, an outspoken lawyer, is the colony's best-known political party. It was formed last year from a collection of liberal pressuregroups united by their opposition to China's Tiananmen Square crackdown. As well as prominent leaders such as Mr Lee, university lecturer Mr Yeung Sum and teacher Mr Szeto Wah, the party has strong grass roots support among Hong Kong's middle class and younger voters. In the March district board election, the party won 56 of 80 seats it contested, leading to its claim to be Hong Kong's largest political party. In the September elections, the United Democrats will field 14 candidates on a populist platform calling for full democracy for Hong Kong. It will also push for stricter environmental protection. In a bid to attract working class voters, the party will campaign for higher public spending and oppose the importation of foreign labour. But the party will be attacked for being idealist, for its confrontational stance towards China and its links with groups branded as 'counter revolutionary' by Peking. Mr Lee and Mr Szeto were both expelled from the Peking-appointed Basic Law Drafting Committee after their criticism of China in 1989. Business and conservative groups will also claim the United Democrats' public spending policies will raise taxes. Because many of the party's leaders are professionals, its opponents will claim they are more interested in emigrating. Other liberal groups contesting the elections include the Hong Kong Democratic Foundation, Meeting Point and the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood. Successful candidates from these parties will probably link up with the United Democrats to form a liberal platform in the Legislative Council. The Democratic Foundation was founded by two prominent legislative councillors, Dr Leong Che-hung and Mr Jimmy McGregor, a former government official and one of the few British expatriates involved in politics. The grouping has 360 members and will field between one and four candidates. But Mr McGregor has decided not to recontest his seat after falling out with his constituents. The Foundation will push for a faster pace of democratic reform although it sees its role as moderating between the mainstream liberals and conservatives. But outside middle class constituencies, the Foundation will have little support.</p>

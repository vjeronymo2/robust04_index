			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Leyland Trucks turnover at Pounds 148m Leyland Trucks, which was rescued last year by a management buy-out, achieved a turnover of Pounds 148m in its first 11 months of trading, the company said yesterday, Kevin Done writes. The company produced 6,800 trucks in the 11 months to the end of April and plans to raise output to 8,000 vehicles in this financial year. Leyland Trucks, which emerged from the collapse of the former Daf group last summer, has increased production by about 20 per cent since it was formed. Mr John Gilchrist, chief executive, who led the buy-out team, said the present output level was 190 vehicles a week. The workforce had been increased by 40 to 670, he said, compared with a total of 1,100 employed at the assembly plant at Leyland, Lancashire, before the Daf group went into receivership last year. The break-even level for production had been reduced to about 5,500 trucks a year. The company had cut its annual costs by about Pounds 10m since 1992 and was seeking to reduce costs by a further Pounds 2m a year. Leyland Trucks has established three main business areas: the production of its 45-series light trucks for sale through the European dealer network of Daf Trucks, the Dutch company formed after the collapse of the Daf group; the production of military trucks; and the production and sale of trucks outside Europe. Mr Gilchrist said the company expected to sell 7,000 trucks through the Daf network this year, and forecast that this total would rise sharply next year and in 1996. For sales outside Europe, Leyland Trucks has formed links with two new independent companies: Leyland Exports, which handles sales to sub-Saharan countries; and Leyland Asia-Pacific, part of the Thai-Rung group based in Thailand. In its first year of operations Leyland Trucks has won export orders worth Pounds 7m from 20 different countries. The company announced yesterday a new contract to supply 180 45-series light trucks and Comet buses to Morocco in an order worth Pounds 4m. The group is seeking new military truck business. Last March it completed its Pounds 155m contract to supply 1,522 ammunition carriers to the Ministry of Defence.</p>

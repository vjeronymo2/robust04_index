			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our military correspondent has just reported that  the Lebanese Army position in Saydun in the Jazzin area was  attacked by saboteurs at dawn today. The South Lebanese Army  [SLA] provided support for the Lebanese Army post. A number of  posts in the Jazzin area, Jazzin, and al-'Ayshiyah came under  artillery and rocket fire from saboteurs' positions. The SLA  artillery returned fire at the sources located outside the  villages, although most of the firing came from inside the  villages. Our correspondent notes that the saboteurs passed  through Lebanese Army checkpoints in a region outside the border  strip to attack a Lebanese Army position. Our correspondent  confirms that Hizballah's claims that it attacked five SLA  positions are totally false.    [Paris AFP in English at 0831 GMT on 25 March in a  Sidon-datelined item adds the following:    ["Iranian-backed Hizballah guerrillas on Friday killed three  fighters with Israel's proxy militia in south Lebanon, security  services said.    ["The three South Lebanon Army militiamen were killed in the  area of Jazzin, which Israel controls, during a dawn offensive  by Hizballah against eight SLA positions, they said.    ["Hizballah said in a statement earlier that it had seized  two small forts, captured two SLA militiamen and destroyed three  Soviet-built tanks sent as reinforcements. It said its fighters  left "several killed or wounded."    ["The SLA's Voice of the South radio confirmed the attacks  but did not mention casualties. It said two of its militiamen  were taken prisoner at Nab' al-Safa, about one kilometer (0.6  miles) outside Israel's self-declared security zone.    ["SLA artillery hit back firing about 200 shells against a  dozen villages in the Iqlim at-Tuffah range, a Hizballah  stronghold southeast of Sidon, Lebanese police said.    ["A mother and her son were killed when a shell slammed into  their home in Jba', police added.    ["On Monday, two Israeli soldiers and two SLA militiamen  were  killed in attacks claimed by Hizballah and a hardline  Palestinian group based in Damascus, the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command.    ["The retaliatory shelling killed three civilians, including  two school children, and wounded 24 others including 15 pupils  who were on a school bus."]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- Most Russian retired military  living in the Baltic states are elderly people and pose no  threat to the security of the countries, according to Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev who also said that the fact is  clearly understood by the Baltic leaderships who, however,  "remain hostages of the political situation".    80 per cent of the pensioners are over 60. "They have  nowhere  to leave and pose no threat to the national security. Besides,  they receive pensions from the Russian Defence Ministry",  Kozyrev told Russian mass media chiefs on Tuesday.    "Leaders of the Baltic republics are intelligent people and  clearly realise that the problem is artificial. However, they  remain hostages of the political situation", Kozyrev said and  added that he is pessimistic about an early solution of the  problem of Russian retired military living in Estonia.    The main Russian task is that "military pensioners in the  Baltics are not offended and humiliated", the minister stressed.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: 3i There is some justification in 3i's satisfaction with yesterday's annual results. The group has managed to keep investing during the recession, though one has to take it on trust that it is only taking on good quality business; its cost-cutting efforts are beginning to pay off; and its balance sheet is strong enough for it to take advantage of the recovery. These, though, are all also reasons for disappointment at the delay in its flotation. The past year saw a sharp rise - to Pounds 115m from Pounds 89m - in profits from the realisation of investments. Evidently 3i's clients have decided that now is a good time to cash in, a view which is also reflected in the number of new issues coming to the stock market. Its shareholders, by contrast, are hanging on for more. This is not just because there is no longer any need for a fire sale to help the Midland Bank. They seem genuinely to believe that greater value may be had by waiting. This may yet prove rash. The value of its portfolio should grow with recovery. Provisions should also fall from last year's Pounds 171m, including the appalling Pounds 72m on Isosceles which 3i seems all too anxious to shrug off. But UK demand for venture capital remains weak, while 3i's relative inexperience in continental Europe makes now a risky time to be stepping up involvement there. Recovery has seen a narrowing of the discount to net assets at which quoted venture capital investment trusts trade. Given its conservative valuations, 3i might not reap much advantage from this trend. It will serve 3i's shareholders right if they become so greedy they end up losing out.</p>

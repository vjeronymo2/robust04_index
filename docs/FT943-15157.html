			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Owners Abroad The package holiday company, announces first-half results on Wednesday, with the pre-tax loss expected to be about Pounds 35m. This compares with a pre-tax loss last time of Pounds 38.6m, which included the Pounds 4.6m cost of successfully fending off a takeover bid from Airtours. There is nothing alarming about a first-half deficit for a holiday company: customers' full payments arrive in the second half. More important will be the new management's assessment of the state of the summer market and the prospects of a price war.</p>

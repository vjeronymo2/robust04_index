			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: French buy and recovery in US helps Wolseley rise 41% WOLSELEY, the heating and plumbing distributor which owns Plumb Center, reported a 41 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 47.6m for the six months to end-January. The figure was helped by recovery on the US East Coast and a first full contribution from Brossette in France. Brossette, acquired in the second half of last year, contributed Pounds 9.3m after using fair value provisions of Pounds 1.3m. Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman, said that despite the results, recovery was 'patchy' in its main markets. He added that conditions in Europe remained difficult - 'the last six months won't linger in my memory.' In the US, operating profits increased 33 per cent to Pounds 18.3m while turnover increased 13 per cent to Pounds 542m. On the East Coast, Carolina Builders and Ferguson performed strongly but the Californian market remained depressed. US profits were lifted by about Pounds 600,000 due to exchange rate movements following sterling's fall. In the UK, Plumb Center lifted profits slightly for the first time since the recession started. The rise reflected months of cost cutting rather than a stronger market. However, sales in February were higher than a year ago, the company said. Mr Lancaster said Brossette's results were better than expected. Although recession in the French construction sector was likely to worsen, Brossette would be helped by savings because of reduced labour costs in the second half. Net borrowings increased more than Pounds 60m to Pounds 122.6m, lifting gearing from 17 per cent to 32 per cent. However, most of the increase was due to exchange rate movements on overseas debt. Earnings increased 30 per cent to 12.86p. Because of a previous imbalance between the interim and final dividends, the interim payment is lifted 14.5 per cent to 3.55p. COMMENT The unconventional Mr Lancaster has become well known for his pessimism, but his dismissal of the last six months' trading conditions as forgetable is more than churlish. These results were much better than the market had been led to expect, and the shares rose 10p to 604p. In the US, Carolina Builders lifted sales 23 per cent and in Europe the combined buying power of the UK and French operations is starting to bear fruit. All of which is wonderful news if one is already a shareholder. If not, given that the share price has more than doubled since last September and forecast full year profits of Pounds 105m put the shares on more than 20 times, they are expensive.</p>

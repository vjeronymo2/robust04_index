			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> It is my impression that movies, TV and stage shows were to be entertainment,  which the dictionary defines as diverting and amusing. What puzzles me is when  I hear producers say a program wasn't realistic enough.  </P> <P> Since when is realism diverting and amusing? Could it be that these people  aren't realistic enough to know the difference?  </P> <P> My interpretation of entertainment is "The Wizard of Oz," "Superman," "Back to  the Future," "Batman," "Star Trek," Sherlock Holmes, Robin Hood, Tarzan, Disney  classics and so on. All quite unrealistic, but everlasting!  </P> <P> I think the most realistic thing to do is keep bedrooms for sleeping, violence  for the news broadcasts and return to real entertainment that is both diverting  and amusing.  </P> <P> Jane Wall, Long Beach  </P></p>

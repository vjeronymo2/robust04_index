			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Rap Intellectualized: A Rhodes scholar testified Tuesday in federal court in  Ft.  </P> <P> Lauderdale, Fla., about cultural, political and literary value in the music of  controversial rappers 2 Live Crew. "The music is political simply in that you  have a group of artists who are saying 'I'm going to express myself the way I  express myself,' " said Carlton Long, who said he will teach political science  at Columbia University this year. The group's album, "As Nasty As They Wanna  Be," has been banned from several Florida counties, and U.S. District Judge  Jose Gonzalez Jr. is considering whether the album should be banned from  Broward County.

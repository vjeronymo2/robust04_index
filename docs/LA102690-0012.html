			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MULLEN GIVES RANGERS AN ASSIST IN 5-3 WIN  </P> <P> The New York Rangers spent the off-season brooding over their failure to  advance past the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs.  </P> <P> They vowed to prove that it was no fluke they won the competitive Patrick  Division title last spring.  </P> <P> Now they are off to a fast start.  </P> <P> Brian Mullen assisted on four goals Thursday night at New York as the Rangers  came from behind to beat the Philadelphia Flyers, 5-3.  </P> <P> The Rangers' sixth consecutive victory at Madison Square Garden matches their  best home start. In 1983, they also won their first six home games. The  Rangers, who have won seven of their last eight, are 8-3-0 and with 16 points,  are the overall leader in the NHL.  </P> <P> The Flyers, trying to get above the .500 mark on the road, led, 3-2, going into  the third period. But in the first minute, former King Bernie Nicholls  converted a goalmouth feed from Mullen into the tying goal.  </P> <P> With a little more than six minutes remaining, Kevin Miller took a cross-ice  pass from Mullen and beat Ken Wregget with a quick shot.  </P> <P> Darren Turcotte set up the Rangers' second goal to extend his scoring streak to  all 11 games this season.  </P> <P> St. Louis 8, Toronto 5 -- Hot-shooting Brett Hull became the first player in  Blues' history to have back-to-back hat tricks.  </P> <P> Wednesday night at Toronto Hull scored his third goal midway through the third  period. In this game at St. Louis, he had three goals after 21:14 of play.  </P> <P> The first was a fluke when the puck bounced into the net off his skate, but he  blasted home the other two to give him 13 in 10 games this season. He led the  league last season with 72 goals.  </P> <P> It was the third loss in a row for the Maple Leafs. The Blues scored 16 goals  in the two-game series.  </P> <P> Chicago 3, Washington 2 -- Eight seconds after the overtime faceoff at Chicago,  Steve Larmer stole the puck and scored his ninth goal of the season to give the  Black Hawks their seventh victory in 11 games.  </P> <P> Larmer also scored Chicago's first goal in the opening minute of the second  period. But most of the night the Capitals dominated.  </P> <P> The Capitals, who never trailed until overtime, led, 2-1, until defenseman  Chris Chelios tied it in the third period.  </P> <P> Calgary 4, Edmonton 2 -- Mark Hunter scored twice at Calgary and the Flames  moved to within one point of the Kings in the Smythe Division.  </P> <P> The Oilers, who are 0-3-1 on the road this season, are in last place, nine  points behind the Kings. It was the third loss in a row for the Stanley Cup  champions.  </P> <P> New Jersey 5, Buffalo 1 -- The home teams are enjoying a big advantage in the  early going this season.  </P> <P> The Devils, with Kirk Muller getting a goal and two assists, improved to 6-0-1  at home and kept the pressure on the Rangers. The Devils (7-3-1) trail the  Rangers by only a point.  </P> <P> The Devils broke the game open with three goals in three minutes midway through  the last period.  </P> <P> Chris Terrari stopped 28 shots to win for the sixth time in his last seven  starts.  </P> <P> Boston 4, Vancouver 2 -- In a recent four-game trip, the Bruins were outscored,  26-4, so they were happy to return home.  </P> <P> Although the Canucks challenged in the closing minutes, the Bruins ended the  four-game losing streak with their third victory without a loss at Boston.  </P> <P> Reggie Lemelin had a 3-0 lead and was bidding for his 12th career shutout, but  gave up a goal to Trevor Linden with 2:48 to play. A minute later, the Canucks  scored again after pulling goalie Troy Gamble. An empty net goal ended the  rally with four seconds left.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 6, Quebec 3 -- Kevin Stevens had a hat trick and the Penguins scored  on their first four shots at Pittsburgh to end a four-game winless streak.  </P> <P> Rookie goaltender John Tanner left after Stevens' first goal made it 3-0 at  12:45 of the first period. Stevens' second score was on the Penguins' first  shot at Tanner's replacement, Ron Tugnutt.  </P> <P> Stevens scored his other goal halfway through the second period. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

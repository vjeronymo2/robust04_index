			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Etonbrook bid terms revised VALID acceptances to the bid for Etonbrook Properties from Panther Securities and Multitrust have been received in respect of 1.93m ordinary shares. That represents 39.52 per cent of the voting rights and 50.46 per cent of issued capital. Under City code rules the offer cannot become unconditional until the offer has been received in respect of more than 50 per cent of the voting rights. The bidding companies, in which Mr Alex Perloff, a rebel shareholder in Etonbrook, has interests, considered it unlikely given the level of acceptance to date that the offer would become unconditional. They said that in this event the offer would lapse and acceptors to the offer would remain shareholders in Etonbrook. The bidders were conscious that this may not be the result acceptors would want and were therefore revising certain terms allowing accepting shareholders to withdraw their acceptances in order to sell their ordinary shares in the market through Southard Gilbey McNish &amp; Co to realise a guaranteed minimum net price of 79p per share. To enable accepting shareholders to take this course of action the closing date of the offer has been extended until September 24.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / US in Balkans peace drive The US, anxious to run ahead of pressure from its Nato allies to send ground troops to Bosnia, is speeding up its search for a political settlement for the former Yugoslavia. Mr Charles Redman, its special envoy, yesterday met President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia in an effort to draw the Bosnian Serbs into last week's federation agreement between Bosnian Croats and Moslems. He later met President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia in Zagreb. Tomorrow, Mr Cyrus Vance, the former United Nations peace mediator, will meet Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek foreign minister, in Geneva to try to resolve Greece's dispute with neighbouring Macedonia. Mr Redman's talks in Belgrade reflect Washington's belief that participation of the Bosnian Serbs is crucial for securing stability in Bosnia and for putting together a broader agreement. 'We need to engage the Bosnian Serbs in order to put something together that would represent an overall settlement,' said Mr Redman. UN and US diplomats yesterday said the issue for the Bosnian Serbs was the status they would have if they accepted the federal plan. The accord envisages a federation of Bosnian Croats and Moslems linked with Croatia through a confederal structure. UN diplomats have warned Bosnian Serbs that if they reject the Washington agreement, then 70 per cent of the territory they hold would be 'placed in limbo'. 'It would not be recognised by the international community and we would not sanction any union of Serbia with eastern Bosnia,' a senior UN negotiator said. In an effort to bring the Serbs to the negotiating table, diplomats stressed that the Bosnian Croat/Moslem federation was aimed neither at isolating the Serbs, nor at providing an instrument to launch a spring offensive against Serbs in eastern Bosnia. Any concessions by the Bosnian Serbs and Croatia would involve: The Bosnian Serbs ceding territory in eastern Bosnia, and agreeing to lift the sieges of the Moslem-held enclaves of Gorazde, Zepa, and Srebrenica. Mr Milosevic and Mr Tudjman agreeing on the status of Serb-held territories in Croatia. Croatia agreeing to grant extensive autonomy to Serbs in south-western and eastern Croatia in return for Zagreb regaining control over the republic. But it is far from certain if Mr Milosevic could, or wants to persuade the Serb leadership in Croatia to accept this proposal since the war has radicalised them. A Spanish aircraft enforcing the Bosnian no-fly zone was hit by ground fire over Croatia yesterday and four passengers were slightly injured, Reuter reports from Naples. The CASA-212 logistics aircraft had to make an emergency landing at Rijeka airport on Croatia's Adriatic coast.</p>

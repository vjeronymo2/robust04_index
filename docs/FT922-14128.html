			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Major asks floating voters to trust his leadership MR JOHN MAJOR last night put his own personality at the centre of the Tories' final appeal to the electorate in an effort to reverse Labour's continuing 2 to 3 point opinion poll lead. Using a party election broadcast and a rally at Wembley, he called on undecided voters to examine his record and to trust his leadership with a fourth Conservative term of government. Describing Mr Neil Kinnock as 'grasping desperately at the prospect of power', he said Britons could be proud of the country's record since 1979 and went on to warn against the 'dead end' of socialism. Tory pamphlets attacking Mr Kinnock's leadership abilities will be delivered to targeted voters today. In an emotional plea to voters, Mr Major said: 'I've only just begun the tasks I have set myself. On Thursday I ask this nation to look at my record of service and my ideals for the future, to place their trust in me and in this party that has served them so well and so faithfully.' With less than 36 hours before voting begins, Mr Kinnock retaliated at a Blackburn rally with a withering attack on the Conservatives' economic record and a warning that the National Health Service would be in 'mortal danger' if the Tories were returned to power. 'I say to the British people - after all they have done, they simply do not deserve to be re-elected,' he said, repeating his claim that the election would be a 'referendum' on the NHS's future. In Cornwall, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, used his penultimate rally to attack the Tories for 'playing on division and conflict', pledging to use the election outcome to reform the political system. The 11th hour manoeuvring came as the smaller political parties including the Ulster Unionists and Plaid Cymru hinted that they would be ready to work with a minority government. Two polls last night showed Labour's support running at 2 and 3 points ahead of the Conservatives, still short of the lead required to win 326 seats - the total needed for an overall majority. A Harris survey for ITN showed Labour 2 points ahead on 40 points, the Conservatives on 38 and the Liberal Democrats on 18, a significant narrowing of a 5-point gap between the two main parties last week. A Mori poll for Channel 4's First Tuesday programme had Labour leading by 3 points on 40, with the Conservatives on 37 and the Liberal Democrats on 20. In Scotland, there was clear evidence of a sharp decline in backing for full independence. An ICM poll for The Scotsman showed support for the Labour and Liberal Democrats' proposal for a Scottish parliament rising by 8 points to 42 as the Scottish Nationalists' separatist policy fell by the same margin to 23 points. There was little comfort for the Conservatives, however. In spite of Mr Major's appeal for backing for the Union on Monday, those supporting the status quo dropped by 1 point to 24. Last night, Mr Michael Heseltine launched a last-minute plea to Scots at an Edinburgh rally to stand by the 'great partnership' and back the Conservatives. Earlier, Mr Major had apparently acknowledged Labour's lead by telling Tory workers that the party would 'surprise people' tomorrow.  -----------------------------------------------            ELECTION 1992  ----------------------------------------------- PM appeals on ticket of '10 Tory truths' Kinnock says NHS is in mortal danger Scotland's changing political landscape Pages 6-8  ----------------------------------------------- Editorial Comment Joe Rogaly: Farewell balanced books Page 18  -----------------------------------------------</p>

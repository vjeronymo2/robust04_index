			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, April 8 (XINHUA) -- North China's  Hebei Province has since 1988 improved medical care in rural  areas using nearly 27.4 million U.S. dollars in either  interest-free loans or assistance from international  organizations.    An official of the provincial public health department said  that the World Bank has promised a 21 million U.S. dollar loan  to Hebei to assist it in training rural doctors and improving  rural clinics.    Hebei began to undertake the six-year World Bank-aided  project in November 1993, he said.    When the project is completed, working conditions in 222  rural clinics will be improved and better medical services  provided for 30 million farmers, he said.    Now, 12 poor counties in Hebei are co-operating with the  United Nations Children's Fund in improving medical care for  rural women and children and promoting family planning, the  official said.    The counties have received 543 sets of medical equipment  worth 3.5 million yuan from the fund, he said.    Moreover, funds from other international organizations are  being used to control tuberculosis [T.B.] in 111 counties,  cities and districts in hebei, he said.    By the end of 1993, 10,000 T.B. patients had received free  medical treatment.    Wang Youhui, vice-governor of Hebei Province, pledged to  make  efficient use of the funds from international organizations to  improve medical care in rural areas, where 80 percent of Hebei  Province's population lives.</p>

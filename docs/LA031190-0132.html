			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USE OF L.A. OFFICERS OUTSIDE CITY PROBED;  </P> <P> POLICE: SOURCES SAY DEPUTY CHIEF GLENN A. LEVANT DISPATCHED DETECTIVES TO A  CHIC HOTEL WHOSE OWNER HAS BUSINESS TIES TO TWO LEVANT RELATIVES AND DARE.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Department is examining allegations that its drug czar,  Deputy Chief Glenn A. Levant, dispatched a team of elite narcotics detectives  outside city limits to investigate burglaries at a chic hotel whose owner has  business ties to two relatives of Levant, The Times has learned.  </P> <P> Detectives spent two days last November staking out Le Mondrian hotel in West  Hollywood after a representative of the hotel's owner called Levant, sources  said.  </P> <P> Le Mondrian's owner, Severyn Ashkenazy, employs Levant's brother-in-law,  Richard Chase, as president of a company based in Le Mondrian.  </P> <P> In 1988, Chase arranged a six-figure deal between one of Ashkenazy's companies  and the LAPD to rent unmarked cars for use by detectives under Levant's  command, according to company officials.  </P> <P> Ashkenazy also has business ties to Levant's wife, Jayne. He helps fund and  direct a hotel referral service that she runs from an office in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> In addition, Ashkenazy sits on the 100-member board of a non-profit  organization that raises money for Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE), the  Police Department's acclaimed anti-narcotics school program that Levant  directs.  </P> <P> Questions involving the Le Mondrian investigation surfaced earlier this year  during a routine management audit of all narcotics operations, police sources  said.  </P> <P> Levant, 49, said he has done nothing improper. He declined to publicly discuss  matters relating to Le Mondrian except to say that "there was a logical  investigative reason" for sending officers to the hotel.  </P> <P> Police Department policy, Levant said, prevented him from responding more fully  pending the outcome of the audit, which is being coordinated by a top aide to  Police Chief Daryl F. Gates.  </P> <P> Levant pointed out that it was he who initiated the audit in January to assess  all facets of the LAPD's anti-narcotics activities.  </P> <P> Gates, through a spokesman, also declined to answer questions about Levant  until the audit is completed. That process is expected to take at least another  three weeks.  </P> <P> The Police Department has a conflict-of-interest code that requires officers to  submit a statement of disqualification to the chief "if they believe that they  are involved in a department decision-making process in which they have a  conflict of interest." The department's manual does not make clear what is  considered a conflict.  </P> <P> Gates's spokesman, Cmdr. William Booth, declined to comment on whether Levant  filed a disqualification statement on matters relating to Le Mondrian.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles police officer for 27 years, Levant is regarded by some in the  department as a contender to eventually succeed Gates.  </P> <P> Gates named Levant deputy chief in September, 1987, and to the informal  position of drug czar four months later.  </P> <P> Levant devotes much of his time raising public support for DARE, whose annual  budget has grown to more than $1 million under his direction. Levant also  oversees various department functions, including the internal affairs and  organized crime divisions. He commands nearly 400 narcotics investigators and  has broad discretion in setting their missions.  </P> <P> One such mission involved Le Mondrian, according to police sources who spoke on  condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> On Nov. 20-21, a team of detectives assigned to the LAPD's Major Violators  Section, which normally investigates top-level drug traffickers, went to the  hotel at Levant's direction, sources said.  </P> <P> Several detectives checked into two rooms at the hotel. They set up electronic  surveillance equipment and left an undisclosed amount of "bait" money in one  room and monitored the room from the other room.  </P> <P> The next day, after no one had taken the money, the detectives ended the  stakeout and left the hotel, sources said.  </P> <P> The officers eventually were paid overtime by the city for the two-day  surveillance and were reimbursed for their expenses, said one source.  </P> <P> Police officials would not say how much the operation cost.  </P> <P> It is not uncommon for detectives from the 47 municipal law enforcement  agencies in Los Angeles County to conduct surveillance outside their normal  geographic areas of assignment. But normally, they pursue investigations that  are initiated within their own jurisdiction.  </P> <P> In this case, the theft complaint was initiated in Los Angeles County, not the  city of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> As a rule, police are required to alert officials of the city in which they are  temporarily operating.  </P> <P> In the case of Le Mondrian, sources said, detectives telephoned the watch  commander at the sheriff's West Hollywood station in advance.  </P> <P> What was unusual, sources said, was the nature of the investigation itself.  </P> <P> "These (detectives) are heavy hitters who go after big fish, Colombians," said  one officer. "This case had nothing to do with narcotics. There was a problem  with (theft). It was a waste of their time. But, hey, (Levant is) the drug  czar. How you gonna say no?"  </P> <P> According to Ashkenazy, the LAPD investigation came about after several guests  complained of thefts from their rooms. Those burglaries, he said, happened to  coincide with rumors that a drug ring had set up shop in the hotel.  </P> <P> "We arranged for the Police Department . . . to come and see what it was we had  here," Ashkenazy said. "Strange enough, it ceased as soon as the word got out."  </P> <P> Asked why the Le Mondrian did not request assistance from the Sheriff's  Department, in whose jurisdiction Le Mondrian is located, Ashkenazy said, "The  sheriff is not equipped to deal with drugs."  </P> <P> Deputies at the West Hollywood station -- which is less than a mile from Le  Mondrian -- said they could not recall being notified by LAPD about any  problems at the hotel.  </P> <P> The sheriff's narcotics chief disputed Ashkenazy's assertion that his  department was not equipped to handle such a case. "Had they called the  sheriff," Capt. Bob Wilbur said, "we would have responded and we would have  done surveillance."  </P> <P> Ashkenazy's executive vice president, attorney Gary W. Nielsen, said he  contacted Levant to discuss thefts at the hotel -- including the theft of some  drugs from a guest about two months earlier.  </P> <P> "I didn't call to report a crime, but to initially ask for some advice on a  matter I viewed as sensitive," Nielsen said. Nielsen called Levant, he said,  because he "wanted someone with expertise . . . I see him once in a while at  parties and at dinners . . . It's a first name basis. He is a person I admire  very much."  </P> <P> Nielsen said he asked Levant whether the hotel should hire a private detective.  </P> <P> "I think he told me there weren't private detectives that would have much  knowledge about drugs and that this was something his department would look  into," Nielsen recalled.  </P> <P> Other hotels commonly hire private investigative agencies to take on such  cases, according to detectives and hoteliers.  </P> <P> Since August, 1988, Levant's brother-in-law, Richard Chase, has been president  of an Ashkenazy company, Resources Exchange, located on the second floor of Le  Mondrian.  </P> <P> The company barters goods and services ranging from hotel rooms to billboard  advertising in exchange for items of equal or greater value.  </P> <P> According to Nielsen, Chase "made the deal" to sell rental car services to the  Police Department in late 1988. Chase traded billboard and bus stop advertising  to RPM Rent-a-Car of Los Angeles for more than $100,000 in rental car services,  Neilsen said.  </P> <P> The rental car services then were sold to the Police Department for use by  plainclothes officers. Nielsen said the cars cost the department "20% less than  they were paying" at the time to other rental companies.  </P> <P> Chase, according to Nielsen, "was very proud of the fact that it was one of his  first or second deals." The arrangement with RPM was one of several negotiated  by Chase that year.  </P> <P> "The company had a good year (in 1989) and this was a small part of that good  year," Nielsen said. "He got a bonus for 1989."  </P> <P> The car rental arrangement ended about a year later, in part because virtually  every RPM car was white, which distressed narcotics officers.  </P> <P> "You can imagine getting followed by six or seven white cars," said one  officer. "It was a joke."  </P> <P> Neither Neilsen nor RPM officials would disclose the specific value of the  rental car transaction. City Controller Rick Tuttle's office also was unable to  provide details.  </P> <P> "There are certain accounts controlled by the Police Department that are not  public," said Barbara Friedman, administrative deputy controller.  </P> <P> Nielsen said he did not know whether Levant had any role in the rental car  negotiations or approved the deal. However, sources said the deal came about  after Levant contacted Ashkenazy regarding car rentals. Chase could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> His sister and Levant's wife -- Jayne Levant -- is executive vice president of  Small Luxury Hotels Inc., an international association of 32 hotels and  resorts.  </P> <P> Ashkenazy helped found the association and is one of its current directors,  according to J. William Sharman Jr., a Houston, Tex., businessman who serves as  the organization's chairman. Sharman said the association was conceived 4 1/2  years ago by Jayne Levant.  </P> <P> Sharman said that the association acts as a referral, reservations and  promotional service for Ashkenazy and other member hotel operators. The hotel  operators pay an initiation fee, plus $12 per room per month to the  association.  </P> <P> Ashkenazy also is among about 100 business and community leaders who serve as  directors of the non-profit Crime Prevention Advisory Council (CPAC), which  raises funds and organizes charity functions for DARE. The council operates out  of Levant's office and he is its executive officer, the organization's 1988 tax  return shows.  </P> <P> Each CPAC director is asked to contribute at least $1,000 a year to DARE.  </P> <P> Ashkenazy said he was not certain how much he has donated, although Nielsen  said that Ashkenazy contributes free meeting facilities and price breaks on  meal tabs at his Bel Age hotel.  </P> <P> Ashkenazy scoffed when asked by The Times whether Levant sent detectives to Le  Mondrian as a personal favor.  </P> <P> "This is utter nonsense, you're barking up a silly tree," Ashkenazy said. "He  (Levant) is a highly ethical man, a very bright man."  </P></p>

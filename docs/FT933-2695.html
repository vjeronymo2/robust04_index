			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / People: From far and wide to join London Ambulance Following its problems earlier this year, the London Ambulance Service has appointed four new divisional directors and a director of personnel. An inquiry last year into the failure of the service's computer system had concluded that the single centralised organisation of the service was not appropriate and that there was a need for a strong local focus. According to Martin Goreham, the chief executive to whom the divisional directors will report: 'We wanted it managed on a scale that people could cope with and are now in the position of having the right management team in place. We have the foundations to rebuild the service.' Of the four new operating divisions - central, north east, north west and south London - only one will be filled by a local person: Philip Saunders, former director of north east Thames, crosses the river to become the director for south London. The other three will be moving south: David Carrington, who was national training and development director in the Scottish Ambulance Service, is appointed to north west London; Owen Disley, former chief executive of the Merseyside Regional Ambulance NHS Trust, at north east London; and Don Page, former chief executive of South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service, at central London. Andrew Brown, personnel director for Nestle and Clark Foods, has been enticed on board as the new director of personnel. Goreham says he is not asking his managers to emulate those at the Northumbria Ambulance NHS Trust where a variety of money-raising activities is being developed: 'We have hired managers, not entrepreneurs.' However, those managers will have to have a commercial awareness in a service where certain activities are being commercially tendered. The posts carry salaries in excess of Pounds 45,000; MSL organised the recruitment campaign.</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Letter: No mortgage rescue falter Sir, Your reports on the government's mortgage rescue scheme (January 14 and 15) have been exaggerated. As the representative of the National Federation of Housing Associations quoted in both your articles, I do not believe that the schemes are faltering, nor that lenders and housing associations are at loggerheads. Since before Christmas a number of lenders and associations have been in negotiation on how the schemes might work, since none of the detail was sorted out before the 'package' was announced. Associations need to make sure that their finances are not put at risk and that the households which become tenants are not confronted with unaffordable rents. There is no merit in a scheme which simply converts mortgage arrears into rent arrears. To make the schemes work, lenders will need to be very flexible, but indications are that they accept this. Stephen Duckworth, head of housing finance, National Federation of Housing Associations, 175 Gray's Inn Road, London WC1X 8UP</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The right to use mandatory deposits by the Ateitis  and Nida commercial banks was suspended yesterday by the  Lithuanian Central Bank. This was reported by Egle Valyte,  press spokesman for the Lithuanian Central Bank.    The statement disseminated by the Lithuanian Central Bank  today stresses that this decision is aimed at protecting the  interests of the creditors. The decision was made after the  Lithuanian Central Bank administration made amendments to the  rules on mandatory reserves of commercial banks on 3 June. The  use of mandatory reserves deposited at the Lithuanian Central  Bank are restricted if the banks violate their obligations and  are not able to settle accounts in full with their creditors.    We have already reported that the Apus, Express, and  Lietukis  commercial banks had their right to use the mandatory reserves  suspended by the Administration Board of the Lithuanian Central  Bank on 3d June.</p>

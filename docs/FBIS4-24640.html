			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- China has slowed down  its price hikes as various macro control and price readjustment  measures have been taken, a senior Chinese official announced  today.    Addressing a national conference on nationwide price  inspection, Chen Jinhua, head of the state price inspection  leading group and minister in charge of the State Planning  Commission, said that China has taken a series of measures to  intensify macro control and control inflation so as to safeguard  social stability.    In line with the state decision, he said, some provinces  have  established grain risk foundations. Meanwhile, price tags are  placed on all commodities sold in state- and collective-owned  retail stores and some private and individual stalls.    According to official sources, 190,000 cases involving 400  million yuan in illegal profits have been uncovered during the  two months after March 10. Over 100,000 of these cases have  been dealt with according to law with a total penalty of 88  million yuan.    To further bring the pries under control, Chen urged the  local officials to focus the national price inspection on the  daily necessities and production materials such as grain,  cotton, chemical fertilizer, steel and electricity for  agricultural use as well as service charges.</p>

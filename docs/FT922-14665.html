			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Smith's timing - Ballot Box John Smith, the shadow chancellor, does not always behave as impeccably in Scotland as in England. At a press conference in Glasgow yesterday, he arrived almost 20 minutes late and the chairman brought it to a premature close after an Independent reporter persisted with a question. Smith then gave TV interviews, although he later had the grace to sit down for a few minutes with some of the journalists. Indeed, the Labour party in general is being a bit peremptory with the Scots. The launch of the party's Scottish manifesto in Edinburgh a few weeks ago also started late and the questioning was curtailed almost as soon as it had begun.</p>

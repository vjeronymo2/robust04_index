			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USD POISED TO IMPROVE TO 5-0 BUT STILL WARY OF POMONA PITZER  </P> <P> On paper, this afternoon's 1:30 game against Pomona Pitzer looks to be a sure  thing for the University of San Diego.  </P> <P> But, as nearly every college football coach will protest, games are not played  on paper, and there is no such sure thing.  </P> <P> "(A letdown) is a normal concern," USD Coach Brian Fogarty said. "Anytime you  come off a couple big wins and play a team that is not traditionally tough is  always a concern."  </P> <P> USD is 4-0 and ranked No. 4 in the NCAA Division III West Region. The Toreros  have more victories than any of the teams ahead of them -- No. 1 Iowa Central  (3-0), No. 2 Minnesota Concordia Moorehead (3-0-1) and No. 3 Wisconsin  Platteville (2-0-1).  </P> <P> USD's record is its best since 1981, when it went 9-0 before losing, 31-14, to  St. Mary's, a Division II team, the final week of the season. That team did not  go to the playoffs.  </P> <P> This year's record is also the best in seven years under Fogarty, who can even  his USD overall mark (now 30-31-2) with a victory today.  </P> <P> "It's been an uphill battle since that second year when we went 1-8," Fogarty  said.  </P> <P> USD has not lost to Pomona since 1971, when it was a club team. The Toreros  hold a 16-1-1 series advantage over the Sagehens, who are 1-1 and coming off a  24-14 loss to Occidental two weeks ago.  </P> <P> But there is still concern. "They put a lot of people on the line and make it  difficult to run," said USD fullback Todd Jackson, who is averaging 21 carries  and 112 yards per game and 5.3 yards per rush. "I think we're looking forward  to it. The challenge is there."  </P> <P> And besides, Jackson said, "Pomona's on their way. We have to take them just  like all the others."  </P> <P> Pomona is led by running back Chris Smith, who is averaging 175 yards per game.  Quarterback Gregg Silver also can play receiver, as he did earlier this year  when he caught a 55-yard touchdown pass from backup Mickey Graville.  </P></p>

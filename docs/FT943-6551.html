			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / M&amp;S prepares to accept debit cards Marks and Spencer, the UK's most profitable retailer, is preparing to accept payments by bank debit cards, such as Switch, in addition to its own store card for the first time. The food and clothing retailer has long refused to accept credit or debit cards, saying that transaction charges levied by the card issuers were too high. Analysts also believe it may have been concerned about the impact of such a move on its own highly successful charge card, which has about 4m holders and laid the foundations for its successful move into financial services. Its stance has irritated some customers and attracted headlines last year when its branch in Salisbury, Wiltshire, refused to accept a Visa card from the Princess of Wales in payment for two shirts. The company has held successful trials involving debit cards in three stores and has been in negotiations with banks about debit-card charges for two years. It said: 'We would like to extend debit-card payments, but we will only do that if it is cost-effective for us.' The company added: 'We have been in fairly lengthy negotiations with the banks, and we are still talking to them.' However, it is believed to be close to reaching agreement with the banks. It is already thought to be making arrangements to extend debit-card payment facilities throughout the chain, including plans for videos to train staff, and for visual displays in stores promoting the move. The company said its discussions had concerned only debit cards, which function in a similar way to cheques, and not credit cards, which involve a different method of payment and carry higher charges. It said it would take some time to introduce card payments throughout its stores, as new card-reading equipment would have to be installed. The company's move reflects the growing popularity of credit and debit-card methods of payment with consumers.</p>

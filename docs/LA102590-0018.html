			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILSON, FEINSTEIN ON TERM LIMITS  </P> <P> Wilson set priorities and cut property taxes. Meanwhile, Feinstein never set a  long-term agenda, was reactive and raised taxes ("A Tale of Two Cities May  Decide Governor's Race," Part A, Oct. 14).  </P> <P> Yet the sewer system says it all. Feinstein had more foresight than Wilson.  "Now San Diego is faced with a $2.8 billion tab for a new plant," with no help  from the feds; but it could have been done for $500 million, largely with  federal money, if Wilson hadn't thought that cutting taxes was an end unto  itself.  </P> <P> Wilson is like the CEO of a company who focuses on this quarter's results and  doesn't worry about the long-term consequences of his shortsighted decisions.  </P> <P> Look out folks, here comes another Gov. Deukmejian.  </P> <P> MARTIN PARKER  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

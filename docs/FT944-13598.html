			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Coface tightens Saudi terms France said yesterday it had toughened terms for providing export credit guarantees to companies dealing with Saudi Arabia, following a reassessment of the kingdom's ability to pay promptly. The government said that Coface, the French export credit agency, was approving short-term credit assurance (for less than three years) on a case-by-case basis but with increased 'vigilance'. NCM Credit Insurance, which handles 80 per cent of Britain's short-term export credit guarantees, has already announced it is reducing the availability of facilities for UK companies exporting to Saudi Arabia. It said payments delays to exporters were continuing to worsen and expressed concern at the 'very grave' financial situation. Last month Coface stopped providing medium-term support for companies trading with the kingdom on the basis of standard credit terms. It continues to provide medium-term support to businesses for transactions payable in cash, provided the Saudis also underwrite the contracts.</p>

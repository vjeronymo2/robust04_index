			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Gold price firmer - Market Report GOLD continued its recovery yesterday, helped by buying from a large bank. But SILVER managed only a marginal rise. An early dip in the COPPER market quickly found support and prices ended little changed. ZINC also rallied after an initial fall, against a background of possible strike action at a Colombian mine. Compiled from Reuter</p>

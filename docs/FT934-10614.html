			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: ICI fails to agree BASF acrylics acquisition ICI's efforts to build a Europe-wide acrylics manufacturing empire collapsed yesterday when talks over acquiring BASF's German acrylics business collapsed. Parallel talks on the sale of ICI polypropylene capacity to BASF are unaffected, ICI said yesterday. The two sides are understood to have disagreed over the valuation on the acrylics business, which has a turnover of about Pounds 60m a year. Such chemical sector valuations are notoriously difficult especially during a recession: profits are low or negative, but recovery is in prospect. The failure to agree on a deal is a blow to ICI's plans to buy acrylics capacity in Germany but it makes only a small dent in the company's worldwide acrylics business which has sales of more than Pounds 500m. ICI has already this year added the acrylics side of US chemicals company Du Pont to its portfolio. Du Pont's acrylics side had turnover last year of about Pounds 200m. The assets, stock and goodwill of the business, which is profitable, was estimated at Pounds 180m-Pounds 190m.</p>

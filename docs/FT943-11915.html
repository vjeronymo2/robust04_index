			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Brussels approves aid for airlines The European Commission yesterday formally cleared the way for the French and Greek governments to rescue their beleaguered state airlines from collapse through big capital injections, prompting dismay among Europe's private airlines. British Airways, the private UK carrier, said it was considering challenging a decision to allow a FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) payment to Air France in the European Court of Justice while Mr Brian Mawhinney, the UK transport minster, said the decision would 'distort competition in European aviation and work against the interests of all European consumers'. The Commission also approved a rescue plan for Greece's Olympic Airways, involving a capital injection of Dr54bn (Pounds 147m) of state funds. The decision, seen as a test case in Europe's efforts to liberalise air transport, comes in spite of a commitment by EU governments to create a fair and open single market. The French government expressed satisfaction with the decision to grant the aid. It follows a humiliating climbdown by Paris in October last year after a strike at the state-owned airline. Approval of the capital increase was a central element in winning staff support for the restructuring package drawn up by Mr Christian Blanc, the chairman. Mr Bernard Bosson, the French transport minister, said Commission conditions attached to the decision were balanced. 'They do not impose any unjustified constraints on the national carrier,' he said. However, Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland, said he found it 'quite extraordinary that the Commission can allow Air France to receive a sum almost equal to the total losses made by all of the world's airlines in 1993'. Sir Colin Marshall, the chairman of British Airways, said there was 'no justification for a subsidy of this size and the conditions imposed are wholly inadequate. Air France is once again being protected from the forces of competition.' Mr Marcelino Oreja, transport commissioner in Brussels, said the aid, together with conditions, would ensure that the company was viable and fit for privatisation by the end of the three-year restructuring. But Air France said the capital injection approved by Brussels was a necessary but not sufficient condition for recovery. 'We have to push ahead with our restructuring plan quickly,' said a spokesman. The plan aims to raise productivity by 30 per cent by 1997, cut 5,000 jobs from the airline's workforce of 40,000 and freeze salaries and promotions. Air France was also ordered to repay an earlier government loan of FFr1.5bn, considered incompatible with EU competition rules. The government said it would appeal. Under the conditions, Air France must formally separate itself from its domestic carrier Air Inter to ensure the aid goes only to Air France. The aid must not be used to acquire new stakes in other airlines, nor to increase the size of its fleet above 146 during restructuring. Nor can the company increase the seats it has on offer within the European Economic Area beyond the level reached last year. The Commission is also demanding that Air France limit its traffic growth to 2.7 per cent per year and that it sell assets including its Meridien luxury hotels chain. In addition, Orly airport must be opened to competing airlines.</p>

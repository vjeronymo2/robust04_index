			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Zhurun] </F>   [Text] Beijing, January 19 (XINHUA) -- Planners of China's  reform programs said today that the government plans to limit  this year's inflation to 10 percent in striving to ensure  success of the economic restructuring.    Wang Shiyuan, vice-minister of the State Commission for  Economic Systems Restructuring, told a press conference that to  achieve the purpose, the government will work hard to maintain a  balance between China's total supply and demand and bring the  money supply under control.    New price reform measures, commensurate to the financial  capabilities of both the state and the people, will be published  at an "opportune date," said Wang, who was attending the press  conference with fellow Vice-Ministers Liu Zhifeng and Hong Hu.    The three officials insisted that on no account will this  year's reforms in banking and taxation affect actual prices as  they are only meant to rationalize the banking and taxation  systems.    XINHUA has learned that the principle for the reforms, as  described by the three vice-ministers, is one of "seizing the  current opportunity to advance the reforms and accelerating  development while ensuring stability."    They said that reform measures for 1994 are greater in  number  and more extensive than for any previous year. "The deeper and  more extensively the reforms develop, the greater will be their  repercussions and the difficulty in executing them," they told  Chinese and foreign reporters at the press conference.    This calls for correctly handling the relations of reforms,  development and stability and summing up experiences in good  time, so that reform plans can be improved in times of  necessity, they said.    Meanwhile, they said, what is also needed is boldness in  exploring ways for pushing the reforms forward to ensure each  one's success.    The officials spoke specifically on the urban housing reform  in the wake of a State Council order to prohibit selling of  publicly- owned housing at excessively low prices.    Recently, state-owned enterprises and institutions in some  places rushed to sell their own housing as a fringe benefit for  their staff.    "The State Council is finalizing the plan and will publish a  decision on the housing reform for nationwide application," said  Liu Zhifeng, a top official in charge of the housing reform.    "The State Council prohibition is meant to ensure success of  the housing reform instead of halting it and help the government  raise enough money for building new housing for the people," he  added.    Work is under way to formulate reform-related laws and  government decrees, according to these officials.    The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is  expected to publish a securities law in 1994. A draft of the  law is being passed around among China's legislators, officials  and experts for opinions and criticisms.    The State Council will soon publish a set of regulations on  China's futures trading and is putting the final touches on a  draft of the "Regulations on the Management of State-Owned  Property and Assets."    Consultations are going on between the State Economic  Systems  Restructuring Commission and the State Economic and Trade  Commission to choose 100 large-sized state-owned enterprises to  experiment with modern enterprise management.    Meanwhile, 13 cities have been chosen to try out what is  called "comprehensive reforms." These are Changzhou, Chongqing,  Anshan, Yanji, Quanzhou, Tangshan, Yantai, Tongling, Ningbo,  Chengdu, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Harbin.</p>

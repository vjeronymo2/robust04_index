			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND AT AFI FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> SATURDAY  </P> <P> Following are The Times' recommendations for today's and Sunday's schedule of  the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival, with  commentary by the film reviewing staff. Information: (213) 480-3232 or (213)  520-2000.  </P> <P> Recommended:  </P> <P> "A BETTER TOMORROW: THE TRILOGY "(Hong Kong, 1986; Directors: John Woo, Tsui  Hark; Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza, 4:30, 9 and 11:15 p.m.). A slam-bang  contemporary Hong Kong action trilogy -- about brothers on opposite sides of  the law, and a swaggering buddy (flirtatious Chow Yunn-fatt), warring with  various bands of vile gangsters. Coincidences and mass carnage abound. Part I  pops with energy, light satire and full-blown emotionalism. The unrecommended  Part II is thin, brutal, conventionally shot. The unscreened Part III -- with  producer Tsui Hark ("Peking Opera Blues" taking over direction -- might be the  best of the bunch. (Michael Wilmington)  </P></p>

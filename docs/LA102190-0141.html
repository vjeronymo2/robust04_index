			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK PUBLICITY PROMOTES HATE  </P> <P> Zev Yaroslavsky is correct in questioning the city's Cultural Affairs  Department as to whether vendors should knowingly peddle hate and false tales  at events that have public support and financing (Times, Oct. 14). However,  quiet diplomacy would have been a more effective way than the heavy public  barrage to handle the described situation.  </P> <P> As reported, the African Marketplace held at Rancho Cienega Park over the Aug.  25 and Sept. 3 weekends attracted more than 150,000 people to a fair, and about  200 vendors participated. That one vendor with 500 books on sale had two tracts  that promote hate and violence against Jews didn't warrant the public attention  The Times story gave it. The result could have been predicted. A First  Amendment debate that would overshadow the individual lack of sensitivity on a  matter of mutual concern over the effects of hate literature.  </P> <P> If the two offensive books are gaining "popularity," then the agencies fighting  anti-Semitism better go back to the basics of how to deal with such matters.  Focus public attention on what needs to be spotlighted, and not become part of  its promotion.  </P> <P> Henry Ford's book on "The International Jew" was based on the false, libelous,  ludicrous "Protocols" of the non-existent "Elders of Zion," tied to a myth of  the non-Jewish Masonic Order control of world power. The absurdity is  self-evident in what has happened to Jews in pogrom after pogrom, and under  Hitler.  </P> <P> The "Protocols" were judged to be a forgery by a Swiss Court, fabricated by  Czarist Russian agents to spread anti-Semitism. Henry Ford was sued for his  book, apologized, withdrew it, and made restitution.  </P> <P> HYMAN H. HAVES  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Boskin's silence on fiscal trends speaks volumes IN ONE of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's detective stories, Sherlock Holmes draws attention to the dog that failed to bark in the night. Readers of this year's Economic Report of the President may find themselves perplexed by an equally singular omission: the absence of detailed discussion of budgetary trends. The 423-page report is the annual showpiece of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, headed by Mr Michael Boskin, an economist from Stanford University. The administration distributes about 45,000 copies, many to colleges. Economists regard it as one of the most authoritative sources of information about US economic trends. Most economists regard the shortage of national savings as a key problem facing the economy. This is exacerbated by huge budget deficits, which count as negative saving by the public sector. Mr Boskin ignores the deficit, presumably because trends have deteriorated badly during his three-year tenure. This year's deficit is expected to hit Dollars 400bn (Pounds 220.9bn) or 6.7 per cent of gross domestic product - bigger than the largest deficits during the Reagan years. For the first time in memory, the White House is not forecasting a return to budget balance in the medium term. After allowing for the cyclical state of the economy and exceptional items (such as the cost of bailing out bankrupt savings and loan institutions), the 'structural' budget deficit is forecast to fall from Dollars 268bn this fiscal year to a trough of Dollars 190bn in 1996. It then begins rising again, driven by rapid growth of spending on 'entitlement' programmes such as health care for the elderly. This outlook - similar to predictions by independent groups such as the Congressional Budget Office - is probably too optimistic. The administration has repeatedly underestimated growth of spending and exaggerated its ability to raise tax revenue. Many economists may feel shortchanged by Mr Boskin's failure to address the principal problems facing the economy. By glossing over adverse fiscal trends, he is encouraging complacency in Congress, which may well pass bigger tax cuts than proposed by Mr Bush in last week's budget. Given spending trends, the figures suggest the US needs a tax increase of 2-3 percentage points of GDP if it is to eliminate its deficit and rebuild national savings. The report fleshes out the budget prediction that a sustained economic recovery will begin in the spring and gather pace through the year. If Congress passes Mr Bush's 'growth package' Mr Boskin expects the economy to grow by 2.2 per cent between the final quarters of 1991 and 1992. If the package is rejected, he predicts growth of only 1.6 per cent. In future years, the measures will ensure growth of about 3 per cent compared with 2.6 per cent if the package is not passed. This time last year Mr Boskin (and many private sector economists) wrongly forecast economic recovery last spring. Recovery is more likely this year because interest rates are lower and companies and individuals have begun to pay off debts accumulated in the 1980s. However, predictions of an early upturn are not yet supported by data. Mr Boskin fails to explain how the president's economic package will raise growth by as much as 0.4 percentage points a year over the medium term. Most of the proposed tax changes - such as incentives for corporate investment and home ownership - are temporary and will cost little in lost revenue. It is thus hard to see why growth should be boosted, not just this year but as far off as 1996 and 1997. Some will say Mr Boskin has bowed to political pressure and exaggerated the economic potency of the president's package. Critics of the administration have argued that much of the prosperity of the 1980s was illusory. Statistics are often quoted which appear to show that the incomes of middle-class families have stagnated since the early 1970s. Mr Boskin's report attempts to debunk such claims. But he concedes the central point that a rapid slowdown in productivity growth in the past two decades has caused incomes to rise much less fast than immediately after the Second World War. Most economists say the root cause of low investment is a low rate of domestic saving. Net savings by the private and public sectors combined is estimated to have fallen to about 2 per cent of net national product by the end of the 1980s - a decline of about 75 per cent relative to previous decades. The growth of federal budget deficits accounts for a large portion of this decline in savings. This is a dog that many analysts believe should have barked loudly in Mr Boskin's report.

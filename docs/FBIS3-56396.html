A more detailed  reaction can be expected from Washington after the official  announcement of the makeup of a new Russian government, the U.S.  ambassador in Moscow Thomas Pickering declared in an interview  with Interfax on Monday.    He explained that his administration's position towards  Russia's reforms did not depend on concrete personalities but  was based on the principles they advocated.    Commenting on the First Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar's decision  to resign, Pickering said that it did not take Washington aback,  since rumors on Gaydar's possible resignation from the  government had circulated long before his public announcement  about it.    He voiced satisfaction with Gaydar's intention to carry on  his duties in the Duma, where he led one of the major  parliamentary factions, "Russia's Choice."    Pickering said that in the current situation the American  administration regarded President Yeltsin's attitude to further  reform as crucial. He recalled that at the recent summit, U.S.  President Clinton had been firmly assured by Yeltsin that reform  in Russia would be continued and stability there would be  preserved.</p>

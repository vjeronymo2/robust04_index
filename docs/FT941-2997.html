			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Michigan raises sales tax to pay for schools: Vote sets a precedent as 28 states seek new ways to finance education The voters of Michigan this week set a precedent with revolutionary implications for state finances and education. They easily approved a ballot motion sharply increasing the local sales tax as a means of paying for the state's schools budget, traditionally underwritten by property taxes. The Michigan measure, promoted by Mr John Engler, the Republican governor, would generate an additional Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.43bn) in revenues by raising to 6 per cent from 4 per cent the state sales tax and by tripling the local tax on cigarettes to 75 cents a pack. This sum, specifically earmarked for education, more than covers a planned Dollars 1.9bn cut in property taxes. It would permit the state to increase by about 6 per cent to Dollars 10.2bn the Michigan education budget, under such severe strain recently that one school district last year closed 10 weeks early because its resources had been exhausted. Under the governor's plan, the state will also try to equalise the large gap in spending between rich and poor school districts by providing each district with a guaranteed minimum sum per student and by limiting spending increases by the wealthier districts. This discrepancy, less severe in Michigan than in most other states, is widely seen as one of the most inequitable factors in American education because it perpetuates the disadvantages of society's underclasses. The increase in the sales tax is not considered an ideal solution, since revenues may vary according to the health of the economy. But it was reckoned preferable to a further squeeze on property taxpayers, in widespread revolt over the last 15 years since the passage of the tax-cutting Proposition 13 in California, or to the politically explosive alternative of higher state income taxes. Tax-cutting at state level has come back into vogue across the country, especially now that the economic recovery has removed some of the constraints on state budgets. Mrs Christine Todd Whitman, the new governor of New Jersey, has just secured approval for a 5 per cent cut in income taxes, the first instalment, she promises, on a multi-year 30 per cent tax reduction. Even in California, still in a recession, Governor Pete Wilson, up for re-election this year like Governor Engler, has found fiscal room to propose a modest Dollars 135m tax cut, mostly directed at the lower end of the income scale. All told, according to yesterday's New York Times, 28 states are in various stages of public and legal debate about new ways to finance education and nearly 20 have active tax-shifting proposals under consideration, mostly designed to relieve property taxpayers. According to one independent study, the recession forced the states to increase local taxes by a net Dollars 9.2bn in 1990 and Dollars 14.4bn in 1991 to maintain essential services. The respective increases for the last two years were Dollars 1.4bn and Dollars 1.1bn. This year could see net cuts of around Dollars 3bn. The Clinton administration will not be displeased by the 70 per cent margin by which Michigan voters approved higher taxes on cigarettes. Its proposal for an even steeper increase in the federal excise tax on tobacco products, part of its healthcare reform plans, is being vigorously fought by the industry. Several states, most recently New York and Maryland, have approved swingeing measures restricting smoking in public buildings.</p>

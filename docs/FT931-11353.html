			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lords move on potato scheme THE government's ability to abolish the Potato Marketing Scheme was limited yesterday when a cross-party alliance of peers twice voted against the government's advice. The Lords voted by 144 to 136 for a move seeking to protect the scheme if the government chooses to abolish it in advance of an impending EC declaration on its conformance with community rules. They then accepted, by 135 to 121, an amendment which would require a poll of registered producers before the Potato Marketing Board could apply to ministers for approval of a successor scheme. The agriculture bill has now completed its passage through the Lords, and will come before MPs shortly when ministers will have to decide whether to reverse these defeats.</p>

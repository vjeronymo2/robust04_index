			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Freddy Melaert: "Increased Support for Party </F> of the Disillusioned"]    [Text] One of the major lessons which Belgium must learn  from the European elections is that Europe has certainly not  proved a winner. And, unfortunately, the principal political  parties must stand accused, despite their denials, of having  diverted these elections from their real objective.    The results show that many voters cast their votes on the  basis of domestic issues, reflecting wide-ranging  disillusionment. The government coalition parties have received  a reprimand, and a relatively harsh one at that. Apart from the  scandals, they have also suffered the consequences of the  unpopular austerity plan and of having so far failed to  reconcile, as they promised, the citizen and politics.  Unacceptable as it may be, we have to accept that the big  winner in these elections is the party of those disillusioned  with the political system and of those who voted in large  numbers for the extreme right, who split their vote among small  parties with no future, or sought refuge in an apparently very  significant abstention vote. In French-speaking Belgium, the PS  [Socialist Party] suffered a very severe defeat. The virtuous  words of Philippe Busquin did not succeed in neutralizing the  negative impact on the PS's image of the scandals that have been  so much discussed of late. The devastation would have been  worse still without the presence of popular and increasingly  ambitious Jose Happart heading the party's list of candidates.    The PSC [French-speaking Social Christian Party] also lost  considerable ground, and that was a personal failure for its  president, Gerard Deprez. His reelection as party president,  previously taken for granted, has now been thrown wide open.  The loss of support for the PSC is probably partly due to the  Demaret-Thys scandal. As to the Ecologists, they have probably  been punished for their misalliance with the majority on the  vote on institutional reform in return for ecotaxes, a move that  was both improvised and unpopular. A part of their electorate  will not forgive them for having entered the troubled waters of  the policy-making.    As to the PRL [French-speaking Liberal reformation  Party]-FDF  [French-speaking Democratic Front] alliance, its strategy no  doubt paid off. But will its increased support be confirmed at  the next elections? The question is pertinent to the extent  that it most certainly harvested protest votes which are by  definition volatile. Nevertheless, the PRL-FDF is now just a few  points behind the previously dominant PS. On the other hand,  the Flemish Liberals suffered a bitter defeat. They fell far  short of achieving their ambition to unseat the CVP [Flemish  Christian Democratic Party] as Flanders' leading party.    An initial conclusion is that the desire for political  change  by the Liberals at the national and the regional level will  probably not be achieved immediately. Despite or precisely  because of their defeat, the majority parties now seem destined  to continue through to the end of their term as early elections  would threaten to be disastrous for all concerned. They must  therefore make every effort to return to form and endeavour to  take concrete account of the problems in society which lie at  the root of the worrying advance of the extreme right. The  Liberals day has yet to come.</p>

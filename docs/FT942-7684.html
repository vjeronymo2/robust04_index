			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Premier Dollars 500m deal for Hellenic Republic Greece is returning to the syndicated loans market for the first time in four years with a Dollars 500m syndicated loan - the country's first under its new sovereign name, the Hellenic Republic. Although Greece is still discussing the terms with a number of banks, early indications point to a five-year deal with a three-year grace period, at a price of around 110 to 112 basis points above the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Senior Greek officials are in London this week to discuss the loan, details of which are expected to be announced within the next week. The deal should be launched in June. Mitsubishi Bank and NatWest are tipped as the arrangers. The underwriting group is likely to include 10 to 15 banks, with each expected to take on an underwriting commitment of up to Dollars 50m. Despite the economic problems currently plaguing Greece, it should still be able to take advantage of the narrowing of spreads in the syndicated loans market. 'Many banks are now hungry for zero-weighted assets - this represents a good source of funding for us,' said Mr Spyros Papanicolaou, head of the international banking department at the Bank of Greece. Telecom Corporation of New Zealand is launching a Dollars 150m syndicated loan via arranger Lloyds Bank Capital Markets. The five-year deal pays a margin of 17.5 basis points over Libor, a facility fee of 12.5 basis points per annum and a five basis point utilisation fee where utilisation exceeds 50 per cent.</p>

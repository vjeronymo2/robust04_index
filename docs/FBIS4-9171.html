			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 21 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav economy  is making a slow headway after three months of implementation of  a programme for monetary reconstruction and the country's  overall economic recovery. A poll conducted by the Belgrade  Institute for Market Research (IZIT) in 200 industrial firms  showed that 84.4 percent of the polled firms have made  perceptibly better results under the new conditions. Since  January 24, when the Yugoslav Government launched its programme,  the world's record hyperinflation dropped from a monthly rate of  313 million percent in january to below zero.    The national currency, the dinar, was stabilized and pegged  to the German mark (one dinar selling one mark). Fifteen  percent of the polled, primarily firms oriented to imports and  exports, said the economic reform has not improved their  business. Revival of their production depends on the lifting or  easing of the international economic sanctions, which the United  Nations Security Council imposed against Yugoslavia on May 30,  1992. Production increase in the period between mid-March and  mid-April was reported by 58 percent of the polled firms, while  15 percent said their production decreased. The poll showed  that the number of industrial firms without sufficient orders  for normal functioning has dropped from 81 percent in  mid-February to 44 percent.    For the first time after nearly two years, some firms  increased the use of their production capacities, mostly those  producing consumer goods (6.7 percent) and equipment (5.9  percent). This mostly results from an improved supply of raw  materials and primary products. At the beginning of the year,  70 percent of industrial firms complained of insufficient stocks  of raw materials while in April it dropped to 59 percent.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BROKEN PIPELINE BRINGS REQUEST TO CUT WATER USE  </P> <P> An 84-inch water pipeline that feeds several reservoirs broke Friday in Scripps  Ranch, forcing the County Water Authority to ask hundreds of thousands of East  County residents to curtail water use over the weekend.  </P> <P> The reservoirs fed by the pipeline had about three days of storage capacity  when the break occurred, and spigots are not expected to go dry, said County  Water Authority spokesman Greg Starmack. However, a statement put out by the  agency said the break could take from three to seven days to repair.  </P> <P> Despite their optimism about the availability of water, officials asked local  water agencies that buy water from the pipeline "to take necessary emergency  water conservation measures."  </P> <P> The County Water Authority also warned residents in several communities against  "outdoor and non-essential water usage" over the weekend. The communities asked  to ration water are La Mesa, El Cajon, Lakeside, Santee, Spring Valley, Lemon  Grove and Otay Mesa.  </P> <P> "It's imperative that they do this," Starmack said.  </P> <P> Starmack said the broken pipe, which carries treated water purchased from the  Metropolitan Water District, normally feeds about 10 reservoirs located south  of the Mira Mar area. The water is pumped from Lake Skinner in the Temecula  area.  </P> <P> Workers were waiting for the pipe to drain Friday afternoon before beginning to  excavate. The cause of the break of the cement pipe, constructed in the  mid-1970s, was unknown, Starmack said.  </P> <P> Starmack said the break occurred at 2 p.m. near Waldgrove Place and Ironwood  Road. However, Irma Warner, who lives on Ironwood Road, said she reported the  break around noon and added that a neighbor had reported it 45 minutes earlier.  </P> <P> "Water was running down a drainage ditch and I knew that wasn't normal. I also  saw gushing water coming out of the utility easement. I called the city water  department and they were puzzled because they didn't know where the water was  coming from. They decided it was the county's responsibility. Ultimately it was  the county that came to turn it off," Warner said.  </P> <P> She added that water flowed into back yards and muddied some swimming pools but  damage appeared to be minor.  </P></p>

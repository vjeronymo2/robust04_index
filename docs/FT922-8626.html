			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Ryan Group will bid in coal sell-off RYAN GROUP, the UK's largest privately owned coal producer, said yesterday that it would bid for part of British Coal when it is privatised. The company's announcement that it had restructured its finances in preparation for a possible bid was the first sign of potential buyers gathering as the government pushes ahead its plans to sell British Coal. Ryan has received a Pounds 50m equity injection from a City consortium led by Electra, the fund management company. That will strengthen Ryan's capital base so that it can take advantage of any opportunities to buy parts of British Coal. Electra, together with consortium partners Bankers Trust and Creditanstalt, will also provide a Pounds 65m loan facility, of which Pounds 35m will be used initially. Mr Crispian Hotson, Ryan's chief executive, said that mining companies such as Anglo-United, Hanson, and RTZ, as well as international coal companies, would bid for parts of British Coal. Ryan will be one of the smallest companies interested in British Coal - it produces 6m tonnes of coal compared with British Coal's 90m. Mr Hotson threw down a challenge to British Coal. 'We could get their costs down, and so could a number of international companies,' he said. He rejected reports from NM Rothschild, the merchant bank advising on the privatisation, forecasting that competition from gas and imported coal might force British Coal's total output down from 90m tonnes to 35m - 40m tonnes. British Coal's pits could produce 50m tonnes of competitive coal, he said. At world prices, that might mean a revenue of close to Pounds 1bn. Although there are so far no details of how British Coal might be sold, it is likely that it will be split into several companies, and Ryan hopes it will be able to bid for smaller businesses. Although Ryan did not indicate how much it might spend, it is likely to be interested in south Wales, where it has some deep mines, or the profitable opencast mining business, where it works as a contractor to British Coal. 'We aren't interested in huge tonnages,' Mr Hotson said. 'We want the bit you can make money out of.' The Electra deal will enable Ryan to clear the debt of more than Pounds 100m it inherited from the management buy-out that formed the company from the quoted company Ryan International in 1989. In the year ending December 1990 (the last published results) the company's interest charge of close to Pounds 20m cancelled out its Pounds 11.2m operating profit.</p>

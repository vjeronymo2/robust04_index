			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / American Steel Tariffs: Free trade threat irks Seoul THE Korea Iron and Steel Association said the US dumping ruling 'destroyed the free steel trade order'. Korean steel exports to the US last year amounted to Dollars 725m (Pounds 476.9m), accounting for 13.8 per cent of the country's total steel exports. The dumping duties on four steel products, including a 30 per cent penalty on Korean hot-rolled steel sheets, would affect almost two-thirds of its steel exports to the US. Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), Korea's biggest steel company, was the most seriously affected by the duties imposed on four Korean companies. Posco mainly provides hot-rolled steel to UPI, a California-based, 50-50 joint venture by the Korean state steel company and USX. Posco hopes to compensate for the threatened lost exports to the US by increasing shipments in east Asia. The other Korean steel companies affected include Dongbu Steel, Dongkuk Steel Mill and Union Steel Manufacturing. In an attempt to avoid other trade problems with the US, the Korean government said yesterday it would enforce protection of intellectual property rights. The US has complained about lax protection of such rights in Korea, including illegal use of software, trademarks, and copyrights.</p>

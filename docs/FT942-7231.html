			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Land Securities' Pounds 237m beats City forecasts The scale of the recovery in the property investment market was yesterday underlined by a 34 per cent rise from 504p to 677p in the net asset value per share of Land Securities, the UK's largest property company, during the year to March 31. Pre-tax profits increased by 3.5 per cent, from Pounds 229.1m to Pounds 237.1m. The group's properties were valued at just above Pounds 5bn, an increase of Pounds 934m. Following the better-than-expected results, the shares rose 2 1/2 p to 663p. The recovery in the asset value reflected a sharp decline in yields, the ratio of income to capital value, which fell from 9.9 per cent to 8.2 per cent. The occupational market showed little sign of recovery during the year, although Land Securities said that the downturn in rents appeared to be coming to an end. 'There has been some encouraging signs of stability and strengthening of demand, particularly for prime retail locations and top quality central London office buildings,' said Mr Peter Hunt, chairman. 'However, we do need to see rental growth coming through to underpin the investment market and to reduce its dependence on yield comparisons with gilts and other financial instruments.' Mr Hunt was cautious about the scope for profits growth. 'There are positive signs of economic recovery but until businesses have sufficient confidence to expand their operations and create the demand for more space, the potential for increasing revenue profit remains limited,' he said. Over the past three years, the company has spent Pounds 600m on properties, more than 60 per cent of which was on acquisitions in which it bought nearly 1m sq ft of retail, industrial and warehouse space. Mr Hunt said that the recent strengthening of yields had made it less attractive to purchase investment properties. Land Securities has restarted its development programme. Last year it spent Pounds 23m on developments; it has committed a further Pounds 128m to developments this year. Gearing fell from 59.6 per cent to 45.6 per cent. Available funds at March 31 amounted to Pounds 241.5m. Values of properties increased by 19 per cent in the City and by 19.5 per cent in the west end and Victoria. Shop and office properties elsewhere in the UK rose by 16.4 per cent. Out-of-town retail property increased in value by 34.1 per cent and industrial and warehouse property by 20.5 per cent. Earnings per share increased by 8.6 per cent to 35.66p (32.83p). A final dividend of 17.4p is recommended, making a total of 24p, an increase of 5 per cent. See Lex</p>

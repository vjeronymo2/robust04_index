			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN CARLOS KILLER NOW MAKING CLOTHES IN PRISON;  </P> <P> STOCKTON TRAGEDY MIRRORS SPENCER CASE  </P> <P> The unthinkable happened Tuesday morning at Cleveland Elementary School in  Stockton when a gunman with a semiautomatic rifle opened fire on terrified  schoolchildren.  </P> <P> A horrifying event, but not unique.  </P> <P> The sniper's rampage was eerily similar in some ways to an attack at Cleveland  Elementary School in San Diego almost precisely 10 years ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Reason Was Obvious  </P> <P> On Jan. 29, 1979, a petite, red-haired, 16-year-old girl picked up a  .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle and peered through its telescopic sight at  schoolchildren arriving at the school, across the street from her Lake Atlin  Avenue home in a quiet San Carlos neighborhood. Seemingly without reason,  Brenda Ann Spencer opened fire.  </P> <P> When it was over, two men lay dead, and eight children and a police officer had  been wounded. But, unlike Tuesday's sniper in Stockton -- who turned his gun on  himself after the shootings -- Spencer entered into a six-hour standoff with  police, and at one point she told negotiators that she had reloaded her gun and  would "hold out" as long as the police could.  </P> <P> Spencer was finally persuaded to lay down her rifle, a Christmas gift from her  father, and surrender. But not before she told a newspaper reporter over the  telephone that she had committed the crime "because I don't like Mondays."  </P> <P> Her infamous statement became the title of a hit song by the Irish rock band  the Boomtown Rats, written by lead singer Bob Geldof, who later became famous  for his African famine-relief efforts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Life Sentence Wanted  </P> <P> The song was released in October, 1979, the same week Spencer was scheduled for  trial in Santa Ana, where the case was moved because of extensive local  publicity. The former Patrick Henry High School student was tried as an adult,  and prosecutors sought a life term without parole.  </P> <P> Spencer, described by neighbors as a quiet tomboy obsessed with guns, violence  and fantasies of killing police, had entered a plea of innocent by reason of  insanity. But, at the last minute, she pleaded guilty to first-degree murder  and was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.  </P> <P> Spencer, now 26, lives in the California Institution for Women in Frontera,  near Chino, and authorities say she is "a model prisoner."  </P> <P> "She has a clean disciplinary record and has adjusted well to the institution,"  said Chief Deputy Hal Tanner, adding that he did not know whether Spencer was  aware of Tuesday's events in Stockton.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Be Paroled in 2001  </P> <P> Spencer will be eligible for parole in June, 2001, at the age of 39. Until  then, she will continue to work in the prison's garment factory, making  clothing for fellow inmates, Tanner said.  </P> <P> San Diego's Cleveland Elementary School, a victim of sagging enrollment, no  longer exists. It was one of eight schools closed in 1983, said Norma Trost of  the San Diego Unified School District.  </P> <P> The building is now being leased by the private San Diego Hebrew Day School,  but a plaque memorializing slain Principal Burton Wragg and custodian Michael  Suchar remains implanted in the concrete by the flagpole. An abstract aluminum  sculpture created by a junior high school art teacher still graces the school  district headquarters on Normal Street in Hillcrest, in memory of the two men  who were gunned down trying to shield the schoolchildren.  </P></p>

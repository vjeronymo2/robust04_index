			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Italian corruption scandal widens A FORMER official of the Italian Communist party (PCI) was arrested yesterday by Milan magistrates on suspicion of operating a Swiss bank account to receive pay-offs from contracts in the power industry. The arrest of Mr Primo Greganti, an official in the Turin branch of the PCI during 1970-87, is part of the widening national investigation into corruption in which a growing number of senior political and busi ness leaders have been implicated. Mr Greganti voluntarily appeared for questioning in Milan yesterday and was later arrested for alleged corruption and illicit financing of the party. It is the first time Italian companies have been linked to alleged payments to the PCI made illicitly outside the country. Corruption in the power industry is one of the main lines of investigation now being pursued by Milan magistrates. According to magistrates, Mr Greganti had been identified by Mr Lorenzo Panzavolta, the head of Calcestruzzi, the construction and cement arm of Ferruzzi, as the recipient of L620m (Dollars 401,000) paid into a Swiss bank account for the PCI in respect of a contract with Enel, the state electricity authority. This is not the first time the corruption scandals have involved the PCI, which has sought to present itself as clean. Mr Giovanni Batista Zorzoli, the PCI representative on the board of Enel, has been arrested. The PCI was dissolved in 1990 and its mantle was taken was up by the newly created Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) of which Mr Greganti was a member. The PDS yesterday vigorously denied any knowledge of the payment and further denied possessing a Swiss bank account. Milan magistrates also arrested and placed on bail yesterday Mr Arturo Romagnoli, a businessman and the brother of Mr Vincenzo Romagnoli, former owner of the construction company Cogefar. Mr Romagnoli was alleged to have been involved in corruption related to Milan municipal contracts. In another development likely to prove embarrassing to the Christian Democrats, Mr Michele de Mita, the brother of former prime minister Ciriaco de Mita, currently head of the parliamentary institutional reform commission, was arrested on fraud charges. Mr Michele de Mita was alleged to have been part of a scheme which submitted fake invoices for potatoes supplied to earthquake victims at Irpinia in southern Italy in 1980.</p>

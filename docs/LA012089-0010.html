			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAKHAROV REJECTED AS CANDIDATE FOR NEW PARLIAMENT  </P> <P> Soviet human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov has been rejected by the  Academy of Sciences as one of its representatives in a revamped Soviet  Parliament, a fellow academy member said Thursday.  </P> <P> Sakharov, 67, physicist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was turned down along  with several other leading scientific and cultural figures at a marathon  12-hour meeting of the academy's Presidium that ended late Wednesday.  </P> <P> "There was enormous support for Sakharov among the rank and file of the  academy," said Roald Sagdayev, director of the Soviet Space Research Institute.  "I do not know how the Presidium is going to explain it to them."  </P> <P> Sagdayev, who also failed to win nomination, said, "If I had to summarize those  not elected, I would say it is the group of the most outspoken proponents of  perestroika (restructuring). I am proud to be in such company."  </P> <P> The official Soviet news agency Tass said that Sakharov won 105 votes, failing  to reach the required minimum of 139.  </P> <P> The academy and other public bodies such as the ruling Communist Party and  trade unions are together allocated one-third of the seats in the Congress of  People's Deputies, a new supreme legislative body to be created in March.  </P></p>

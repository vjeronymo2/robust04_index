			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from Miraflores Presidential </F> Palace in Caracas from the "Union Radio News" newscast]    [Text] Dr. Gustavo Roosen, who has been appointed special  commissioner for reforming the financial system, said a few  minutes ago that within the next 72 hours he intends to  establish a solidarity pact between commercial banks and the  Central Bank of Venezuela to preserve the country's financial  network.    Speaking at Miraflores Palace, Dr. Roosen broadly outlined  the complex situation for reporters. He said this pact is  intended to clarify the issuance of financial instruments, which  can help ease the situation by decreasing the issuance of  zero-coupon bonds and, in place of these bonds, issuing Treasury  bills of exchange that would be purchased by domestic banks.    [Begin Roosen recording] In accepting this important duty,  we  intend to coordinate between the Finance Ministry, the  superintendency of banks, FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee and Banking  Protection Fund], and the Central Bank of Venezuela in every way  possible in an effort to establish a solidarity pact to restore  confidence in the financial system.    We will do this by implementing programs that lead to the  recovery of subsidized banks, gradually reducing the current gap  between passive and active interest rates in the national  market, and seeking ways to use the system's financial surpluses  in the placement of Treasury bills of exchange or financial  instruments other than zero-coupon bonds, which has been the  only available mechanism to remove surplus liquidity from  circulation.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Milan Martic, president of the republic of </F> Serbian Krajina, by Dusan Vojvodic; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Vojvodic] Mr. President, could you say for the  Radio and Television of Serbia how the present stage of the  implementation of the cease-fire agreement and the separation of  forces on the front lines is assessed in Krajina?    [Martic] So far I would say that everything is going  according to the agreement. Separation has to a large extent  been completed. The UN forces are entering the area between the  two forces, this area of 2 km on each side. As envisaged by the  agreement, they have the right to carry out inspections up to 20  km inside the territory, where the heavy weapons are stored.    As I said, everything is going according to the plan. There  have been no major disagreements. There are some small, minor  details that need to be solved and they are being solved in  Western Slavonia, where UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] duties  are obviously not properly understood, but we are working on it.  There will be no problems with that.    [Vojvodic] How are the army and the people of Krajina, whose  supreme commander you are, accepting this agreement, and what is  their primary objective at present?    [Martic] They are accepting it very well. There have been  no problems or provocations from the Croatian side in the past  few days, which is understood to mean that they will, after all,  adhere to the agreement. However, the army has its objectives  and cannot fall asleep. We must think in terms of the  possibility of being attacked tomorrow and we must prepare  ourselves for a normal existence.    [Vojvodic] In any case, we have observed over the past few  days, and we know that you personally, and the people of this  region, are in favor of peace, but not at any cost. Could you  tell us when the new Krajina government will finally be formed  and what its first task will be?    [Martic] The new Krajina government will be formed on 20  April. This government should be a government of national  unity, a government of experts. As we have said, we plan to  appoint people who can indeed deal with every task, people who  can implement in the best possible way what we have emphasized  in the program. In other words, they will be able to start the  production process. Actually, they should address the six  points emphasized in our program. The first, of course, is  defense. This had to be placed in first place, then the legal  system, the revitalization of the economy and environment, the  social program, more aggressive diplomatic activities,  especially that in which we are most interested, the unification  of Serbian lands.    The biggest problem facing the government is the regulation  of the legal system and revitalizing production.    [Vojvodic] There are rumors in [word indistinct] and Krajina  that some agreements on this program have been reached with  members of almost all parties.    [Martic] [Words indistinct] we have held talks with the  majority of people who make decisions in the different parties  and found a common language. What I am pleased about is that we  are overcoming the small crisis that existed. I think that this  will be thrill the entire nation.</p>

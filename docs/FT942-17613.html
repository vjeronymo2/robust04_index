			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Well-rounded education Sir, In her letter of March 25, Mrs S Copperwaite of Merrill International demonstrates all the enthusiasm of a good student. After all, poets are read mostly by other poets, watercolour painters viewed by others of their skill, and investors also think the world revolves around their profession. I am a fan of Michael Prowse and agree that a well rounded education includes economics. The trouble is that formal schools of economics admit they cannot create an expanding market at will. I read somewhere that most economic reports are studies in obfuscation and I agree. Until this problem is cleared up, I think schools could use some understanding of moral standards, honesty and charity backed up by the age-old tenets of whatever major religion is followed by the student and his family, whether he/she is an investor, watercolour artist, poet or whatever. Ms C Shepard, 600 Foothlll Road, Palo Alto, CA94305 8444, US</p>

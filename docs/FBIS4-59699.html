			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jack Katzenell] </F>   [Text] Ministers learned about this morning's terrorist  attack at Bet Hagay during the weekly cabinet session, which was  held today instead of on Sunday. They expressed outrage at the  attack. The information was still fragmentary, but the chief of  the General Staff, Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, gave a  detailed report on yesterday's incident in Hebron. Some  ministers criticized the Army for permitting the settlers to  walk into downtown Hebron.    Environment Minister Yosi Sarid said these tours are never  innocent; they are always provocative. We have to fight  terrorism and provocation, he said, if we are to press forward  with the peace process. Immigrant Absorption Minister Ya'ir  Tzaban said that if this artificial cult of old tombs is allowed  to continue, there will be plenty of new tombs. Housing  Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer renewed his demand for the  concentration of all the scattered groups of settlers in Hebron  in one place, and Prime Minister Rabin said the action of the  settlers yesterday was not justified.    The chief of staff rejected the ministers' criticisms of the  Army. He said in allowing the settlers tour, the Army was only  carrying out instructions of the government. On the basis of  these instructions, settlers are permitted to walk from Qiryat  Arba' into Hebron. This had always been permitted in the past,  and the government had never adopted a decision to the contrary.    The prime minister did not report to the cabinet on his  meeting with Warren Christopher last night. It was informal, he  said, and the real talks will take place this evening.    The head of the Israeli team negotiating with Syria,  Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, told Qol Yisra'el this morning he  has the impression that the Syrians realize that time is running  out and do wish to make progress, but are not certain how to go  about it. In an hour's time, Secretary Christopher will be  meeting Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. This evening, he will  have another meeting with Prime Minister Rabin.</p>

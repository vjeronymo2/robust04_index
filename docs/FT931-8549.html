			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Survey of World Taxation (1): The pressure is starting to hurt - President Bill Clinton's intention to raise taxes and squeeze more from foreign companies in the US is symptomatic of a new fiscal aggressiveness in many other countries PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's calls for higher taxes this week are warning shots which have been heard in terror by tax practitioners around the world. He may have toned down his aggressive campaign rhetoric about capturing an extra Dollars 45bn from foreign corporations operating in the US. But many will see his pledges as symptomatic of a new, aggressive attitude in the world's largest economy which will help set the agenda of many other governments over the next few years. The prominence given to Mr Clinton's remarks since his election also serves as a reminder of the huge importance now being given to international tax issues, as multinational companies and international transactions grow in significance. 'Business has undoubtedly become more international,' says Mr Roger White, head of tax at KPMG Peat Marwick in London. That has brought a corresponding change in the attitude of fiscal authorities. 'In their own plodding way the revenue services are catching up,' says White. 'They are desperately trying to bring themselves into the 1970s as business moves into the next century.' He argues that there has been a 'globalisation of tax policy setting', with fiscal authorities from different countries meeting more regularly across borders, exchanging information and sharing ideas through forums such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. This dialogue is reflected in the recent resurgence of international tax treaties, which grew after the second world war but then declined in importance during the 1960s and 1970s. There are now many hundreds in place around the world, including a near-complete network between EC member states. Geographically, the US is an important focus of attention. When the Internal Revenue Service takes action, other countries often have to follow to ensure they maintain their share of tax levied. Aside from President Clinton's general sabre-rattling, it has been aggressively pushing for new rules on transfer pricing. 'We have the potential for the start of a tax war,' says Mr Peter Dickinson, head of international tax with Coopers &amp; Lybrand. This attitude is shown in the recent re-negotiations of its tax treaty with the Netherlands. The US forced discussions for a new treaty, and the result includes some tough conditions on removal of remaining privileges - on pain of the treaty being nullified. 'It was a reflection of what the US wanted,' says Dickinson. The new climate is posing particular problems for multinational companies when trying to structure acquisitions and plan operations, he argues. 'It is difficult to plan in the long-term, so you have to arrange things in a way that can be changed without adverse consequences in two years' time.' One trend in which the US remains the exception is the introduction of value added tax. Around the world there has been a clear shift away from direct taxation towards indirect tax. Mr Ian McDade of Price Waterhouse says this reflects both the simplicity and lower costs of collection, and the fact that, once introduced, indirect taxes are less politically damaging since people are not so likely to see their impact. He adds that this growing application reflects a shift away from considering tax as an instrument of social policy or wider public policy objectives, towards one more tightly focused around income generation. At a time when many countries are in recession, it comes as no surprise that their fiscal authorities are pushing hard to boost collection. The use of indirect taxes is now also being echoed in the countries of Eastern Europe, the former Commonwealth of Independent States and Asia. McDade says this is explained by competition for inward investment: companies will be discouraged by seeing high headline tax rates. Most geographical attention for international taxation at the moment lies in Western Europe. The EC has achieved a harmonised system for VAT, which began operating at the start of this year. Market forces, officials argue, will begin to force the varying member states' tax rates to converge. The next challenge will be the debate on whether to shift from an origin-based system - in which VAT is charged in the country where goods or services are bought - to a destination-based one. That change is designed to take place in 1997 but may be strongly contested. On direct tax, EC trends are more ambiguous. Progress towards harmonisation on corporation tax seems to have been stalled in spite of an ambitious report by Dr Ono Ruding early last year. But a number of practitioners point to draft EC legislation clearly pushing in that direction. Methods of collection have changed considerably in the last few years. There has been a movement towards self-assessment of tax, by which taxpayers calculate how much they should pay and send this amount directly to the authorities rather than wait for an assessment. This has long been the method applied in the US. It is also in place in countries such as Canada, Spain, Italy, Denmark, France and Germany. Ireland and Australia recently moved in the same direction. Now the UK is doing the same, with an Inland Revenue consultative document issued last year on self-assessment for personal income taxpayers, and a new system of 'pay and file' for corporations due to begin this autumn. The approach reduces the prolonged annual debates over tax calculations, and permits revenue authorities to make considerable staff savings. But it introduces new pressures by placing greater burdens on taxpayers - one reason, it is said, why alcohol sales peak in the US at the time of filing the annual return. It also brings the risk of far greater investigations or 'audit' work by tax officials to ensure that the correct amount has been paid. The onus is being shifted on to taxpayers to prove they have paid the right amount - backed up by detailed documentary proof. Investigations and compliance issues are taking on a wider significance. Most international tax treaties include clauses calling for exchanges of information between different national fiscal authorities. These have led to a growth in multinational examinations of a company's tax affairs. In the EC, formal computer systems to share information between member states and to detect fraud are now in place. This raises questions about the security of confidential and commercially-sensitive information. It also worries many practitioners, since data may be exchanged and used as the basis for inquiries without any opportunity for the company involved to be able to verify the information under scrutiny. Technology is becoming more important in other ways too. For companies and their advisers, new software is making it possible to compute and experiment with the presentation of financial information more easily. For revenue authorities, electronic filing of tax returns will increase markedly during the 1990s. As international tax issues continue to flourish, one more question remains: the role of the tax professional. In the UK, advice has traditionally been led by accountants. Elsewhere, lawyers or others with specialist qualifications have dominated. Small companies offering niche services are also developing. Accountants have good abilities to crunch numbers; lawyers play a vital role in interpreting legal texts and precedents. In the future, there will probably be greater demand for a combination of these skills, at a competitive price.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR WHEELS: WHO PAYS FOR MISTAKEN REPAIR?  </P> <P> As cars become more complex, the job of diagnosing mechanical problems is  growing into a major nightmare for motorists. Even competent and honest  mechanics can make a mistake in diagnosing what is causing a suspension noise,  an engine stall or an overheating condition, among many other problems.  </P> <P> In a sense, a faulty diagnosis is even worse than a bad repair, since the  motorist is left without knowing what is causing the problem in his or her car.  As cars become more sophisticated, automobile manufacturers have attempted to  help mechanics by building in computerized diagnostic systems that self-test  various systems in the car.  </P> <P> But these computer systems are often beyond the comprehension of most  neighborhood mechanics. And as a car ages, primary or secondary owners become  more reluctant to pay the high premiums charged by dealership garages.  </P> <P> All too often, garages engage in trial and error to find a problem. If the car  is stalling, they will perform a tuneup first, regardless of whether the car  has been tuned up recently. Then, it's on to exhaust gas recirculation valves,  fuel injectors, distributor wires, coils and on and on until they find the  problem. This is clearly an unacceptable expense.  </P> <P> What can a motorist fairly expect if he or she takes a car into a garage and a  repair is performed which does not solve the problem? It is a gray area, far  more difficult to handle than a simple faulty repair.  </P> <P> Even though most states have consumer protection laws that are supposed to  safeguard motorists from dishonest mechanics, no government can legislate  competence. In California, for example, state laws do not specifically say that  a motorist is entitled to a refund if a faulty diagnosis leads to an  unnecessary repair.  </P> <P> So all too often, the motorist is left to his own devices.  </P> <P> One school of thought holds that the mechanic is supposed to be the expert and  should back his diagnosis. If a repair does not solve a problem, then the  garage should provide a refund or credit for the subsequent correct repair.  </P> <P> But trying to jawbone a refund from a garage is a tough task. Many mechanics  will insist that what they repaired was broken.  </P> <P> The other school of thought is that mechanics, like doctors, rocket scientists  and journalists, sometimes make mistakes. Is it really fair to expect a  mechanic to give up part of his day's pay for an honest mistake?  </P> <P> The issue revolves around what is reasonable, based on how faulty the diagnosis  was and whether the mechanic should have known better. Experts in the area of  dispute resolution argue that in most cases, a mechanic should make an  adjustment if a repair was based on a faulty diagnosis.  </P> <P> "Is the customer responsible for paying for an honest mistake? No," argues  David Taylor, a program manager for California Bureau of Automotive Repair.  "The mechanic is the expert."  </P> <P> Clair Villano, chairman of Automotive Service Excellence, a national  organization that certifies mechanics, said dispute arbitration boards often  will back the motorist if a diagnosis is incorrect.  </P> <P> Rather than go to arbitration, many mechanics will try to find some middle  ground and bear at least some of the cost for the mistake. Motorists hold a  strong hand if they are regular customers of the garage, since the mechanic  will see a concession as an investment in keeping the customer's future  business. One way to help avoid such disputes is for consumers to refrain from  making their own diagnosis. If the repair doesn't solve the problem, then the  mechanic cannot argue that he followed the motorists instructions.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VETERAN'S SEARCH  </P> <P> Thanks very much to staff writer Greg Krikorian for his wonderfully written and  very moving Veterans Day story (Metro, Nov. 12) on Wallace Perry, a World War  II veteran who journeyed to Belgium on behalf of a woman he barely knew to find  the grave of her father who had been killed in battle back in 1944, and to lay  a medal on the grave site.  </P> <P> It really was frustrating to hear that Perry was unable to locate the woman  upon his return to tell her of his success. That made the follow-up article  (Nov. 16) all the more satisfying to find out that the woman had indeed been  found, and that she was thrilled and touched.  </P> <P> RON GRACEN  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

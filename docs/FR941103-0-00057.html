			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This submittal was supplemented by a letter from the Commissioner of DEP dated May 26, 1994 describing additional changes Maine is making to the I/M program, and a commitment to provide additional material by July 22, 1994 and to address issues relating to the low mileage waiver by specified dates. On July 21, 1994, the State of Maine submitted a revised SIP submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific requirements of EPA's I/M regulations and the rationale for EPA's proposed action were explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. This rulemaking explains how the State fulfilled the requirements articulated in the May 26, 1994 letter from DEP as they were described in the NPR. While no public comments were received on this NPR, substantial public comments were received on a related NPR published on June 23, 1994 (59 FR 32390). In that package, EPA proposed approval of a voluntary I/M program in Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln and Sagadahoc counties, without evaluating whether or not it met any requirements of the federal I/M rule. One hundred seventy-four comment letters were received on that package. Comments centered on a potential emissions trade, which would have allowed nitrogen oxide emission reductions from the I/M program, not reqired by federal law, to be traded to promote industrial growth. Though it was reported by the local media as such, the NPR did not propose approval of an emissions trade. In addition, while many supported I/M, some of the commenters questioned the need for I/M in Maine. Each of the letters which had a return address was responded to in writing individually from Region 1's Air Director, with the exception of comments received from the Natural Resources Council of Maine and the American Lung Association of Maine. A summary of all these comments, and EPA's response is included in section IV of this document. Again, no comments were received on the July 8, 1994 NPR to which this final action specifically pertains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The I/M SIP includes Chapter 128 of an amended State rule entitled ``Motor Vehicle Emission Inspection Program,'' and additional supporting material including authorizing legislation, administrative items, and a description of the program being implemented. Maine submitted this SIP revision request to the EPA to satisfy the requirements of sections 182(b)(4) and 184(b)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Act, and the federal I/M rule codified at 40 CFR part 51, subpart S. This SIP revision will require vehicle owners to comply with the Maine I/M program in the seven moderate ozone nonattainment counties in Maine. This revision applies to the Maine counties of Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc, and York. At the time the NPR was prepared, the State was proposing revisions to its I/M regulations and was undergoing rulemaking action to address outstanding deficiencies in the rules submitted as part of the November 1, 1993 SIP revision. The July 21, 1994 submittal includes those revised adopted rules and a detailed narrative description of the program. EPA is taking final action to conditionally approve the program because the state has met the requirements of the I/M rule except for the items which provide the basis for the conditional approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPR stated that the only outstanding issue which could not be resolved in time for the July 21, 1994 submission (and which therefore formed the basis of the conditional approval) was the ``low mileage'' waiver (LMW). Conditional approval for the LMW issue is necessary because the number of vehicles to be granted low mileage exemptions is uncertain and EPA is concerned that the use of LMWs may result in the State's failing to meet the minimum enhanced I/M performance standard in actual practice. Coincident with EPA's processing of the NPR, however, Maine adopted a change to the regulation that is inconsistent with the federal I/M rule. Specifically, Maine allowed for owner-performed repairs for select emission control devices for 1980 and newer vehicles to count toward the minimum waiver expenditure provided by section 51.360 of the federal I/M rule. Section 51.360 does not allow the cost of parts for these newer vehicles to count toward the waiver limit. However, the state committed in its May 26, 1994 letter and reiterated in the July 21, 1994 submittal that it would issue waivers only when the requirements of EPA's waiver requirements are met. EPA construes this as a commitment to adopt the necessary corrective measures which in turn provides an additional basis for the conditional approval proposed in the July 8, 1994 NPR. EPA believes this deviation in the area of owner-performed repairs, referred to herein as the ``OPR issue,'' provides an additional basis for the conditional approval proposed in the July 8, 1994 NPR. Such conditional approval is appropriate because of the State's commitment to meet all of EPA's waiver requirements in its May 26, 1994 letter and in the July 21, 1994 submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

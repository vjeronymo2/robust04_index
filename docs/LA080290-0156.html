			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: VENICE;  </P> <P> ENGINEERS RECOMMENDED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Board of Public Works has voted to recommend the hiring of a  San Francisco engineering firm to conduct a hydrology study of the Venice  canals.  </P> <P> The board recommended to the City Council and Mayor Tom Bradley that the city  hire Phillip Williams &amp; Associates to perform the $152,000 study, which is  being paid for by the city and the state Coastal Conservancy.  </P> <P> The council is expected to consider the matter in the next few weeks.  </P> <P> Department of Public Works officials said they are recommending Phillip  Williams because the firm had previously written a hydrology report on the  canals for the Coastal Conservancy and is being considered for a state contract  to conduct a tidal flushing of nearby Ballona Lagoon. The department sought no  other bids for the project, officials said.  </P> <P> The hydrology study will examine the quality of water in the canals and analyze  ways to improve water flow. City officials said the study is needed before the  city can move forward on various proposals to restore the canals, which will  involve improving water quality and rehabilitating disintegrating banks.  </P></p>

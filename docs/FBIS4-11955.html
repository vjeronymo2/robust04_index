			<p>BFN     [Text] The Knesset will hold a special session next week.  Among other things, it will discuss the government decision to  repatriate Palestinian deportees and to place foreign observers  in Hebron. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the Likud  faction this morning submitted the 30 Knesset members'  signatures, required to summon the house for a session during  its recess.    The Likud says that stationing observers gravely violates  Israel's sovereignty and attests to the fact that the government  is losing control at this time.</p>

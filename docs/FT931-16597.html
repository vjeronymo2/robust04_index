			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Japan's vehicle registrations decline by 7.2% MOTOR vehicle registrations in Japan fell 7.2 per cent last year, the second consecutive year of decline, highlighting the impact of the economic slowdown and the increasing pressure for a restructuring of an overcrowded car industry. The Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said total sales were 5.33m, with sales of passenger cars, excluding mini-cars, down 8.6 per cent to 3.68m units, marking the first yearly fall since 1981. Eight of the country's 11 vehicle makers reported a downturn in sales last year, while sales of imported cars slipped 7.7 per cent to 184,616 units. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the federation of economic organisations, said the government should consider new measures to stimulate the flagging economy if the slowdown continues into the spring. He said the government may need to remedy the stock market weakness, which has undermined business confidence. The Electronic Industries Association of Japan also highlighted the difficulties facing the country's leading manufacturers by announcing that domestic shipments of colour television sets fell 11.9 per cent in November, compared with the same month in 1991. Electronics makers were particularly surprised by a 24 per cent fall in shipments of large-size televisions, on which they had based hopes of a recovery in consumer demand for higher-priced products. Video cassette recorder shipments were down 19.9 per cent, while shipments of high-performance VCRs fell 40.5 per cent. Daihatsu, the maker of mini-vehicles and commercial vehicles, reported a 28.5 per cent fall in sales by volume, while Toyota saw a 5.4 per cent decline and Nissan 10.8 per cent. Mitsubishi Motors said its sales were 3 per cent higher, while Suzuki reported a 19 per cent increase. In December, passenger car sales fell 8.1 per cent on a year earlier, while truck sales were 8.4 per cent lower. Bus sales fell 30 per cent.</p>

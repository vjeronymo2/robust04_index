			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Singalonga Matsumoto One night, as he mingled with other Tokyo businessmen intent on forgetting their worries with a drink and a song, Seiya Matsumoto, president of Pioneer, had a thought that was to alter the course of his company's history. The head of the Japanese audio company had been joining in a sing-along when he noticed a drawback to the conventional karaoke format using audio tapes: whenever someone asked for a song, everyone had to wait until it could be found. Matsumoto's experience led Pioneer to develop systems for karaoke using laser discs, a move which was to mark the first significant success for the group in its plan to become a diversified consumer electronics group and establish its place in the growing market for audio visual products. Since the early 1970s, Pioneer had been hoping to expand out of the specialist audio market. Although it had been producing TVs and experimenting with VTRs, Pioneer was already well behind its bigger, stronger competitors which dominated the market. Pioneer was a small fish in the consumer electronics world and it was looking for a new product with added value to give it a leading edge. The laser disc provided just that. A digital video disc that combines the high quality sound offered by digital recording with the improved picture quality and the random access capability of laser technology, the laser disc was a new medium which seemed to offer a wide range of applications. Although originally invented by Philips, the Dutch company failed to market the laser disc, which it called the CD-V, as a successful consumer product. The problem, as with many entirely new technologies, was finding a use for the laser disc that would justify the high cost for consumers of investing in the hardware. Pioneer's initial attempts to repackage existing software, such as popular films and music, and producing practical guides to golf courses and educational material, met with little success. Rather than give up, as many others did, Pioneer forged ahead. It was years after it started developing the laser disc that it stumbled, almost by accident on the application that would win wide consumer acceptance. As a result of its success with laser disc karaoke, Pioneer has achieved an important objective - to build the group into an audio-visual company. Its involvement with the laser disc has supported other new products such as the projection cube which combines several 40-inch projection monitors for large public display video screens. Pioneer, however, now needs to win wider acceptance for its laser discs in western markets, which will mean developing software appropriate to a western audience. It plans to do this through straightforward marketing, rather than by following other Japanese electronics manufacturers into acquisitions. Another challenge is to find an alternative application for the laser disc that will attract widespread consumer demand before the karaoke boom dies out. If it waits too long, the appeal of laser karaoke could be overtaken by interactive media being developed by competitors.</p>

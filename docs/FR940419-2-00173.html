			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under EPA regulations, the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a treatment facility, including secondary treatment, is a bypass. EPA bypass regulations at 40 CFR 122.41(m) allow for a facility to bypass some or all the flow from its treatment process under specified limited circumstances. Under the regulation, the permittee must show that the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage, that there was no feasible alternative to the bypass and that the permittee submitted the required notices. In addition, the regulation provides that a bypass may be approved only after consideration of adverse effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normally, it is the responsibility of the permittee to document, on a case-by-base basis, compliance with 40 CFR 122.41(m) in order to bypass flows legally. For some CSO-related permits, the study of feasible alternatives in the control plan may provide sufficient support for the permit record and for approval of a CSO-related bypass in the permit itself, and to define the specific parameters under which a bypass can legally occur. For approval of a CSO-related bypass, the long-term CSO control plan, at a minimum, should provide justification for the cut-off point at which the flow will be diverted from the secondary treatment portion of the treatment plant, and provide a benefit-cost analysis demonstrating that conveyance of wet weather flow to the POTW for primary treatment is more beneficial than other CSO abatement alternatives such as storage and pump back for secondary treatment, sewer separation, or satellite treatment. Such a permit must define under what specific wet weather conditions a CSO-related bypass is allowed and also specify what treatment or what monitoring, and effluent limitations and requirements apply to the bypass flow. The permit should also provide that approval for the CSO-related bypass will be reviewed and may be modified or terminated if there is a substantial increase in the volume or character of pollutants being introduced to the POTW. The CSO-related bypass provision in the permit should also make it clear that all wet weather flows passing the headworks of the POTW treatment plant will receive at least primary clarification and solids and floatables removal and disposal, and disinfection, where necessary, and any other treatment that can reasonably be provided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this approach, EPA would allow a permit to authorize a CSO-related bypass of the secondary treatment portion of the POTW treatment plant for combined sewer flows in certain identified circumstances. This provision would apply only to those situations where the POTW would ordinarily meet the requirements of 40 CFR 122.41(m) as evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, there must be sufficient data in the administrative record (reflected in the permit fact sheet or statement of basis) supporting all the requirements in 40 CFR 122.41(m)(4) for approval of an anticipated bypass. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purposes of applying this regulation to CSO permittees, ``severe property damage'' could include situations where flows above a certain level wash out the POTW's secondary treatment system. EPA further believes that the feasible alternatives requirement of the regulation can be met if the record shows that the secondary treatment system is properly operated and maintained, that the system has been designed to meet secondary limits for flows greater than the peak dry weather flow, plus an appropriate quantity of wet weather flow, and that it is either technically or financially infeasible to provide secondary treatment at the existing facilities for greater amounts of wet weather flow. The feasible alternative analysis should include, for example, consideration of enhanced primary treatment (e.g., chemical addition) and non-biological secondary treatment. Other bases supporting a finding of no feasible alternative may also be available on a case-by-case basis. As part of its consideration of possible adverse effects resulting from the bypass, the permitting authority should also ensure that the bypass will not cause exceedances of WQS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Construction Contracts: Newspaper production facility The south west regional office of BOVIS CONSTRUCTION in Bristol has been awarded a Pounds 14.5m management contract by The Western Morning News Co, part of the Northcliffe newspaper group, to build its new 12,675 sq metre headquarters at Derriford, in Plymouth, 4.5 miles north of the city centre. Bovis Construction, a P&amp;O company, will start work in June on the 64-week project which will provide a combined printing plant, editorial and administrative offices. Designed by Nicholas Grimshaw &amp; Partners, the building, which has views of Dartmoor and Plymouth Sound, resembles a grounded glass ship. Clad completely in curved faceted glass walls, the entire printing operation will be visible from the exterior. The 'open' production areas are situated on two levels and will house the operations of both the evening and regional morning newspapers, providing views through the illuminated press hall. As the building is cut into a hillside, pedestrian access will be directly into level two. More than 4,500 sq metres of space will be provided in both open plan and private offices built around a central atrium which will also accommodate a reception area. The company boardroom will be situated in a tower, which resembles a ship's bridge, standing 22 metres above the main building. The main structure of the building is of in situ reinforced concrete with flat slabs to office areas, ribbed slabs to production areas and circular columns extending through all floors to support the steel standard section cambered roof beams. The north and south external elevations will feature faceted glass walls. Cambered roof beams will be supported by fabricated 'tusk' columns. The glass panel system used will comprise fixed cast steel glazing arms and struts which will be secured to the concrete columns.</p>

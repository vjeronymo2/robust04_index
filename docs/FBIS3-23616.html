			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kiselev: "You Will Learn of Their Fate </F> from the Order"]    [Text] ITAR-TASS has sent a report: reorganization of  the Armed Forces' mass media has begun. Which is not entirely  correct. They have simply begun speaking about this at last. But  the reformers had a different intent. To prepare a draft order  by the minister of defense without unnecessary fanfare. He would  sign it hastily without considering it carefully. And the deed  was done, the reorganization took place.    Who needs this? One viewpoint. "We have three  central organs for the Ministry of Defense--KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, the  weekly SYN OTECHESTVA, the semimonthly journal ARMIYA, and 13  travel and other magazines. Altogether, 102 editions. At the  same time, for example, the Pentagon publishes about 400  magazines and 1,000 newspapers. In the FRG they publish about  100 military newspapers and magazines, and Britain publishes  more than 110. A subsidy of 1,241,462,000 rubles [R] is  required. As a comparison, it costs the state budget roughly  R1.5 billion to publish just the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA alone."  (From an interview last year with Vladimir Kosarev, chief of the  Information and Press Administration of the Ministry of Defense.)    The following episode took place last year in one of the MO  [Ministry of Defense] collegium meetings. "Is a large amount of  money required to support our press?" the minister asked. They  answered him. "And how many houses can be built with this?"  Pavel Grachev asked. "Three or four," the general in charge of  finances reported. "Well, we should build them," the minister  sighed. "The housing for officers is really a catastrophe." As  we know, any sigh by the chief is interpreted as a directive in  the Army.    An arithmetic lesson. Speaking of the need for  reform, all the military officials say the primary cause is the  shortage of money (at the same time, though, they prefer to call  it "optimizing" the press or "putting it in order"), stating  more specifically that most of the funds go toward the wages of  editorial staff collectives. The conclusion is obvious--to be  squeezed. Some of the large-edition publications will really  disappear soon. This amounts to kopecks, however. You cannot  shut down the district newspapers. They decided to fill up the  Ministry of Defense's empty purse at the cost of the Moscow  editions. Asking that his name not be given, an officer from the  Information and Press Administration said the finance people  simply ordered straight out at first: leave only one newspaper  and one journal. But their ardor was restrained. It looks as if  only the SYN OTECHESTVA and six magazines are being sent for the  slaughter in the end. But two new ones are being established (we  have to pay to order them, by the way).    No one could tell me if there is a substantial economic gain  from such deviations. There are probably no such assessments at  all. But according to my estimates, it is very questionable. The  most profitable military publications which are issued regularly  and are not losing subscribers are on the list of the ones  curtailed. At the same time, CHEST IMEYU (formerly SOVETSKIY  VOIN), a literary and artistic journal with excessively inflated  staffs (55 officers and 63 employees, with 12 correspondents  stationed in the districts), turned out only six issues last  year and is up to its ears in debt. The supplement to CHEST  IMEYU--BOYEVOY TOVARISHCH--has not been issued for a year.  Aleksey Petrenko, who heads the supplement, implores: "Dismiss  us in the staff reduction." "No, stay," they respond.    Altogether, about 100 officer-journalists are being released  in the publications being abolished. A few more than the number  left in the Information and Press Administration. But not many  more. Even during the times of the unforgettable GlavPUR [Main  Political Directorate], the octopus which squeezed the Armed  Forces, the entire military press was headed by a department  with under 10 soldiers. But now the official category of chief  of the administration is a lieutenant general, his deputy is a  major general, and the heads of departments are colonels, who  are in charge of more colonels. According to my information, the  administration is staffed by 62 persons. There are 40, according  to its chief. Although this does not change the point.    The prime mover of the reform. When I expressed my  doubts to one of the administration's employees, he just smiled:  "Everything runs smoothly as long as our lady is with us." The  boss of the military press today is Yelena Agapova. The new  administration--information and press--was established in the  Ministry of Defense precisely because she asked for it.  According to Grachev's order, "The chief of the administration  is subordinate to the Russian Federation minister of defense's  assistant for public and press relations," that is, to Yelena  Aleksandrovna. She was formerly the deputy editor in chief of  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. Her subordinate, Vladimir Kosarev, who has  headed the administration and received his general's shoulder  boards with the speed of lightning, also comes from KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA.    And there are no mysteries for military readers with respect  to CHEST IMEYU. When Nikolay Ivanov no longer wished to head the  journal after the tragic October, and Aleksandr Tkachev, who  headed the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA cultural department, took his place,  Agapova was still a reporter for it.    So the encirclement is being reinforced, step by step, "with  her own people." As General Kosarev explained it to me, his  administration will decide which publications to shut down and  whom to appoint as editors of the new ones. They do not even  intend to consult with the Ministry of Defense collegium about  the publications being abolished (they include two central  organs of the Ministry of Defense: SYN OTECHESTVA and ARMIYA,  the only military-political journal in the Armed Forces). "This  matter is too minor to divert the collegium's attention."    But I know not all the minister's deputies and commanders in  chief of the service branches are prepared to be content with  the role of extras.</p>

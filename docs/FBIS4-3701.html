			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- China supports the  idea of expanding the U.N. Security Council at the proper time,  China's foreign minister told his Egyptian counterpart in talks  here today.    Qian Qichen, who is also a vice-premier, added that the  regional distribution principle, especially how to reach balance  between the developing and developed countries, should be taken  into account in the reform of the U.N. Security Council.    'Amr Musa, Egypt's foreign minister, agreed with Qian's  views  on this issue. The two foreign ministers also reached extensive  consensus on the international situation and bilateral ties in  their talks.    Qian said that yesterday's talks between Egyptian President  Husni Mubarak and Chinese President Jiang Zemin were very good,  and he was convinced that the current visit of Mubarak would  enhance Sino- Egyptian relations.    Musa said that in recent years, the bilateral ties had  developed smoothly and steadily. The two countries should  explore new ways of economic and trade cooperation in order to  promote the equal and mutually-beneficial cooperative relations,  he said.    Touching on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Qian said  that China was deeply worried about the conflict in the region,  which has lasted for a long time, and heartily sympathized with  people there.    The Chinese Government sincerely hoped that all the parties  involved would take the people's interests into consideration  and at once stop the conflict and all hostile activities, Qian  said.    China was also concerned with the deteriorating situation in  Gorazde, he said, adding that the Chinese Government held that  the problem should be solved by peaceful means rather than by  actions which would make the situation more complicated.    China's foreign minister said that China, along with the  international community, would continue to promote the peace  process in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and spare no effort to help  national reconciliation to be reached and people there to shake  off the sufferings brought by the war.    Musa told Qian that Egypt was concerned about the problem,  especially the suffering and unfair treatment of the Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    He pointed out that the United Nations and international  communities should take effective actions to end the war in the  region.    The two foreign ministers also discussed such problems as  the  situation in the Persian Gulf, the nuclear issue in the Korean  peninsula, and the non-aligned countries movement.</p>

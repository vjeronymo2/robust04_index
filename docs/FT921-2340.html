			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Technology: Attracted by a taste of freedom - Why the open systems movement has so many dedicated followers Britain's Post Office is jumping on the 'open systems' bandwagon. It has appointed Hewlett-Packard to supply its equipment, and over the next couple of years intends to install Pounds 20m worth of Unix-based systems and software to sit alongside its IBM infrastructure. The Post Office expects to enjoy big economic benefits from the move  - a reduction in capital expenditure, better performance from hardware investments, and great flexibility, not least in delivering new applications to its operating companies. Three things are especially striking here: First, the Post Office has developed an open IT strategy to control the proliferation of Unix systems across the group. The strategy offers technical coherence, without inhibiting the evident enthusiasm for, and deliverability of, Unix-based systems. Second, the Post Office has put itself through an exhausting formal procurement process and selected a 'single strategic supplier' of open systems hardware. In other words, the Post Office feels more secure in a long-term partnership. Third, it has joined a growing body of senior IT users  - BT, BP, Boots, Unilever, DHL  - in a move which promises to deliver at last the revolutionary potential of IT in business. The seismic effects on the computer industry itself are well documented, not least in the balance sheets of IBM and the rest of the proprietary world. Their attempts to demonstrate credible open products and marketing strategies prove the strength of the movement. According to Simon Forge, principal consultant for CSC Index in Paris: 'Even a year ago you could still argue that proprietary systems would go on forever. But we are past the hype now. There is no longer a question about the viability of open systems.' Nick Earle, HP's computer systems marketing manager, says the shift was even later. 'Suddenly in the last nine months, just enough has come together to make open environments a reality  - and businesses are taking advantage of it,' he argues. But what exactly defines open systems? At its simplest, open systems implies freedom of movement  - for software developers and users alike - in three principal areas: portability, scalability and interoperability. Portability means that you can run the same piece of software on computers from different vendors. Scalability is running that software on machines of different sizes. Interoperability allows diverse hardware software components to work together, typically across a distributed network. Progress is evident in each of these areas. Improvements in hardware price performance, delivered increasingly by highly parallel architectures or Risc-based processors, give unprecedented scalability. This in turn encourages widespread 'downsizing'. As Earle points out, applications which were once supported by a multimillion-pound mainframe investment now run happily on processors, or across networks, costing just tens of thousands. Similarly, there is movement on the standards front. The International Standards process underpins much of this open systems initiative. Public standards (most notably OSI Communications, and Posix, which defines calls between an application and operating system) and industry-based standards (X-Windows, XPG3, and the prospect of only two versions of Unix from the Open Software Foundation and Unix International respectively) are slowly maturing. But this is only part of the story. Forge detects a new and highly pragmatic attitude to open systems development. It cannot wait for the standards process, he argues. A new consensus is also emerging which articulates open systems as much in terms of basic computing trends  - desk-top hardware performance, client-server architectures, complex distributed networks, relational databases and sophisticated graphical user interfaces  - as in any formal standards-making process. As Norman Schofield, partner at PA Consulting argues, these technologies are now 'sufficiently capable, cheap and reliable to take the weight of primary responsibility for corporate information'. It is their convergence, within the context of open systems, which promises not only to empower end-users, but to make IT a real competitive force, arguably for the first time. So this is where the real momentum is coming from. Users such as these have finally appreciated that IT is not necessarily the expensive frustration of long experience. Ironically, says John Spires, director of strategic marketing at Oracle, the software developer, if anything business users have 'bought into' the open systems concept far beyond what can be delivered. No doubt the true distributed, integrated computing environment remains a thing of fantasy, but there is enough technology in place, enough precedents, enough demonstrable benefits, to encourage the Post Office and its peers. Glen Peters, head of Price Waterhouse's open systems group, points to striking economies at his client BP. As the company rolls out its pan-European open systems infrastructure, savings have been made in applications development costs and in the proportional cost of hardware to total IT spend. Similarly, Paul Livsey, deputy chairman of House of Fraser stores, says the company's open strategy has given it the flexibility to develop new applications at a fraction of their traditional cost. The group now has 'a phenomenal basis for competition between suppliers', he says. Unilever's experience is perhaps the most telling of all. It embraced open systems at the end of 1990, and its goal was to 'create an application in one Unilever company and use it in any of the other 499,' says Mike Johnson, IT director. Proprietary computing areas had frustrated the transfer of good ideas. With those barriers broken, Johnson believes that over time the new regime will increase Unilever's basic productivity by 'hundreds of millions of pounds'. There are two stumbling blocks on this course, however. First, IT is getting more complicated. In particular, multi-vendor environments throw the onus of technical responsibility back to the users. This is why the Post Office views its partnership with HP as an 'insurance policy'. Second, there is the legacy of proprietary investment. Schofield believes that it is 'criminal' for businesses to add to proprietary systems. But moving inherited applications from a proprietary, often mainframe-oriented, environment to a distributed open one represents not just a technical complication but a business risk. Migration methodologies are emerging to help manage this process, and their common denominator is that an enterprise-wide information architecture  - in essence a blueprint for constructing computing and telecommunications applications and systems across the business  - is a prerequisite to moving to open systems successfully. Similarly, as is the case at the Post Office and Unilever, the view is that open system strategies must be tested in purely business terms. Not surprisingly, as Forge notes, the fastest, most determined uptake has been in global businesses  - McDonald's, DHL, Federal Express  - where there is an imperative to clone systems quickly. Conversely, where the mainframe data centre is institutionalised  - in airline reservations systems, for example  - there is less penetration. Overall, Earle estimates that perhaps 30 per cent of businesses are approaching open systems incrementally  - starting with a new application such as a customer service system to prove the concept. The rest, he suggests, are just watching and waiting. But, as Schofield argues, they should not wait too long: 'The choice is to be a leader, an early follower, or too late.'</p>

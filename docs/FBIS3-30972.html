			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by K.Gr. and P.W.R.: "Against Raises on the Streets </F> of Warsaw; 5 Km of `Solidarity'"]    [Text] Approximately 40,000 "Solidarity" unionists  demonstrated on Wednesday [9 February] in Warsaw against price  rises and for salary increases. "Down with communism,"  "Thieves," "Government go on the dole," they shouted. A  "Solidarity" delegation presented Michal Strak, head of the  Office of the Council of Ministers [URM], with a petition in  which they demanded, among other things, that the budget bill be  amended and the packet of bills related to the "Pact on State  Enterprise" be passed by 15 March. If this deadline is not met,  "Solidarity" Chairman Marian Krzaklewski does not rule out the  possibility of a strike. For a while Strak left the premises of  URM, but he was heckled and quickly went back inside the  building.    "There are 40,000 of us here," announced Krzaklewski as he  started the demonstration at Pilsudski Square. As he was in  front of the URM building, he estimated that approximately  100,000 people were taking part in the demonstration. It was  indeed an enormous demonstration, but the former figure seems to  be closer to the truth. The crowd of protesters stretched from  the URM building to Krakowskie Przedmiescie Street  (approximately 5 km away).    "Those who are in power right now have declared: It does not  have to be this way any longer. It does not have to--because it  is worse," said Krzysztof Mlodzik, chairman of the Secretariat  of Mining and Energy. He warned the authorities that "if they  want a conflict with `Solidarity,' they will have one."    "We do not want to support the perfidious practices that  have  been deceitfully called privatization," said Tomasz Wojcik,  chairman of the Lower Silesia Region; he demanded "giving  property to citizens en mass." At the head of the  demonstration, Ursus unionists were competing with the  supporters of the National Committee. When the former were  shouting "Down with judecja [probably reference to the  Democratic Union allegedly being dominated by Jews]" and "Down  with Walesa," while National Committee supporters were chanting  "Solidarity."    "We do not want to die of hunger in line with the election  promises," "Sejmocracy should be submitted for file-checking,"  "Instead of paying too much for electricity, let us chase the  communists away from here," "Take your hands out of our  pockets," "Nation is working, government is wasting," "Kuron  gave soup, Miller showed his behind," "Communists are promising  things, nation is suffering hunger," "SdRP-PSL [Social Democracy  of the Polish Republic-Polish Peasant Party]: You have given us  the games and circus. Now is the time for bread," were only  some of the slogans heard during the demonstration.    The most popular slogans were "Down with communism,"  "Communists--affair mongers," "Communists go to Cuba."    "Where is your honor, where is the fatherland," people  shouted in front of the URM, where there is the inscription  "Honor, Fatherland."    Lodz Region representatives were carrying an effigy  representing Waldemar Pawlak (with horns) and Lech Walesa  (wearing a ribbon with the word "Traitor" written on it). The  effigy of Pawlak was burned in front of URM. The union members  shouted: "Down with Miller, the affair monger" (Leszek Miller is  a deputy from Lodz), "Lodz wants jobs, not the dole."    The unionists threw a 1.5-meter red casket over the barriers  surrounding URM. They carried, among other things, a black  plaque with a white inscription: "The government, rest in peace."    A railway orchestra was playing; one could hear whistles,  trumpets; many participants of the demonstration were wearing  union caps and shirts.    In a speech in front of URM, Marian Krzaklewski said that  the  reason for the demonstration was, among other things, the fact  that in another year characterized by economic growth, incomes  are on the wane. "Solidarity" supports a "market-solidarity"  state, and not a state of "capital oligarchy." If the latter is  formed, "Solidarity" will overthrow it. Krzaklewski suggested  that the work week be reduced by two hours, which he believes  would allow us to decrease unemployment by approximately 300,000.    The group of demonstrators from Ursus was not able to  continue the demonstration from URM to the Belvedere, where they  say "the greatest evil " lies. The determining factor here was  the behavior of protesters from Gdansk Region.</p>

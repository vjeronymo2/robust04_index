			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Hillsdown facing pensions probe The Pensions Ombudsman is investigating complaints about the treatment of a group of pensioners by Hillsdown Holdings, the food manufacturer. More than 40 former employees of FMC, a meat processing company acquired by Hillsdown in 1983, have voiced complaints that they were treated unfairly when a surplus from their pension fund was repaid to Hillsdown. Hillsdown transferred the FMC scheme's assets, totalling about Pounds 35m, to another Hillsdown fund in 1989, which subsequently repaid Pounds 18.4m, predominantly from the FMC surplus, to Hillsdown over the next two years. The pensioners say that Hillsdown was unfair in that it gave them minimal increases in their benefits, in return for the transfer of their scheme's assets. They also argue that there may have been a breach of the FMC trust deed, which said that any surplus not retained should mainly be used to increase benefits. Hillsdown says that it believes, on the strength of independent advice, that the transfer of the surplus was legal. It also says that it paid a suitable package of improved benefits to the scheme's members. The complaints were initially investigated by the Occupational Pensions Advisory Services, which passed the matter to the Pensions Ombudsman last November. The courts have the power to enforce decisions made by the Ombudsman, who is expected to reach a conclusion on the matter shortly.</p>

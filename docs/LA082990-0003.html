			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN AID FOR SOVIET UNION  </P> <P> Was the CIA misreading the Soviet economy ("CIA Misread Soviet Economy," Part  A, Aug. 3) since 1950 or misleading the American government?  </P> <P> Surely, the leaders of the CIA would rather be seen as well-meaning bunglers  than as disinformers, especially in view of recent events in Eastern Europe;  yet I wonder if the agency wasn't really being artful in its overestimation of  Soviet economic achievements during the last 40 years.  </P> <P> The U.S. Cold War program, in which the CIA was deeply involved from the very  beginning, was certainly served better by this alleged misreading than it would  have been by accurate information.  </P> <P> ANTHONY GARAVENTE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NO ROLE MODEL  </P> <P> I am disappointed and repelled by Tracey Ullman's narrow view of women  presented in the "Taste Makers" article (Calendar, Dec. 25). Her statement, "As  for women role models, I don't have much respect for other women and much  prefer men" displays a sexist, prejudiced attitude that, if stated by a man,  could lose an election or be cause for termination from a public position.  (Whatever happened to Jimmy the Greek?)  </P> <P> Ullman's remark is biting and condescending, and I know that because of it I  will not be able to watch "The Tracey Ullman Show" for a long time. I just  wouldn't be able to enjoy it. After all, I am a woman, a member of the sex for  which Ullman has not much respect. And I can't continue to support an  individual who has no respect for me.  </P> <P> SANDRA ROBBIE  </P> <P> Westminster  </P></p>

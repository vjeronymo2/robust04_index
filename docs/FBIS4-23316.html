			<p>BFN     [Text] Many more massacres of innocent civilians continue  to be done behind government lines. Fleeing government soldiers  and government-backed militias are continuously butchering  innocent civilians. Mr. Edouard Karemera, first vice chairman  of Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development  and minister of internal affairs in the current Sindikubwabo  so-called government, yesterday was blaming government soldiers  who are revenging their massacred relatives by militias. He  claimed that the government is not in control of militias. As  minister of internal affairs, Karemera should be ashamed of this  claim. Why doesn't he stop programs for the inciting of  militias to kill civilians on radio RTLM [Radio-Television Libre  des Milles Collines] and Radio Kigali?    Does he also claim not to be in control of the two radios?  Mr. Karemera should not deceive himself. This genocide which  he has helped in planning and executing, like those of his  clique, will weigh heavily on him. It is not peace that the  so-called government of Rwanda wants, but more time to massacre  the remaining people. One wonders how the Rwanda Government  forces are committed to peace while they continue to massacre  civilians behind their lines.</p>

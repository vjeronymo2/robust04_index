			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / US assurance on Mideast PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday assured his Egyptian counterpart, Mr Hosni Mubarak, that the US would take a balanced approach to solving Middle East problems, Reuter reports from Washington. At a joint news conference in the White House the US leader offered to be a 'full partner in renewed peace talks. . . I am convinced that we share a common vision of a more peaceful Middle East.' He believed 'there is reason to believe we can make real headway.' The two men had earlier discussed a US proposal for the peace talks to resume on April 20 in Washington. Some Arab diplomats have expressed fears that Mr Clinton might soften the approach followed by former President George Bush, who exerted pressure on Israel to comply with US wishes. However, Mr Clinton assured Mr Mubarak that the US would not not tilt towards Israel, administration officials said. The Egyptian leader sought to counter the damage that violent incidents by Moslem fundamentalists have had on his country's tourist trade, declaring that Egypt was not in danger. Mr Mubarak also said yesterday that Egypt had 'no definite information' on the bombing on February 26 of the World Trade Centre in New York. In an interview published on Monday, he claimed that the Egyptian intelligence services had supplied the US with general information that might have prevented the blast.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Observer: United in defence Bill Clinton can do with all the help he can get in defusing the Whitewater row. But even he might balk at his newest defender - Lyndon Larouche, the political extremist and conspiracy merchant not long released from a Virginia jail after serving a term for tax fraud. Larouche, who took the short trip round the dark side of the moon from the far left to (mostly) far right, is planning another presidential run. His exploratory campaign organisation goes by the wonderful title of The Committee to Reverse the Accelerating Global Economic and Strategic Crisis. Whitewater, according to the CRAGESC gospel, is, of course, all a plot by British intelligence and others intent on destabilising the US presidency. Active co-conspirators include Conrad Black and his media empire, Henry Kissinger and those responsible for the Hebron mosque massacre. Larouche, who used to list the Queen of England and anyone named Rockefeller among the plotters, claims that he and Clinton share a lot of the same enemies.</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Air France retreat worries Italy The French government's climbdown over cost-cutting measures at Air France, the national carrier, has been viewed with concern in Italy where the government is planning similar cuts in loss-making, state-owned industries. The government is committed to a broad programme of privatisation and restructuring, and this autumn faces labour unrest over jobs threatened in the chemicals, defence and steel sectors as well as public transport. The position of Air France management has particular relevance for Alitalia. The loss-making airline has seen its plans for an early return to profit undermined by the recession and posted a half-year loss of L216bn (Pounds 90m). Last week plans were leaked of a restructuring scheme that involved the loss of more than 1,000 jobs among ground staff in plus a renegotiation of pay claims already agreed for 1994 for the flight personnel. Alitalia presently employs 21,000 people. Pilots risk losing their bonuses while cabin crew could have their pay frozen. These moves are expected to be strongly resisted by Alitalia staff. The latter claim that only since 1990 have their pay levels been brought up to the norms of other European carriers such as Air France. However, a strike planned for today by the air transport sector protesting against proposed cuts in Alitalia and its subsidiary, Ati, was called off yesterday. This was after assurances were received from IRI, the state holding company that controls Alitalia, that a meeting would be held on November 5 to hear the union point of view. The protests over threatened job cuts across state-run industry have taken the form of factory occupations and the blocking of roads and railways. Over the weekend police removed by force a group of unemployed protesters who had occupied Naples cathedral. A four-hour general strike is due on Thursday to protest against the failure of the 1994 budget to provide sufficient funds to combat unemployment. Unlike his French counterpart, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, is not an elected politician and heads a government with a limited mandate that is largely composed of technocrats. Mr Ciampi's room for political manoeuvre in dealing with labour unrest is strictly circumscribed; while the need to curb public spending has reduced the scope for financial palliatives. Trades union representatives said yesterday they were firmly against any form of violent protest but could not always control grassroots frustration over rising unemployment. Last month, the union leadership was considerably embarrassed by the violent take-over by workers at a petrochemical plant at Crotone in southern Italy.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Cascades to raise up to CDollars 150m to fund new unit CASCADES, an international packaging group controlled by the Lemaire brothers of Montreal, plans to raise CDollars 125m to CDollars 150m (USDollars 120m) in equity for its new Cascades Paperboard International subsidiary. The shares will be offered in Europe as well as North America, and the new funds will be used to reduce debt and develop the subsidiary. Cascades, the Lemaires' holding company, acquired 100 per cent of the old Paperboard Industries from a banking syndicate. It has now put all its packaging products operations in North America and Europe into the new unit which will be 60 per cent owned by the holding company after the equity issue. Cascades Paperboard, which will be profitable, has annual sales of about CDollars 1bn. The new issue is being underwritten by the group headed by Gordon and RBC Dominion Securities, both of Toronto.</p>

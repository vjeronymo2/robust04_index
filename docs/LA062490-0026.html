			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> WEILL: "Die Dreigroschenoper." Ute Lemper, Milva, Helga Dernesch, Rene Kollo,  Mario Adorf, Rolf Boysen; RIAS Chamber Choir and RIAS Berlin Sinfonietta  conducted by John Mauceri.  </P> <P> London 430 075. The second release in London's Weill project should satisfy  both those who believe the composer belongs in the opera house and those who  would consign him to the musical theater. Boysen's Ballad Singer sounds smarmy  and slightly indecent. Dernesch's formidable mezzo relishes the Brecht text in  the "Ballad of Sexual Obsession." Kollo's Macheath lends just the right note of  skewed gallantry. Lemper's Polly (this version restores her the "Pirate Jenny"  number) is insidiously demure, while Milva is a ferocious Jenny. Mauceri keeps  sentimentality at bay while sticking with the printed score. Spoken passages  are abridged; some verses are eliminated in order to fit "Threepenny Opera"  onto one compact disc, but this is generally a performance that sizzles. Allan  Ulrich  </P></p>

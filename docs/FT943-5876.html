			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Flexible options play blamed for Dow rally - Derivatives An 18-month-old derivative product caught the attention of Wall Street last week when a respected money manager's options play, representing a mere Dollars 100m in underlying stock value, was blamed for igniting a 70-point rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday afternoon. Insiders scoff at the idea that such a small options play could move the market so substantially. However, the event and subsequent publicity have created an awareness that a new and fast-growing variety of exchange-traded options might introduce a new sort of volatility into stocks. Mr William Mullen, managing director of Loomis, Sayles and Company, a firm that manages money for a variety of pension funds, was reported to be engaged in a portfolio enhancement strategy that has been popular over the last nine months because it works best in markets that are static or which are on a downwards trend. Known in the industry as 'index overwriting', it involves writing, or selling, call options on popular stock indices like the Standard &amp; Poor's 100 or 500 for the income the options sale generates. Over the past year, derivatives traders say, such call writing could have added a full 1 per cent of return on a fund's investments. The calls sold are generally 5 per cent or more 'out of the money', meaning that the underlying index would have to rally by at least 5 per cent to give the calls any value to their buyers. The strategy works best with 'short-dated' options that expire six to eight weeks after they are sold, since research has shown that the stock market rarely rallies by 5 per cent to 7 per cent in most 45- to 60-day periods. The call writer faces a loss only if the market rallies and throws the options 'into the money' by expiration. The strategy is best applied using flexible exchange options, or 'flex' options, a product introduced to the world by the Chicago Board Options Exchange in early 1993. Flex options are the exchange's answer to competition from over-the-counter structured instruments. They allow traders to tailor their own options terms, including expiration dates, and have a Dollars 10m minimum transaction size. Until flex options were introduced, all US exchanged-traded options expired either once a month, or quarterly. Index overwriters like Mr Mullen tend to stagger their flex options call writing to ensure a steady stream of premium income, making just about any day an options expiration day. When conditions are right, options expirations present sophisticated derivatives traders with attractive arbitrage opportunities. This was best observed in the late 1980s, when the 'triple witching' quarterly expirations of stock index futures, stock options, and stock index options often caused the US stock market to pitch and roll in the final hour of that day's trading. Regulators tamed those quarterly events by staggering the expiry times of the three types of instruments, and the New York Stock Exchange began publishing lists of stocks for which there are derivatives-related order imbalances on any important expiration day. In last week's case, traders say a stock market rally had put the flex options calls that Mr Mullen wrote at the American Stock Exchange close to the money, and that related stock and futures purchases by people on the opposite side of his trade helped stock prices shoot up, causing him to take a loss. Mr Rob Merrilees, a managing partner with G-Bar corporation, a Chicago-based trading firm that specialises in equity-linked derivatives, said that while flex options have become increasingly popular with institutional investors, they are still such a small part of the market that it would be unlikely for them to be to blame for underlying stock market volatility. 'Their size by comparison just pales next to the options and futures that expire on a monthly and quarterly basis,' he says. Mr David Hall, vice-president for institutional marketing at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, says there were flex options contracts representing about Dollars 13.5bn in underlying stock value open at his exchange at the beginning of the week. That is about double the amount represented by the flex products a year ago, and institutional interest continues to grow. Other exchanges, such as the American and Philadelphia Stock Exchanges and the Chicago Board of Trade, have adapted the flex options concept to their own products, and the London International Financial Futures Exchange is seriously considering launching flexible exchange options products.</p>

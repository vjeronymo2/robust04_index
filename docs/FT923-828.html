			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / How to Spend It: New look, new label for Harvey Nichols - The London store's revamped image HARVEY NICHOLS has long been acknowledged as London's one really glamorous store. Others might be bigger, quirkier and less damaging to the pocket but, when it comes to sheer knock-out glamour, there has not been another store to touch Harvey Nichols. The irony has been that in spite of its vertiginous reputation, high-profile customers and royal patronage, it never seemed to produce the kind of figures that its profit-driven masters had in mind. It lost Pounds 3.5m in its last 13 months as part of the Burton Group and it is no secret that Burton was mightily relieved when Dickson Poon, from Hong Kong, took it off its hands for Pounds 57m. The problem now for Dickson Poon is that he has somehow to make his investment pay in some of the worst trading conditions anyone can remember. All the signs are that he does not seem short of ideas. His feet were hardly under the boardroom table before Amanda Verdan, director of fashion buying, was despatched to put together a collection of Harvey Nichols own-label clothing - everything the fashionable woman-about-town might want to wear at affordable prices, was the brief. Last week it hit the Knightsbridge store and this Friday it goes into a new Harvey Nichols store in the Landmark Building in Hong Kong. One does not need to be a business genius to see what Dickson Poon has in mind - if the own-label collection works (and I believe it deserves to) then this just the beginning. Harvey Nichols' label may well be seen in a great many places besides Knightsbridge and Hong Kong. It is, by any standards, a desirable collection - filled with everything the snappy dresser could hope for. All the season's must-have pieces are there - the long sarong, wrap-over skirt in wool crepe, the cigarette pants made out of men's tie material, the long over-sized coat for wearing over the new long skirts, the perfect satin evening trousers, the black cashmere 'bodies'. Amanda Verdan has aimed at the sophisticated woman who has some know-how at putting a wardrobe together. The idea is to build a wardrobe out of classic basics and then to put them together in different ways. There is lots of black and navy and an edited selection of key accessories - the essential beret (see it sketched right), the stunning leather belt with a great big buckle, the man's silk scarf (particularly good in navy and white spotted chiffon), the good handbag. Most of the clothes are meant to be worn with flat shoes or wedged platforms and opaque tights. There are also a few magic pieces which are not essential but for those who can afford them give life and lift to a whole wardrobe. The printed silk coat, (sketched here right) is worth enduring a month of baked bean dinners for. The brown suede jacket may seem expensive at Pounds 600 but given the quality and what it could do for the most basic of wardrobes you could easily kid yourself it is a snip at the price. It is a tight collection, beautifully thought out, so that almost everything in it can be worn in one way or another with other pieces in the range. It is particularly strong on evening wear with lots of sophisticated, seductive little black dresses. Notions of what is affordable, of course, vary - one person's idea of affordability is is another's extravagance. Those used to shopping in High Street stores and middle-market chains will find the prices high. Those accustomed to trawling through the big designer names should be happily surprised. There are satin-backed trousers at Pounds 160, lined wool crepe skirts at Pounds 250, cavalry twill ones at Pounds 150, and an over-sized black or navy coat at Pounds 390. The knitwear - all cashmere with silk and cashmere mixes mooted for the spring - averages Pounds 200 a piece. The dresses are mostly around Pounds 260 and jackets start at Pounds 250. The collection is on sale now on the first floor. Anybody who feels in need of a little help in putting the whole look together should ask for Kim, who is there to help do just that.</p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israel has decided to stop making grants of about $1,000 to Soviet Jews allowed  to emigrate to Israel because many end up in other countries, a government  official said. The grants previously were paid to Soviet Jews in Moscow or  Vienna to help them emigrate, he said. Israel is frustrated that an  overwhelming majority of Soviet Jews given Israeli visas move instead to the  United States. In 1988, only 1,428 of 20,082 Jews who left the Soviet Union  ended up in Israel. The government has been trying to set up flights that will  pass through Romania rather than Austria to prevent emigres from changing  destinations in Vienna.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE POLICE OK 2-YEAR CONTRACT  </P> <P> The Torrance police union on Wednesday approved a new two-year contract, ending  more than two months of tense relations between the union and city officials as  police worked without a contract.  </P> <P> Terms include a 5% cost-of-living increase in the first year and an increase of  4% to 7.5% in the second year, depending on the consumer price index.  </P> <P> Members of the Torrance Police Officers Assn. voted 90 to 39 in favor of the  contract, said President David A. Nemeth. The terms won unanimous approval from  the Torrance City Council Tuesday night.  </P> <P> The last police contract expired July 31. Relations between union leaders and  the council deteriorated after council members rejected an earlier agreement  worked out by negotiators.  </P> <P> In addition to cost-of-living increases, the contract provides special raises  for newly hired officers and a system of graduated salary increases for senior  staff. Thus, the starting salary for new officers will increase from $32,976 to  $37,092, and top-scale salaries for officers with 20 years of experience will  increase from $42,936 a year to $46,032.  </P></p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Here a squiggle, there a wobble: Yesterday's performance by the prime minister suggested not so much a U-turn as a U-squirm Mr John Major's run of ill-fortune continues. He has lost a strategy, forfeited a vision, and now failed to protect a best friend in his cabinet. I will come to the minor matter of Mr David Mellor in a moment. Take the big stuff first. The prime minister has spoken. The government's intentions remain the same: they are as clear as mud. The cabinet's strategy for Europe and the economy looks like a toss-up between two propositions. Either we are in the midst of the mother of all U-turns, or what we heard yesterday will go down as the first squiggle in what is likely to be a prolonged period of wobble. My vote is for the squiggle-wobble theory. Mr Major, whose current mood is described by close colleagues as 'up and down', is, to his credit, sticking to the most important of all the positions he has espoused since arriving at Number 10 Downing Street. He still asserts that Britain must be a participant in the affairs of its continental neighbours. Opening the emergency debate yesterday he rejected the view, held by one or two of the more lunatic anti-European MPs, that it was a mistake to enter the European Community in the first place. He also derided the proposition, common among vintage Euro-enthusiasts, that sooner or later a centralised Europe is inevitable. 'Just as the interests of France or Germany will always come first for them, so the interests of Britain will always come first for us,' he said. 'The third school of thought about Europe is quite different,' he went on. 'It's that it is in the interests of Britain . . . for us to be part of the development of our continent.' This kind of statement, of which there are other examples, might, in happier times, serve to reassert his leadership. So would the promise, firm on first hearing but unfortunately wobbly on close examination, that once an unpredictable set of circumstances has come to pass, the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty will once again be put before the house. 'I do not believe it would be proper for a British prime minister to agree a treaty and then disown it,' said Mr Major. The difficulty with this stout affirmation lies in those unpredictable circumstances. Take, first, the exchange rate mechanism. Mr Major led Britain in two years ago, then suddenly led us out last week. Yesterday he made it clear that he will not advocate re-entry until the other participating countries have done such things, he knows not what, as enable the mechanism to work 'to the benefit of all its members'. These things needed 'careful examination, careful consideration' before a decision to return to membership could be made. That is a squiggle if ever there was one. In July he set a single obstacle to ratification of the Maastricht treaty. There must first be a solution to the Danish veto. Now he has added a further obstacle, the incorporation into the treaty of a protocol on subsidiarity. A clear wobble. Thus the effect of a speech that contained passages worthy of the best in Mr Major was diluted by the surrender of such territory as the Conservative anti-Europeans are deemed to have captured for the duration. It did not sound like a U-turn, more like a U-squirm. The prime minister's performance was not enhanced by the opening remarks, which amounted to a list of excuses, made all the more piquant by references to 'my formidable predecessor'. It is hardly surprising that the Conservatives did not rise to their feet to cheer. Only a scattering of order papers was waved. The hostility of some of the Tory backbenchers was evident from both their questions and the insulting tone in which they were put; one questioner had to be reminded by Mr Major that he had fought the recent election on the Conservative manifesto. Those who fear a U-turn on the strategy for the economy will find similar obfuscation in yesterday's debate. The prime minister told the Commons that his administration would still fight for low inflation, albeit outside the European exchange rate mechanism. He stood by Mr Norman Lamont, declaring: 'I take full responsibility for the actions and policies of my chancellor.' The trouble here is that no one has any reason to believe what Mr Lamont says any more. My own view, from some knowledge of both of them, is that Mr Major and Mr Lamont sincerely intend to maintain the reduction of inflation as the lodestar by which economic policy is guided. They will not, however, be believed by the markets until their actions demonstrate the truth of their words. So far their one action, an interest rate cut, has been in the direction of fostering growth, not bearing down on inflation. Now for Mr Mellor. Shortly after the prime minister sat down yesterday the news came through that the heritage secretary, known as the 'minister for fun', had resigned. In the battle with the tabloids, the prime minister lost. He had made more than one statement of steadfast support for his close friend, who had been caught in an act of adultery, for which he should not have had to resign, and hounded over stories about his acceptance of hospitality, which would not have been pursued if there had been no adultery to oil the lubricious word processors of the popular papers. The question now is whether this is a sufficient blood-sacrifice for a public that has wanted to see at least one member of the government topple in the light of all the disturbing news of the past 10 days. Is Mr Mellor's head to lie on the scaffold that might have dispatched Mr Lamont? We can only ask the question. The proposition that Mr Lamont will not be next rests more on his own purposeful build-up of a power base within the party than on Mr Major's stated determination to protect the colleague who helped him become leader of the party. That is not the end of the tale of prime ministerial woe. The new leader of the Labour party has emerged from his Trappist period and shown that when he has a man in his open sights in a clear field he has no hesitation in mowing him down. This Mr John Smith did mercilessly yesterday, with an easy command of the house that Mr Major can only dream of. They listen even when Mr Smith speaks in a low voice for dramatic effect; Mr Major has to shout above the hubbub. The Labour leader, who has positioned himself solidly on Mr Major's pre-devaluation European strategy, contented himself with displaying his forensic skills and his talent for knockabout comedy. It lacked substance, but was strong on entertainment value. Mr Major and Mr Lamont may content themselves with the observation that in their last contest with Mr Smith, in April, it was they who won. They (or at least Mr Major) can look forward to four more years of office before taking him on again. A simple U-turn would ensure that they coast to victory next time. All Mr Lamont has to do is betray his own deep instincts and stoke up a Lamont boom to stand in history alongside the Barber and Lawson booms. He will not mean to, but the temptation must be strong. The likely result: wobble.</p>

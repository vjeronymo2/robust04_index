Its number of Senate  members rose from 22 to 31, and in the Chamber of  Representatives, where up until now it had 50 representatives,  it will now have 59.    These results, added to the fact the party has been  consolidated as the nation's second leading political force, are  a cause of satisfaction for its directors, and it has them  thinking once again that the possibility of attaining the  Presidency is very close.    "We are united, and leadership under Andres Pastrana has  generated enthusiasm among the voters. The results are now  becoming evident," stated Eugenio Merlano, secretary general of  the National Conservative Directorate [DNC].    He has also hailed the fact Fabio Valencia Cossio,  conservative leader from Antioquia and one of Pastrana's main  supporters, had obtained the second highest number of votes in  the nation.    The conservative leaders interpret this fact as a bow to the  good work Antioquia Governor Juan Gomez Martinez and Medellin  Mayor Luis Alfredo Ramos Botero are carrying out.    The conservatives' optimism is based on the fact that almost  all of their candidates were elected. All five candidates  presented for the Senate by the New Democratic Force, a movement  from which Andres Pastrana rose, were elected.    The sole exception was the National Salvation Movement,  which  although it obtain two senate seats, only garnered one  representative in the Chamber of Representatives.    It was surprising that the parliamentaries closer to Andres  Pastrana, including Fabio Valencia, were the ones who obtained  some of the highest number of votes in the nation, as did Jorge  Hernandez Restrepo, Claudia Blum, and Gustavo Galvis.

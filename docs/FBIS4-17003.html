			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Military desk report: "...And Morale in the Barracks Is </F> Steadily Growing"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Plus or Minus Half A  Million    Not so long ago in an interview with ARGUMENTY I FAKTY,  Colonel General Dmitriy Volkogonov, former military adviser to  the Russian Federation president, said that the numerical  strength of the Russian Army stood at 1.8 million men. Soon  afterward Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Federation  Armed Forces General Staff, in an interview with SEGODNYA,  claimed that there are 2.1 million men in the Russian Army.  Literally the next day Defense Minister Pavel Grachev stated at  a press conference in the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense  that there are 2,341,000 men in the Russian Armed Forces.    Such acute discrepancies are today the object of serious  analysis by many Russian and foreign military experts. In the  main two conclusions can be drawn from the analytical materials:  Either Russia's top generals do not know the true state of  affairs, or they are deliberately bluffing, misleading both the  "enemy" and the authorities so as to extort as much money as  possible for military needs. In favor of the latter hypothesis  is the fact that CIA Director James Woolsey recently told the  U.S. Congress that, according to data compiled by all branches  of U.S. intelligence and verified many times over, the numerical  strength of the Russian Armed Forces as of the beginning of 1994  stood at 1,554,000 men.  <H5>  Our Military-Industrial Complex Reaches the Republic of </H5> South Africa    A large group of engineers and designers from the Russian  military-industrial complex set off 17 April on a TU-204  aircraft for Johannesberg. The aim of the trip is to  participate in the international air show "Aviation Africa  1994." This will be the first time that Russia has been  represented on such a large scale in the RSA [Republic of South  Africa]: from major defense enterprises to the Tupolev,  Beriyev, Mikoyan, and Kamov firms. What, were our weapons in  short supply only in the RSA?    "Let me stress: The exhibition is a purely civilian affair.  We are not taking any military items to the RSA, especially  since no one has lifted the corresponding UN embargo," E.  Neymark, chief of the Russian Federation Committee for the  Defense Sectors of Industry Aviation Industry Main Directorate  said. "The only real exhibit that we are presenting is the  TU-204; the rest are models, artillery boards, and video  trailers. We hope that our participation in the air show will  promote Russian aviation technology and know-how on the South  African market."    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] But aren't you afraid? More than 10  Russians who went to an air show in Chile recently were robbed  on the streets, and one was almost shot.    [Neymark] You can get shot in Moscow too -- it's no big  deal. And anyway, two of our people are already there; they  phoned recently: Everything is quiet, the Germans, Americans,  and French have confirmed their participation. We will be  flying back 26 April, the day before the [South African]  elections. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Mission in Beijing </H5>   M. Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces  General Staff, visited China last week. The aims and results of  the visit are shrouded in secrecy. However, according to  certain information, in addition to talks on additional arms  deliveries, the general tried to dispel Beijing's extreme  caution over Russia's signing of the NATO "Partnership for  Peace" program, now in preparation, and also over plans to build  the "Svobodnyy" Space Center near the Chinese border. Did he  manage to reassure the Chinese, and if so, at what price?  <H5>  "Land Reform" in the Ministry of Defense </H5>   KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA has learned that a major furor has  erupted over the publication in a newspaper of the scandal over  the "land reform" of Grachev aide General Ivanov. As a result  of the reform around 100 land plots intended for officials of  the military department's central apparatus have disappeared  somewhere. Early on Saturday morning Grachev had a stern talk  with Ivanov, after which the Ministry of Defense threw all its  efforts into composing a refutation. There is so far no talk of  any investigation.

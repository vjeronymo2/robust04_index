			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / International Company News: Institutions optimistic on prospects and equities A MAJORITY of institutional investors believe the UK equities market to be the most attractive investment prospect on a 12 month view over other markets, and many remain confident about prospects for the UK economy, according to a survey published today. The monthly Smith New Court/Gallup survey of fund managers reveals that a balance of 77 per cent of institutions (the difference between those institutions that are positive and those that are negative) remain bullish on UK equities over the next 12 months; against a balance of 56 per cent in favour other European markets; 50 per cent positive on the Japanese market and a mere 4 per cent that favour the US market. A balance of 22 per cent of those polled plan to increase their holdings of UK equities this month, up sharply from 7 per cent the previous month, with 56 per cent favouring the FT-SE 250 stocks while 37 per cent prefer to limit investments to the FT-SE 100. Overall, institutions continue to be optimistic about economic recovery and inflation, and many continue to expect a cut in interest rates.</p>

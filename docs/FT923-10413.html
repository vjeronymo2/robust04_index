			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Lasmo beats forecasts and maintains interim dividend LASMO, the UK independent oil company, yesterday confounded its critics by maintaining its interim dividend and showing a substantial increase in profits in its first results since the Pounds 1.1bn takeover of rival oil company Ultramar last December. Pre-tax profits in the first six months of 1992 increased more than five-fold to Pounds 72m, compared with Pounds 13m in the same period in 1991  -although the company effectively doubled in size with the integration of Ultramar. Profit after tax was Pounds 26m - above analysts' forecasts of between a Pounds 10m profit and a Pounds 10m loss. However, profits were flattered by Lasmo's decision to capitalise Pounds 22m of interest charges relating to the Ultramar downstream assets which were recently floated. Without similar factors in the second half, analysts said, the outlook for full-year earnings - and the dividend  - remained pessimistic. The shares yesterday gained 1p to 134p. Mr Chris Greentree, chief executive, said the results showed the company's potential now that Ultramar's downstream assets had been disposed of and the upstream assets integrated into Lasmo. He said pessimistic City earnings forecasts overlooked the strong contribution from Lasmo's Indonesian interests, inherited from Ultramar. Average production reached 184,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of more than 100,000 b/d. Turnover more than doubled to Pounds 297m, in spite of the fall in the average sterling oil price from Pounds 10.63 a barrel to Pounds 10.33. Earnings per share rose to 3p, compared with a 1.4p per share loss. The interim dividend was held at 2.3p, although Mr Greentree warned that while Lasmo's long-term policy was to maintain dividends in real terms, future payouts would depend on operating results, and, particularly, on the sterling oil price. Net debt fell to Pounds 914m after the disposal of the downstream assets which generated Dollars 1bn (Pounds 530m), taking gearing to 80 per cent. Further disposals, including Ultramar's US upstream assets, shipping fleet, and the second half of Lasmo's holding in Lasmo Canada, together with non-core assets in the North Sea, are expected to generate around Dollars 350m over the next 18 months.

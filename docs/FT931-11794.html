			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: PolyGram in UK video purchase POLYGRAM, the music company 80 per cent owned by Philips of the Netherlands, has bought the UK operations of Vision Video from General Electric Capital of the US. The acquisition of the company, which sells videos to retailers, makes PolyGram the UK's leading supplier of videos for the 'sell-through' market, ahead of the BBC. Vision Video was originally part of Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group, but has had several owners since. PolyGram is believed to be paying Fl 10m (Dollars 5.5m) for the company, mostly through the assumption of debt. According to the Gallup market research and polling organisation, PolyGram last year took 7.7 per cent of the UK market in 'sell-through' videos in value terms. 'Sell-through' involves customers buying, rather than renting films. Vision Video had a 4.9 per cent market share. The combined total would put the enlarged group ahead of the BBC, which was the 1992 market leader with a 10.5 per cent share.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Scandal casts shadow over autonomy for Bank of Spain Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, should be celebrating that the institution he has run for nearly two years has gained a Bundesbank-like independence. Instead he is picking up the broken crockery caused by the scandal involving his predecessor Mr Mariano Rubio. 'The public seems to think that everyone in the Bank of Spain is under suspicion,' says Mr Rojo with a stab at humour. The situation clearly infuriates this intense academic who held the chair of economic theory at Madrid University before he joined the bank to set up its research department in the 1970s. The fallout from the Rubio affair is reflected in the Bank of Spain autonomy statute that was approved by the Spanish parliament on Thursday. The legislators introduced amendments to the draft law that subject portfolio investments by senior central bank officials to strict guidelines and supervision. Mr Rubio was coincidently released on Pta15m (Pounds 72,400) bail after spending two weeks in prison on the same day that the Bank of Spain gained its independence. He is being investigated for tax evasion and insider dealing in connection with a Pta115m stock market portfolio that was managed for him by the failed Ibercorp financial services group in the late 1980s when he was the central bank governor. Mr Rojo says that what the public has not fully understood is that the probity of the bank of Spain as an institution outweighs by far whatever scams might be conducted by those who sat a given moment might represent it. 'Supposing (the allegations about Mr Rubio) are true; the mechanisms of the Bank of Spain are such that whatever frailties and temptations its governor might have will be neutralised,' says Mr Rojo. 'It is extraordinarily difficult for a senior official to favour a financial institution and get away with it.' Mr Rojo argues that the scandal surrounding Ibercorp, a bank which sought out fashionable wealthy clients, and the former governor, bears out his point; it was a Bank of Spain inspection of Ibercorp's assets, when Mr Rubio was still governor, that prevented a proposed merger within the group and prompted its collapse - and Mr Rubio's ruin. He concedes, however, that it might take time to restore the bank's credibility. It irks Mr Rojo that the scandal dominated the headlines last month just at the time when the central bank was successfully concluding the rescue of Banesto, the troubled banking group whose board he peremptorily dismissed on the grounds of gross mismanagement. Mr Rojo does however have now a golden opportunity to project the Bank of Spain's virtues as well as his own professionalism. In line with the Maastricht treaty's provisions for central bank autonomy, the bank has the responsibility for setting monetary policy and Mr Rojo becomes the effective guardian of price stability. It is clear that he relishes the prospect and is undeterred by potential conflicts with politicians. 'Our basic priority may not necessarily be to create employment. Our job is to ensure price stability and that is an objective that hardly anyone in politics is interested in.' He hopes to raise the bank's image through 'open government' procedures that will include detailed progress reports on inflation and regular appearances before parliament's economy and finance committee. He would also like to follow the example of Bank of England governor Mr Eddie George and have formal meetings with the economy and finance minister at which minutes are taken and subsequently made public. 'At the moment the minister and I just talk on the phone and see each other informally, perhaps twice a week, when we have the time to do so. I like Eddie George's initiative with the Chancellor of the Exchequer but it depends on my minister here liking it too.'</p>

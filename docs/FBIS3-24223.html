The  aforementioned document apparently can be viewed as the  manifestation of a rather traditional trend among the leadership  of the republic of late to significantly correct, and even to  reduce entirely to nothing, ideas that were popular a year or  two back, which were implemented at a declaratory level and as a  rule not developed either juridically or practically. One of  these is the idea of creating free economic zones as one of the  basic factors in the formation of an export orientation for the  republic.    The president's edict is commented on for PANORAMA by Rust  Zholamanov, manager of the Strategic Economic Development  Department of the Strategic Research Institute under the  President of the Republic of Kazakhstan.    "Our institute recommended that the government adopt this  measure, based on a number of factors. We will start with the  fact that free economic zones presuppose a special tax policy,  customs system, and principles of investment. None of this, as  we know, was worked out. Moreover, the free economic zones in  Kazakhstan encompass territories that are too big, and when you  consider that there were nine of them in the republic and that  they were formed on the basis of oblasts, as a result, the  question goes beyond a strictly economic scope, taking on a  political nuance--the territorial integrity of Kazakhstan could  be threatened. It will be recalled that in its time the breakup  of the USSR began precisely with the idea of regional economic  accountability, which was implemented with great success by the  Baltic republics. It was so great that they were the first to  leave the Union system as a result.    "The free economic zones not only assume the existence of a  definite technological infrastructure--international  communications centers, hotel complexes, and transportation  support--but they also must have commodity or technological  potential for access to both foreign and domestic markets.    "And, finally, there is no strategy as such in Kazakhstan  for  the development of free economic zones.    "Our institute is now preparing a concept for a republic  regional policy that develops a version of the mechanism for  managing regions in general and an optimal formation of free  economic zones in particular."</p>

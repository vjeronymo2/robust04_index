			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (14): Confidence in UK regions The venture capital sector in Britain's regions has a self-confidence bred by its close connections with the areas in which it operates. There is no substitute, argue those with offices in the country's leading provincial cities, for being part of the business community in which they are seeking investment opportunities. Unsurprisingly, this view is not supported by firms like Charterhouse Development Capital, which has opted to target Yorkshire, the Midlands and south-west England by setting up dedicated teams based in London, but commuting constantly to the regions - 'we're only two hours from London to Leeds by train,' says the firm. In contrast, Barclays Development Capital which in 1987 had only a London office has since opened in Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and Reading; 70 per cent of its new investments are made by these regional offices. 'In our view, key intermediaries such as accountants have built up significant corporate finance expertise in the regions and by being in the same centres as they are we feel we offer a faster, more responsive service,' says Mrs Catherine Wall, the Leeds-based regional director for eastern England from Lincolnshire to the Tweed, plus Cumbria. In illustration of how regional expertise has developed, she cites last year's MBO of Leyland Trucks, the Pounds 150m annual turnover Lancashire truck assembly plant. The deal was advised and funded from Leeds. 'A few years ago, a deal of this size and complexity would have been handled in London,' says Mrs Wall. Some regionally-based venture capitalists feel their forte remains deals under Pounds 10m, but Mr Charles Richardson, corporate affairs manager of 3i, which has 17 offices outside London, says there has been a continuing trend towards medium sized and larger deals gravitating to regional offices  -'over the last five years we've moved a lot of technical expertise into regional offices; the net has widened.' Stoy Hayward Manchester now publishes an annual Guide to Venture and Buy-out Capital in the north west; the 1994 edition is due out imminently. Mr Ian Templeton, Manchester-based senior partner in charge of corporate finance, has noticed an increase in the number of accountancy firms claiming expertise in venture and development capital 'possibly because there is very little growth in the core activities of audit and tax which is forcing them to look elsewhere for business.' Mr Mike Davis, corporate finance partner for Ernst &amp; Young in Manchester, says clients are very interested in what kind of relationship they will have with venture capital investors. This does not necessarily mean choosing a firm with a regional office but it has made London firms anxious to rebut any suggestion they might not be as responsive. The competition between London and the regions 'has hotted up a lot,' says Mr Davis, who adds that accountants are helping venture capitalists by providing better researched and presented proposals for consideration. But he adds: 'We know there's a degree of flexibility, we know they are keen to do deals, we make sure our clients get the best deal.' This wider dissemination of skills in venture capital has contributed to the rather more competitive climate, says Mr Peter Folkman, managing director of North of England Ventures, the Manchester and Middlesbrough based fund which is associated with Schroder Ventures. The industry, he points out, is now maturing. 'It's a whole lot less cosy, it's more like a proper business,' he says. 'To earn our living we are going to have to be a little bit sharper.' The past year has seen funds winning good returns on earlier investments; NEV, for example, is collecting about Pounds 9m from the Pounds 850,000 equity stake it made in 1990 in Cumbrian miniature model-maker Lilliput Lane. But, says Mr Folkman, venture capitalists have done fewer new deals than they would have liked. In this more competitive market, he sees a developing trend, in which he is participating, of venture capitalists going out much more pro-actively to bid as principals for companies. Competition is likely to be stiffened by the sharp increase recorded by the BVCA in new money raised this year for venture capital investment. The BVCA says the UK regions accounted in 1993 for 64 per cent of the number of companies receiving venture capital funding. So far this year it has recorded an upturn in England and Wales, whilst the Scottish market is reported to be 'relatively flat,' although with some signs of improvement. Some venture capitalists say the number of deals regionally so far this year has been relatively stable, or even increasing. Mr Alistair Conn, managing director of Newcastle-based Northern Venture Managers, says 1994 has been busier than 1993, although mid-1994 dipped a little. In northern England and Scotland, he says, the peaks and the troughs are flatter than in London and the south east. Mrs Wall at Barclays Development Capital says its investments are running at around double last year's level, and 3i notes its local offices are much busier than they were - 'my impression is that the regions have picked up faster than London and the south-east,' says Mr Richardson. Despite this bullish tone, there is some surprise that the presumed uplift from recession has not brought a stronger demand for capital for investment in organic growth rather than acquisitions. Confidence, it seems, is still fragile. 'A lot of companies are contemplating deals, far more are contemplating rather than doing them because people are still being cautious,' says Mr Davis of Ernst &amp; Young. For one new regional venture capital initiative, the Midland Enterprise Funds, 1994 is a milestone; by the year end, all its 11 funds in England and Wales will have begun operating.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 4 April HOMMIKULEHT, p 1; "News Bulletin" No. 63/94] </F>   [Text] The Estonian Interior Ministry is interested in  bilateral cooperation agreements with Russia concerning  operations against crime, Interior Minister Heiki Arike said.  But he added that Estonia will not sign agreements concerning  all CIS states.    Arike added that he had discussed the need for continued  negotiations with Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Trofimov  recently. He hoped that the talks between ministries will lead  to an agreement between the governments.    Russia had so far favoured only agreements signed within the  CIS framework and concerning all member states, Arike explained.  He said that the Interior Ministry is cooperating efficiently  with Finland, Sweden, Germany, Great Britain and Italy.</p>

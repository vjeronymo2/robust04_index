			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Britain signals EU climbdown: Whips warn of possible backbench rebellions from Euro-sceptics The British government yesterday signalled that it was prepared to compromise over its power to block Brussels legislation ahead of today's meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Brussels. Downing Street officials indicated that Britain may not veto a rise in the number of votes needed to block legislation from 23 to 27 to prevent it being blamed for jeopardising the Union's enlargement. Agreement by Britain to compromise would allow successful negotiations on the entry into the EU of Sweden, Finland and Austria to be approved by the European Parliament and help smooth the few remaining obstacles to Norwegian entry into the Union. The signs of movement in London were welcomed by European Commission officials in Brussels last night. Without a compromise by Britain and Spain, who oppose increasing the number of votes required to block decisions by the EU Council of Ministers, Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway will be unable to join the EU by next January. However, government business managers are worried about possible backbench rebellions by Euro-sceptic MPs and have warned ministers of the difficulty of getting legislation through the House of Commons if they agree to compromise. At present the blocking minority is 23 votes out of the total of 76, distributed between the 12 members. After enlargement, with the entry of Austria, Norway, Finland and Sweden, it is proposed that the blocking minority would increase to 27 votes out of a new total of 90. But Britain may have been attracted by a Spanish proposal which would allow the blocking vote to rise to 27 once the new members join the EU, while maintaining a further blocking vote at 23 provided a maximum of three countries made up the 23 votes. That would keep the status quo intact and allow two large EU members and one small one - with a combined population of at least 100m - to block decisions, possibly until an EU intergovernmental conference in 1996 when voting weights could be renegotiated. But as Mr John Major last night met Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, to finalise Britain's negotiating position, leading Conservative Euro-sceptics said they would oppose any 'climbdown'. Mr William Cash, one of the leading Euro-sceptics, said the Commons would not put up with 'more erosion' of its powers. However, faced with the choice of another dispute with its European partners or its Euro-sceptics, Whitehall officials predicted the government would pick the latter as long as it was confident of limiting any backbench rebellion. Mr John Major's officials said the prime minister was determined to defend British interests 'in an enlarged Community and get enlargement'. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office last night said that it had not received any acceptable offer over the size of the blocking veto, but underlined its commitment to enlargement. Another official predicted that 'a compromise of some sort will emerge'. Senior British officials in Brussels signalled over two weeks ago that they could live with the Spanish formula, although, formally, they were yesterday insisting there was no change in London's position. Nevertheless, Spanish negotiators are depending on UK support, and any likely compromise may take the form of a 'declaration' by the 12. Anything more binding risks being turned down by the European Parliament, which is refusing to ratify the new members' accession treaty if the 12 make it too easy for a minority of member states to block Euro-laws.

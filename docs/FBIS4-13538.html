			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-MUSAWWAR in Arabic on 8 April  publishes on pages 34-36 an approximately 3,000-word article by  Dr. Muhammad Nur Farhat under the headline "Al-Azhar and Control  on Thought." The author discusses al-Azhar's authority to  license or reject artistic, literary, and intellectual works  dealing with Islamic affairs against the backdrop of a ruling on  the subject issued by the State Council's General Assembly for  Fatwa and Legislation. He expresses fear that this may lead to  "an institutionalized religious authority imposing hegemony over  thought."    The writer notes that the ruling was issued amid "a  noticeable rise in the voice of the political Islam trend in all  its factions." He says: "While representatives of the Islamic  trend claimed trusteeship over us in our religious affairs,  accusing whoever they wanted of blasphemy and depriving whoever  they wanted of God's mercy, the official religious  establishment, represented by al-Azhar, recently stepped forward  to announce its right to impose this trusteeship by virtue of,  first, its legitimacy, and second, its religious knowledge and  competence."    Refuting the legal justification on which the State Council  based its ruling--namely, protection of society's general order  of which Islam is a pillar--the writer says: "Our society,  although Islam is the official religion of the state, is  actually based on religious pluralism and its Constitution  guarantees freedom of religion and creed." He adds: "The first  article of the civil law made Islamic shari'ah a source of law  after two other sources--legislation and tradition." He says  explanations and comments from the legal community made it clear  that "the principles of Islamic shari'ah meant as a source of  law are those comprehensive principles that fit the social and  cultural bases of Egyptian society throughout its development."    The writer argues that giving al-Azhar exclusive authority  to  pass official rulings concerning the concept of general order  when it comes to Islamic affairs "will lead to extremely serious  legal consequences if this logic is stretched to its limits."  He explains: "For example, since Article Two of the  Constitution states that Islamic shari'ah is the main source of  legislation, and since al-Azhar, as the State Council's ruling  contended, is the only party that shall give binding opinions on  Islamic affairs, it becomes constitutionally necessary to take  al-Azhar's opinion on all our legislations before they are  passed. This will turn al-Azhar, thanks to the State Council's  fatwa [ruling], from a deep-seated religious institute and a  great establishment for preserving shari'ah into a controller of  legislative authority in the country." According to this logic,  the writer adds: "Al-Azhar may also control the judicial  authority because the idea of general order, on which the fatwa  was based, is penetrating most of our judicial system."    The writer concludes: "If al-Azhar, according to this fatwa,  takes over the authorities of legislation and the judiciary, the  thing feared by all nationalists concerned about Egypt's future  and democracy, even some supporters of the Islamic trend  themselves, will happen--Egypt, with its executive, legislative,  and judicial authorities, will turn into a religious state. Its  decisionmaking will be in the hands of a religious establishment  with indisputable rulings--something that neither Egypt nor any  other Islamic country has known throughout its history, except  during the Ottoman era."    Finally, the writer says: "The nature of the binding  religious control the fatwa is giving to al-Azhar must lead to a  society closing its doors to culture, thought, and creativity."  He wonders: "If creative people, under the valid law, can  complain about the decisions of the [administrative] control,  how can they complain about decisions on which al-Azhar has  given a binding opinion? Will complaints in this case mean  religious disobedience and heresy?"</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Invesco plans Dalian fund Invesco, the international fund management group, is planning to launch a fund investing in Dalian, the port and industrial zone in north-east China. Dalian established an economic and technical development zone 10 years ago, and has attracted more than 3,000 foreign enterprises. Last year it processed imports and exports worth more than Dollars 4.3bn. Invesco Asia has signed a memorandum of understanding with the municipal government of Dalian to set up and manage a fund investing in about 25 unlisted companies in the region. Fund managers have so far narrowed a potential pool of 120 companies down to a short-list of 50. The fund is mostly likely to take the form of a closed-end vehicle, possibly listed in Hong Kong, but that will depend on tax considerations.</p>

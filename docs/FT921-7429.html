			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Appointments: More leisurely life in view Jonathan Bodlender, chairman of Horwath Consulting, which provides advice on hotels and tourism, is to reduce the work he does for the firm and spend more time on projects of his own. Although Bodlender is only 53 he believes that full-time leisure consultancy, with weekends filled with work and travel, is for younger men and women. He has retired as a partner of Stoy Hayward, the accountancy firm which owns Horwath. He will continue to be Horwath's non-executive chairman and will also be doing some consulting work outside the firm. He recently became a special adviser on tourism investment to the World Tourism Organisation.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Tokyo risks Beijing anger over Taiwan Japan yesterday courted Chinese displeasure for the second time in a month, by announcing plans to hold its first formal ministerial meeting with Taiwan in 22 years. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's minister of international trade and industry, is to meet Mr Chiang Ping-kun, Taiwan's economics minister, in Osaka on Saturday, in the margins of a conference on small businesses in Asia. The move is the latest in a series of recent examples of Japan's search for a more self-assertive foreign policy line. On this occasion, Tokyo's confidence could be a reflection of the fact that China is seeking the renewal and enlargement of a six-year Y800bn (Pounds 5.2bn) programme of Japanese government loans, ending in 1996. Tokyo showed itself prepared to confront Beijing on the same issue of relations with Taiwan earlier this month, when it allowed Mr Hsu Li Teh, Taiwan's deputy prime minister, to visit the Asian games in Hiroshima. Mr Hsu ignored his hosts' requests to keep a discreet profile and met politicians from the ruling Liberal Democratic party. Officially, Mr Hashimoto and Mr Chiang will talk about small business policy, in an attempt to present the meeting as politically uncontroversial. Miti officials said they believed China would have no grounds to object, since Mr Hashimoto will also meet counterparts from China, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Indonesia. They will attend the conference in their capacity as members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum. Japan cut formal diplomatic links with Taiwan in 1972, when it opened relations with China, thereby implying acceptance of China's belief that Taiwan is part of China. Yet there is an influential pro-Taiwan faction in the Japanese government.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (7): All that you need, almost - Doing Business in China / New guide lacks a full overview Doing Business With China Consultant Editor: Jonathan Reuvid Kogan Page, Pounds 75 120 pages Everybody in business knows by now that there are huge opportunities in China. The country's ambitious economic reforms have, in the past two years, brought extraordinarily rapid economic growth and a deluge of foreign investment. Even if there are setbacks along the way, the Chinese market is one that companies increasingly will have to reckon with. Its openness, however, does not mean that it is at all easy. Any dealings with China, whether import/export or involving deeper co-operation, require a combination of perseverance, flexibility and hard-won knowledge. The effort seems to be worthwhile. Companies which have built up a presence continue to want to expand. The pay-back may take some time - although it need not always - but the combination of a massive domestic market, which has rapidly growing demands and expectations, and a cheap, bounteous, enthusiastic and educated labour force, is compelling. So, you've read all this before but still feel understandable trepidation about making an exploratory trip. Doing Business With China  - to be published on July 19 - is a laudable attempt to put all the things you need to know into one practical (though large) volume. It is aimed at businesses everywhere. The book covers most of the issues that are likely to be of immediate concern: trade practices and regulations; different types of venture allowed and how they work; currency regulations; customs duties and their operation; tax; accounting; employment issues; copyright; disputes resolution; quality assurance. These issues listed are covered in a straightforward and coherent manner, mainly by the law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie, accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Mr Li Yong, a market research expert with the Centre for Market and Trade Development, an official body in Beijing. A few caveats. The economic and trade reforms are quite well described, mostly by Chinese officials. But the book lacks a full overview from outside of what still needs to be done to further economic reforms and to smooth the path of foreign investors. Some of the most politically difficult tasks remain to be tackled. A foreign company needs at least to have a sense of them before embarking on a venture with a company which may face radical restructuring as the 'iron rice bowl' is broken. And although the book is clearly designed as a business handbook that steers clear of politics, it seems perverse not to provide an account of how the political system and government work. The 'socialist market economy' may not have much to do with socialism, but China is still run by a totalitarian government and a large part of the economy remains state-run. Many foreign joint ventures are with official bodies. Though the book has lists and statistics aplenty, it needs more maps and more details about transport. But it does contain some useful tips about how to conduct oneself in China, such as not insulting contacts by giving presents bearing the image of a turtle.  This section is one of the most useful, underlining the importance of building up personal contacts. The authors would not pretend that you can learn everything about doing business in China from a book. Contacts, investigation of the right partner, patient negotiation are all vital. Each venture is different. Agreement of deals is not the signal to relax. Each requires vigilance and, in the event of disputes, the procedures for resolution - although they exist - are hardly reliable. As the book points out, friendly negotiation is necessary. The fact that the book is needed shows the shortcomings of China's legal system, its macro-economic management, its bureaucratic control. But it also underlines the extraordinary breadth and ambition of China's reformers who are pushing ahead on so many fronts simultaneously. Doing Business in China will need regular new editions to remain useful.</p>

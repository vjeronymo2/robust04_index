			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (7): Rolling back the boundaries of the state - Privatisations Privatisation will contribute to creating an economic democracy that is more solid and, above all, free from political abuse,' Mr Carlo Azeglo Ciampi wrote at the end of last year in a pamphlet explaining the benefits of selling state assets. Mr Ciampi, who headed the government between April 1993 and May this year, had been a firm privatisation supporter when governor of the Bank of Italy. 'The nature and size of the public sector's presence in the economy need to be changed drastically,' he told the central bank's annual meeting in May 1991. Mr Ciampi noted that the sale of public assets is not simply a means of resolving the problem of debt and debt servicing. He said: 'Disposals must relieve the state of the burden of activities that are not its proper concern.' When Mr Ciampi became prime minister, the process of shedding this burden had already been started by Mr Giuliano Amato, his predecessor. A decree issued by Mr Amato's government in July 1992 was the first serious step in rolling back the boundaries of the state, which in Italy had encroached deeply into many areas of the economy. The highly diversified business empire that Mr Amato's government inherited included ice cream and confectionery making, hotels, bars and supermarkets, as well as machinery manufacture, chemicals, steelmaking, banking and insurance. The decree transformed the large holding corporations, IRI and ENI, the electricity corporation Enel, and the state insurer INA into joint stock corporations, with share capital owned by the Treasury. Transformation brought the state corporations into line with the form of private sector companies. Under pressure to demonstrate privatising credentials, from financial markets that had watched the lira's enforced exit from the European exchange rate mechanism, Mr Amato did not wait long. Two months after the decree, in mid-September 1992, he announced that the controlling interests of IRI in Credito Italiano and ENI in turbine and pump maker Nuovo Pignone would be sold. Italian privatisation was under way. Since then there have been numerous plans, programmes, administrative and legislative steps, formal opinions and directives dealing with privatisation. Conference organisers have been kept busy. Volumes have been written and spoken. What results have been achieved since September 1992? On the financial side, the figures show that IRI has received a little over L6,000bn from disposals of shareholdings and ENI about L3,200bn. In addition, the Treasury has received about L7,000bn from sales of shareholdings owned directly. Although he got privatisation underway, Mr Amato was no longer prime minister when the first important operation was completed. Mr Ciampi's government oversaw the transfer of Credito Italiano from IRI to wider ownership last December. Investor enthusiasm was such that the operation, in which IRI sold its 64 per cent stake of ordinary stock, was more than eight times over-subscribed. The public offering in Credito Italiano, a bank already enjoying stock market quotation, was quickly followed by the initial public offer of shares in IMI, the Rome banking and financial services group. In this operation, also heavily over-subscribed, the Treasury halved its direct and indirect stake of 59 per cent. IRI's Banca Commerciale Italiana completed last winter's trio of banking privatisations when the state holding corporation sold its 54 per cent interest at the end of February. This spring brought a pause in privatisation operations of interest to the general public. It was broken by the first privatisation under Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing government, which also made its mark as Italy's biggest privatisation so far. At the end of June, the Treasury sold 53 per cent of wholly-owned INA, thereby raising L4,800bn. Italian privatisations that have created, or broadened, wide share ownership amount to just four. All are financial institutions and the shares of two were already well-known and traded on the stock market before the share offerings were made. Progress might be described as modest. Mr Pietro Ciucci, IRI's finance manager, says, however, that the achievement of disposing of large shareholdings in two leading banks in a period of only three months should not be underestimated. 'The timetable was tight. There was a lot of scepticism. Only with the benefit of hindsight can we say it was easy,' commented Mr Ciucci. He rejects suggestions that IRI has been slow in privatising its industrial activities. Three trade sale operations have been completed over the past two years. Break-up of the SME food and retailing group has allowed IRI to dispose of two divisions. The Italgel ice cream, frozen food and confectionery business was bought by Nestle in August 1993 for L437bn and the Cirio Bertolli De Rica canned vegetables and olive oil business was sold two months later for L311bn. Mr Ciucci is pleased at the out-turn of SME's break-up. He expects that revenues from the sale of the final division, GS-Autogrill food retailing and motorway catering, will be banked by the end of the year. 'The break-up will have allowed IRI to obtain a higher price per share than SME's shares ever reached.' IRI's finance manager also hopes that the sale of the Ilva Laminati Piani steel company will be completed before year-end, thereby registering a second successful withdrawal from steel in six months. The corporation's third industrial trade sale in the past two years was the disposal of Acciai Speciali Terni special steels for L600bn in July. Trade sales have predominated so far in privatisations at the ENI hydrocarbons holding. The principal operation was the disposal of Nuovo Pignone to the US General Electric for L1,100bn, finalised last December. ENI has completed about 60 sales in the past two years. Its Enirisorse sub-holding has shed coal activities in the US and South Africa, as well as copper alloy tubes and secondary aluminium businesses in Italy. The Agip oil subsidiary has sold minority stakes in fields in the US and rights in the North Sea, while the downstream Agip Petroli subsidiary has sold liquefied gas distribution activities in Italy and its Argentinian operations. The Agip hotel-motel chain was an early operation in a deal with the UK's Forte group. In concentrating on its core businesses, ENI has also sold textile machinery makers Matec and Cognetex and a manufacturer of domestic gas heating systems, Caldaie Murali a Gas. Many of Enichem's chemicals activities have been identified as non-core and sold or put up for sale as a result of corporate restructuring. Businesses making rubber and latex synthetics, additives for plastics and auxiliaries for rubber have been sold. So also has the Isagro agricultural pharmaceuticals and seeds subsidiary, in a management buy-out. Trade sales do not contribute to stimulating the stock market or broadening the shareholder base, however. Some 2 1/2 years ago Mr Ciampi said: 'Privatisation of public sector companies will strengthen the market and spread share ownership among savers and institutional investors.' So far, ENI's privatisation operations have done nothing to encourage wider shareholdings. ENI does, however, control a group of companies that are among Italy's most attractive privatisation candidates: Agip (upstream oil and gas), Agip Petroli refining and distribution, and Snam gas trading, transport and distribution. While it is planned that these will be offered to the public, there is disagreement over how they should be offered. Should they be presented as an energy conglomerate, the SuperAgip solution, in a package that would also include the Saipem drilling and pipeline laying business and the Snamprogetti engineering company? Or should they be quoted and sold separately? A plan prepared two years ago proposed that ENI itself should be quoted and sold, after disposal of non-core activities such as Nuovo Pignone, coal, media interests and chemicals. Subsequently the Amato government instructed ENI to present plans for the stock market quotation of Snam, Agip and other candidates for listing, with March 31 1993 as the deadline for completing the task. With the fall of the Amato government, the problem was faced by Mr Ciampi's administration. A directive issued at the beginning of July 1993 required that procedures for selling Agip should be got underway within 30 days. Mr Franco Bernabe', managing director, says that the corporation awaits instructions from the government. Stockbrokers and merchant bankers are not unanimous about how to maximise revenues. Politicians are divided. But whatever the decision, the initial public offering of shares in ENI's energy companies will be an important event for investors, in Italy and outside. So also will be IRI's offering of shares in its quoted telecommunications sub-holding, Stet. As with ENI's energy business, the Stet offering is contentious, with politicians, bankers and industrialists elbowing for advantage. There is more than IRI's L12,000bn interest at stake. Although there are further INA and IMI tranches to come, and Mr Mario Sarcinelli, the new chairman of Treasury-controlled Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, hopes for privatisation within two years, attention is now focused on Italy's infrastructure and industrial privatisations. IRI expects to make an offering of shares in quoted Autostrade, the motorway operator, next year, as well as an initial public offering of shares in Aeroporti di Roma, the Rome airport company. Much more time will be needed to sort out struggling Alitalia, the quoted state airline in which IRI has a 90 per cent stake. 'On Alitalia we will need a convincing story for the market,' remarked Mr Ciucci. Privatisation has been slow. Restrictive conditions on sales, aimed at job preservation, and a deeply ingrained anti-market mentality among many staff whose companies are threatened by privatisation have not helped. On a political level, continuity and unity of purpose have been lacking. Disagreements in the Berlusconi government do little to encourage expectations that a coherent, determined and all-embracing programme will be implemented rapidly.</p>

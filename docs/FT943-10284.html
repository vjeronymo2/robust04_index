			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow drops awaiting jobs figures Wall Street US stocks retreated yesterday ahead of economic data which may influence the timing of the Federal Reserve's next move to tighten credit conditions, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 26.87 down at 3,765.79, its lowest level of the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 3.05 at 458.40. Trading volume on the Big Board amounted to 294m shares. The Nasdaq composite receded 3.51 to 720.18. The session opened on a sour note. Investors were greeted by a piece of economic data which did not bode well for this morning's crucial July employment data. The Labor Department said that initial claims for unemployment benefit had declined by 10,000 last week, suggesting that the economy was moving along at a steady pace. The market was counting on seeing the opposite trend in today's report. Non-farm payrolls in July were expected to show a moderate increase of 200,000 after a sharp rise in June. If the figure came in line with expectations, the Fed might have sufficient cause to delay its next move to lift short-term interest rates. Investors held their jitters in check for most of the session, but the erosion in share prices grew more pronounced near the end of the day. Early on, motor vehicle shares were marked down in reaction to weak July sales data released the previous session. General Motors dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 50 3/8 , Ford Dollars 2 to Dollars 29 1/2 and Chrysler Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 45 3/4 , with Merrill Lynch lowering its ratings on the group. The securities house also downgraded several of their component suppliers. As a consequence, Eaton lost Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 49 3/4 and Dana Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 27. Outside the motor vehicle sector, investors were initially reluctant to make any big moves, but several large cyclical stocks fell sharply in the final hour. International Paper gave back Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 75, General Electric Dollars 1 to Dollars 48 1/2 and Caterpillar Dollars 1 to Dollars 107 5/8 . The release of July sales data by leading retailers failed to generate much enthusiasm or concern, even though most stores showed continued sales improvement. Sears Roebuck slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 47 1/4 and Gap Stores declined Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 37 7/8 . But two electronics retailers were rewarded for their strong sales performances. Best Buy jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 27 1/4 and Circuit City gained Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 22 1/2 . Conrail shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 55 and Norfolk Southern receded Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 63 1/8 after a report that the two railways were discussing a merger. In their initial day of trading, Shandong Hueneng Power Development ADRs finished unchanged at Dollars 14 1/4 on heavy volume of nearly 14m shares. The company is the first Chinese enterprise with a primary listing on the NYSE. Canada Toronto closed on a mixed note after moderate trading. The TSE 300 index lost 3.96 points at 4,202.09, but advances outscored declines by 380 to 345. Volume was 53.7m shares. Seven of the 14 sub-indices rose, led by real estate, up 1.5 per cent. The conglomerates group gained 1.2 per cent as Canadian Pacific put on C 3/8 at CDollars 22 1/2 in the wake of impressive second-quarter financial results announced earlier in the week. Financial services fell 1.3 per cent. Mexico Profit-taking after four straight days of gains brought the market down initially, but demand from foreign investors left a slightly higher finish on balance. The IPC index of 37 leading shares was finally 6.50, or 0.25 per cent, up at 2,573.81. Turnover was a moderate 1.33bn new pesos on 109.3m shares traded. Supporting the market was news that Mexico's industrial production grew 3.1 per cent in May, the second highest monthly increase of the year. The index has gained 362 points, or 16.4 per cent, since July 20, helped by better than expected second-quarter company reports and investor confidence in a victory by the ruling party in the August 21 presidential elections.</p>

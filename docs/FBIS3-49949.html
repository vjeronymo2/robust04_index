			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By diplomatic editor Stevan Cordas; "pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, Jan 20 (TANJUG) -- The agreements reached  between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) and Croatia  and between the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats to begin  normalizing the mutual relations have salvaged the Geneva peace  process and made its resumption on February 10 possible, despite  the fact that the Bosnian Muslims have done everything to  undermine it, according to diplomatic circles in Belgrade.    Diplomatic circles in Belgrade set out on Thursday that the  agreements signed between the F.R.Y. and Croatia and between the  Serb Republic (RS) and Herceg-Bosna in Geneva on Wednesday will  also facilitate the resolution of the conflict in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    According to the same circles, it is extremely important  that  the agreements signed in Geneva proceed from the de facto  situation which is practically becoming a de jure one. The RS  and Herceg-Bosna, the states of the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian  Croats, respectively, have signed the document on the  normalization of relations although they have not  internationally been recognized as sovereign states. At the  same time, Croatia has signed a similar document with the F.R.Y.  which is recognized as a state, although its right to continuity  in relation to the former Socialist Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia is disputed.    It is believed in Belgrade that, by signing the document on  the normalization of relations with the F.R.Y., Croatia has  abandoned the option of war as a means of resolving its  relations with the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK).    It is set out in Belgrade in that context that what is  involved is only the beginning of a normalization process, which  absolutely in no way delves into relations between Zagreb and  the RSK and in no way prejudices the eventual solution. It is  said that the mutual recognition between Belgrade and Zagreb and  the establishment of diplomatic relations between them has most  likely been left for the final stage of the process.    As far as the Bosnian Muslims are concerned, it is obvious  that they have in a way been isolated in Bosnia-Herzegovina  since Wednesday, since their hitherto strategy of insisting on  the war option has totally been defeated.    It is beyond doubt that the Bosnian Muslims will no longer  be  able to use Serbs as an alleged excuse when they sit down at the  negotiating table in Geneva again on February 10. RS President  Radovan Karadzic was right when he said on the eve of the latest  round of the Geneva talks that "nothing will any longer be the  same" in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

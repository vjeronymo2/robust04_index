			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Bulgarian dailies did not come out this morning  and private radio stations interrupted their programs to protest  the plan to impose an 18-percent valued added tax [VAT] on  newspapers. [passage omitted]    At this afternoon's meeting the Governing Board of the  Bulgarian Private Radio Stations Association decided to prolong  the protest actions another 24 hours. Private radio stations  will therefore not resume their programs until 0600 on 30 March.    The association applied for a meeting with Snezhana  Botusharova, deputy chairman of the parliament, at which they  will demand that VAT for commercials be abolished, this being  the private radio stations' only source of income. Regardless  of whether the meeting takes place or not, private radio  stations are resolved to resume their broadcasts the morning of  30 March but to pursue their protest actions in other ways.    Our local correspondents and BTA are reporting that several  local newspapers and local radio stations in Plovdiv, Vratsa,  Sliven, Silistra, and other towns in the country have  interrupted their publications and programs in solidarity with  their colleagues.    At today's meeting the Secretariat of the Bulgarian  Journalists Union once more confirmed its solidarity with the  newspapers and radio stations on the strike against VAT.    In a letter to the parliamentary groups, the Confederation  of  Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria [KNSB] also expressed  support for the demands of the journalists on strike, insisting  that the problem be resolved by 1 April 1994, when VAT comes  into force.    Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov described the  implemented  threat of the newspapers to go on strike as a simple act of  blackmail, as a method of winning compassion and [word  indistinct]. Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov officially declared to  journalists at the Council of Ministers that he is not against  freedom of speech, that he has never prevented anyone one from  writing whatever he wishes, but that he is in favor of everyone  paying his taxes.</p>

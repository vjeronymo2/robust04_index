			<p>SUMMARY                               Apparently reflecting mounting pressure on China's reformers to  moderate the pace of the ambitious new market reforms endorsed by  the Third Plenum of the 14th Central Committee last fall, recent  regulations charting a new role for the State Planning Commission  (SPC) include only modest steps toward limiting the commission to  broad oversight of the economy and fall far short of the  reformers' goal of strictly curbing its direct administrative  authority.  Despite this setback, reformers show no sign of  having modified their goals and will likely continue to press for  market-based changes in the planning system.                        END SUMMARY   Although the new State Council regulations, entitled the "Program  Governing the Disposition of Functions, Establishment of Internal  Organs, and Size of Staff in the State Planning Commission," do  not mandate a sharp reduction in SPC administrative powers as  suggested in the Third Plenum "decision" and leadership  statements last year, they do indicate the reformers' progress in  changing the overall role of the commission.  Announced by Xinhua  on 9 May, the regulations reduce SPC personnel by a third and  embrace the reformist goal of transforming the commission into a  mechanism for strategic planning and setting general industrial  policy.  They call for the SPC to "propose strategic targets and  major . . . policies" for economic development and to "formulate  state industrial policies and coordinate and supervise their  implementation."  The regulations also direct the SPC to provide  more forecasting, monitoring, and analysis of economic conditions  and to generate "economic information."  Underscoring the reform  aspect of the regulations, SPC Vice Minister Gui Shiyong was  quoted in the English-language China Daily on 30 May as claiming  that "planning groups have shifted their function to broad  oversight of the economy" and that the reform "aims to replace  most administrative controls with economic regulations."     Retention of Major Administrative Power     However, despite the inclusion of these reforms, the new  regulations do not appear to significantly limit the SPC's power  over financial policy, development planning, and capital  investment decisions as called for by the plenum and an SPC-  sponsored national planning conference held last December.  In  particular, they are not consistent with the plenum's goal of  shifting responsibility for finance policy and state investment  decisions from the SPC and other planning agencies to state  enterprises and to a reformed banking system.  In addition, the  regulations appear to endorse a continued role for the SPC in  short-term planning.     -- Finance Policy.  With the issuance of the new regulations  Beijing has backed away from previous plans to create  institutional checks on the SPC's role in financial policy.  Under the new regulations, the SPC appears to have overall  authority for financial policy.  According to Xinhua, the  commission will "coordinate" finances, credit, interest rates,  prices, tax rates, exchange rates, and other economic "levers"  (Xinhua, 9 May).  The regulations also called for the SPC to  retain its strong role in price regulation, directing it to  "supervise" and "check" prices and keep the general price level  "under control."  By contrast, the plenum had implicitly endorsed  important limits on the SPC's monopolistic control over finance,  calling for a system in which "planning, banking, and public  finance" are "coordinated" and "mutually check" each other. (16  November 1993).     -- Development Planning.  The regulations also appear to give the  SPC a larger role in the specifics of development planning than  did the planning conference.  According to the 9 May Xinhua  account of the regulations, the SPC is responsible for "long-  term, intermediate, and annual" plans covering a broad range of  economic issues.  By contrast, a Xinhua report on last year's  planning conference stated that the new planning system would  focus on "medium- and long-term planning as the mainstay" (8  December 1993).     -- Investment Decisionmaking.  Finally, the regulations fall  short of the sweeping "investment reform" called for by the  plenum and last year's planning conference, giving the SPC the  authority to determine the "sources" of capital and where that  capital should be invested and to include not just large "key"  state projects in the annual plan but also a variety of other  projects.  By contrast, the plenum had assigned enterprises and  new commercial banks a major role in making investment decisions  in areas not included in large state-funded projects.  In  addition, while the planning conference had said that the state  would continue to "indirectly" determine the total volume of  investment, it had also declared that the market must be given  "full scope" in regulating investment and that enterprises should  enjoy "full authority" in making investment decisions (Xinhua, 8  December 1993).  Moreover, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, in a speech  at the conference, had also promoted the "risk-based" investment  system that had been endorsed at the plenum, which would allow  market principles to play the primary role in investment and  credit allocation (Xinhua, 8 December 1993).     Reformer Resolve on Investment     In an apparent effort to portray the regulations as a temporary  setback in the investment reform timetable rather than an  abandonment of the reformers' goals, SPC Vice Minister Gui  Shiyong, as cited in the 30 May China Daily article, stated that  the government would "gradually withdraw investments" in local  projects.  He also insisted that the new investment system "will  strengthen the responsibility of enterprises as well as banks" in  both "decisionmaking power and risk responsibility."     Leadership Differences     Inconsistent media portrayals of the planning reforms suggest  that the new regulations represent a compromise between backers  of senior leader Deng Xiaoping's sweeping market-based reform  agenda and more cautious central leaders and SPC bureaucrats who  fear destabilizing economic dislocations and loss of power if the  SPC's control is radically altered.  For example, a 9 May report  in Zhongguo Xinwen She, Beijing's press agency for overseas  Chinese, appeared to take a conservative tack, stressing the  S?C's continuing power in the central government.  Noting the  SPC's traditional role as the State Council's "general staff  headquarters," it stated that the SPC "will remain the highest-  ranking department for the comprehensive management of the  national economy."  By contrast, Vice Minister Gui, in his  remarks carried by the 30 May China Daily, appeared intent on  putting a reformist spin on the SPC's new role.  Although he  acknowledged that "the existing planning and investment system  still fails to meet market requirements," he claimed that the new  regulations "redefine the robe of planning and investment" and  that "the connotation of the word 'planning' is changing."  Gui  went on to assert that under the planning reforms "all that the  market can manage should be . . . managed by the market" and that  "planning departments should restrict their activities to those  that the market cannot do or has failed to do well."     Implications     Faced with continuing inflationary pressures as a result of  Deng's fast-growth policies, general leadership concern over the  potential for social unrest, and pressure from conservative  leaders and planning bureaucrats to moderate the pace of market  reform, the reformers appear to have backed away from their  ambitious goals to strictly curb the power of the SPC.  This bow  to economic and political realities parallels the apparent  slowdown in the pace of banking, enterprise, and other reforms  mandated by the plenum last year.  Despite these formidable  obstacles, Deng's backers show no sign of having modified their  reform agenda in principle and will likely continue to press for  market-based changes when conditions are more in their favor.

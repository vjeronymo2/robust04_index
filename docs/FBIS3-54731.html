The new parliament is more clever, more intellectual, and  more politically competent than the previous body of Soviet  power, Yeltsin said at a meeting with leaders of departments of  the presidential administration that took place in the Kremlin  Thursday [30 December].    The year was difficult, he said, but the country has had for  the first time free elections and has a democratic Constitution.    An Interfax correspondent reports that the president has  stressed the need to improve the analytical work of the  presidential apparatus.    Emphasis should be put on the quality, not quantity, of  materials prepared by experts, he said.    The president has spoken out in favor of a reduced  presidential apparatus. At the stage of discussions, he said  all presidential staff members should advance proposals for  decision-making, but once a decision is made, they should all be  in agreement.</p>

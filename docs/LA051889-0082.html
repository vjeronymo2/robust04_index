			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Air Route Talks Fail: The bid to expand air links between the United States and  Japan failed after Tokyo halved a proposal that Washington had found inadequate  five months ago, a U.S. negotiator said. In December, Washington proposed 16  new services for Japanese carriers and 13 new services for U.S. carriers, while  Japan countered with 10 new lines for Japanese carriers and six for U.S.  carriers. The United States had hoped the two countries would reach a  compromise, the official said. But the new Japanese proposal was for five new  Japanese services and three new U.S. services.  </P></p>

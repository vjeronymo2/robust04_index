In January, Korean oil companies imported petroleum for 13  to  14 U.S. dollars per barrel, but as the current price is 15  dollars it is necessary to reduce oil prices by 4 to 5 percent,  Director General Han Chun-ho said.    Han announced on Friday at a seminar sponsored by the Korea  Petroleum Association that the government would adopt a policy  linking domestic oil prices to the average price of petroleum  imported the previous month and to exchange rates. Han added  that the government will adjust domestic oil prices on the 15th  day of every month.    Under the plan, the government will announce oil prices on  the 14th of every month through the Korea Petroleum Association  and apply the new prices on the 15th. The government plans to  limit its involvement in deciding oil prices, but if a sudden  international incident arises like the Gulf crisis and prices  increase sharply, it will intervene in setting prices to prevent  economic disorder. However, the government will continue to  control the price of liquefied petroleum gas.</p>

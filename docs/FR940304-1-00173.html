			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act provides for subsequent State petitions for exemption from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preemption, which necessarily means that the determination as to whether a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State law prevails must be made on a case-by-case basis using criteria set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth in the Act. When DOE receives such a petition, it will be appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to consider preparing a federalism assessment consistent with the criteria in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> e. Regulatory Flexibility Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354) requires an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment of the impact of regulations on small businesses. Small businesses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are defined as those firms within an industry that are privately owned and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less dominant in the market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this rulemaking, eight different products and, hence, industries are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being addressed. Regulatory flexibility issues will be discussed for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industries for which standards are being prescribed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the energy conservation standard on those room air conditioner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers who could be considered small businesses will be discussed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The room air conditioner industry is characterized by three firms with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large market shares (accounting for nearly 75 percent of sales) and numerous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firms sharing the remaining one-quarter of the market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are significant differences among the major firms. For this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry, the Department has learned that average cost has an inverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship to firm size. Thus, the industry has economies of scale, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large firms (to the extent that their facilities are up-to-date) have lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average costs than small firms. This fact, coupled with increasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitiveness of the national market, probably accounts for the continuing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consolidation that has been occurring for several decades. The fact that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consolidation has been producing larger firms strongly corroborates the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding that large firms have a cost advantage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A principal implication of consolidation is that the smaller of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firms will be, on average, in more danger of failing or being bought out than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will the large firms. Because of the greater precariousness of smaller firms,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any decrease in average profitability is more likely to mean the difference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between success and failure for a smaller firm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From the point of view of competitiveness, a decrease in average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> profitability could speed up the process of consolidation, producing a less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitive industry, while an increase in average profitability could help  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain the current levels of competition. Either effect might well be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary, because, in the long run, the number of firms should be determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the industry's cost structure and by the way a single firm's elasticity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demand relates to the number of competing firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While some small firms have more energy efficient models than larger  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firms, and while some have more models of average efficiency, the impact of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher efficiency standards on small firms is likely to be mixed. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards are technologically difficult to meet, however, they may hurt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected smaller firms the most, because smaller firms have less sophisticated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> research and development capabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secondly, the impact of the energy conservation standards on water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heater manufacturers needs to be addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water heater manufacturing firms can be divided into two groups: those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that compete on large sales volume products and those that compete in small,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specialized markets. Small firms are generally forced to specialize in small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market niches that offer some protection from the cost advantage that large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firms hold when they can produce in volume. This effect can even be observed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among the major producers, in the tendency of the smaller major producers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce somewhat more specialized products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Just like the room air conditioner industry, water heater manufacturing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is characterized by economies of scale in production, and large firms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally tend to have average costs that are lower than those of small firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although larger firms have a cost advantage because of economies of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scale, the very small firms in the water heater manufacturing industry have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found market niches in which to survive profitably. There are at least two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small firms which manufacture standard electric resistance water heaters. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, there are also two small firms that manufacture heat pump water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters. Therefore, if a very stringent efficiency standard for water heaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is mandated, one could expect that given the small margins in the industry,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some small firms may have to leave the market. On the other hand, the small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firms that specialize in higher efficiency models (such as heat pump water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters) may experience a boom.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

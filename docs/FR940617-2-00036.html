			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver determination must be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Commerce Business Daily <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  as a part of the notice of solicitation for offers of an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made after that notice is published, by amendment to such notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document approving the waiver and any supporting and accompanying documents, with such deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5 U.S.C.

The goal of API standards is to enhance the portability of graphics programs (and programmers) between installations and environments. The goal of Interoperability standards is to enable graphics data to be exchanged successfully between graphics systems and devices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Figure 1 is a very simple reference model of a computer graphics operating environment. The model emphasizes that a graphics application program interacts with physical devices and human operators via a computer graphics environment. Figure 1 also shows that the application may receive information from an external database. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The output of the graphics program, as shown in Figure 1, is directed to a virtual graphics device (i.e., Virtual Device Interface or VDI) rather than directly to a physical device. A Device Driver provides an interface, implemented in either hardware or software, for translating virtual device commands to commands understood by a particular physical device. By substituting one device driver for another, an application can run on a different physical device. This device independent is a central concept of this graphics reference model. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Figure 1, the API standards reside in the box labelled the Device Independent Graphics Package. Interoperability standards are related to the boxes in Figure labelled Metafile, Database and Virtual Device Interface. Figure 2 depicts the various graphics standards associated with the general model shown in Figure 1. These are discussed below. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;CN&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d640 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSEN17JN94.055 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;CN&hyph;C <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

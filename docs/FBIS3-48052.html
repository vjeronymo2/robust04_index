			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The United  Nations Security Council must be prepared to use force, if  necessary, to make the aggressors in Bosnia-Herzegovina comply  with certain critical requirements, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said  Saturday.    Among the critical requirements were the lifting of the  siege  of Sarajevo by silencing or removing the Serbian heavy artillery  surrounding the city and the opening of Tuzla Airport to enable  food, medicine, and other essentials to reach major surrounding  towns, the prime minister added.    All concerned parties must be made to permit, by force if  necessary, the unhindered flow of humanitarian assistance, he  told an international conference of parliamentarians on Bosnia-  Herzegovina here.    These actions are necessary especially to save innocent  lives  during the harsh winter, he said in a keynote address to about  180 parliamentarians from more than 30 countries attending the  two-day conference.    Also here for the conference was Bosnian President Alija  Izetbegovic.    Dr. Mahathir said Sarajevo remained under siege to this day,  surrounded by Serbian guns capable of delivering 800 rounds of  shells each day, although, for the fifth time, Western nations  had threatened to launch air-strikes against the Serbs.    And for the fifth time, the Serbs have thumbed their noses  at  these so-called righteous great powers. Of course, no air-strike  is mounted, he added. He said the Serbs knew that the bark of  these defenders of human rights was worse then their bite. And  so they will go on raping and murdering, fully convinced that  they will not only go unpunished but they will be actually  rewarded, he added. This was because the so-called civilised  world was not prepared to stop the Serbs although it was  horrified, he said.    Dr. Mahathir said the Americans were blaming the British and  the French for preventing the use of air strikes against the  Serbs. He added, however, some very highly placed British and  French sources told him that it was the United States which was  against the military action. [Word indistinct] frankly do not  know whom to believe, he said, adding that he suspected neither  the Americans nor the Europeans cared enough to act as they did  not wish to risk the lives of their soldiers for something that  was not really very important for their own well-being.    Dr. Mahathir said it was obvious that no one really approved  of what the Serbs were doing. But, the Western governments  remain obdurate, refusing to see anything wrong in their blatant  disregard for the wholesale violation of every item of human  rights by the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he added.    As such, Dr. Mahathir said, it was now up to the  parliamentarians to help shock their people and governments out  of their self-imposed stupor.    They should request their respective governments to place  the  issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina high on their country's  international agenda and call for the resumption of meaningful  talks aimed at a lasting and just settlement, ne added.    Assert your rights as members of the United Nations to  insist  that the Security Council act decisively to end the sufferings  of the Bosnian people and bring back peace to that country, he  said.    To do this, they should firstly exert pressure on the UN  Security Council to implement the various resolutions on  Bosnia-Herzegovina which the council had passed.    The second thing you should do is to urge the Security  Council to take a hard look at the Geneva process and since  there is wide agreement that the Geneva talks cannot go on as  before, seize the opportunity to convene a new international  conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina, he added.</p>

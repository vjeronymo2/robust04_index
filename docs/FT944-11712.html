			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Celsis settles with sacked chief One of the more acrimonious corporate sackings in recent years came to a sudden and apparently amicable end yesterday in a deal that will probably make Mr Tony Martin, former chief executive of Celsis, the biotechnology company, a millionaire. Mr Martin was sacked without compensation in March 1994 on the grounds that he was 'ineffectual'. Celsis then sought judicial confirmation that the termination of the contract was lawful. Mr Martin counterclaimed, alleging unfair dismissal and said he would sue for defamation. All these actions will now be suspended. Celsis will pay Mr Martin Pounds 80,000 in a 'without prejudice' payment, and a contribution of up to Pounds 40,000, which Mr John McKinley, Celsis' lawyer, said would be likely to account for all costs and expenses. Celsis also agreed, subject to shareholders' approval, to establish and lend sufficient funds to a share option trust for the benefit of unnamed senior staff, which would buy 500,000 shares in the company from Mr Martin at a price of 48p per share. In addition, Mr Martin will keep 1.3m shares in the company, worth Pounds 923,000 at yesterday's closing price of 71p. Mr Martin felt he had won a moral victory. Since his departure from Celsis, he has taken up two biotechnology non-executive directorships, one in the US and one in Ireland. He plans to accept a third and said yesterday that he had been offered executive positions. Cambridge-based Celsis, which specialises in contamination detection equipment, said it 'wishes Mr Martin every success in his future endeavours'. It appointed Mr Arthur Holden, from Baxter International of the US, as his replacement in September.</p>

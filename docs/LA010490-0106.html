			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP NOTES / ROB FERNAS;  </P> <P> DAD LIFTS WESTCHESTER PLAYER SUSPENSION -- JUST IN TIME  </P> <P> Senior forward Robert Hamiter has sat out all but one game for Westchester  High's basketball team this season because he was ruled academically  ineligible.  </P> <P> Not by the school. By his father.  </P> <P> Westchester Coach Ed Azzam said Hamiter's father, in a unique arrangement, does  not allow his son to play unless he maintains at least a 3.0 grade-point  average.  </P> <P> L.A. City Section athletes must carry at least a 2.0 GPA with no F grades to  remain eligible. Hamiter meets those standards, but he has watched the Comets  from the sidelines in 14 of their first 15 games because of his father's edict.  </P> <P> "I'm behind the dad 100%," Azzam said. "It's been a little frustrating, though.  The other guys are playing well and playing hard, but we're not real big. We  have a 6-8 junior (LeRoi O'Brien), but everybody else is around 6 foot."  </P> <P> The 6-foot-5 Hamiter, a transfer from Florida, has not played since the Comets'  opener against Cleveland of Reseda. Over the holidays, though, his progress  report indicated his grades are again above a 3.0 average.  </P> <P> The timing couldn't be better. Westchester opens Coastal Conference play Friday  against University High of West L.A.  </P> <P> "He makes us a notch better," Azzam said.  </P> <P> Carson basketball Coach Rich Masson was happy with his team's performance last  week in the Las Vegas Valley Tournament, but not with the officiating.  </P> <P> The Colts lost to Bonanza of Las Vegas, 73-64, in Saturday's championship game  after three of their best players -- Nkosi Littleton, Michael Ross and Bobby  Kelly -- fouled out in the second half.  </P> <P> "It's tough to beat a Vegas team in Vegas," Masson said. "It was a bad scene."  </P> <P> Masson said the officiating was so one-sided that a Las Vegas sportswriter  apologized to him after Saturday's game.  </P> <P> "It was the second-worst officiating I've ever seen," he said. "The worst was a  few years ago when we played Rex Chapman's (high school) team in Kentucky."  </P> <P> No one said life on the road was easy.  </P> <P> Chris Keldorf, the talented St. Bernard sophomore who plays quarterback for the  football team and is sixth man for the basketball team, lives in Manhattan  Beach and is the son of Russ Keldorf, who helps run the Manhattan Beach Youth  Basketball League at Mira Costa High.  </P> <P> How does Mira Costa Coach Glenn Marx feel about losing one of the city's top  basketball players to a neighboring Catholic school?  </P> <P> "I don't have any problem with it," he said. "There's always been a good  relationship between St. Bernard and Mira Costa. (Keldorf's) family wanted him  to go to a Catholic school environment."  </P> <P> Marx, basketball coach at St. Bernard in the late 1970s, pointed out that when  Keldorf enrolled at St. Bernard in the fall of 1988, Mira Costa was coming off  terrible seasons in football and basketball.  </P> <P> Since then, both programs have undergone improvement under Marx, in his second  season at Mira Costa, and first-year football Coach Larry Petrill.  </P> <P> "I think we'll be able to attract some of the Catholic kids from now on," Marx  said. "I wish him well, but I don't want to lose any more Keldorfs."  </P> <P> Rolling Hills basketball Coach Cliff Warren, who has guided the Titans to three  straight Bay League titles, expects a dogfight for the championship this  season.  </P> <P> "It's up for grabs," he said. "I think everybody is about the same. I don't  think anybody is great. But at the same time, everybody is good."  </P> <P> Morningside is an overwhelming favorite to win its second straight Ocean League  crown, but Co-Coach Carl Franklin says it will not be as easy as some people  think.  </P> <P> "I think there is a lot of parity," he said. "From what I've seen, most (Ocean  League) teams are winning games in the preseason."  </P> <P> Franklin might be overestimating his competition. Of the eight Ocean teams that  opened league play Wednesday, only two (Morningside and Mira Costa) had winning  records.  </P> <P> If anyone deserves an injury-free basketball season, it's St. Bernard senior  Martin Smith.  </P> <P> The 6-4 guard missed his sophomore season with a knee injury and was sidelined  most of last year with a stress fracture in his leg.  </P> <P> So far this year, though, he's healthy and making up for lost time. He entered  Wednesday's Camino Real League opener against El Segundo averaging 15 points a  game, tops on St. Bernard.  </P> <P> "He's really been a pleasant surprise," Coach Jim McClune said.  </P> <P> At 11-3, Narbonne's basketball team is off to its best start in years.  </P> <P> And the Gauchos' record might be even better if 6-2 forward Derrick Dukes, a  first-team All-Pacific League choice last season, had not moved to Chicago  during the off-season.  </P> <P> PREP NOTES -- Rolling Hills guard Steve Clover set his second tournament  scoring record last week with 108 points in four games in the Pepsi Classic at  Seattle. The week before, Clover scored a record 124 points in four games to  lead the Titans to the championship of the Beverly Hills Tournament. The 6-4  senior is averaging 26 points and five three-point shots a game . . . The  powerful Morningside boys and girls basketball teams each lost their last two  games in out-of-state tournaments last week. The boys lost to Bonanza of Las  Vegas, 77-76, and Bishop O'Dowd of Oakland, 58-54, in the Las Vegas Valley  Tournament, while the Lady Monarchs lost to Cannon County of Tennessee, 72-43,  and South Pike of Magnolia, Miss., 67-64, in the Best of the U.S. Invitational  at Shelbyville, Tenn . . . Five members of the South Bay Unit of the California  Football Officials Assn. were selected to work the CIF-Southern Section  Division II final between Santa Barbara and Muir on Dec 9: Bill Agopian of  Westchester, Chad Brown of Carson, Robert Salcido of Manhattan Beach, Larry  Daniels of Hermosa Beach and Greg Fucci of Redondo Beach . . . Former North  Torrance High and USC volleyball star Lawrence Hom is a graduate assistant  coach at USC.  </P> <P> </P> <P> South Bay's Boys Basketball Top 10  </P> <P> Selected by Times Sportswriters  </P> <P> Through Games of Jan. 2  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.09IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Rank, School, League  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Record  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1 Morningside (Ocean)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9-3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2 Carson (Pacific)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10-5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3 Narbonne (Pacific)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 11-3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4 Rolling Hills (Bay)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8-4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5 Westchester (Metro)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8-6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6 Hawthorne (Bay)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7-5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7 St. Bernard (Camino Real)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5-5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8 Palos Verdes (Bay)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6-5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9 Leuzinger (Bay)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6-2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10 Mira Costa (Ocean)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6-3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

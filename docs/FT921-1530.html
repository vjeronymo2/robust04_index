			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Actuation side behind 23% growth at Rotork ROTORK, the Bath-based valve control manufacturer, yesterday announced a 23 per cent increase to Pounds 9.5m in pre-tax profits for 1991, due to strong sales to the water and oil industries. The increase from last time's Pounds 7.7m came on turnover ahead slightly to Pounds 51.5m (Pounds 50.8m). Earnings increased to 20.66p (16.08p). A recommended final dividend of 5.75p makes a total of 10p (9p). Rotork Actuation, which accounts for the bulk of group profits, saw strong demand from UK water companies, oil companies in the Americas and power companies in Australasia. European sales remained strong, while Singapore, Australia and South Korea produced combined profits of Pounds 1m for the first time. But the group warned that its smaller Rotork Instruments and Rotork Analysis divisions were hit by the recession. Mr Tom Eassie, chief executive, said export markets were being sought to reduce exposure to the UK.</p>

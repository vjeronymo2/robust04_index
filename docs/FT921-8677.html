			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Blue Arrow Verdicts: Mixed results for corporate Untouchables THE COVER of an issue of the Serious Fraud Office's house magazine features a cartoon of Mrs Barbara Mills, its departing director, as a pin-striped Robocop. This lampoon by her colleagues was their way of commenting on the high profile she had sought since taking up the post in September 1990. That she projects herself as a sort of female Elliot Ness leading a team of corporate Untouchables is a popular observation in the City. In a week of mixed fortunes for prosecutions, with the conviction of Mr Peter Clowes almost eclipsed by the collapse of the Guinness Two case, and with four convictions in Blue Arrow - but six acquittals - it appears that the SFO gun has in some cases been firing blanks. The strain at its Elm Street offices was beginning to show, even before the Guinness Two jury was discharged and the case dropped. One staff member confided only three weeks ago: 'We have so many people deployed on Maxwell and BCCI (the collapsed Bank of Commerce and Credit International) that we would have difficulty coping if another big fraud was to break.' Recognising the difficulties, the government lifted cash limits on the SFO last autumn to allow extra funding for the Maxwell and BCCI cases. The annual budget of Pounds 18m pales, however, when measured against the costs of some of its most prominent prosecutions. The Blue Arrow trial is thought to have cost about Pounds 35m. The defence costs alone would easily have dwarfed the SFO budget for a year's investigations. Since its inception in 1988 the SFO has brought 73 trials, involving 158 defendants and achieving 109 convictions. The 69 per cent conviction rate is showing a small improvement on the 63 per cent rate in its last annual report. In comparison London's Metropolitan Police Fraud squad can claim a consistent conviction rate of about 95 per cent. The SFO does not disclose how many cases it has started and abandoned. The figures also mask a disturbing number of high-profile cases that have failed to produce convictions. That Blue Arrow resulted in some convictions must have been a big relief for the SFO. Critics of the SFO have pointed to the time-lag involved in cases such as Blue Arrow that are built on the back of Department of Trade and Industry investigations which themselves take years. The SFO was formed on the recommendation of the Fraud Trials Committee under Lord Roskill. It now consists of 21 lawyers and 27 accountants working full-time with police and accountants seconded part-time for individual cases, and seeks to bring a multi-disciplinary approach to fraud cases. Roskill recommended that police officers in fraud cases should be given powers of interview similar to those available for DTI inspectors, who can compel interviewees to give evidence that may later be used against them in a trial. The government instead left police interview powers within the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and gave the civilian members of the SFO powers under Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 to compel answers to questioning and to seize documents. The crucial difference between these powers and those of DTI investigators is that evidence collected in Section 2 interviews of suspects cannot generally be used against them unless the evidence can be shown to be a clear lie. It has yet to happen, but it is only a matter of time before parts of a suspect's Section 2 interview are used to rebut evidence given in the witness box. Section 2 notices are used mostly to enable people such as bankers to have a legal sanction to breach their professional duties of confidentiality and give evidence about clients who are under investigation. This partly explains why SFO investigators tend to wait until they have accumulated a mass of evidence before they approach suspects for questioning. It is not a hard-and-fast policy and it has its detractors in the SFO. Mr Michael Chance, a former deputy director of the SFO and now a consultant at London solicitors Cameron Markby Hewitt, has defended the investigation system. He said: 'There can't be a particularly tight blueprint as to how to set about a fraud investigation because they aren't all the same. 'It's set out very clearly in guidance given to all members of the SFO that you keep you eye on the ball and right from the start, as soon as you possibly can, you identify the principal offences and the principal offenders. You don't go amassing mountains of stuff and then try and dig in your pile for evidence of offences. That's not a realistic way to go about it, and that's not the way the SFO goes about it.' While the SFO is satisfied with the system of referral - it does not seek out its own investigations - it would like a closer liaison with regulators, and in some cases earlier discussions on the possible fraudulent implications of some regulatory cases. It remains a small organisation with large responsibilities. Mr Chance argues that it is too small at present. 'It cannot adjust very comfortably to changing workloads,' he said. The current budget, which is projected to increase to about Pounds 21m next year, is supporting about 60 cases on the SFO's books at any one time. Mrs Mills is unimpressed with the current argument that fraud can be handled by US-style civil actions where the burden of proof is lower. Her view is that it must remain under criminal law. Mr Chance reinforced the argument. He said: 'Would Peter Clowes have gone to prison for 10 years if he had been dealt with by his regulator? He would have been fined.' He added: 'My own feeling is that if people engage in serious dishonesty to the detriment to the public the right course is a criminal prosecution.'</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Institutions turn against Sugar's bid for Amstrad TWO large institutional investors said yesterday that they will vote against Mr Alan Sugar's controversial 30p-a-share buy-back bid for the 65 per cent of Amstrad he does not already own. Prudential said it would vote its 5m Amstrad shares, equivalent to a 0.9 per cent stake, against the bid as did Postel, the UK's largest pension fund, which holds 10.92m Amstrad shares, equivalent to a 1.88 per cent stake. Although the stakes are small, the institutions' decision to oppose the bid is a setback for Mr Sugar, Amstrad's chairman. Opponents of Mr Sugar's Pounds 113m plan to take the consumer electronics group private again need to muster a total of 94.4m shares, or 16.25 per cent of Amstrad's paid up capital, to block the deal. Although many institutional fund managers have said they are unhappy with the terms of the offer, Prudential and Postel are the first to announce they will try to block the bid. Their lead could result in other institutional shareholders, who are thought to control a significant chunk of Amstrad's equity, taking the same stand. Mr Andrew Threadgold, Postel's chief executive, said yesterday that the pension fund would be opposing the 30p-a-share bid because 'we are opposed to management buy-outs of public companies by insiders'. Postel gave other reasons. These include 'not being confident about our own valuation', because of the lack of financial information and forecasts from Amstrad, and: 'We are not convinced Mr Sugar is being altruistic.' Mr Threadgold added that Postel had considered the possibility that it will be left as a minority shareholder and 'may even end up with less than 30p', but felt this was the correct position to take. If Mr Sugar's bid fails Mr Threadgold said Postel will push strongly for the introduction of non-executive directors on to Amstrad's board. The action of the two institutions yesterday is also likely to strengthen opposition among Amstrad's 31,000 individual shareholders, many of whom have already expressed concern about the bid. One, Mr Edward Northcote who owns 1,000 Amstrad shares, will mount a legal challenge to the planned buy-out in the High Court this morning.</p>

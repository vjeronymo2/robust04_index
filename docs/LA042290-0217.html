			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JON KLEIN: A -- 'BUZZ' ON MTV  </P> <P> Imagine a video roller coaster ride through world events and culture. Imagine  the news cut like a music video. That's "Buzz," a new half-hour program that  MTV is banking on to help relieve its ratings slump and propel its image from  Music Television (what MTV stands for) to terribly hip, program-oriented  television.  </P> <P> "Buzz," which premieres Sunday at 9 p.m., is a giddy montage of interviews,  street scenes and cultural icons organized around a different theme each week.  The show is made by MTV in England, where it also airs. Co-creator Jon Klein --  who himself could not say whether the program would intrigue viewers or simply  make them dizzy -- 'talked about the show with Sharon Bernstein.  </P> <P> What is "Buzz"? Is it a news show?  </P> <P> It's not really meant to be categorizable in any traditional sense. There's a  bit of news, there's a bit of art, there's a bit of current affairs, there's a  bit of documentary to it.  </P> <P> It's on Fridays in England and on Sundays on MTV in the States. It's a regular  TV show. It's edited to be very fast-moving, but it's meant to be watched like  a regular TV show.  </P> <P> How is the show organized? Is there a plot?  </P> <P> It's sort of thematic. The first U.S. show is about cultural stereotypes, so  people talk a lot about racism or about sexism or about other forms of cultural  stereotyping.  </P> <P> It's kind of like meditations on a theme. There are different elements to it;  it's through different people's eyes, through different stories, but it does  stick to the theme fairly religiously.  </P> <P> How do you get information?  </P> <P> We set up bureaus all over the world. They're not really bureaus in a  traditional sense, they're basically just kind of knowledgeable people, people  who know what's happening in a city. We've got people in New York, Los Angeles,  Paris, Tokyo, Germany, Ghana and Cairo. And these people just call us with  information about what's happening. They read newspapers, they go to the  movies, they go to the clubs.  </P> <P> Does your sound track have songs in it?  </P> <P> We're pretty free with (the sound track). We take all the sound off the  interviews we do. We mix it with music both off videos and off records and old  commercials and stock footage and make a kind of collage with it.  </P> <P> The show is very sound driven, the sound is pretty important. We spend half our  time in sound studios and half our time in video studios.  </P> <P> And that's your way of staying in keeping with the "Music Television" aspect of  it?  </P> <P> I don't think it was that planned. But it just happens to be a real colorful  rhythmic type of show, so we use a lot of music, we push the rhythm along, we  cut to the beat. We do cut it very much like a music video. It's sort of like a  music video with content.  </P> <P> Would you describe one of the programs?  </P> <P> In the show that we do about the future, we open with a segment where we talk  to people from about 15 countries about what their concerns are for what's  going to happen in the '90s.  </P> <P> We then go into a segment on "virtual reality," which is this artificial kind  of reality where people can literally dive into a world which is created on  their TV or on their computer, and they can interact with computer images.  </P> <P> We've then got a piece on computer hackers, people who can break into your  phone account and learn your credit history, who can break into government  files and access sensitive documents, who have this ethic that they are the  last bastion of goodness before a possible police state.  </P> <P> And then at the end, there's a piece where we talk to kids who go to the United  Nations school, kids from all backgrounds, and we ask them about the future.  </P> <P> Do you think it's too much of a kaleidoscope for people to be able to watch for  a half-hour?  </P> <P> We have no idea. I mean, our friends think it's great.  </P> <P> This show is meant to be understood and to be watched. We don't want it to go  over people's heads or be too up in the air about things. The intention is to  communicate. We just hope that people give it a chance as it wings its way into  their sitting rooms, their living rooms.  </P> <P> "Buzz" really doesn't want to be confusing or nebulous. Sometimes the fact that  it's such a new format and looks so different can confuse people initially, but  it's not something where we're trying to be obtuse. It's just a new format that  may take people a few minutes or maybe a couple of shows to get used to.  </P> <P> What does MTV hope to get out of this show?  </P> <P> I think there are only so many music videos you can watch and MTV definitely  realizes that, and it's going much more show-oriented. "Buzz" is sort of a  bulwark of that phase in MTV's history.  </P> <P> What kind of a commitment has MTV made to the show?  </P> <P> We're taping the first 13 now, and we're starting in July with the next 13. We  assume it will be 26 shows, and then we'll see what happens. It should  definitely establish itself as a hit or a miss by then.  </P> <P> What age group are you looking for?  </P> <P> I would say it's for people who are 14 to 35, but I'm not sure. I don't know  many people who are under 14, and I'm not sure if people in the older age group  would like it. It's for people who grew up with television.  </P> <P> Does the show have a point of view?  </P> <P> We're trying to show a side (of life) that isn't usually portrayed on TV shows.  </P> <P> We aren't really taking any particular political stands or waving anyone's  flag. I think if anything, we're asking people to doubt the flag wavers, to  doubt the things that will only tell you what to do and what to think, to doubt  advertisers, to doubt TV shows.  </P> <P> Sometimes if you're watching a news show, the newscaster can be saying  something which sounds very straightforward but is actually a very subtle way  of making you believe one thing or another. You hear things in ads where things  are presented in one way, and it's really for the convenience of selling that  product, so "Buzz" sometimes mocks this kind of corporate slickness in certain  advertisements and certain TV shows and says this kind of TV show can be a bit  dangerous.  </P> <P> So "Buzz" looks like a TV show that's a bit dangerous sometimes, because it's  trying to point out that TV can be a bit dangerous.  </P> <P> What is your vision about what this program will do for the people who watch  it?  </P> <P> We hope it makes them think or wake up a bit. This is not television that is  meant to be relaxing or is meant to coddle you. This is television that sticks  its hand out of the TV set and shakes you a bit.  </P></p>

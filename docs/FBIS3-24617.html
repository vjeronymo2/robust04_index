This was  followed, in the same place, by another seminar organized by  UNICEF, the Kazakhstan Ministry of Health and the Bobek  Children's Charitable Fund. This time, the talks revolved around  the subject of a program of controlling pneumonia among children  in Kazakhstan. What prompted such representative meetings of  physicians in Alma-Ata? At the newspaper's request, Aman  Duysekeyev, deputy health minister of the Republic of  Kazakhstan, shared his thoughts:    First, let me cite some figures: in our republic 40 children  are born per hour, but there is also one death per hour, which  is indicative of high infant mortality. Analysis of child  morbidity revealed that it has risen everywhere. For example,  the highest incidence of infectious diseases is noted in  Kzyl-Orda and Mangistau oblasts, and the city of Alma-Ata. Most  often, blood and hemopoietic organ diseases are detected in the  above-mentioned oblasts, as well as Semipalatinsk Oblast. In our  opinion, the rise in morbidity among tots is related, first of  all, to the poor ecological situation in this republic and  worsening of the people's socio-economic status.    Infant mortality is one of the most sensitive indicators of  socio-economic development of society, which comprises the  educational and cultural level, condition of the environment,  efficacy of preventive measures, medicogenetic consultations,  availability and quality of medical care, distribution of social  and material wealth. It has been established that the highest  indictors of infant mortality are observed in oblasts with a  high birthrate, since they have the poorest obstetric and  pediatric care resources, and lowest per capita consumption of  basic foods. And this enables us to conclude that planning of  resource capabilities of mother and child care services was  carried out for many years without consideration of the regional  distinctions (in the sense of high or low birthrate). True, for  the last few years emphasis has been placed on the regional  conception of distribution of resources. But the difficult  socio-economic situation, reduction in funds allocated to  medicine from the State budget have diminished the capacity to  carry out the work that was begun. Yet we are dealing with  children. Today, more than ever, safeguarding their health  requires effective government support.    What else causes infant mortality? Studies carried out by  the  Kazakh Scientific research Institute of Pediatrics show that the  more abortions are used as a birth control method, the higher  the gynecological pathology, the more often there are  complications of pregnancy, considerable share of premature  infants, while the risk of infant mortality increases 20-fold.  The physical condition and morbidity rate of children,  particularly in infancy, is also directly related to how they  are fed. Yet requirements such as keeping mother and infant  together in maternity homes, and immediate nursing of the infant  are not followed actively enough in Kazakhstan. And this can  ultimately lead to catastrophic rise in number of infants  deprived of maternal milk. Even now, in this republic only half  the infants up to the age of 3 months and one-third of those up  to 6 months old are breast fed. This cannot fail to cause alarm.  Especially since the prognosis is depressing, since Kazakhstan  does not have its own baby food industry, and support of breast  feeding involves major socioeconomic difficulties.    In most of the world's nations, including CIS states,  prevention and treatment of respiratory diseases is one of the  pressing socio-medical problems. In our republic, for example,  bronchopulmonary pathology among children constitutes more than  64 percent of all diseases. Thus, the rise in incidence of acute  pneumonia among tots in Atyrau, Zhezkazgan, Kzyl-Orda and South  Kazakhstan oblasts is attributable to inadequate supply of  necessary equipment to the roentgenological service,  difficulties in making the exact diagnosis, and problems of  professional training of pediatricians, particularly on the  primary level.    The high incidence of pathology of respiratory organs among  children is related not only to unsolved medical, but also  socioeconomic, ecological and ethnic problems. For this reason,  only a comprehensive approach is needed to solve this problem.  In recent years, many scientists have concluded that it is  important to instruct mothers on first medicosanitary aid. As  shown by studies, the education of moms was instrumental in  establishing a health lifestyle, expanding knowledge about acute  respiratory infections, and helped lower infant mortality by 29  percent. Consequently, we consider primary prevention and  hygienic education of the public to be the chief role of  out-patient and polyclinic institutions.    At this stage of economic and social transformations, and  with changing demographic processes, the most important task to  health care practice is to preserve the life of every infant.  And I should like to state through AZIYA, which devoted a page  in its preceding issue to the problem of mother and child health  the following: everything we discussed above will be only a good  intention unless funding of health care in Kazakhstan is carried  out on the basis of scientifically validated forecasts and more  generous investment in programs that guarantee the health of  children and women.</p>

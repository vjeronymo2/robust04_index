			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hungarian output down 20 per cent after drought HUNGARY HARVESTED 4.38m tonnes of cereals this year, 20 per cent down from last year, according to figures released by the Central Statistical Office, reports Reuter from Budapest. Cereals were sown on about 1.54m hectares (3.8m acres) of land, 7 per cent more than the area planted in 1992, but the harvest was smaller, mainly as a result of widespread and protracted drought, the CSO said. 'One must mention drought as the primary reason for the drop. . . but losses were also increased by inadequate agrotechnical work,' it said. 'Due to a shortage of money the necessary plant protection and fertilising work was also not performed.' it said. Wheat output was 3.03m tonnes, half of the 1986-1990 average and 12 per cent less than last year. The 3,060 kg/hectare average wheat yield was 25 per cent below last year's. The rye harvest was 112,000 tonnes, 16 per cent less than in 1992, and average yield lagged behind last year's by just as much, the CSO said. The sown area for barley was 10 per cent below last year's, but the harvest was only 1.14m tonnes, one-third less than in 1992. The yield for autumn barley was 3,270 kg/hectare, 1,100kg higher than for spring barley. Oats output fell to 94,000 tonnes from 144,000 in 1992.</p>

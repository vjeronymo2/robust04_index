According to the branch secretary, Ephraim  Motoko, said: "ISU members are harassing residents, kicking in  doors, and searching their houses for stolen goods," Mr Motoko  told SAPA. The ISU seem to be intent on recovering items  removed from the massive and now burnt out Mega City shopping  complex in three days of frenzied looting.    The ANC is also complaining that the embassy staff, or the  temporary administration is mainly white and want that issue  addressed. "We are demanding the inclusion of blacks to  neutralise the white staff," he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] A first round of bilateral trade talks between the  ROC [Republic of China] and the United States on the former's  admission to GATT has ended for the time being.    People have been most concerned with issues of tariff  reduction in agricultural products. Even though they failed to  respond completely to the U.S.-proposed list of 387 agricultural  products earmarked for tariff reduction, the ROC has agreed to  reduce tariffs on 277 items. The tariff reduction rates will be  more than 20 percent.    It has been learned that, under strong U.S. pressure, tariff  reductions on imported apples will be the largest. Tariff  reductions on certain sensitive agricultural products, including  fresh pears, peaches, plums, and processed fruit juices, will be  relatively low and will be reduced gradually over six years in  order to lessen their adverse impact.    The Council of Agriculture indicated: To counterbalance  future massive tariff reductions on agricultural products --  especially imported fruits including apples, whose imported  quantity is large -- and fresh fruits that are produced by major  exporting countries at low production costs, the ROC will shift  from the existing practice of levying tariffs on fresh fruits in  accordance with their price levels to a new practice of levying  tariffs in accordance with their imported quantities, or levying  mixed tariffs by integrating the existing and new practices.  The ROC has formally notified the U.S. delegation that we are  shifting from the existing practice to a new practice of levying  tariffs on fresh fruits.</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Power chiefs hold out on coal deals THE HEADS of several regional electricity companies said last night that they were still unwilling to sign deals to buy coal until the government published its white paper on the future of the coal industry. The government has said it wants the deals signed before the white paper. After a weekend of talks in the coal and electricity industries there was continuing uncertainty about whether the government could publish its coal white paper before the Easter parliamentary recess. British Coal executives and the electricity companies said considerable progress had been made in the talks on contracts which will replace those ending this month. Most outstanding differences were resolved. Senior executives at the corporation are resigned to the uncertainty over the industry's future continuing for several months after it emerged on Friday that the white paper would not include details of deals for coal additional to those for 'base contracts' which were the subject of the weekend negotiations. One corporation executive said: 'The white paper will not be the end of the story, just a further stage in the process. We still hope to keep some pits open but how many is uncertain.' The best guess is that fewer than 10 of the 31 pits will be kept in the corporation's ownership, although several more may be leased to the private sector. At the weekend outstanding issues between the two generating companies and some of the regional distribution companies were resolved without the need to resort to binding arbitration. British Coal and the generators also settled most remaining differences. Even if the government and the electricity companies resolve their dispute over whether signing the deals or publishing the white paper should come first, ministers have a tight timetable if they want to publish this week. Some electricity companies said yesterday they were prepared to sign contracts before the white paper if the government provided written guarantees on several issues. Regional companies want to be sure the government does not alter its timetable for liberalising the electricity supply market. The generators are seeking assurances that they will not be forced to sell generating plant they no longer want to operate. Several companies said the detail of the contracts, most of which are more than 200 pages long, meant that signing before the end of the week would be impossible even if the assurances were provided. One chief executive said last night he was strongly against signing before the white paper was published. He would be consulting with other companies, and this would affect how firm a stance he would take, but 'in any case we cannot sign by Thursday'. That is the day the cabinet meets and the first opportunity the government is likely to have to publish the white paper.</p>

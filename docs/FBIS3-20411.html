The 3d Plenary  Session of the 14th National CPC Congress was held in Beijing.  An important document was adopted by the plenary session. That  was the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues  Concerning Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic  Structure."    If it is said that the reform is aimed at building a grand  mansion of socialist market economy, then we may definitely say  that the "decision" is the magnificent blueprint in building  this mansion.    For more than one month since the convocation of the 3d  Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC Congress, many people  at home and abroad are asking: How was such a magnificent  blueprint and such a program of action born to help us forge  ahead toward the new century?  <H6>  I </H6>   China spends a decade to relieve its 100-year distresses and  worries.    The socialist market economy, something controversial which  was tried out long time ago, was finally regarded as the correct  orientation and written into the Party Constitution and the  Constitution of the People's Republic of China after Comrade  Deng Xiaoping gave his important talks during his South China  tour last year and the convocation of the 14th National CPC  Congress. To establish a socialist market economic structure has  become a arduous task assigned to all CPC party members and all  the people in China by the history and the times.    After the 14th National CPC Congress put forward the general  task and principle in establishing the new system, people  earnestly hope to have the following questions answered: What  does the socialist market economic structure look like after  all? How can we establish such a structure? What kind of  magnificent scene will prevail in China after the establishment  of the socialist market economy?    We should and must answer these questions.    This is the trend of the times...    People have heard a great deal about the saying that, "Cross  the river by feeling the rocks." During the early stage of the  reform, we were not even clear about the targets and focal  points of the reform, the internal relations among all the  sectors of the economic system, the complexity and the risks of  the reform program and the difficult points in carrying out  reform. We need to watch each step when we move forward. By  relying on this kind of ideological guidance of boldly exploring  things and carrying out practice, we have accumulated a great  deal of experiences and learn many lessons after paying the  necessary prices, and use them as our references in forging  ahead.    Right now, the internal relations among various sectors of  the system and the specific target and pattern in carrying out  the reform have become clearer after 15 years of efforts and  practice. The focal point has become obvious and the risks and  the degree of complexity can be estimated. Under this situation,  there are conditions in carrying out reform, and we should have  more rational guidance in observing the times and sizing up the  situation.    This is the voice of the people...    Let us look back at the history in carrying out reform.  During the past few years, we promote this reform program  spontaneously from the lower level to the higher level, and  develop this program consciously from the higher level to the  lower level by using the experience of the former to do work in  the latter. Some of the reform measures are popularized in an  overall manner after they have been spontaneously and  successfully carried out by the masses and reaffirmed by the  leadership departments such as the contract responsibility  system which links remuneration with output in rural areas, the  enterprise contract responsibility system and the share-holding  system.    The people call for more rational guidance so that they can  consciously follow such guidance. They hope that they may be  able to make plans, forecast the future and pre-fulfill their  targets in carrying out reform.    This is something inevitable in carrying out reform...    We have achieved a great deal after we worked hard to  explore  things for 15 years. On the one hand, the pattern with the  publicly owned economic sector constituting the mainstay while  various other economic sectors developing simultaneously has  taken shape. and the role of the markets is rapidly expanding in  the allocation of resources. A certain foundation has been laid  for us so that we have the conditions to carry out the reform in  an overall manner. On the other hand, progress has been  insignificant in certain major realms in carrying out reform.  This becomes a weak link in the entire chain of the economic  structure, and affects the deepening of our reform program and  the healthy development of our economy. We urgently need to  carry out our reform and planning in an overall manner, paying  attention to overall design, and to system and policy  standardization.    Our unshirkable task is to keep pace with the development of  the society and the times, meet the requirements of the people,  and draw up a programmatic document which will specifically  guide us to further deepen our reform, open up even wider to the  outside world and establish a socialist market economic  structure.    Just like what the report of the 14th National CPC Congress  pointed out that, "To establish a socialist market economic  structure involves China's economic foundation and many aspects  of the superstructure. We need a series of relevant system  reform and policy adjustments. We must pay full attention to  working out an overall plan, and implement this plan in a  planned manner and step by step."    It was precisely under this background that the "Decision"  arose at the historic moment.  <H6>  II </H6>   The series of theses written by Comrade Deng Xiaoping on  developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, particularly  his real knowledge and deep insight reflected in his important  talks which he gave during his south China tour in the spring  last year, and the goal on building a socialist market economic  structure explicitly put forward by the 14th National CPC  Congress have pointed out the orientation in providing a solid  theoretical foundation to draw up the "Decision."    In May of last year, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central  Committee held a plenary session and decided to convene the 3d  Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC Congress in Beijing  during the second half of 1993. The main theme of the plenary  session is to discuss issues on building a socialist market  economic structure and work out some provisions for the  development of such structure.    The team for drafting the "Decision" formed by personages of  all spheres was established on 31 May. General Secretary Jiang  Zemin delivered an important lengthy speech at the first meeting  of the drafting team, putting forward a series of requirements  concerning the framework, main contents and issues to be  resolved. He emphatically pointed out that in drafting this  "Decision," it is necessary to regard Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  the guideline laid down by the report of the 14th National CPC  Congress as the guiding ideology and supply a programmatic  document for the establishment of a socialist market economic  structure. This "Decision" is of great significance in carrying  out reform and opening up to the outside world and promoting the  modernization program. It involves developments in China to the  end of this century and even into the next century. We must  fully demonstrate a high sense of responsibility and concentrate  our efforts in drafting this document, said Jiang Zemin.    On the basis of General Secretary Jiang Zemin's views, the  drafting team, first of all, prepared an outline of the document  which contained 10 chapters and 53 articles. Soon after that the  standing committee members of the Political Bureau of the CPC  Central Committee listened to a briefing by the drafting team on  the drafted "Decision," and agreed with the outline in  principle. They asked the drafting team to begin drafting this  document officially.    While the drafting team began to write the manuscript of the  "Decision," the CPC Central Committee organized 16 special  subject investigation and study groups composed of comrades of  relevant departments in various localities to tour various  localities to extensively investigate and study issues  concerning the establishment of a socialist market economic  structure, collecting data and laying a foundation to draft the  document.    The drafting team and the various investigation and study  groups maintained close contacts, and continuously exchanged  views. They repeatedly carried out debates on each subject and  gradually agreed with one another on some issues.    The first, second, third, and fourth manuscripts were  completed one after another. Whenever a manuscript was  completed, the drafting team invariably solicited opinions from  all relevant departments for study, deliberation, and revision.    Comrade Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out more than once  that this document must go on advancing and developing. There  must be a long-range target in carrying out reform, while we  must achieve our goal in implementing this document. We must  proceed from our actual situation at present and take into  consideration China's reality, he said.    The standing committee members of the Political Bureau of  the  CPC Central Committee once again listened to a briefing made by  the drafting team, and studied the fifth manuscript of the  "Decision" at a meeting held on 9 September. General Secretary  Jiang Zemin and various comrades of the standing committee  expressed their views on firmly establishing a modern enterprise  system, quickening the pace in reforming the financial system,  the fiscal and taxation system, the investment system and the  social security system and attaching importance to work in the  fields of science and technology and education. Participants of  the meeting endorsed the fifth manuscript of the "Decision" in  principle and asked the drafting team to revise it and make  further improvements.    A plenary meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central  Committee was held on 20 September at the Huairen Hall.  Participants at the meeting discussed the revised sixth  manuscript of the "Decision." They believed that this manuscript  confirms with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and tallies with the  guideline laid down by the 14th National CPC Congress, and that  it had brought forth new ideas and made breakthroughs. They  endorsed this manuscript in principle, and put forward their  views to make further revisions.    The establishment of a socialist market economic structure  is  a pioneering undertaking unprecedented in history. In despite of  the fact that there are experiences in developing market  economy, on which we may draw on, there are still many aspects  that we must develop by ourselves. There is no ready-made  pattern that we may copy indiscriminately. Nor is there any  shortcut that we may take. We can only find out a way suited to  China's actual situation by conducting investigations and  studies, drawing on collective wisdom and absorbing all useful  ideas and keeping on improving. In the course of drafting the  "decision," the party's general secretary, standing committee  members and regular members of the Political Bureau of the CPC  Central Committee and all staff members of the drafting team had  earnestly and meticulously carried out their work with a high  sense of responsibility to the party, the people and history.  Jiang Zemin and other comrades presided over a total of four  meetings and solicited views from various special subject  investigation and study groups. The standing committee members  of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee also heard  briefings made by various special subject investigation and  study groups on financial affairs, taxation, pricing, marketing,  and modern enterprise system.    The Central CPC Committee held a forum of nonparty  personages on 15 October, soliciting views from the responsible  persons of the All China Federation of Industry and Commerce and  other nonparty public figures on the draft "decision." These  personages who have cooperated and worked with the Communist  Party of China for a long time offered many valuable suggestions  on building a socialist market economic structure and revising  the draft "decision." During that period, the comrades of the  standing committee of the CPC Central Committee also held a  symposium of senior party members and another forum of experts  in the economic field to solicit their opinions and listen to  their suggestions.    Moreover, the CPC Central Committee also printed and  distributed copies of the sixth manuscript to various provinces,  autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central  government and various departments and units under the central  authorities and the State Council to solicit opinions. Members  and alternate members of the party's 14th Central Committee,  responsible cadres of the party, government and army at the  central level and responsible comrades of the party committees  in various provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities  directly under the central government and various major military  districts took part in debates and expressed their views on the  "decision." While approving the draft "decision" in general,  they made as many as 1,050 suggestions to make revisions. They  suggested to make major revisions involving the structure and  contents of the document as well as minor ones on wording and  even punctuation. These suggestions fully reflect their serious  attitude and lofty sense of responsibility.    On the basis of the suggestions from all sectors, the  drafting team once again made 270 revisions on the manuscript  for solicitation of opinions, forming the seventh manuscript.    The third meeting of the Political Bureau Standing Committee  was held on 3 November to study the request for instructions  submitted by the drafting team on several major issues  concerning the revision of the draft "decision." The standing  committee members earnestly carried out debates on these issues  and made clear-cut decisions.    In accordance with the recommendation made by this Political  Bureau Standing Committee meeting, the drafting team once again  made some revisions on the draft "decision."    The Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held its  second meeting on 6 November to study the revised "decision."  The meeting endorsed this manuscript in principle and decided to  refer some portions of the manuscript to the forthcoming Third  Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC Congress for discussion.    After extensive discussions and repeated revisions, the  17,000-odd word eighth manuscript of the "decision" was  presented to the members and alternate members attending the  Third Plenary Session held on 11 November. During the plenary  session, the members and the alternate members once again  earnestly studied and made discussions, and made nearly 100  revisions. Only then, did the final version of the "decision"  take shape.    For a period of five and half months, the work of drafting  the "decision" was tense and arduous. The comrades of the  drafting team had worked hard. Reviewing the process of drafting  the "decision," we clearly see that this process is one of  bringing democracy into full play and drawing on collective  wisdom of the whole party. The work of drafting the "decision"  was carried out under the direct collective leadership of the  third generation with comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. The  "decision" draws on the collective wisdom of the whole party and  reflects the common will of the entire party and the people of  all nationalities throughout the country.  <H6>  III </H6>   The 3d Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC Congress  adopted the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some  Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market  Economic Structure" at the dignified Hall of the People on 14  November. Just like a huge rock hitting the water, the  "decision" has created a strong impact at home and abroad.    An influential foreign press commented: "The 3d Plenary  Session of the 14th National CPC Congress which adopted the  "decision" is of tremendous significance. Its significance is  only next to the important talks given by Deng Xiaoping during  his inspection tour in South China in spring last year and the  party's 14th National Congress in the fall. If these three  important stages are likened to a triple jump, then the Third  Plenary Session is the last jump."    This document clearly portrays the basic framework of the  socialist market economic structure. It is the overall plan and  program of action in building our new system. It systematically  works out the details of the reform targets for the development  of a socialist market economic structure as put forward by the  14th National CPC Congress. It not only fully reflects Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory, thinking and viewpoints in building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, but also makes new  developments and breakthroughs on the basis of what was achieved  at the 14th National CPC Congress.    The establishment of a socialist market economic structure  is  a pioneering undertaking and a kind of historic exploration.  What helps us to decide on reform measures and judge their  advantages or disadvantages are the "three conducive's" --  whether or not these measures are conducive to developing the  productive forces in a socialist society, to enhancing the  overall national strength of a socialist nation and to raising  the people's living standard. All our reform measures are  basically aimed at emancipating and developing the productive  forces to the greatest extent. All the guidelines and policies  laid down by the "decision" and its point of departure and final  goal are also aimed at further emancipating and developing the  productive forces.    It is precisely for this reason that we are able to  explicitly put forward the need to "establish a modern  enterprise system which meets the requirements of the market  economy and in which the property rights as well as the rights  and responsibilities of enterprises are clearly defined,  government administration and enterprise management are  separated and scientific management is established."    It is precisely for this reason that we are able to clearly  put forward the need to "establish a nationwide integrated and  open market system to closely combine the urban market with the  rural market and link the domestic market with the international  market, so as to optimize the allocation of resources."    It is precisely for this reason that we are able to boldly  put forward the need to "transform the government functions in  economic management and establish a sound macro-economic control  system which chiefly relies on indirect means so as to ensure  the healthy operation of the national economy."    It is precisely for this reason that we are able to  repeatedly stress the need to "establish an income distribution  system which takes the principle of `to each according to his  work' as its mainstay, gives priority to efficiency while taking  fairness into account so as to encourage some localities and  people to become prosperous first and adhere to the road to  common prosperity."    It is precisely for this reason that we are able to clearly  point out the need to "establish a multi-layered social security  system and provide both urban and rural people with a degree of  security commensurate with China's reality so as to promote  economic development and social stability."    The aforementioned five aspects particularly emphasized in  the "decision" constitute the main contents in developing the  socialist market economic structure. If we liken the socialist  market economic structure to a mansion. The aforementioned five  aspects are like the five major pillars of the mansion. The  foundation of the mansion is the structure of the ownership  system with the publicly owned economic sector constituting the  mainstay and various other economic sectors developing  simultaneously. The basic aim in building this mansion is to  emancipate and develop the socialist productive forces to the  greatest extent.    We have noted that in drawing the outline of the framework,  the "decision," first of all, emphasized the principle of  regarding the public-owned economic sector as the mainstay with  various other economic sectors developing simultaneously.    The framework of the socialist market economic structure set  by the "decision" represents the organic integration of the  basic socialist system with the socialist market economic  structure and it is imbued with the distinctive features of  China's socialism at its preliminary stage. It constitutes a  major breakthrough made by the 14th National CPC Congress and an  important contribution to the theory of socialism.    Another breakthrough of the "decision" is to put forward the  need to transform the government functions with the aim to  establish a sound macroeconomic control system.    Right now, more and more people have realized that a sound  macroeconomic control system is a general requirement in  developing the market economic structure. It is an important  component part of the socialist market economic structure.  Showing great foresight, the "decision" put forward the need to  establish a sound macroeconomic control system and emphatically  pointed out the need to "rationally delineate the powers of the  central and local authorities over economic administration and  bring into full play the initiative of both the central and  local authorities." It is precisely on this foundation that the  "decision" explicitly put forward the major reform measures to  be adopted in the near future. Either in promoting the reform of  the monetary and taxation system, quickening the pace to reform  the financial system or deepening and accelerating the reform of  the investment and planning system, the "decision" invariably  tried to make breakthroughs in establishing and improving the  macroeconomic control.    The "decision" also rendered a brilliant exposition on  developing the legal system. It pointed out that the socialist  market economic structure internally includes the development of  a legal system. Only in the legal form can comparatively  matured and good systems be reaffirmed, and only by forming a  system, can legal measures be consolidated. While trying to  establish the market economic system by the end of the century,  it is necessary to set up a legal system which meets the  requirements in developing market economy. In carrying out all  types of reform, the "decision" invariably placed emphasis on  the development of the legal system. It explicitly pointed out  that many reform measures must be carried out "according to law."    Some people say that the "decision" is an important document  in Marxist political economy. It is vast in knowledge and rich  in contents. It has made not only breakthroughs and developments  in the aforementioned aspects, but also new proposals of great  significance in theory and in practice on socialist economic  theories and policies.    The "decision" put forward a new point of view that "with  the fluidity and reshuffling of property rights, there are more  and more economic entities with mixed ownership. This will bring  forth a new structure of ownership." This point of view will  become an important trend of development in China's economic  realm in the future.    The "decision" put forward that, "The state should create  conditions for economic sectors under different kinds of  ownership to compete in the market on equal terms, and should  deal with the various types of enterprises without  discrimination." To create conditions for competition on equal  terms is an important function of the government under the  conditions of market economy. It is a requirement in ensuring  the healthy development of market economy and promoting system  and policy standardization.    With regard to the system of income distribution to  individuals, the "decision" put forward the principle of giving  priority to efficiency while taking fairness into account." It  attached more importance to efficiency. It pointed out: "It is  necessary to permit the distribution of earnings by capital and  other production factors belonging to individuals." This is a  requirement for all economic sectors and all forms of income  distribution to develop simultaneously. With regard to the  reform of the rural economic system, the "decision" put forward  that the term for contracting cultivated land may be extended,  the inheritance of contracts for the management of explorative  undertakings and the compensated transfer of the land-use rights  be allowed. The "decision" also made new breakthroughs in  building small cities and townships and reforming the household  registration system....[XINHUA ellipsis]    Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory in building socialism with  Chinese characteristics has, for the first time, systematically  answered the series of questions on how to build, consolidate  and develop socialism in economically and culturally backward  China. With a scientific approach of emancipating the mind and  seeking truth from facts, the "decision" which was born under  the guidance of this theory has scored new achievements in  integrating Marxism with China's reality today, and once again  demonstrated the courage and creativeness of the Chinese  Communists in continuously opening up and keenly seeking  advancement. It will definitely play a significant role in  guiding and promoting the development of the reform and opening  up program and the undertaking for socialist construction.    For the past 15 years, we have scored universally  acknowledged glorious achievements. During the last seven years  of this century, we will preliminarily establish the socialist  market economic structure.    This constitutes a great pioneering undertaking  unprecedented in the history of mankind, another trans-century  achievement in carrying out China's reform and opening-up  program and another major and profound change in the Chinese  society.    "Solid ice has been broken, the navigation channel open to  traffic, and the road clearly pointed out." We are filled with  confidence in face of the new century!</p>

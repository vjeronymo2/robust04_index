			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY DOESN'T BELIEVE DEFENDANT'S STORIES OF SHOOTING, CONVICTS HIM  </P> <P> Joseph Angelo Grosso was convicted Wednesday of attempted first-degree murder  and conspiracy in the shooting of Santa Ana nightclub financier William  Carroll.  </P> <P> The conviction could have implications for Los Angeles racketeer Michael  Anthony Rizzitello, who is scheduled to go on trial for the Carroll shooting  Dec. 11. Prosecutors charge that Rizzitello, with Grosso's help, shot Carroll  after Rizzitello had made an unsuccessful attempt to take over the now-defunct  Mustang Club, a topless bar in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Both Grosso and Carroll testified that it was Rizzitello -- listed by the state  attorney general's office as an underboss in the Los Angeles-based Milano crime  family -- who pulled the trigger in the 1987 shooting that left Carroll blind.  Carroll, 56, said that Grosso, 46, held him down to prevent his escape.  </P> <P> Rizzitello, 62, has denied through his attorney, Anthony P. Brooklier, that he  participated in the Carroll shooting.  </P> <P> Jury foreman Kathleen Bruck of Costa Mesa said the jurors believed Carroll's  testimony that Rizzitello was the man who shot him and that Grosso was a  participant.  </P> <P> Grosso testified that he did not know that Rizzitello was going to shoot  Carroll, after the three had dinner together. Grosso predicted that he will be  killed because he testified against Rizzitello. The two are being held in  separate sections of the Orange County Jail.  </P> <P> On the witness stand, Grosso also admitted that he had told "probably more than  25" different versions about the shooting.  </P> <P> "We tried to show the jurors that Mr. Grosso had to tell different stories  about what happened to protect himself from being killed," said Grosso's  attorney, William Yacobozzi Jr. "But obviously they did not accept that."  </P> <P> Grosso, who faces an automatic sentence of 25 years to life in prison, was  found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, attempted first-degree murder, and  mayhem. Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn Jr. set a Dec. 12 sentencing date.  </P></p>

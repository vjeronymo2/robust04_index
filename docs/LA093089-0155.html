			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE JUDGE: ARBITRATION PANEL ASSISTS IN SETTLING FEE DISPUTES  </P> <P> Q. I have been involved in a long and expensive divorce. It was finally  resolved this year, but it was so traumatic that I truly never want to see the  inside of the courthouse again.  </P> <P> I just received my attorney's bill, and I am absolutely flabbergasted over the  amount. I have tried to speak to him about it, but he never returns my calls. I  don't want to pay the bill since I don't feel it's fair.  </P> <P> Please tell me what I can do. I don't want to be sued, and have to go back to  court!  </P> <P> J.E.,  </P> <P> Irvine  </P> <P> A. The Orange County Bar Assn. has a Mandatory Fee Arbitration Committee that  is made up of qualified attorneys who hear cases involving fee disputes between  an attorney and the client.  </P> <P> If the amount of the disputed fee is $5,000 or less, a single arbitrator will  hear the case. In all other cases, a panel of three arbitrators will determine  the amount of the fee, if any, owed to the attorney.  </P> <P> The client or the attorney may disqualify any arbitrator from hearing the case  if there is a belief that the arbitrator may not be fair.  </P> <P> The attorney and the client have a right to ask the court to hear the fee  dispute if either one is dissatisfied with the arbitration award. However, the  arbitration award becomes final if neither party makes such a request within a  certain period of time.  </P> <P> The committee does charge for its services. For more information about this  type of hearing, contact the Orange County Bar Assn. for its information  packet.  </P> <P> Q. I recently got a judgment from small claims court. However, the defendant  still refuses to pay. Is there anything I can do to get the money owed to me?  </P> <P> M.C.,  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P> <P> A. There are several ways that you can try to collect on your judgment. One of  the most commonly used methods is to garnish the wages of your judgment debtor  so that his employer withholds a portion of his paycheck in order to satisfy  your judgment.  </P> <P> Another method is to execute on any real or personal property the judgment  debtor may possess. This method would result in the property being sold in  order to satisfy your judgment.  </P> <P> You may also place a lien on real and certain personal property of the debtor.  </P> <P> If you do not know what kind of property, if any, the debtor possesses, you may  require him to appear at a judgment debtor examination and be questioned under  oath by you. If the debtor refuses to answer, he may be ordered to do so by a  judge.  </P> <P> All of the methods that I have listed assume that the debtor has property of  some kind. If he does not, you may be out of luck. Contact the Municipal Court  that heard your small claims case for more information about these methods.  </P> <P> B.

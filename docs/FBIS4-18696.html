			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The debate on the "Macedonian," The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM, issue and the  various parties' stance on it have elicited commentary in the  Greek press.    Writing in the 27 March Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS,  Nikos Marakis notes that the long-lasting "Macedonian" issue  highlighted the rule that foreign policy is not only the product  of diplomatic initiatives, but is influenced by internal policy,  partisan interests or even personal strategies. In fact, the  decisions of Minister of Foreign Affairs Karolos Papoulias and  his diplomatic advisers bear little authority because foreign  policy is completely controlled by Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou, whose priorities do not always coincide with those  of his ministers, Marakis comments. Papandreou's decisions are  dictated by a series of parameters, one of which is his expected  move to the presidency in 1995, at which time the votes that  Political Spring leader Andonis Samaras, a fierce opponent of a  Skopje compromise, may contribute can be "precious." According  to Marakis, this limits Papoulias and alternate Minister of  Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos' jurisdiction to matters  that have no influence on public opinion and are unrelated to  internal political processes. However, Papoulias is more likely  to carry out Papandreou's directives because he is "the more  obedient of the two," comments Marakis. The other alternate  minister, Yiorgos Papandreou, has thus far assumed a low profile  in playing the role of the prime minister's "special envoy" for  Greek-American relations. The ministry's "triangle" has  therefore failed to function as a group, with confrontation  focusing on each individual's ability to influence the prime  minister.    Turning to the New Democracy (ND), Marakis reports that when  the issue of sending Greek peacekeeping troops to Bosnia was  discussed at a meeting chaired by ND leader Miltiadhis Evert,  former ND Minister of Education Yiorgos Souflias and former ND  President of the Chamber of Deputies Athanasios Tsaldharis  "vehemently" argued that the party ought to oppose the move and  that governmental initiatives ought to be denounced. Evert and  former Minister of Defense Ioannis Varvitsiotis agreed with  them, albeit expressing reservations about a direct denunciation  of the government. Souflias and Tsaldharis admit that they are  influenced by the rivalry with Samaras, who could outflank the  ND on Skopje and steal ND votes in the June European Parliament  elections. In addition, many party members believe that Evert's  low-key opposition to PASOK fails to stress Papandreou's policy  errors, Marakis comments.    With regard to Political Spring, Marakis goes on to note  that  to date, Samaras has only derived political benefits from his  stance on the "Macedonian" issue. Samaras, he says, believes he  is the "main factor in Greece's rejection of a compromise," and  does not refute the view that he is "holding captive" the entire  political leadership. Meanwhile, Samaras has let it be  understood that he would vote for Papandreou in an eventual  presidential race if the prime minister were to follow an  uncompromising policy on the name of "Macedonia." While thus  offering a "bait" to Papandreou, Samaras is in fact becoming  enmeshed in the question of whether the country would be led to  new elections were the government to accept a compromise on  "Macedonia," Marakis concludes.</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Pirelli close to truce with Continental PIRELLI, the Italian tyre company, is close to ceasing hostilities against Continental, after a two and a half year campaign to gain control of its German rival. The Italian company last week agreed in principle to sell its 5 per cent stake in Continental and also to cancel arrangements with corporate allies who control a further 25 per cent. According to a senior executive involved in negotiations between Pirelli and Continental, attempts are being made to place this combined holding of 30 per cent in Continental with institutional investors. However the executive stressed that the share sale was not certain, because Pirelli has insisted that the disposal must be made at a premium of around 10 per cent to the market price. Under the terms of the share sale agreement, if buyers cannot be found for the entire 30 per cent, none of the shares will be sold. Continental's share price was DM208.5 last week, valuing the company at DM1.83bn (Pounds 752.5m). Continental is being advised by Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, and Morgan Grenfell, Deutsche's UK merchant banking subsidiary. Morgan and Deutsche's securities arm are leading the process of finding buyers for the shares. Pirelli has in the past claimed to control more than 40 per cent of Continental shares. It has options giving it the right to buy 30 per cent from allies. In addition, Pirelli also believed that two other holders of Continental shares, controlling 10 per cent, were supporters. However, Continental believes that a placing of only 30 per cent would end hostilities between the two companies. Pirelli has made huge losses as a result of its raid on Continental. It and its allies bought their shares when they were priced at more than DM300. The Italian company's original intention was to force Continental to buy its tyre subsidiary, to create Europe's biggest tyre manufacturer. Continental rejected the merger plan on advice from Morgan. Since then, the two companies have been locked in legal disputes about whether Pirelli has voting rights over the shares it holds under option. Continental has been keen to end the dispute because it has absorbed management and financial resources. In addition, Pirelli was able last summer to block Continental's attempts to raise new capital.</p>

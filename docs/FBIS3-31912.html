			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The funds to pay Banco Latino depositors, beginning  on 28 January, have already been deposited into the Central Bank  of Venezuela [BCV]. In addition, the possibility of also making  such payments at branches of the government-intervened bank on  29 and 30 January is being analyzed.    Esperanza Martino, Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund]  president,  has said her organization has deposited funds into the BCV to  settle Banco Latino debts with small-savings account holders.  Those who have accounts with less than 100,000 bolivares--that  is, about 326,000 accounts--will be paid during the first phase.  Meanwhile, those account holders who have up to 1 million  bolivares must wait until Fogade makes a 60-billion bolivar  deposit.    Meanwhile, Colonel (Numa Coz Briceno), Metropolitan Police  Intelligence Division chief, has said a large-scale operation  will be conducted beginning 28 January around Banco Latino  branches to protect depositors from possible holdups.    [Begin recording] [Martino] We have already issued bonds and  believe approximately 25 billion bolivares are available. We  have asked the BCV to advance 60 billion bolivares....    [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] I beg your pardon.    [Martino] 60 billion bolivares.    [Reporter] In addition to the 25 billion bolivares?    [Martino] In addition to the 25 billion bolivares. We are  procuring funds to make them available to the BCV. I want to  tell you that we are maintaining a perfect relation with the  BCV, and we are working together. I think we will have good  news for account holders. [end recording]</p>

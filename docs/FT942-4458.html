			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: IBM seeks lifting of decree IBM wants to persuade the US courts to lift restrictions on its computer services business, imposed in a 1956 anti-trust consent decree. The decree forces IBM to separate its US 'outsourcing' business, which manages computer centres on behalf of customers, from other operations. IBM lawyers this week discussed the decree with a New York Federal judge, but have not filed any motions with the court. The decree arose from a 1952 government complaint alleging IBM had monopolised the market for tabulating machines, the precursor to the electronic computer. The terms of the decree include orders that IBM must operate its 'service bureaux' business as a separate wholly-owned subsidiary, which must pay for IBM computer equipment and software on the same terms as its competitors in the service business. The decree also restricts IBM in its sales of used computer equipment. It may only acquire used computers when they are traded in or exchanged for credit on new equipment. It must then go through a 60-day listing and remarketing procedure before it can sell the equipment. 'We think the decree operates to the disadvantage of customers by artificially raising our costs and preventing us from passing on to our customers the benefits of our integrated operations in marketing, services, manufacturing and development,' IBM said.</p>

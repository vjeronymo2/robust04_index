In their meeting, Kim proposed that Romanian industries set  up subsidiaries and stage goods fairs here while Ionescu, who is  visiting with Romanian President Ion Iliescu, suggested that the  two countries exchange trade delegations and private-sector  visits in a bid to narrow the current trade imbalance.    Seoul sold goods worth 80 million U.S. dollars to Bucharest  and imported products worth 6 million dollars to record a  74-million-dollar surplus last year.</p>

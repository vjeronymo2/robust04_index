			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Intrigue swirls about Israeli power brokers RABBI Menachem Porush, a leading figure among Israel's ultra-orthodox religious parties, broke off campaigning for next Tuesday's general election to travel to Cairo this week at the invitation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Speculation flashed around Israel that Mr Mubarak was seeking to persuade the venerable rabbi that, after the election, his United Torah Judaism party should side with Mr Yitzhak Rabin's Labour party - and its commitment to accelerate Middle East peace talks - in coalition bargaining. If so, he did not appear to be very successful. Rabbi Porush declared that the religious parties tended to favour the hardline Likud party. But Mr Mubarak may well be correct in assuming that the black-hatted religious parties will play a power-broking role in the formation of the next government. He may also be right if he reckons Mr Porush's statement may not be the last word from the mysterious and intrigue-riddled ultra-orthodox. First, the parties have to secure their seats in the Knesset. The influx of overwhelmingly secular Russian immigrants has diluted their strength in the electorate. This, plus a welter of corruption allegations surrounding orthodox party, has led to predictions that the four religious parties will fail to hold the 18 seats they won in the 120-seat Knesset in the 1988 election. What's more, the ultra-orthodox parties are concerned that Labour and Likud are plotting to unite against them, to cut down their power-broking influence and conscript into the army their hitherto exempt young men. There has been a significant re-alignment in their ranks. The National Religious party, whose members do not wear the black garb of the ultra-orthodox, is unchanged, broadly aligned with Likud. But two of the other three, Agudat Yisrael and Degel HaTorah, have combined to form the United Torah Judaism party, attracting to their ranks a former leading member of the Shas party. A fierce battle lies behind this change. Degel, a party of Lithuanian 'Ashkenazi' Jews, used to be close to Shas, the party of 'Sephardi', or Oriental religious Jews. But Rabbi Eliezer Schach, the 96-year-old spiritual leader of Degel, shifted amid much bad blood to an alliance with his fellow Ashkenazim of Agudat Yisrael. This seemed odd, as Rabbi Schach has long been at odds with fellow nonagenarian Rabbi Menachem Schneerson of Brooklyn. The ailing Rabbi Schneerson is a leading influence in Agudat despite never having set foot in Israel. Secular Jews, never mind gentiles like Mr Mubarak, find all this hard to penetrate. However, there are other pointers to how the parties may act apart from Rabbi Porush's statements. Both Rabbis Schach and Schneerson opposed Labour in its previous attempt, in 1990, to set up a pro-peace government. They are also united by their hatred of what they see as the anti-religious stance of Labour. The religious parties always require large dollops of public money to cement their support for any government. Labour would be no less willing than the Likud to stump up. But over the last 15 years, the religious have appeared more comfortable in harness with Likud.</p>

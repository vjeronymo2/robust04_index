			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Republicans see time to break into Clinton's lead REPUBLICAN campaigners claimed yesterday that they still have time to break into Governor Bill Clinton's commanding polling lead before the US presidential election on November 3, after President George Bush once again failed to inflict any appreciable damage on his Democratic rival in Thursday night's debate. 'We've got over two weeks. That's a long time in politics,' said Vice-president Dan Quayle. But Mr Bush appeared more resigned than his ebullient running mate, all but conceding in Thursday's debate with Mr Clinton and Mr Ross Perot that he should have handed over the reins to another candidate. 'I think if Barbara Bush were running this year she'd be elected, but it's too late,' he said. Many Republicans have been desperately urging Mr Bush to take his gloves off in his assault on Mr Clinton, emulating Mr Quayle, who in his debate earlier this week with Senator Al Gore, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, relentlessly attacked Mr Clinton's policies, personality and integrity. If Mr Bush had any plans to follow this advice, he was quickly cut off by the audience of 209 uncommitted voters who had been selected to ask the questions in this second of three encounters between the three main candidates. Although he embarked briefly on what has become known as 'the character issue', criticising Governor Clinton as 'someone who demonstrates and organises demonstrations in a foreign land when his country is at war, Mr Bush appeared quickly to decide that this would win him no friends in the audience. 'The amount of time the candidates have spent in this campaign trashing their opponents' character and their programmes is depressingly large,' one questioner complained. Mr Perot, who stole the show at the first debate last Sunday with his good humour and folksy phrasing, once again managed the best one-liners, but appeared to make no headway in convincing undecided voters that he might be a serious presidential candidate. Early polling suggested that Thursday's debate had little effect on voting intentions, and there are few indications that the final debate, on Monday night, will do any more to dent Mr Clinton's lead. He is comfortably ahead in 26 states - already enough to ensure victory - and holds the advantage over Mr Bush in 12 more.</p>

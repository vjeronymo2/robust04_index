			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Revenue writes off Pounds 900m unpaid tax THE INLAND Revenue wrote off nearly Pounds 900m in unpaid taxes in 1991  - an increase of 55 per cent on 1990. The disclosure, covering the latest year for which figures are available, came in a written Commons answer from Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury. The sum written off in 1990 totalled nearly Pounds 569m, he indicated in a reply to Mr Archie Kirkwood, the Liberal Democrat MP for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. In a separate answer, Mr Dorrell disclosed that an independent survey in June 1992 suggested that one in three employed taxpayers were dissatisfied with service from the Inland Revenue. Research International, a market research group, found that only 65 per cent of employed and self-employed taxpayers were satisfied.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Elkem improves to NKr198m Elkem, the Norwegian light metals producer, reported a sharp rise in nine-month pre-tax profit to NKr198m from NKr64m, helped by increased demand for its main products. However, the rebound in aluminium prices failed to benefit the group because it had secured fixed-price, long-term contracts and forward hedging agreements in 1993 under softer prices. Primary aluminium prices shot up 40 per cent in 1994 and yesterday hit Dollars 1,800 a tonne on the London Metals Exchange, thanks in part to reductions in capacity utilisation by western producers which has contributed to lower stocks and firmer demand. At the end of last year, when LME aluminium prices were Dollars 1,125 a tonne, Elkem signed contracts covering a large part of 1994 production, but based on 1993 prices. Elkem would not disclose contractual arrangements for 1994 sales. The company plans to cut aluminium output by 10,000 tonnes from the fourth quarter and into 1995. Elkem intends to seek board approval for a four-year NKr250m investment programme for its Lista aluminium plant in Norway, for which annual capacity will be upgraded by 10,000 tonnes. Nine-month group operating profit rose to NKr333m from NKr282m but the advance was stemmed by slightly weaker third-quarter operating profits.</p>

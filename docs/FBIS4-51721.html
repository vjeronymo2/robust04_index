			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Noorzita Samad] </F>   [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Wed. -- Khazanah Holding Bhd.  [Limited], the government's new investment holding company, can  be expected to spearhead Malaysian investments in mega and  strategic projects overseas.    Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim announced  yesterday that Khazanah Holding, which will begin operations in  early June, would be allowed to make additional or new  investments in mega projects that are considered "strategic" to  the nation either locally or abroad.    Khazanah Holding will also identify several strategic  projects, which the private sector is not yet able to undertake,  and plan the governnment's investments in them accordingly. It  will also be allowed to raise funds in the domestic and  international markets by issuing shares, loan stocks, or other  types of financial instruments. "This form of financing is much  cheaper. It will also enable the government to undertake new  investments without resorting to its internal resources," he  said.    Anwar, who is also finance minister, was speaking to  reporters after sending off Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and  his delegation at Bilik Bunga Raya, Kuala Lumpur International  Airport in Subang. The prime minister, who will be Khazanah  Holding chairman, and his delegation left for a five-day  official visit to Zimbabwe.    Anwar, who will be Khazanah Holding deputy chairman, said  the  government's existing investment arm, the Minister of Finance  Inc. (MoF Inc.), will be the sole shareholder in Khazanah  Holding. Khazanah Holding has an authorised capital of RM  [Malaysian ringgit] 500 million and a paid-up capital of RM100  million. Anwar said Khazanah would take over the management of  the bulk of the government's equity investment currently being  overseen by MoF Inc.    "The government will identify which assets to be transferred  to Khazanah. Not all (of the equity investments) will be placed  under the new entity. The assets will be transferred in  stages," he said    MoF Inc. holds shares in 37 companies worth RM72.5 billion  based on the current market value and RM7.59 billion at par  value. These include shares in listed companies like Tenaga  Nasional Bhd. [electricity company], Telekom Malaysia Bhd.,  Edaran Otomobil Nasional Bhd. (Proton) as well as in unlisted  ones like National Oil Corporation Petronas, Heavy Industries  Malaysia Bhd., and Perwaja Steel Industries Sdn. Bhd. [Private  Limited]. It is understood that initially about RM40 billion of  the investments will be taken over by Khazanah Holding.    Anwar said Khazanah Holding will have six directors -- three  from the public sector and another three from the private  sector. "Khazanah Holding will have a team of professional  managers. Its policy, however, will be ascertained by the Board  of Directors chaired by the prime minister," he added.    Anwar said the government decided to form Khazanah Holding  in  view of the increasing equity investments in MoF Inc. as the  privatisation and corporatisation of government-owned  enterprises gained momentum in 1990s. This in turn calls for  more professional and systematic management of the assets, he  added.    Anwar said to protect the government's interests, the  company  is required to submit its annual statement of accounts to the  auditor general. The documents will also be forwarded to  Parliament.    Anwar also outlined various functions of the new holding  company. These include:     -  Drawing up the medium-and long-term  corporate plans for the group' participation in the private  sector, especially in new priority areas;    -  preparing strategies  to enhance efficiency, productivity, and profitability of the  companies in its stable [as published] so that returns from the  investments can be maximised; and    -  undertaking additional or new  investments in mega projects which are "strategic" to the nation  either locally or abroad.    Anwar said as the companies improved their profitability,  Khazanah Holding is expected to receive larger dividends. "Most  of the dividends will be channelled to the federal government,  being the sole shareholder through the MoF Inc. The revenue  will be used for various purposes, particularly to finance  development projects."</p>

A claim subject to the statute of limitations is an Indian claim for money damages which arose prior to July 18, 1966. Claims against the United States are not governed by this law, only money damage claims against persons, corporations, states, or any other entities except the Federal Government. Claims for title to land are also not governed by this statute of limitations. This notice is required by section 5(c) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to sections 3 and 4 of the Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982, lists of all potential Indian damage claims, which had at any time been identified by or submitted to the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the Department of the Interior's Statute of Limitations Program, were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 48 FR 13698, on March 31, 1983, amended at 48 FR 15008, on April 6, 1983; and at 48 FR 51204, on November 7, 1983, amended at 49 FR 518, on January 4, 1984. Excluded from these lists were claims which were erroneously identified as claims and those which had no legal merit whatsoever.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When rejecting any claim or category of claims included on the published lists, the Secretary must send a report to the appropriate tribe whose rights or the rights of whose members could be affected by the rejection. The report must identify each separate claim being rejected, list the names of potential plaintiffs and defendants, if known or reasonably ascertainable, and briefly set forth the reason or reasons for rejection. A written notice of rejection must be sent to individual Indian claimants if their identities and addresses are known or reasonably ascertainable from Bureau of Indian Affairs records. After a report has been forwarded to a tribe, the Secretary must publish a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  identifying the claims covered in the report. By the terms of the Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982, any right of action on any claim appearing on the following list of claims, which have been rejected and reported accordingly by the Secretary, shall be barred unless a complaint is filed in accordance with date established in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DATES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this notice.

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Book Review: Food for thought BEYOND BEEF: the rise and fall of the cattle culture By Jeremy Rifkin Dutton books. Dollars 21. 353 pages Beef consumption represents one of the gravest threats to the future well-being of the earth and its human population. A week ago, I would have dismissed Jeremy Rifkin's claim as absurd. Having read Beyond Beef, I am not so sure. Mr Rifkin, an American author and green activist, has doubtless overstated his case. But his diatribe raises questions that deserve far greater attention. His first, startling point concerns the world's extraordinary reliance on beef. There are nearly 1.3bn cattle spread across six continents. They occupy nearly a quarter of the total land space and consume about a third of the world's grain harvest. This passion for beef is increasing poverty in the Third World, damaging the global environment and threatening the health of affluent consumers in the US, Europe and - increasingly - Japan. The argument about poverty is straightforward. An acre of cereal can produce five times as much protein as an acre devoted to meat production; an acre of legumes (beans or lentils) 10 times more; an acre of leafy vegetables, 15 times more. More than 1.3bn people in the Third World are reckoned to be chronically underfed. If only a portion of the land occupied by cattle were turned over to crop production, most could be fed at no net cost to the developed world. The environmental case against cattle appears equally compelling. The billions of hooves trampling the world's surface are destroying natural habitats, stripping away vegetation, eroding soil and contributing to desert-like conditions in Asia, Africa and the Americas. Some 40 per cent of the Amazon rain forest has been cleared for cattle-grazing, despite unsuitable soil conditions. The obsession with cattle is also leading to water shortages. Nearly half the water consumed in the US goes to grow feed for cattle and other livestock. Cattle account for a sizeable portion of all methane emissions, thus contributing directly to global warming. If red meat were good for us, all this might perhaps be justified. Yet scientific opinion is shifting towards the view that an ideal human diet would be based mainly on vegetables, grains and fruit. Some three-quarters of deaths in the US are reckoned to result directly from poor diets, including excessive intake of saturated fats and cholesterol. The incidence of colon cancer in the west, for example, is up to 10 times higher than in non-beef-eating Asian cultures. Beef addiction (nearly 7bn hamburgers a year are consumed in the US alone) also helps explain why more than a quarter of Americans are clinically overweight. While lack of grain leads to starvation in developing countries, these portly individuals spend Dollars 5bn a year trying to get thin. Billions of dollars are also wasted on wholly unnecessary medical bills. Rifkin, while strong on the practical cost to human beings of excessive beef consumption, also raises troubling ethical questions about the things we do to cattle. 'Modern meat is a testimonial to the utilitarian ethos . . . Cattle are dehorned, castrated, injected with hormones and antibiotics, sprayed with insecticides, placed on a cement slab, and fed grains, sawdust, sludge and sewage until they reach the appropriate weight. The animals are transported by truck to automated slaughterhouses, where they are killed, disassembled into their constituent parts, mixed, moulded, shaped and reconstituted into useful products . . .' Can we really justify this behaviour when more people could be fed - and more kept healthy - by growing beans? Rifkin reminds us that the word 'cattle' is derived from the words 'capital' and 'chattel'. In a fascinating historical discussion, he traces man's relationship with the bovine from ancient Egypt, where the bull and cow were worshipped as icons of our virility and fertility, to the mass concrete feedlots of the American mid-west, where they are raw industrial inputs. He shows how the British aristocracy's love for fatty cuts of beef - and its willingness to finance American ranches in the 19th century - helped change tastes throughout the world. And he documents how the cattle industry - the first form of mobile capital - repeatedly led developments in other sectors: Henry Ford, for example, got the idea of an assembly line from the Chicago meat-packers. The author sees the changed status of cattle as a metaphor for the evils wrought by modern capitalism: 'We have substituted mechanism for organism, utilitarianism for spiritualism, and market values for community standards, turning ourselves from beings to resources.' He exaggerates. But the over-production of cattle, while encouraged by public subsidies, remains a good example of the way capitalism can have globally irrational consequences if it fails to take all the costs of production into account. In calling for the renunciation of beef today, Rifkin is decades ahead of public opinion: in due course, however, I have no doubt that red meat will go the same way as tobacco. We must prepare to apologise for this anti-social and unhealthy habit.</p>

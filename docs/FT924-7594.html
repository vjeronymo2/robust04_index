			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Unpicking the US and UK savings paradoxes BOTH THE US and Britain, according to conventional economic wisdom, have savings problems. But is their shared problem too much or too little saving? The answer, confusingly, is that both statements are true. The depth of the UK recession, and the failure of economic forecasters to predict its lingering nature, is largely explained by the uncharacteristic willingness of consumers to save rather than spend. Since 1988, the UK household savings ratio has doubled from a 1980s low of 5.1 per cent to 11 per cent in the first quarter of 1992. This occurred because consumer borrowing, which counts as negative saving, has dropped sharply. The UK personal savings ratio is still lower than its main European competitors although it is now roughly comparable. The household savings ratio in 1991 was 13.7 per cent in Germany, 12.7 per cent in France and 15.6 per cent in Italy. The US, according to the released data, has a much lower household savings ratio. According to the latest data, the US household savings ratio was a mere 4.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year, down from 5.3 per cent in the previous quarter but still well above its 1980s low of 3.1 per cent in 1987. The implication is that US consumers cannot increase their consumption as much as can UK consumers by reducing their rate of savings. Yet this transatlantic comparison is misleading. The US household savings ratio refers to personal savings and income, net of depreciation charges, rather than to gross savings and income as is the normal practice in Europe. In 1990, the US authorities deducted Dollars 229m (Pounds 151.6m) to cover the depreciation of fixed household assets, equivalent to 6 per cent of total consumption. Half of this depreciation applies to the decline in the imputed value of housing wealth. Mr Albert Edwards, an economist at Kleinwort Benson Securities, the investment bank, has calculated the gross US household savings ratio by restoring these depreciation charges. His adjusted US gross savings ratio is shown in the left-hand chart. The UK gross household savings ratio has, in fact, been converging on US levels in recent years. UK gross household savings fell much further than US savings in the 1980s but have since caught up. The US gross ratio was 10.7 per cent in the third quarter of this year while the latest UK figure was 10.3 per cent in the second quarter. Both countries need a fall in household savings to fuel recovery. Yet the medium-term economic performance of both countries has been hampered by too little national savings, not too much. National savings is the sum of private and public saving. The US government has been a net borrower throughout the 1980s while the UK government is expected next year to have twice as large a budget deficit, relative to the size of its economy, as the US. In theory, there should be little relationship between rates of national savings and investment so long as low-saving countries are free to borrow internationally. In fact, the correlation between national savings and investment over the past 30 years is strong, as the right-hand chart shows. High saving countries have tended to invest a higher share of their national output, a relationship that has persisted throughout the 1980s. That is why the new US administration aims to raise the US national savings rate, and why that means tackling the budget deficit.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: NATIONAL ACCOUNTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures for GNP/GDP are in billions of European currency units (Ecu).

Statistics for Germany apply only to western Germany. GNP/GDP is broken down into private consumption expenditure, investment (the sum of gross fixed capital formation and the change in stocks), general government final consumption, and net exports (exports of goods and services minus imports of goods and services). The US includes investment by government in the government series rather than under investment.  Quarterly GNP/GDP totals are annualised. The growth rates are the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The figures in the fifth column of each set of growth rates refer only to exports, rather than to net exports.

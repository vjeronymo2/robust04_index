Addressing  journalists, he said his "prolonged meetings with Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and First Vice Premier Oleg  Soskovets," which took place on Wednesday, gave him hope that  the military budget would be increased.    Let us remind you, on the eve of his visit to Kaliningrad,  Pavel Grachev sharply criticized the military budget proposed by  the Finance Ministry and regards the allocated funds as  insufficient. The defense minister also laid great hopes on the  State Duma which, in his opinion, "is not indifferent to the  fate of the defense capacity of our state."</p>

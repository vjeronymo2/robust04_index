			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- A government panel is urging  a dismantling of official curbs on participation by domestic and  international business concerns in Japan's telecommunications  and broadcasting markets, according to its report to be released  later this week.    KYODO NEWS SERVICE obtained a copy of the report, compiled  by  the panel of three economists and an industrialist who are  serving on the Information and Telecommunications Subcommittee  of a government council on deregulation, headed by Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata.    The report says the government "should abolish or review  restrictions on participation in the telecommunications and  broadcasting fields, because curbs placed by the bureaucracy  that forecasts the supply and demand situation contravenes the  principles of a market economy."    "The government should eliminate a partition between  international and domestic telecommunications operators," the  report said.    At present, international telecommunication operators like  KDD and domestic telecommunication operators like Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) are barred from moving into  each other's turf.    The report also says the government should "authorize  participation by local telecommunications operators in  long-range telecommunication fields by allowing the local  concerns to link up their networks with each other."    The report featuring these recommendations will be submitted  for scrutiny and approval by Posts and Telecommunications  Minister Katsuyuki Hikasa and other related cabinet ministers at  their meeting, slated for Saturday [28 May], government sources  said.    However, the report cautioned that unusually rapid  deregulation in these fields might trigger confusion, urging the  government to take precautionary steps to prevent a possible  outbreak of chaos.    All or some of these recommendations will be included in a  package of economic measures to be announced by the government  in June. The pacakge is designed to eliminate possible seeds of  conflict between the Japanese economy and the international  community, the sources said.    The report also proposed changing a possible role of the  bureaucracy from a regulator to a mediator who would "amend the  imbalance between those with ample information and those  without, while extending a helping hand to those who suffer  disadvantages."    Demanding greater emphasis on consumers' interests, the  report also recommended creating a "more flexible fee system as  well as a system under which the benefits of a lower cost  stemming from a more efficacious management could be passed on  to beneficiaries."    It also proposed the elimination of a law regulating the  operators of cable television, saying, "the CATV law that  regulates operators' facilities and the contents of their  businesses is unnecessary."    The panelists are IBM Japan Ltd. Chairman Takeo Shiina,  Hitotsubashi University Prof. emeritus Kenichi Imai, Rikkyo  University Prof. Masayuki Funada, as well as a noted commentator  on economic affairs, Naoki Tanaka.</p>

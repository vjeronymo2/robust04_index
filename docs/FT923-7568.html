			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Corporate sector health improves THE FINANCIAL health of the corporate sector improved last year, according to an article to appear in the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, published tomorrow. In spite of falling profits and rising dividend payments, companies undertook stringent cost control measures including cuts in employment, investment and stocks. But capital gearing is still high and many sectors remain in a fragile state despite a 45 per cent increase in company insolvencies last year, the Bank says. The longer a recovery is delayed, the greater will be the damage to the real economy. Gross trading profits of UK industrial and commercial companies, excluding the newly privatised electricity companies, fell by 5 per cent last year but profitability remained higher than in previous recessions. Gross trading profits were Pounds 74.3bn in 1991 - Pounds 68bn when North Sea oil profits are excluded. The real rate of return has fallen from 11.5 per cent in 1988 to 7.3 per cent in the first quarter of last year. The overall fall in profitability has been at least as severe as in the 1980-81 recession, when the rate of return fell from a peak of 8.9 per cent to a trough of 5.6 per cent. But the fall in profitability for non-North Sea oil companies was much sharper in 1980-81. Manufacturers appear to have been able to maintain their domestic profit margins last year because of falling wage inflation and input prices, although the Bank suspects that these estimates may not take into account the effects of price discounting on profit margins. But export margins were pared back sharply, the report says, as companies strived to maintain price competitiveness and market share against a background of worsening labour competitiveness and weakening overseas demand. UK manufacturers are still earning a lower rate of return than their international competitors, despite making up some of the ground in the 1980s. The Bank says high real interest rates have encouraged companies to strengthen and restructure their balance sheets. Total company income fell by 3 per cent last year, but the financial deficit of the corporate sector fell to Pounds 11bn from Pounds 24bn in 1991. Last year, companies repaid Pounds 3bn of bank borrowing while net issues of ordinary shares rose threefold during the year. The Bank of England report expresses surprise that against this background of severely restrained profitability and cost-cutting, industrial and commercial companies have chosen to raise their aggregate dividend payments by 7 per cent last year with a further strong rise in the first quarter of this year. In spite of a Pounds 3bn fall in total income, the dividend pay-out ratio was slightly up on 1990 and remains high by historical standards. Even at the current stage in the economic cycle, managers feel obliged to provide shareholders with a constant stream of income and minimise the threat of takeover, the report says. Increasing dividends has meant that the burden of adjustment has had to fall on employment and investment. The fall in capital investment has been steeper than in the last recession, although gross domestic fixed capital formation remains higher than in 1979-81 as a percentage of gross domestic product. The Bank expects that as output recovers, a cyclical improvement in productivity should enable companies to widen their profit margins. But the longer the recovery is delayed, it says, the more likely it is that capacity will be scrapped and the greater the damage to the real economy.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Japan agrees stimulus package Japan's government was struggling to restore public confidence yesterday as a deepening recession plus the resignation of a cabinet minister threatened to delay political reform beyond the year-end deadline. The seven-party coalition agreed to launch early next week the fourth economic stimulus package this year. It will include Y5,000bn to Y6,000bn (Pounds 31.4bn to Pounds 37.7bn) of income and other tax cuts, a further reduction in bureaucratic controls, lower taxes on land sales and measures to stimulate the stock market, said officials. Details have yet to be settled, particularly about how to fund the income tax cut, on which the coalition is deeply split. The move is a clear sign that government concern over the economy, which has failed to respond to record low interest rates and a boost in public spending, has reached a new phase. The gross national product for the third quarter and the Bank of Japan's quarterly review of business confidence are to be published next week and both are expected to show deepening gloom. Today's annual report on Japan by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development warns that growth prospects are not encouraging. Recent stock market falls have reinforced the need for economic action. The government has had to give priority to a supplementary budget, needed to finance the previous spending package, at a time when it was hoping to be pushing political reform. This makes it unlikely that Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, will get parliamentary clearance by the end of the year for plans to reform the corrupt electoral system, said officials of his Japan New Party. 'We just don't have the time to worry about political reforms. Our immediate attention is on the economy,' said one official. The government lost a valuable day of parliamentary business yesterday when Mr Keisuke Nakanishi, director general of the defence agency - the Japanese equivalent of defence minister - created an uproar by calling for the pacifist constitution to be revised to allow Japanese soldiers to take a larger combat role under United Nations command. Mr Nakanishi resigned, to be succeeded by Mr Kazuo Aichi of the Japan Renewal Party. OECD urges reforms, Page 4 Editorial Comment, Page 15 Industry survey, Pages 27-32</p>

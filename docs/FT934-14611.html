			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Blick says it plans acquisition BLICK, the communications systems and time products company, announced yesterday that it was in discussions which might 'lead to the acquisition of a substantial business'. This is thought to mean between Pounds 40m and Pounds 60m. At the same time, the group estimated pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 would be not less than Pounds 9.3m (Pounds 8.6m). It also revealed cash balances at the year-end were more than Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 7.3m). It said it intended to lift the final dividend to 6.9p (6.2p) to make 10.2p (9.2p) for the year. Mr Ian Scott-Gall, managing director, said Blick had been 'stalking' the acquisition for some time and that heads of agreement had been signed in the summer. The negotiations, in effect, had prevented the group rebriefing its broker, he said, and that the share price had been 'under attack'. He added that he was aware of what had happened recently to Tiphook and Automated Security (Holdings) and that he did not want the group's silence to be misinterpreted. As it is, the estimates are largely in line with most analysts' expectations. Some analysts, however, have suggested the release of the estimates is an effort to stop the downward pressure on the shares, because Blick will have to issue paper to make the acquisition. Mr Scott-Gall said: 'We are happy to gear up if an acquisition is on the cards.' On February 5 the shares stood at 565p; on October 11, they fell 11p to 453p; and yesterday they declined a further 8p to 445p. Possible acquisition candidates include Granada's Electronic Rentals, Cable &amp; Wireless's Telephone Rentals, or part of Plessey unwanted by GEC. The deal is likely to be priced on a cash-flow basis with adjustments for the value of the assets.</p>

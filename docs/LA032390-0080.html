			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDENT RECORDS FOUND IN DISARRAY AT 3 HIGH SCHOOLS  </P> <P> A state investigation of student records at three Inglewood high schools has  uncovered serious record-keeping problems that apparently allowed some students  to graduate even though their transcripts showed they had not completed  required course work.  </P> <P> In addition, the study found numerous discrepancies between grades on teachers'  logs and those recorded in the transcripts.  </P> <P> The most significant problem uncovered in the review by the state Department of  Education occurred at Morningside High School, where records indicate that four  of 16 randomly selected seniors who graduated last June had not completed all  the graduation requirements.  </P> <P> One graduate's records showed the student had completed only half of the 20  required science credits. Another was missing five credits of mathematics.  Investigators said they do not know whether the records are incorrect or the  students graduated without completing required work.  </P> <P> "This is pretty serious," said James Smith, deputy superintendent for  curriculum and instructional leadership in the state Department of Education.  "Everybody who sees a diploma relies on the integrity of the process. It's not  at all trivial. It's one of the more egregious errors a school can make."  </P> <P> The investigation, requested by Supt. George McKenna last September, is a  follow-up to an internal audit conducted by the district last fall.  </P> <P> Smith said he forwarded a copy of the report, dated March 9, to McKenna earlier  this month. McKenna could not be reached for comment but district spokesman  Maurice Wiley confirmed that the report had been received.  </P> <P> The state made a copy of the report available to The Times.  </P> <P> At both Morningside and Inglewood high schools, the review team also found  discrepancies between the grades recorded in teacher log books and those on the  final student transcripts. At Hillcrest Continuation High School, where the  investigators found the fewest problems, there were no grade discrepancies.  </P> <P> Investigators said in the report that all the irregularities appeared to be  inadvertent and were probably the result of carelessness by a combination of  administrators, teachers, counselors and record clerks.  </P> <P> The review team recommended that teachers in the Inglewood Unified School  District exercise more care in recording grades and that the schools improve  their filing systems. To ensure confidentiality, the team said, the schools  should stop leaving transcripts in cardboard boxes on counselors' desks during  the day. The investigators also said the district should strengthen its system  for determining if a student qualifies for graduation.  </P> <P> "To grant a diploma to a student who failed to meet these requirements degrades  the value of the diploma for those students who have met all the criteria," the  investigators said.  </P> <P> School board members and principals at the three high schools reacted with  surprise when informed Thursday of the report's results.  </P> <P> Board President Larry Aubry said there will be "definite responses to this  situation," which he characterized as serious.  </P> <P> "I'm horrified," board member Zyra McCloud said. "The school district is in a  state of emergency. The ship is sinking."  </P> <P> Board Vice President Joseph Rouzan said he had not seen the report. "I'm  shocked to hear the superintendent has not notified us of it. What can I say  except 'Wow!' "  </P> <P> Inglewood High School Principal Lawrence Freeman angrily disputed the report's  results.  </P></p>

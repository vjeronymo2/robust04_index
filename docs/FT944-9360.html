			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Airport reports passenger record Manchester Airport yesterday reported record passenger figures of 1.4m for October - 8 per cent up on October last year and more than the airport's annual total 30 years ago. The continuing growth brought the airport's moving annual total of passengers carried to 14.72m, 12 per cent ahead of last year's total. The airport expects to reach 15m passengers this year. The increases came in spite of the withdrawal of British Airways' Los Angeles service, Canadian Airlines' flights to Toronto, South African Airways' Johannesburg service and the suspension until spring of American Airlines' New York flights. However, Aer Lingus has started a New York service from Manchester, Uzbekistan Airways has a route to Tashkent and France's Regional airline has started a service to Lille. The airport offers 175 destinations, flown by 95 airlines. Frequencies were increased on services between Manchester and Rome, Brussels, Amsterdam and Glasgow. Lauda Air will double its Vienna return flights to two a day from next March.</p>

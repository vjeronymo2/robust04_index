			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Mr Maxwell's second coming FT-SE Index: 2,545.0 (+25.5) The Mirror Group flotation gives the investing public its second chance in a decade to become minority shareholders in a Maxwell-controlled company. Past experience might suggest that no investor in his sober senses would bother. But Mirror Group differs from Maxwell Communication in some important respects. It has less debt, even if its gearing net of intangibles will be around 150 per cent. It is much more transparent, since its circulation and advertising revenues can be readily calculated. And if only for that reason, it is perhaps less likely to be the chosen vehicle for Maxwellian escapades. Nevertheless, the presence of Mr Maxwell as chairman and controlling shareholder remains the most important consideration in pricing the stock. Shareholders must brace themselves for unpredictable changes in strategic direction, adventurous accounting policies and no more disclosure than is good for them. This might suggest that the shares should be priced on a yield basis with reference to MCC. But that is tricky, since the extraordinary and opportune recovery in MCC shares shown in the chart has taken their yield from 15 per cent to 8.5 per cent in a couple of months. The initial target of the flotation appears to be a multiple of somewhere around 10, giving a total market value of Pounds 500m. On the basis of a twice-covered dividend, that would give a yield of 6.7 per cent. Even under more conventional management that might not seem unduly generous, given that the newspapers now operate at full efficiency in a relatively mature market. On the other hand, the fact that the massive Pounds 500m capital expenditure programme is virtually complete has obvious benefits for future cash flow. But however the issue is priced, it is unlikely to be one for the stags. The essence of stagging is to intercept shares on their way to the institutions; and there will be some UK institutions, at any rate, who would be reluctant to go for this one at any price.</p>

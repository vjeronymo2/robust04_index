			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ESSAYS  </P> <P> In his column, Danziger rebukes colleges and universities for encouraging  insincerity in the youth of America when they write their college application  essays.  </P> <P> Danziger muses, "What would happen if someone just wrote what he or she was  thinking?" Well, here's the start of an essay that's not at all phony, one that  Danziger might like.  </P> <P>  "If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to  know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my  parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David  Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to  know the truth."  </P> <P>  Holden lives! But, then again, he never did do well in school.  </P> <P> SUSAN EDDY  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

This was revealed by  senior members of the ruling parties on 12 January. The idea is  based on the belief that, after the passage of political reform  bills, the government needs to portray its image as a  full-fledged administration which is capable of dealing with  domestic and diplomatic political tasks, including economic  pump-priming measures, a new emergency task, and at the same  time, it needs to create conditions for tackling the regrouping  of political parties while maintaining the current framework of  the ruling coalition parties. It is expected that the cabinet  reshuffle will occur on a small scale. For example, State  Minister for Political Reform Sadao Yamahana is expected to  leave the office, and some cabinet members in charge of the  economy are also expected to be replaced. There is a plan to  transfer Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura  (representative of Sakigake [Harbinger]) -- who has taken an  opposing stance with Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], over handling of the  reorganization of the political world -- to another post.  However, the situation is fluid due to such factors as pressing  time for compilation of the fiscal 1994 draft budget.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa discussed a plan to  reshuffle the cabinet with Ichiro Ozawa at the end of last year,  and he is considering the timing and scale of the plan.    So far, it has been reported that the most probable plan  under consideration within the government and ruling parties was  to reshuffle the cabinet immediately after the passage of a  draft budget for the next fiscal year through the upcoming  ordinary Diet session. And, the prime minister had reportedly  agreed on the plan basically. However, now that political  reform bills are expected to be enacted and the government needs  to speed up efforts to create conditions for tackling the  political situation after the passage of the bills, the idea of  reshuffling the cabinet as early as at the end of the current  Diet session has cropped up. There will be no change in posts  which party leaders are now holding. The main points of the  reshuffle will be: 1) to appoint an economic expert to be chief  of the Economic Planning Agency; and 2) to strengthen chief  cabinet secretary's functions of coordination among cabinet  members, as well as between the government and the ruling  parties.    Mr. Takemura and Mr. Ozawa have different views on the  handling of political reform bills. While Mr. Takemura had  moved to compromise with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], Mr.  Ozawa has taken a hard-line stance vis-a-vis the LDP. There was  also a confrontation between Mr. Takemura and some members of  the government and ruling parties over the timing of compiling a  draft budget for the next fiscal year. For this reason  especially, both Shinseito and Komeito have demanded that Chief  Cabinet Secretary Takemura be replaced with a person who will  devote single-heartedly to a coordinating role.    Faced with such circumstances, there is speculation that Mr.  Takemura will be transferred to another cabinet post. However,  he and members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ],  who have different views from Mr. Ozawa on a strategy for  regrouping the political parties, will inevitably oppose the  plan. Although the prime minister is reportedly reluctant to  dismiss Mr. Takemura as the chief cabinet secretary, some people  think if Mr. Takemura is relieved at the same time as changes of  some economic ministers and political reform minister, this will  soften the cushion that the prime minister "dismisses Mr.  Takemura" as the chief cabinet secretary.    Moreover, Mr. Yamahana himself has indicated an intention to  resign as political reform minister if political reform bills  are enacted, since he resigned as SDPJ chairman in September  last year. Therefore, if the cabinet is reshuffled, there is the  possibility that political reform minister will be changed, or,  the post will be abolished. In this case, it is expected that  the prime minister will ask SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama to  join the cabinet in order to establish a cooperative  relationship among all the ruling parties.    However, there are views that it is inappropriate to change  economic ministers immediately before the budget compilation and  that the issue of how to deal with Mr. Takemura's post may cause  a crack in the foundation for the Hosokawa administration. For  this reason, the prime minister intends to be cautious in making  the final decision.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar dips below Y100 The US currency plunged through its post-war low against the yen in late European trading yesterday as markets attempted to tease out central bank action in its support, writes Motoko Rich. After closing in London at Y101.225, down from Y101.970, the dollar crashed through the psychological barrier of Y100 and hovered below the post-1945 low of Y100.35. In New York it finished at Y100.335 and DM1.5942, having earlier ended in London at DM1.6009. Analysts were puzzled by the dollar's fall as it defied economic fundamentals, namely a narrowing of the US trade gap with Japan. As central banks remained silent, economists warned of a crisis of confidence in the US currency if concerted intervention did not occur. The Australian dollar reached its highest level against the US dollar since August 1992, around Dollars 0.744, after reports from the Australian reserve bank suggested that interest rates would rise sooner rather than later. A narrowing of the US's trade gap with Japan was set in a context of a wider than expected US April trade gap and the highest current account gap in five years. The US's trade gap rose 22.1 per cent to Dollars 8.40bn, from March's downward revised figure of Dollars 6.87bn. The trade gap with Japan narrowed by 5.6 per cent to Dollars 5.48bn. The markets ignored the Japan figure, and chose to focus on the overall trade number, as well as the US's first-quarter current account gap of Dollars 31.90bn, cited at its highest for five years. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economist at Bank of America, said all of these figures were sufficiently close to market expectations and therefore were treated as excuses rather than specific triggers for the dollar's fall against the yen. Shaky political conditions in Japan made the dollar vulnerable, with markets expecting an imminent vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's government. 'Anything that brings forward the collapse of the Hata government is probably bad for the resolution of the trade dispute' with the US, said Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW. The bearish market, which was wary of central bank intervention earlier in the day, battered the dollar in late trading to test the resolve of the banks. 'The bottom line is that the central banks must come through with aggressive intervention,' said Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS. 'They must go in together and stay in to push the dollar to higher technical levels.' Without such action, Mr Chertkow warned that the dollar would test new lows against the yen and the D-Mark. 'The dollar will continue to slide and will move as low as Y90 or even Y80.' A report was circulating in the late afternoon that a senior official at the US Fed had said it was unlikely to raise interest rates merely in response to the dollar's weakness. Reports from the Australian reserve bank saying it would lift interest rates sooner rather than later, and rising commodity prices, buoyed the Australian dollar to its highest level against the US dollar since August 1992. The Australian dollar was trading against the US unit at Dollars 0.743-0.744. 'Most economists had expected no change in rates until the fourth quarter of this year,' said Mr Turner. 'But now there is speculation that it is imminent.' The D-Mark remained strong on the crosses, showing little reaction to news that the German M3 money supply data for May rose a smaller than expected 13.7 per cent, from 15.4 per cent in April. 'The response to the M3 was muted,' said Mr Hawkins. 'The headline figure was below expectations but some of the components were still high, which suggests that any movements downward in the money supply are going to come about quite slowly, so the market impact was quite limited.' Against the French and Belgian francs, the D-Mark ended in London at FFr3.418 from FFr3.417 and at BFr20.59 from BFr20.61, and it also closed at L987.4 from L989.4. The Bundesbank announced that it was setting a tender for 14-day variable repos to replace DM64.2bn in funds which expire today. Analysts are expecting another cut of five basis points today from last week's 5.05 per cent. German call money was little changed at 5.00/5.10 per cent. Sterling followed the dollar's trend against the D-Mark for most of the day, pushed downwards by a disappointing non-EU trade deficit. But the pound finished in London at DM2.4612, from DM2.4606, and it was little changed against the dollar, closing in London at Dollars 1.5374 from a previous Dollars 1.5393. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided assistance of Pounds 515m at established interest rates after it forecast a shortage of around Pounds 500m. The overnight lending rate traded between 5 and 3 1/2 per cent. The short term sterling contract for December settled at 93.68 from 93.70. The December Euromark contract closed unchanged at 94.78.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Labour moves to end union role THE Labour leadership agreed yesterday to call on its policymaking annual conference to end the trade unions' role in the selection of parliamentary candidates. But Mr Neil Kinnock, who had proposed the changeover to a simple one member, one vote system, used his first interviews since the general election to insist that there was no question of severing the unions' historic links with the party. Without union support for Labour the Conservatives would have had 'a near monopoly' of the press, political funding and power, the party leader told the national executive committee. 'I don't believe there is anyone in Britain who believes that British democracy would have been best served in that fashion,' he said. His warning came as officials confirmed that individual membership of the party had fallen to 260,000 from 320,000 in 1990. This is the lowest figure for 60 years and another compelling reason for maintaining union financial support. NEC members voted by 20 to 2 against to support the rule change with just Mr Tony Benn and Mr Dennis Skinner, the veteran leftwingers dissenting. By a similar margin, they went on to approve a proposal for Mr Larry Whitty, the general secretary, to hold consultations on a wide ranging review of the party's relationship with the unions, reporting back to the executive next month. That proposal, tabled by Mr Tom Sawyer, an NEC member and deputy general secretary of the public service union NUPE, comes as a deliberate effort to calm the debate on the link that has raged since criticism of union influence surfaced with the party's leadership election. Union leaders, who provide the overwhelming bulk of Labour's funding, have been growing increasingly angry at the attacks. Mr Whitty will now seek opinions on how to review the unions' role in the leadership election - currently they command 40 per cent of the electoral college - their affiliation fees and representation on the national executive and the soon to be established national policy forum. Also high on the agenda will be the controversial block vote at conference, whereby union delegations control some 90 per cent of the votes. At Blackpool this autumn, delegates will vote on a proposal to reduce the union weighting against the constituency parties to 70-30.</p>

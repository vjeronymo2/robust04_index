On Tuesday North Ossetians stopped a convoy of Ingushi  refugees returning to the North Ossetian village of Kartsa.  They seized six Ingushis who they planned to exchange for three  Ossetians captured on March 30. Russian peace-keepers are to  safeguard the return of hostages.    Head of the Temporary Administration in the State of  Emergency Zone Vladimir Lozovoy succeeded to talk the Ossetians  into freeing the Ingushis, however one hostage remained in  captivity and his fate is unknown. According to the source, the  tensions may tell on the second round of negotiations between  the North Ossetian and Ingush presidents scheduled to take place  in Nalchik.</p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Face to face with Ukraine's future: A look at the meeting between Presidents Clinton and Kravchuk On the eve of his long-awaited visit to Washington, President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine has caused dismay in the Clinton administration by announcing that he will not be a candidate in June's presidential elections. For the US, this is a troubling development. Mr Kravchuk's skill at convincing the Ukrainian parliament to surrender the country's nuclear missiles transformed him, in the assessment of American diplomats, from 'an ex-communist ideologue' to 'a remarkable statesman'. American officials in Kiev are so worried by Mr Kravchuk's apparent decision to leave the political stage that they are theorising his announcement is merely a tactic designed to test his political strength. But regardless of whether Mr Kravchuk is being coy or in earnest, President Bill Clinton confronts a more basic challenge. With or without Mr Kravchuk at Ukraine's helm, the US and more broadly the Group of Seven leading industrial nations must formulate a coherent strategy for their relations with the second most powerful former Soviet republic. The west's initial attitude to Ukraine, now a country occupying a territory the size of France, was to hope that it would remain part of the Soviet Union. This sentiment was displayed most egregiously in August 1991, by President George Bush, who lectured Ukrainian parliamentarians on the virtues of remaining in the Soviet Union less than two weeks before they decided to go it alone. In spite of US efforts at persuasion, Ukraine chose the path of independence, however tenuous it has proved to be. Even if, bereft of Mr Kravchuk's statesmanship, Kiev follows through on its pledge to relinquish its nuclear weapons, two further problems remain. In three years of independence, the government has pushed the economy into free-fall, setting records for hyperinflation in the post-communist world. The resulting hardship has exacerbated regional tensions in the Russified east and provoked secession in Crimea, which elected a pro-Russian president in January. Neither the nuclear nor the economic issue might be worthy of Mr Clinton's attention were it not for Ukraine's geography. Positioned next to an increasingly expansionist and unstable Russia - many of whose leaders regard Ukraine as a natural part of 'greater Russia' - Ukraine has the potential to become, in the view of some US intelligence experts and UK military analysts, the site of Europe's bloodiest conflict since the second world war. For the west, the question is whether to leave Ukraine to its fate or to take on the job of bolstering the shaky Ukrainian state. In Washington, the most vocal proponent of the latter view is Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, former National Security adviser in the Carter administration. In a forthcoming article in America's leading foreign policy journal, Foreign Affairs, Mr Brzezinski argues that the only way to ensure that Russia becomes 'a normal state' is to create conditions in which it is impossible for a neo-imperialist Russia to emerge. To do that, he says, the west must put its money on Ukraine. 'It cannot be stressed strongly enough,' Mr Brzezinski writes, 'that without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be an empire; but, with Ukraine suborned and then subordinated, Russia becomes automatically an empire'. He urges the US to promote, then help pay for, economic reforms in Ukraine and to offer public support for the country's independence and political integrity. But other American foreign policy observers, equally convinced that a Ukrainian-Russian confrontation is both dangerous and likely, draw the opposite conclusion. Mr Irving Kristol, a leading rightwing commentator, recently argued that 'a Russian-Ukrainian conflict looms, one that Russia is bound to win'. This view leads Mr Kristol to conclude that Ukraine's fate is to become 'a client state, or semi-protectorate of Russia'. Mr Kristol thinks this is Kiev's problem, not Washington's. How Ukrainians resolve the dilemma of Russia's influence versus independence will furnish the answer to which of these two views prevails. But with less than a month to go before parliamentary elections and a presidential race which, if Mr Kravchuk is serious, could be wide open, Ukraine is ambivalent about its future. One reason is that in order to settle its foreign relations it must first set its own house in order. This means deciding who will lead the country. On March 27 more than 5,000 candidates will be competing for 450 seats in parliament, but the race, which a western observer in Kiev describes as 'a free for all', is generating more heat than light. More than half of the candidates are running as independents and, with about 30 competing political parties, no single democratic, pro-market bloc has been formed. The political debate is shaping up against a background of a deepening economic crisis. With monthly inflation figures approaching 90 per cent and a budget deficit last year which accounted for 29 per cent of gross domestic product, the transition to the market has caused undoubted privation. Yet serious though Ukraine's economic plight may be, it is not shaping up as the main issue in this spring's election campaigns. In part this is because, thanks to Ukraine's fertile agricultural land and the prevalance of an informal barter system, the disintegration is more brutal on paper than in real life. But it is also because the great challenge of nation-building is the dominant preoccupation of the politicians. Forging a country out of 53m people, 11m of whom are ethnic Russians, is proving a Herculean task. Eastern Ukrainians would rather live in a country which has a friendly relationship with Slavic Russia, along the lines of Austria's links with Germany, while nationalistic western Ukrainians would prefer to see their nation solidly anchored in Europe. As Mr Roman Szporluk, a professor at Harvard University, puts it: 'I see quite a big debate, perhaps a political struggle, in which various regions are trying to present their own models, but I think it's a debate about whither Ukraine not whether Ukraine.' The talk on street corners in Kiev, in Lviv in the west and in Donetsk in the east suggests that Mr Szporluk is right. At a recent banquet for a visiting Russian emigre businessman, Ukraine's Jewish prime minister, a native of the eastern Donbass region, made a toast, in Russian, to independent Ukraine. The government officials who flanked him, one from Odessa in the south, one from central Ukraine, rose to join him and, as the evening wore on, and the vodka bottles grew lighter, spoke in increasingly hostile tones about the 'damned Muscovites'. For all their economic ineptitude and internal struggles to forge an identity, the politicians thus appear committed to maintaining Ukraine's independence and unity. Whether Mr Clinton decides to welcome Mr Kravchuk on Thursday with promises of aid or to leave him and his country to their own economic devices, Ukrainian leaders have decided that it is better to rule from an impoverished Kiev than to submit to orders from oil-rich Moscow. In Washington, Mr Kravchuk will ask for financial aid to bolster the parlous economy so that the country is at least able to withstand threats from Russia to cut off Ukraine's energy supplies. Mr Kravchuk will request a Dollars 300m 'bridge loan' from the US; he will also ask Washington to support Kiev's application for a Dollars 700m loan from the International Monetary Fund and a Dollars 400m World Bank loan for sectoral reform. If Mr Clinton decides that Kiev is not worth the investment, Ukrainian politicians will continue the search for ways to consolidate their country's independence. 'The economy is one thing, but the need to defend one's country is a stronger impulse,' said Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the powerful parliamentary commission on foreign affairs. 'Let no one think that Ukraine will peacefully give up and become a province of Russia.'</p>

			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / High Court action starts over pension funds HIGH COURT proceedings have been started by members of two pension funds controlled by the Nottingham-based Melton Medes, the mini-conglomerate run by Mr Nathu Ram Puri. The court action has been launched by the Graphical Paper and Media Union in an attempt to obtain further information about the investment of scheme assets and to appoint a judicial or independent trustee. It has been taken on behalf of a number of beneficiaries of Robert Fletcher (Greenfield) and Robert Fletcher (Stoneclough) Pension Funds against Melton Medes Pension Trustees and MM Fund Management, the funds' trustees. The funds relate to two Lancashire factories that were bought by Melton Medes from the Imperial Group in 1986. A preliminary High Court hearing in July placed assets, other than property, that had been controlled by the trustees into the hands of Philips &amp; Drew, the professional fund manager that was already handling part of the fund investments. Undertakings were obtained from the trustees that they would not permit the removal of the fund manager or intervene in the manager's investment functions. The application for the appointment of an independent trustee is to be heard in October. The court action has arisen after a campaign by Mr Victor Edwards, a foreman at Greenfield Mill, to enlist union financial support for a legal battle. Last night Mr Puri said in a prepared statement: 'The trustees resolutely deny any suggestion of financial or other impropriety in the management of Robert Fletcher (Greenfield) and Robert Fletcher (Stoneclough) pension funds. 'The interests of the members of the funds have always been, and remain, of paramount importance to the trustees. We would add that the majority of the assets of the funds have always been under independent financial fund management. The remainder, except property, were placed under the management of the same managers before there was any intimation of these proceedings. 'They were not placed with them because of these proceedings. The trustees are not doing anything different today than they were doing before the action.'</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Purchase policy that led to scramble for equity Starting with Dollars 50,000 in 1975, Tony Ryan built GPA Group into the world's largest aircraft lessor. But over-ambition, a flawed financial strategy and recession brought GPA to the verge of collapse. Last night, at the eleventh hour, Ryan pulled off the deal of his career but he was forced to cede control of the group SEVEN YEARS after Mr Tony Ryan founded GPA Group he made a decision which appeared inspired but which eventually brought the aircraft leasing group to its knees. Instead of only leasing used aircraft, Mr Ryan ordered 100 aircraft direct from the manufacturers, telling his directors 'to ignore the price of aircraft and look at the logic of what we were doing.' By 1986 GPA was positioned to exploit the world-wide aircraft shortage that developed in the late eighties. But as Mr Craig Jenks, head of the New York-based Airline/Aircraft Projects Consultancy, says: 'GPA's appetite for low credit and high margin deals expanded as swiftly as the availability of finance allowed.' Its success promoted a further round of explosive orders and in April 1989 it committed itself to a total of almost Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11bn) in options and firm orders. As the market turned against GPA it suffered a significant deterioration in the credit quality of its lessees. Some defaulted, such as VASP, the Brazilian Airline, forcing GPA to repossess aircraft; others rescheduled lease rentals, and American West Airlines, filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. Faced with Dollars 12bn of firm orders from aircraft manufacturers to the end of decade and more than Dollars 5bn of total debts the company decided at the beginning of 1992 to raise equity via a global flotation. The question was at what price should the shares be valued. The fate of GPA was determined largely by its inability to raise that equity, which it has tried to do on many occasions over the past year. Had GPA put a lower valuation on its stock during these attempts they might just have succeeded. The problem was not that GPA ever refused to accept that its shares were worth less than it had hoped. It was more that each time the company was ready to price its shares more competitively, investors took the view that they were worth even less - a suicidal game of beggar my neighbour. After a public row with advisers, Mr Ryan agreed to sell the shares at Dollars 20 each, instead of the Dollars 30 he believed they were worth. But the issue was pulled at the last minute on June 18 because of lack of support from institutions. Some of the biggest, including Alliance Capital, which manages about Dollars 60bn of pension and mutual fund assets in the US, complained that the shares were significantly overpriced. GPA did not give up, it simply changed its strategy and opted for something less complex than a global issue. A few weeks after it was forced to abort its flotation, Nomura, the group's main adviser, approached a number of outside investors in an attempt to place up to Dollars 500m of new shares. Discussions centred on the shares being offered for sale at about Dollars 12. But by then the market took the view that the value of the shares had fallen further, in line with the decline in the value of aircraft and the deterioration of the credit quality of GPA's lessees. In September the company appeared to have accepted this when it asked some of its biggest shareholders to support a Dollars 350m preference share issue with a conversion price of Dollars 8. Yet by now the ordinary shares were being quoted on the Dublin grey market at between Dollars 6 and Dollars 8. The issue was shelved as the group was forced to begin negotiations with banks on its borrowing arrangements. Earlier this year the company went back to its shareholders for the last time, offering them new shares at just Dollars 1. As one of its bankers said at the time: 'This was the last throw of the dice'. If investors declined to take up their rights in the new preference share issue they would be saying something about the perceived price of the shares that the banks did not want to hear. By writing down the value of their shares to less than Dollars 1 many shareholders confirmed the banks' worst fears. Mr David Kingston, chief executive of Irish Life, said GPA was probably the worst investment ever undertaken by the company. That view was echoed by many other shareholders, who have declared that they have no intention of reinvesting at any price.</p>

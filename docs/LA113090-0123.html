			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PLAN TO PROTECT MIGRANTS ON I-5 PROVOKES DISPUTE  </P> <P> Immigrant advocates and enforcement officials seeking ways to reduce accidents  involving pedestrians on freeways from San Clemente to the Mexican border  clashed Thursday over a proposal to erect 10-foot-high barriers along portions  of Interstate 5.  </P> <P> While U.S. Border Patrol and California Highway Patrol officials strongly  endorsed the barrier concept, immigrant representatives from San Diego and  Orange County voiced fears that such a step could result in more injuries by  trapping exhausted and frightened immigrants in the median strips of hazardous  expressways.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's going to save one life," Lee Steelman, a member of the  Human Resources Committee of the city of San Clemente, said during an  informational meeting in Oceanside sponsored by Assemblyman Steve Peace  (D-Chula Vista). "I just see panic."  </P> <P> Meantime, the California Department of Transportation disclosed that it has  decided to halve the number of traffic lanes from eight to four on the  approximate 3-mile strip of Interstate 5 near the U.S.-Mexico border where most  of the accidents occur.  </P> <P> Since January, 1987, 101 immigrant pedestrians have been killed and an  additional 110 injured after being struck by vehicles on area expressways.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ana Lucia Armijos, president of the Monetary </F> Board, by Roberto Peralta Cardenas; place and date not given]    [Text] The first step included in the plans for the new  year is the reduction of expenditures in the public sector,  Monetary Board President Ana Lucia Armijos has announced.    In an interview with EL UNIVERSO, this official emphasized  that the goals set for the government do not mean that a period  of stagnation lies ahead for the economy. On the contrary, the  reactivation of the productive apparatus will basically be  supported by the dynamism of the private sector, and in part by  the improvement in the levels of public investment.    Armijos explained that despite the fact that production  growth came to about 2 percent in 1993, as compared with 3.5  percent in 1992, the rate of growth in the gross formation of  fixed capital exceeded 50 percent. This represents growth that  is greater than the increase in the population.    "Greater growth in productive activity, in both the public  and private sectors, is expected in 1994," she said.  <H5>  Inflation Below 20 Percent </H5>   She stated that the government will seek to provide the  economy with responsible fiscal management in 1994, making it  possible to consolidate the reduction in inflation at a rate of  less than 20 percent by the end of 1994.    Armijos did not mention the goal of 15-percent annual  inflation for 1994, to which reference has been made over the  past several months, in what might be interpreted as one of  the principal effects of the most recent fiscal crisis.    Armijos said that as of the end of 1993, the greatest social  benefit provided to the people of Ecuador by the government of  Sixto Duran-Ballen has been the reduction in inflation.    This official refuted the criticisms voiced by businessmen  who maintain that on balance 1993 was a year of recession. She  went on to say that intermediary credit for the financial sector  increased by 30 percent, in real terms, so that it can be said  that the formal sector had adequate resources for the financing  of its activities.    Armijos said that the monetary and foreign-exchange boards  will continue to be used in 1994. This will make strict control  of liquidity possible. She further said that it is expected that  the amendments to the Law on the Monetary System will be "taken  up and approved by the Congress" within the first two months of  the year.    Our interview with the head of the body that directs the  economy follows.    [Cardenas] How do you assess the economic activity in 1993,  as 1994 begins? What is the legacy left for the new year?    [Armijos] In the year just ended, it was possible to reduce  inflation to 31 percent--a goal that for more than five years,  the preceding governments were unable to achieve. The goal for  the reduction of inflation was reached thanks to the  responsible, consistent, and concerted effort made in the  monetary and fiscal sectors. Other important achievements  include the stabilization of the rate of exchange, the  stabilization of the financial market, and a substantial  reduction in the fiscal deficit. In addition, the foreign sector  was strengthened, enabling the country to accumulate reserves of  more than $1 billion since the program was adopted.    In 1993, the country made progress toward the more flexible  use of the tools of economic policy. Better management of the  utilization of the tools of monetary policy based on the market  was achieved. A new system was designed for interest rates,  allowing greater flexibility for the middlemen and greater  efficiency in the allocation of financial resources. And the  foreign-exchange policy was made fully flexible, with a view to  rendering the establishment of the most important price in the  economy--the rate of exchange--a much clearer process.    [Cardenas] What is the lesson taught by the achievement of  the inflationary goal in the year just ended? Are there some who  maintain that it is a relative success?    [Armijos] There is no sense in speaking of a relative  success  when we have succeeded in reducing the rate of inflation from 60  percent in December of 1992 to 31 percent in December of 1993.  This is the greatest social benefit the government of architect  Sixto Duran-Ballen has given the people of Ecuador.    The reduction of the rate of inflation to 31 percent and the  maintenance of macroeconomic stability have additionally allowed  investors to plan their activities with greater confidence. And  what is more, they have expanded their investment horizons into  the medium time range.    [Cardenas] What the productive sectors have suffered has  without a doubt been a recession, rather than a slowdown. How  can this situation be improved in the new year if recession does  reoccur in 1994?    [Armijos] The major increase in intermediate credit for the  financial sector, which was 30 percent in real terms in 1993,  allows us to say that the formal sector had adequate resources  for the financing of its activities.    The initial estimates indicate that an increase of  approximately two percent in production growth was planned for  1993, as compared with the growth of 3.5 percent seen in 1992.  It should be noted, however, that the rate of growth in the  gross formation of fixed capital for this year exceeds 50  percent. In real terms, this represents growth greater than the  increase in the population.    Still greater growth in productive activity is expected in  1994, with the impetus being provided by the greater gross  formation of fixed capital in both the public and private  sectors. In fact, the state budget provides for projects of  vital importance that will promote growth in various sectors.    [Cardenas] In your opinion what are the economic prospects  for 1994?    [Armijos] In 1994, the government will seek to provide the  economy with responsible fiscal management, making it possible  to consolidate the reduction in inflation and to lower the  inflation rate to less than 20 percent by the end of 1994. This  responsible fiscal management will involve a major reduction in  current expenditures and a substantial improvement in tax and  customs management, which will serve to generate additional  budget resources.    This does not mean that a phase of stagnation will begin for  the economy. On the contrary, the reactivation of the productive  apparatus will be due basically to the dynamism in the public  sector, and in part, to the improvement in the levels of public  investment. This dynamism will be based on the maintenance of  foreign-exchange stability, a level of interest rates consistent  with inflationary expectations, and a considerable increase in  productivity.    It must be pointed out that the growth seen in 1993 was  achieved despite the implementation of a strict adjustment  program, which reduced inflation. This is a result that has been  achieved in very few countries in Latin America.    [Cardenas] How much will the progress that may be achieved  in  the modernization of the state influence the economic prospects  for the coming year?    [Armijos] The approval, in 1994, of the Law on the  Modernization of the State and its application will enable us to  consolidate the efforts to ensure stability with growth and will  provide the international community with a favorable picture of  the scope and duration of the reforms in Ecuador. Modernization  and monetary stability do not constitute just a situational  phenomenon, but rather a permanent one. It will continue in our  country and will sink deep roots in our society.    [Cardenas] If it is not possible to realize the government's  aspirations with regard to increased taxes and total income  collected, might new measures be contemplated?    [Armijos] As the vice president of the Republic has said,  the  results of the tax reform would justify a revision of the  economic program for 1994. In addition, as was noted by the  minister of finance, the first measure must be the restriction  of the expenditures of the public sector, including both current  expenditures and the investments initially planned for 1994.    [Cardenas] What does the government hope to see in 1994  where  the foreign debt is concerned? Might there be a definitive  renegotiation, and along what lines are the negotiations  progressing? Might the Monetary Board approve the foreign-debt  conversion operations within the framework of the Securities  Market Law?    [Armijos] The renegotiation of the foreign debt is a slow  process that is advancing as macroeconomic stabilization is  achieved and as the country consolidates its foreign solvency.  The intention of the government is to obtain an agreement on the  renegotiation of the debt, because this will not only enable us  to establish a better payments profile for the future, but will  basically allow the consolidation of the credibility, for the  international financial community, of our efforts in the realm  of stabilization and modernization. Renegotiation will enable  the country to obtain credit again and will expand the  opportunities for domestic and foreign investment. However,  despite all of the benefits we will derive from the  renegotiation of the debt, the current government is not  prepared to agree to conditions that will be burdensome for  future generations. In this connection, progress is being made,  with firmness and determination but without haste, taking the  national interests into account.    As to the debt-conversion operations, they will be governed  by the overall renegotiation agreement achieved.    [Cardenas] Several months have passed and we are still  waiting for the amendments to the Law on the Monetary System.  When will something concrete be known? Might some major  alteration at the last moment be expected, as happened with the  amendments to the Tax Law?    [Armijos] The amendments to the Law on the Monetary System,  duly approved by the Monetary Board, have been submitted to the  president of the Republic for his approval and sent to the  Congress. It is to be expected that they will be discussed and  approved by the Congress in the course of the first two months  of this year.    The Law on the Monetary System is an eminently technical  text  designed to perfect that which was approved in 1992--that is to  say, to introduce basic changes in the way shown to be necessary  by the application of the law in effect, so that the Central  Bank can fully carry out the proper functions of a  currency-issuing institute.  <H5>  Auctions Have Not Threatened the State </H5>   [Cardenas] Will the criticisms voiced by the  securities-exchange sector because of the fact that the  government has used auctions rather than the securities market  be refuted?    [Armijos] The negotiation of state bonds by the minister of  finance through the Central Bank of Ecuador has its legal basis  in Article 63 of the Regulations Governing the Securities Market  Law. That article clearly provides for the possibility of  placing the bonds issued by the state and bodies in the public  sector by means of the auction mechanisms supported or used by  the Central Bank of Ecuador. Such mechanisms are not just used  by Ecuador, but are in place in the majority of other countries,  such as the United States of America, Mexico, Chile, etc.    The auction mechanism has not worked to the detriment of the  interests of the state, because in the adjudication of the bonds  in question, the reserve price was not relevant. This was  because the bonds sold out at a higher price (90.01 percent),  and the average weighted price at which they were adjudicated  was also obviously higher (91.3333 percent) than this value.    [Cardenas] Will the monetary policy for 1994 be linked with  the continuity of open-market operations of the monetary and  foreign-exchange board type? Will the issuance of monetary  stabilization bonds perhaps entail a cost for the Central Bank?    [Armijos] In fact, open-market operations are an effective  tool that has made it possible to maintain strict control of the  liquidity of the economy. And consequently, this has created the  capacity for more efficient management of the variable monetary  factors. Therefore, the use of this tool will be continued in  1994.    Since the stabilization bonds are the securities being  placed  on this market, this does involve a cost for the Central Bank.  However, it is a cost that has been carefully calculated and  duly provided for in the budget of the issuing establishment.</p>

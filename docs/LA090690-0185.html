			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> GAIDO STATUS UNCLEAR DESPITE COURT ORDER  </P> <P> Despite a court order saying Mary Ann Gaido should be seated on the City  Council, it remained unclear Wednesday whether she will be allowed to take  office.  </P> <P> The City Council is meeting today at 2 p.m. in a special session to discuss  Friday's order by Orange County Superior Court Judge Eileen C. Moore that Gaido  be seated and what effect the ruling may have on the city's complicated  election laws.  </P> <P> After a closed-door discussion, the council is expected to decide whether it  should proceed with an appeal of the ruling, cancel a November special election  called to fill the council seat left vacant by Sally Anne Sheridan's elevation  to mayor, or seat Gaido, City Manager Paul O. Brady said.  </P> <P> The timing of the council's decision is critical because today is the last day  to remove items from the Nov. 6 ballot before it goes to press.  </P> <P> Gaido has already made two attempts to take office since the court order was  issued but has been turned away from City Hall both times by City Atty. John L.  Fellows. Brady said Fellows immediately filed notice that he was going to  appeal Moore's court order.  </P> <P> Gaido's attorney, Christopher Mears, is expected today to seek another order  from Moore, which would allow Gaido to be seated until Fellows' appeal is  resolved.  </P> <P> "I think (Moore's) ruling from the bench is effective until a court of appeal  says to unseat Mary Ann Gaido," Mears said.  </P> <P> Gaido's lawsuit against the city, filed in July, was the second in as many  years over city election laws approved by voters in 1988.  </P> <P> Under those election laws, a special election to fill a council seat left  vacant by a member who is elevated to mayor must be held if 7% of the city's  registered voters sign a petition. If no petition is filed, the third-highest  vote-getter in a council election is automatically seated. Gaido finished third  in the June election behind William A. (Art) Bloomer and Barry J. Hammond in a  race for two seats, but subsequently a special-election petition was filed.  </P> <P> Sheridan said the confusion over whether to seat Gaido could have been avoided  had the previous City Council attempted to resolve inconsistencies in the  election laws, which were pointed out by a recently settled lawsuit against  former Councilman Cameron Cosgrove, who was challenged as the third-highest  vote-getter in the 1988 election.  </P> <P> "The last council didn't deal with this responsibly, and now we have all these  people who acted on their decisions," Sheridan said. "I told the whole world  back in 1988 that this system (of allowing a special election) was crazy, and  now we have to go back to court to get a reading on the law."  </P> <P> Irvine's November ballot contains two measures that would repeal the election  laws enacted in 1988. Measure E would repeal the directly elected mayor process  and Measure F would repeal the special-election process. WENDY PAULSON  </P></p>

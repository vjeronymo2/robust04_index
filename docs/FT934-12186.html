			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Labour fires broadside at Spanish reforms X:IMPORTANT talks on wage restraint and labour market reforms in Spain opened under a pall yesterday as unions announced nation-wide demonstrations on November 25 in protest at the government's economic policy. Union leaders, who are meeting government ministers and representatives of the employers' confederation, agreed to continue negotiating the so-called social pact next week but held out little hope of any agreement after the first round of talks. The call for demonstrations underlined the grave task facing the government as it seeks to persuade the unions to accept an incomes policy pegging wages to below the inflation rate over the next three years, and an overhaul of labour regulations to lower the cost of dismissals. Officials and employers fear that Spanish union militancy is being fuelled by events in France. 'The climbdown over Air France is the worst possible news for us because we have to do everything the French government should be doing and more,' said a leading Barcelona industrialist. Union leaders at the social pact talks were in part responding to what they see as government intransigence over the negotiations and in part to the groundswell of rank-and-file unrest. 'The government is wrecking the talks, not us,' said Mr Antonio Gutierrez, leader of Comisiones Obreras, the Communist party-led union. The government has insisted that it will impose wage restraint and labour market reforms before the end of the year if there is no agreement with the unions. Unrest is running high among Spain's 70,000 public sector steelworkers following a decision by INI, the state-holding company, to defer until the outcome of the social pact talks a wage and productivity package agreed in June. INI's agreement with its unions was marginally more generous than the incomes policy the government is currently backing. Union leaders at companies such as CSI, the state's integrated steel concern, and CASA, the aerospace manufacturer, said they would prepare strike action following a meeting with the INI management yesterday. Meanwhile, the first of several planned industrial stoppages took place yesterday at the three plants run by SEAT, troubled subsidiary of Volkswagen. The four-hour strike went ahead despite a promise by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez Arriortua, the Spanish-born VW board member, that job losses would be minimal because workers would be re-hired under a scheme to increase the proportion of SEAT compoments manufactured in Spain. In Spain's biggest labour shakeout to date, VW announced last week it was closing SEAT's Zona Franca plant in Barcelona and shed 9,000 jobs, 3,000 of them through voluntary retirement. The Barcelona-based regional government of Catalonia has since said it will provide credit lines for component manufacturers setting up in the Zona Franca plant to supply SEAT.</p>

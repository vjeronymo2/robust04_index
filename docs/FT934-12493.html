			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei firms ahead of East Japan Railway listing THE Nikkei average firmed ahead of today's listing of East Japan Railway, as financial institutions and public fund managers pushed up activity by trading large-capital issues, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average gained 44.50 at 20,309.33. The index rose to the day's high of 20,473.85 in the morning on institutional buying. Selling by corporations and arbitrageurs briefly pushed down the index to the day's low of 20,271.83 in the afternoon. Volume amounted to 300m shares, against 315m. Declines outnumbered advances by 634 to 387, with 175 issues unchanged. Dealers and institutional investors shifted funds from smaller stocks to large-capital issues to lift volumes. Indices of small-capital stocks lost ground, with the OTC Jasdaq average falling 1.98 per cent and the second section index losing 1.23 per cent. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 6.35 to 1,669.44 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.86 to 1,313.23. Traders said most investors were wary of building long positions ahead of the JR East listing, while some corporate investors unloaded holdings to raise funds to buy JR East shares. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel said investors would want to keep share prices steady during the initial period after the listing; but he added that expectations of poor corporate results due to be released during the next few weeks and bad economic figures would eventually trigger selling pressure. Steels and shipbuilders were traded actively: Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, rose Y6 to Y349 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industrial also gained Y6, at Y691. The dollar's recovery against the yen helped export-oriented issues. Sony rose Y50 to Y4,950 and Pioneer Electronic advanced Y60 to Y2,860. However, TDK lost Y100 to Y3,820 on reports of poor earnings prospects. Financials, including banks, brokers and non-life insurers, firmed on bargain hunting. Industrial Bank of Japan put on Y70 at Y3,410 and Mitsubishi Bank appreciated Y90 to Y3,180. Nomura Securities rose Y30 to Y2,030 and Tokio Marine &amp; Fire moved forward Y30 to Y1,340. In Osaka, the OSE average firmed 4.45 to 22,221.40 in volume of 27.4m shares. Roundup A MIXTURE of performances characterised yesterday's trading among the region's markets. Taiwan and New Zealand were closed. HONG KONG rebounded from earlier losses to end higher on bargain hunting.

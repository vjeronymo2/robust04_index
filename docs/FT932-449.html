			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major upbeat on return of Heseltine THE prime minister 'hopes and expects' that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will resume his political career after he recovers from last week's heart attack, Downing Street said, Ralph Atkins writes. Mr John Major's optimism appeared to rule out the appointment of a replacement at the Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, will continue to stand in for Mr Heseltine at cabinet meetings. However no timetable has yet been set for Mr Heseltine's return to the political mainstream and Downing Street said it may be some while. The expectation at Westminster is that Mr Heseltine will convalesce until the Conservative's annual conference begins in October. Consultants at the Harley Street clinic where Mr Heseltine is staying yesterday also expressed confidence that he was making a good recovery. A statement said: 'Mr Heseltine spent a quiet weekend and continues to make good progress.' Further tests are likely be carried out on Mr Heseltine later this week.</p>

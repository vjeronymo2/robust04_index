			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Arts: The Winslow Boy - Theatre in London The steady revival of Terence Rattigan's reputation as a playwright is in danger of being halted in its tracks by this remarkably inept production of The Winslow Boy at the Globe. Admirers of Rattigan, however, need not have undue fears; the faults lie not in the play, but in the performances and the direction. The Winslow Boy was first performed in 1946 just after the end of the second world war, but is set shortly before the outbreak of the first in 1914. Surely the juxtaposition matters. The piece is about Englishness in a changing world. Some of the background is factual. George Archer-Shee was expelled from the Royal Naval College at Osborne because he was thought to have stolen a five shilling postal order from a fellow cadet. The appeals against the judgment went to the House of Commons and the boy was exonerated. The play is loosely based on that, but being Rattigan there is rather more to it. We never know in the end whether the boy was guilty or not. The question is whether it was worth bringing the case, which disrupts an entire family because of the publicity it creates, and whether there is really so much to be said for an English legal system which can devote so much time to one small affair while the country is on the verge of war. You can argue about that as much as you like; that is one one of the merits of the play. Yet where the direction by Wyn Jones falls down is in painting the Winslow family as a bunch of Edwardian fogies, young and old, from the start. This is a travesty. The Winslows may not be rich, but they are comfortably off, the father having recently retired from a senior post at the Westminster Bank. He is well read, sometimes witty and refers to Voltaire. The elder son, Dickie, goes to Oxford, even though he ploughs his exams. The family is also liberal. Daughter Catherine (well played on a bad night by Eve Matheson) is a voluntary worker for the suffragettes, but has no problems about living at home with her middle class background; nor has the family in accommodating her. The Kensington home must be quite decent, even smartish. A female journalist asking about the case is attracted by the curtains - a new material from Barkers. In the designs by Mark Bailey, the curtains cannot even be seen from the middle of the stalls: the rest of the set is entirely drab. What we should be watching is the tranquillity of Edwardian England disturbed by a moral family dilemma and thoughts of war in the background. The family should visibly age as the Winslow case drags on; in this production, they are prematurely old to start with, and that includes the boy himself. Simon Williams is not nearly sharp or suave enough as the King's Counsel who gets the boy off. But, as I say, much could be retrieved if Wyn Jones would go and sit in the audience, note the slowness of the pace and the general lack of style, then give the show a new lick. Globe Theatre.

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> McGraw-Hill Cuts Staff: New York-based McGraw-Hill Inc., the publishing and  information services company, announced sweeping layoffs and a restructuring.  It plans to eliminate 1,000 jobs, a 7.3% reduction. In addition, it hopes to  streamline operations by shifting from a structure of three operating firms to  two. The cost of the layoffs, a writedown of assets and the costs associated  with closing its general book division will result in a $220-million charge to  fourth-quarter earnings, McGraw-Hill said.  </P></p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Inflation falls to lowest level for 27 years The underlying rate of inflation in the UK fell to its lowest level for at least 27 years in September, providing a boost to the Conservatives. Unemployment also fell for the eighth consecutive month, bringing the numbers claiming benefit down to levels last seen in 1991. Unchanged average earnings growth in August was a further pointer to the increasingly healthy nature of the UK's economic recovery. This suggested pay settlements were not yet threatening to boost inflation. The Treasury hailed the data as evidence that the country was now on course to achieve the unusual combination of steady growth with low inflation. Although some City analysts suspect the current low rate of inflation may not be sustained in coming months, Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, suggested financial markets were being too pessimistic about inflation. The Central Statistical Office yesterday announced that the annual rate of retail price inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, was 2 per cent in September - the lowest annual rate for what the government considers 'underlying' inflation since 1967. The headline inflation rate also fell. The annual growth rate in the retail prices index, covering all items, was 2.2 per cent in September compared with 2.4 per cent in August. Last month's low price rise is likely to prove particularly significant for next month's budget, since September's index will form the basis for the rate at which state pensions and other benefits will rise. The data were welcomed in the City, which had forecast a higher rate of inflation in September following a surprise August rise. Although inflation may rise later this year, reflecting tax increases and commodity price rises, yesterday's figures suggest that the picture is benign. The overall figures were slightly flattered by volatile factors such as a dip in petrol prices. But price growth in most retail categories remained low, suggesting that underlying inflationary pressures were weak. Further data from the Department of Employment yesterday suggested that falling unemployment was not resulting in pressure for higher wages. The numbers claiming unemployment benefit fell by a seasonally adjusted 28,000 in September to 2.57m, or 9.1 per cent of the workforce, its lowest level since December 1991. However, the underlying annual rate of average earnings growth was unchanged at 3.75 per cent in August.

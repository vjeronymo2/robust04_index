			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, June 10 (TANJUG) -- Zagreb will not shrink  from "war option as an ultimate means" to re-establish its  authority in the U.N. Protected Area (UNPA) on the territory of  the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia, said Jure Radic, head  of the presidential office of Franjo Tudjman, Friday.    "This will be done through consistent peacemaking policy",  but "we do not rule out war option either as an ultimate means,"  Radic, secretary-general of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union  (HDZ), told a rally in Delnice.    According to Croatian media, Radic warned that Croatia this  time openly pointed out that this was the "last unproductive  mandate of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR). If the U.N.  forces were not deployed on the internationally-recognized  Croatian borders, the Croatian Army would," he said.  "Cypriotization of Croatia is out of question" as well as the  possibility of part of Croatia "becomimg some other state,"  Radic stressed.    The UNPA in Croatia matches the Republic of Serb Krajina  (R.S.K.), which was in 1991 proclaimed by the Serbs on the  territories where they are majority population, in response to  Croatia's forcible secession from the former Yugoslavia and  downgrading the status of the Serbs in the new state of Croatia  from a constituent people to one of a natioanl minority.    Croatia does not recognize the R.S.K. and has attempted four  times to forcibly return it under Zagreb's authority. The  Krajina Serbs do not want to give up their independence,  claiming that their state is legitinate, being created by  breaking-up of the former Yugoslavia and that they, since they  were a constituent people in the former state, have the right to  self-determination.    Croatian President Tudjman has also on several occasions in  recent months announced that Zagreb will re-establish authority  in the entire territory of the former Yugoslav Republic of  Croatia by force if not through negotiations.</p>

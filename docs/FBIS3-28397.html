			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In 1993, the An Giang Province Import-Export  Corporation exported 40,000 tons of food and agricultural  products of all kinds, achieving an import-export index of  nearly 24 million dollars. The corporation began implementing  two joint ventures involving more than one million dollars in  capital investment with foreign firms. It also encouraged  peasants to sign contracts to grow subsidiary food crops of high  economic value to meet export demands, helping them with seeds,  technological assistance, and product consumption. As a result,  hundreds of hectares of land have been zoned off for planting  Japanese red beans, black sesame, and mushrooms to meet export  demands.</p>

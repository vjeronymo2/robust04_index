Stephen Cranston Professional Corporation Pension Plan and Trust (the Plan), Located in San Marino, California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Application No. D&hyph;9733]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Exemption <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code shall not apply to the proposed cash sale (the Sale) of certain real property (the Property) by the Plan to H. Stephen Cranston and Karen Y. Cranston, husband and wife, and disqualified persons with respect to the Plan; provided that (1) the Sale is a one-time transaction for cash; (2) the Plan does not experience any loss nor incur any expenses from the proposed transaction; and (3) the Plan receives as consideration from the Sale the greater of either (a) the fair market value of the Property as determined by a qualified, independent appraiser on the date of the Sale, or (b) an amount equal to all the funds expanded by the Plan in acquiring and maintaining the Property during its period of ownership.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Facts and Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Plan is a defined benefit plan that has one participant, H. Stephen Cranston. As of March 31, 1993, the total assets of the Plan were $748,627. The fiduciaries of the Plan, who have investment discretion over the assets of the Plan, are H. Stephen Cranston and his wife, Karen Y. Cranston, who are also the applicants for the exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sponsoring employer of the plan is a California professional corporation which is designated as H. Stephen Cranston Professional Corporation. It is engaged in the practice of general business law with its offices in San Marino, California. H. Stephen Cranston is the sole shareholder and only employee. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Since Mr. H. Stephen Cranston is the sole shareholder of the sponsor of the Plan and the only participant in the Plan, there is no jurisdiction under Title I of the Act pursuant to 29 CFR 2510.3&hyph;3(c)(1). However, there is jurisdiction under Title II of the Act pursuant to section 4975 of the Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The Property consists of 59.9 acres of forested land that is located in Linn County on 48063 Cascadia Drive, Cascadia, Oregon. The improvements on the Property are a 67 year old two-story house with a detached barn and shed. The house is represented by the applicants to be in a deplorable condition and uninhabitable. There is no available drinking water, the prior occupants destroyed the furnace for heating the house, and the septic tank needs to be replaced. There is no basement under the house and the wood foundation, which is riddled with termites and dry rot, is braced to avoid collapsing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Property was appraised by Scott Lepman, SRA, RM of Albany, Oregon, an independent appraiser, who determined, as of March 18, 1994, that the Property had a fair market value of $128,000. Among other things, Mr. Lepman determined that the Property would not qualify for bank financing; and also, he observed many structural defects on the Property: the buildings need painting; the sunporch needs to be finished; the ceiling in the living room is in disrepair; the walls in several rooms need repairing; and the house's foundation is structurally unsound. He also observed functional obsolence such as, the house has unevenly settled and has no conventional source for heating.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Lepman also indicated that the barn and shed are in disrepair.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Lepman described the location of the Property, which is surrounded by forest land, to be in a mixed neighborhood of poor to good dwellings that vary in age and design, and are predominately located on large parcels that are devoted to agricultural and timber production. Mr. Lepman referred to the properties in the area as below average in visual appeal and in level of maintenance. He further stated that the area is an older rural community with a declining timber base due to the enforced governmental protections of the spotted owl.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Property was purchased by the Plan on July 30, 1990, from Charlie West and Lorraine West, husband and wife, for the total consideration of $70,000. The Wests are represented by the applicants as unrelated persons with respect to the Plan and its sole participant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicants represent that the purchase of the Property was made by the Plan with the intention that the timber on the Property would be cut and sold over a number of years for a profitable return to the Plan. During 1992, the Plan had cut approximately 40 percent of the timber on the Property for a net return of $43,646.32 after expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the cutting in 1992, the applicants represent that circumstances have curtailed further timber cutting. One intervening condition has been the recent reporting of spotted owls in the area followed by the imposition of governmental regulations precluding the cutting of timber and destroying the owl's habitat. Another curtailment to cutting timber on the Property is the State of Oregon requirements that all trees cut must be replaced with new trees that survive for at least five years. The applicants represent that because of the steep and uneven contours of the Property the survival of new trees is precarious and uncertain. Also, after the replanting there is a need for the services of a professional forester to care for the new plantings for an additional three years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the Plan purchased the Property in 1990 for $70,000 and incurred legal fees of $262.35, the applicants represent that the Plan has expended an additional sum of $15,794.38 for repairs and maintenance of the Property. The expenses to the Plan included such things as property taxes, roof repairs, weed and rubbish removal, electrical repairs, fence and gate repairs, chimney removal, materials and labor for bracing the foundation of house, and security services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The applicants propose that the Property be sold to them for the higher of either its fair market value or for the total amount of funds expended by the Plan acquiring and maintaining the Property, so that the Plan can avoid the continuing expenses of repairing, reforesting, and maintaining the Property. In addition, the Plan will be able to invest the funds from the Sale in liquid assets that generate yields and incur less expenses. The applicants state that the Plan will incur no expenses nor any losses from the proposed transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicants represent that the proposed transaction will be in the best interests of the Plan and its participant and beneficiaries because it is unlikely that the Property can be sold to persons unrelated to the Plan. The applicants represent, and the appraiser corroborates, that the Property is not habitable and the availability of bank financing for the purchase of the Property is not foreseeable. Also, the likelihood of finding a purchaser in the area with adequate cash is represented to be remote because of the high unemployment in the area due to logging restrictions involving the ecological problem of the spotted owl.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPER MILL FIGHTS EPA CONTROLS;  </P> <P> JOBS VS. POLLUTION: 2 STATES CLASH OVER RIVER CLEANUP  </P> <P> There was a time when the 75-mile-long Pigeon River was an ideal spot for  catching trout, taking a swim, drawing drinking water and performing church  baptisms.  </P> <P> Rising in the majestic Great Smoky Mountains of western North Carolina, the  stream flowed crisp and clean over a pebbly bed in a northwesterly direction  until it joined the French Broad River near Knoxville in eastern Tennessee.  </P> <P> But all that was before the Champion paper company built a pulp mill in the  early 1900s in the North Carolina community of Canton, about 20 miles  downstream from the Pigeon's headwaters.  </P> <P> Now, as a result of eight decades of pollution, beyond Canton the once-pristine  river has become a fetid sewer that Tennesseans say looks like Coca-Cola,  smells like rotten eggs and is laced with potent carcinogenic dioxins.  </P> <P> Tennesseans have been trying for decades to get Champion to clean up its  operations, claiming that the mill -- now a major producer of paper for juice  and milk cartons and for envelopes -- is responsible for the pollution and a  hazard to their health and economic well-being.  </P> <P> In Hartford, a river hamlet of about 780 residents five miles west of the North  Carolina border, townspeople blame the poisons in the stream for a rash of  cancer deaths in recent decades.  </P> <P> "We've had 167 deaths from cancer in the past 20 to 30 years," said Mary Woody,  postmaster of the town that local residents have grimly dubbed "Widowville."  </P> <P> Added 81-year-old Margaret Jenkins: "My husband died from cancer on his 71st  birthday in 1977, and I can look out my kitchen window and see half a dozen  other homes where there's been cancer deaths. There's been so many died with  it, it's a tragedy."  </P> <P> In Newport, a town of 7,580 residents about 15 miles farther downstream,  environmental activists say fish taken from the river show high levels of  dioxin, often have missing eyes and fins and are covered with unsightly sores.  The town long ago stopped using the Pigeon for its municipal water.  </P> <P> Four years ago, prodded by Tennessee, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  stepped into the dispute and attempted to impose more stringent waste-water  discharge requirements on the Champion plant.  </P> <P> But the agency's action set off a classic jobs vs. environment controversy that  has since turned into a diminutive War Between the States.  </P> <P> Champion, whose Canton mill is the largest single employer in hard-pressed  western North Carolina, contends that the only way it can meet the EPA's  proposed standards is to reduce its operations and cut its nearly 2,000-person  work force in half.  </P> <P> To North Carolinians, that spells economic disaster. Champion pumps almost $210  million into the regional economy, including more than $96 million in employee  wages and benefits. About $600,000 of Canton's $3.75-million annual operating  budget comes from Champion's city taxes.  </P> <P> "This town would be dead without Champion," said Roy Lee McCord, 53, of Canton.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Governors Clash  </P> <P> In the dispute, the governors of Tennessee and North Carolina have traded harsh  words, North Carolina legislators have attempted to ban the sale of Tennessee  sippin' whiskey within their state's borders and environmental activists have  become the objects of death threats.  </P> <P> In addition, more than 175,000 letters have been sent to the EPA's regional  office in Atlanta from partisans on both sides of the issue.  </P> <P> The battle has been fought in federal courts and has even raged in the halls of  Congress.  </P> <P> "In all my experience, there's never been an issue quite like this," said Fritz  Wagener, regional EPA water quality standards coordinator.  </P> <P> The feud erupted in May, 1985. North Carolina had routinely approved the  renewal of Champion's waste-water discharge permit. But after complaints by  environmental activists and state officials in Tennessee, the EPA vetoed the  permit -- the first time in its history that the agency had ever overridden a  state's authority to issue such permits.  </P> <P> Champion filed a federal lawsuit challenging the EPA veto. In December, 1986,  U.S. District Judge David Sentelle in Asheville, N.C., upheld the agency and,  in the spring of the following year, the EPA wrote a draft permit that Champion  said would have forced the mill out of business.  </P> <P> The EPA proposal called for the water at the end of the mill's discharge pipes  to contain no more than 50 color units instead of the 85 color units the state  of North Carolina had allowed.  </P> <P> The difference in color between water with 50 color units and water with 85  color units, EPA officials say, is like the difference in color between ginger  ale and tea.  </P> <P> Hearings on the EPA's proposed guidelines were set for May but were later  postponed to January, 1988.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Protest Movement  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a protest movement against the EPA and Tennessee was formed in  Canton, which has a population of 4,700. Blue-and-white signs saying "We  Support Champion" blossomed throughout the town in shop windows, neighborhood  lawns and school buildings.  </P> <P> "The way that draft permit was written . . . we'd have had to turn the lights  out and walk away," Oliver Blackwell, a Champion vice president and manager of  the Canton operation, said in a recent interview.  </P> <P> Dissenting voices were stifled. Rebecca Allen, a former Canton elementary  school teacher, says that she was given her first unfavorable evaluation in her  then 17 years of teaching and was transferred to a less challenging assignment  after she attempted to have her fifth- and sixth-graders study both sides of  the issue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Posters Torn Down  </P> <P> In one clash with school administrators, she recalled, six small posters that  she had put up in her classroom along with newspaper clippings of the story  were torn down by the school district superintendent. The posters, which Allen  had made by hand, bore such slogans as: "Don't Muddy the Waters With Emotion"  and "Don't Cloud the Issue."  </P> <P> "He took them down right in front of me and the kids," she said. "I was afraid  those kids were going to think that's how it is -- when you stand up for  something you believe, somebody's going to come and get you."  </P> <P> She resigned from the Canton school system in 1988 and now is an eighth-grade  teacher in Andrews, a North Carolina town about 70 miles southwest of Canton.  </P> <P> In the face of such controversy, the EPA consulted with environmental officials  from both North Carolina and Tennessee and drew up a new draft permit that  called for a standard of 85 color units in the river at the border between the  two states.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Canoe Trip  </P> <P> After public hearings on the new proposal, North Carolina officials gave their  approval, but Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter gave it a thumbs down. McWherter's  rejection, which he announced on Christmas Eve, came after he made a canoe trip  down the Pigeon, from above the Canton mill, where he found a "Class A trout  stream," to downstream, where the pollution is thickest.  </P> <P> "They're not doing us right," he said, referring to North Carolina.  </P> <P> North Carolina Gov. James G. Martin was livid. "North Carolina is being injured  by an irrational attitude by the Tennessee government," he said, adding: "We  don't like it."  </P> <P> Tensions grew; neighborly feelings evaporated. North Carolinians stopped  shopping in Tennessee and Tennesseans stopped shopping in North Carolina.  </P> <P> Ronnie Sprinkle, owner of a downtown Canton dry cleaning shop, says he stopped  using the two Tennesseans who were among his business supply vendors. "Anybody  who has a governor that acts the way theirs does doesn't deserve my money," he  said.  </P> <P> Two North Carolina state senators proposed prohibiting Jack Daniels whiskey  from crossing the border into their state. In response, Sam Venable, a  Knoxville News-Sentinel columnist, said that such a ban would be fine with him  and urged his fellow Tennesseans to join him in drinking North Carolina's  share.  </P> <P> Dick Mullinix, a retired engineer and president of the North Carolina-based  Pigeon River Action Group, which was formed in 1983 to protect the river, says  that he was forced to leave his home in Waynesville, near Canton, after a rash  of threatening phone calls. He took refuge for the rest of the winter at his  vacation retreat in Florida.  </P> <P> He says that one anonymous caller told his wife: "You know that husband of  yours who loves the Pigeon River. You're gonna find him floating down that  river face down one of these days."  </P> <P> Once again, the EPA decided to redraft Champion's permit. Among other things,  this latest version calls for a standard of 50 color units in the Pigeon by the  time the river reaches Tennessee, and for the first time calls for dioxin  testing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hearings Set  </P> <P> Public hearings on the proposal have been scheduled for August in Knoxville and  Asheville. Meanwhile, Champion continues to operate under the permit that it  has held from the state since 1985.  </P> <P> Champion officials say they can live with the proposed requirements, although  it will require a cutback in production and the layoff of about 1,000 workers  -- about 50% of the work force. It also will require expenditures of about $175  million in new anti-pollution equipment.  </P> <P> But few residents in Canton and the surrounding area of North Carolina are  pleased at the prospect of so many permanent layoffs.  </P> <P> Some merchants are already feeling the pinch as Champion workers and others who  make their livelihood from the firm -- such as loggers and truckers -- hold  back on purchasing big-ticket items.  </P> <P> "Our sales are off about 30% and have been for about seven months," said Hugh  Yarborough, general manager of a Canton car dealership.  </P> <P> At Canton's municipal building, City Manager Bill Stamey says that local and  county officials are working on a plan to recruit a manufacturing concern that  would absorb any workers Champion lays off.  </P> <P> He says the mood in Canton is one of anxiety and despair over the future.  </P> <P> "People with young children are saying: 'How am I going to educate my kids.'  It's very traumatic," he said. "I've never known a federal agency that's done  more to heap misery on people than EPA."  </P> <P> Across the border in Tennessee, residents are sympathetic with Canton's plight  but say that Tennesseans have long suffered while Champion and North  Carolinians prospered.  </P> <P> Charles Moore, chief administrative officer of Cocke County, through which the  Pigeon flows in Tennessee, says a study done by Walters State College shows  Cocke County is losing between $7 million and $10 million a year in tourism  revenues alone because of the river pollution.  </P> <P> How soon the issue is resolved remains to be seen. Environmental groups in  Tennessee say that, at the August public hearings, they intend to challenge  several important provisions in the latest proposed permit -- including one  that would give Champion the authority to perform the required dioxin testing.  </P> <P> "That's like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop," said Fran  Ketterman of Newport, secretary of the Tennessee-based Dead Pigeon River  Council.  </P> <P> Both sides in the dispute would like a speedy resolution. North Carolinians say  too much damage already has been done in the protracted arguments.  </P> <P> For different reasons, Tennesseans agree. "I would like to see that river clean  just once before I join my husband," said widowed Margaret Jenkins, who was  born in the same year that Champion built the mill.  </P></p>

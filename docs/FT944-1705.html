			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Why Bill signed Newt's contract: America Nothing better illustrates the shift in political power in Washington than Bill Clinton's address to the nation last week. Instead of wresting the political initiative from Republicans, Clinton in effect admitted that he had erred and promised to mend his ways. The defining features of the first two years of his presidency were dropped. Deficit reduction became a dead letter, as did fond hopes of expanding the government's role in healthcare and worker training. The new policy objectives are frankly Reaganesque: to reduce the burden of taxation and get government off people's backs. Clinton's 'bill of rights' (an absurd misuse of language) consists of a ragbag of proposed tax breaks for 'middle class' families (American parlance for anybody who is neither poor nor affluent) estimated to cost Dollars 60bn over five years. It includes child tax credits, deductions for college and vocational education, and concessions on retirement saving. The White House swears it will be paid for by cutting the federal bureaucracy and freezing domestic spending, but it has yet to produce the details. As tax policy, the Clinton proposal is little short of disastrous. The increased deductions for children championed by Republicans can perhaps be defended on the grounds that the tax system has become less generous toward children in recent decades. But the new element in the Clinton scheme - a tax break for post-secondary education - represents a damaging (and potentially expensive) retreat from fiscal neutrality. Instead of introducing extra fiscal concessions, the US needs to build on the achievements of the bipartisan 1986 tax act by broadening the base further and cutting marginal rates. But close analysis of the Clinton plan is a waste of energy. The crucial point to remember is that Democrats no longer control the congressional budget machinery. Republicans will be as contemptuous of Clinton's fiscal proposals as Democrats were of the Reagan and Bush budgets in the 1980s. Before Clinton spoke, senior Republicans were already calling for much larger tax cuts. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a likely presidential contender in 1996, wants to double the dependent exemption for children, a measure that would cost Dollars 124bn over five years. There is thus no point worrying whether the Clinton proposals would increase the deficit; the fiscally-relevant question is whether Republicans will cut spending sufficiently to offset their proposed tax cuts. I am cautiously optimistic that they will, although I would not blame bond investors for remaining sceptical. To believe that tax cuts will mean higher deficits, just because they did in the 1980s, is to fail to grasp the changing nature of US politics. Tax cuts used to mean higher deficits largely because the Democrats who controlled the House of Representatives passionately opposed deep cuts in domestic spending. Reagan was thus forced to choose between no tax cuts or tax cuts plus large deficits. The mindset that created that impasse largely disappeared in last month's political revolution. 'Liberal' Democrats were vanquished on November 8. The incoming conservatives relish the prospect of 'downsizing' the federal government. If they shy away from spending cuts and allow the deficit to balloon, while simultaneously pushing for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, they will lose all credibility with voters. The larger question is whether Clinton was wise to repackage himself as a moderate conservative. I suspect he was. There are two possible explanations for the Democrats' defeat last month that might be dubbed 'disgruntled voters' and 'ideological shift'. On the first view, voters (especially blue-collar white males) lashed out at the ruling Democrats primarily because they were feeling economically insecure. If congressional Republicans do not create genuine economic prosperity in the next two years, the argument runs, they too will feel the voters' wrath. There is obviously something in this argument. The rapid productivity growth of the immediate postwar decades has not yet been re-established and real wages are consequently rising slowly for many groups. Yet it was absurd of Clinton to talk of Americans 'hurting', as though the economy were still mired in recession. More than 5m jobs have been created since he took office. The unemployment rate is down to 5.6 per cent. Gross private investment is up nearly 30 per cent. Vehicle and new home sales are up about 20 per cent and running close to the peak levels of the 1980s. People who feel economically insecure do not spend this readily. The election results thus almost certainly reflect a deeper-seated ideological shift. Times really are changing. A couple of generations after Franklin Roosevelt's 'New Deal', Americans have finally lost confidence in the ability of government to solve problems. Think of the hardening of attitudes on welfare: the majority view now is that strict time limits should be placed on benefits. Think of the healthcare debate: as soon as the Clinton plan was perceived as a government takeover of private provision, it was doomed. Think of the desire to curb politicians' powers: 22 states have passed legislation limiting the terms of elected representatives. Speaker-elect Newt Gingrich may be the bete noire of Washington intellectuals. But they, not he, are the aberration. Hence Clinton's decision to risk an egregious flip-flop and dress himself in Republican clothing.</p>

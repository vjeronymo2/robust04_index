			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin says Israel  cannot countenance a situation in which terrorists escape into  the autonomous areas after an attack and the Palestinian  authorities do not take steps to apprehend them. In an  interview with reporter Jack Katzenell, Beilin said the  Palestinian administration is still in diapers, but it must  disarm the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorists.  Today's terrorists' attacks were both sad and serious, Beilin  said.    [Begin Beilin recording] It is sad because of the people who  were killed and injured, and it is serious also because of the  fact that the Palestinians did not react properly to this event.  What they have to do is to claim responsibility to assure that  they are doing their utmost in order to disarm those people, and  to pursue them, and to find them. The difficulties are there,  we know that, we don't dismiss it, but it is now the duty of the  Palestinian police to deal with the matter, to find the people,  and to do whatever possible in order to prevent a recurrence of  those events in the future.

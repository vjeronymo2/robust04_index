			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow firms on continued rate cut hopes Wall Street A WEAKER than expected national purchasing managers report boosted investors' hopes for lower interest rates, lifting US share prices across the board in the process, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 35.58 ahead at 3,354.10, its high for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 4.74 to 412.88, while the American SE composite added 3.73 at 383.01 and the Nasdaq composite ended 5.39 higher at 568.99. Turnover on the New York SE was fairly heavy at 214m shares, and rises outpaced falls by more than two-to-one. As it has for the past week, speculation about monetary policy remained the dominant influence on market sentiment. An announcement from the National Association of Purchasing Management that its index of nationwide business activity fell from May's 56.3 to 52.8 in June sparked widespread strong buying. The report indicates that the economy is still expanding, albeit very slowly, but analysts had predicted a stronger number. The figures immediately boosted hopes that the Federal Reserve, which was reviewing monetary policy at its monthly Open Market Committee meeting yesterday, will cut interest rates once more to stimulate economic activity. If today's June employment report is noticeably weak, then the chances of a rate cut will be high, analysts said. Among individual stocks, General Motors retreated Dollars 1 to Dollars 43 after analysts warned that a write-off at its Hughes Aircraft subsidiary, announced late on Tuesday, could wipe out the carmaker's profits for the first half of this year. GM's class 'H' shares, which represent Hughes, dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 22 5/8 . The other two auto giants were also lower, with Chrysler off Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 21 and Ford Dollars 3/8 cheaper at Dollars 45 3/8 . Owens-Corning moved ahead Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 31 3/4 after the company settled its lawsuits related to asbestos. The retailer, Bradlees, a subsidiary of Stop &amp; Shop, made its debut yesterday. With 11m shares offered to the public at Dollars 13 each, the stock finished the session at Dollars 12 1/2 after turnover of 2.6m shares. Stop &amp; Shop, meanwhile, was Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 13 1/8 . Systems Center plummeted Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 6 3/4 on a warning from the company that it expects to post a significant operating loss in the second quarter. On the Nasdaq market, Wetterau climbed Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 29 1/8 in the wake of a deal clinched late on Tuesday whereby Super Valu will buy Wetterau for Dollars 30 1/4 a share in cash. Oracle Systems appreciated Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 17 3/8 after an analyst at broking house Alex Brown upgraded the stock from 'neutral' to 'buy' in the wake of the company's strong earnings. Michael's Stores weakened Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 17 1/2 after investors reacted negatively to news that the retailer's same store sales during June were up by just 2 per cent. Toronto was closed yesterday for Canada Day.</p>

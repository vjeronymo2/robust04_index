			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Mr Mulroney's political legacy MR BRIAN Mulroney is bowing out as Canada's leader essentially for one reason: to give his Conservative party a sporting chance of retaining power in the general election later this year. His unpopularity had become so overwhelming, and so apparently immutable, that its chances of winning with him at its head were generally rated negligible. Why is Mr Mulroney so unpopular? Mainly because he has been in power for eight years, the last few of which have coincided with the longest and deepest recession in Canada's postwar history. Most of the causes of the recession lay well outside the prime minister's control, but his policies have been perceived by many Canadians as making things worse rather than better. That is almost certainly unfair. It is hardly likely that Canadians in general would be better off if trade barriers had been left in place between their economy and that of the US and no attempt had been made to reform their tax and social security systems. These reforms - the free trade agreements with the US and Mexico especially - may well turn out to have laid the foundation for a new era of Canadian prosperity. The Conservative party intends, in fact, to continue Mr Mulroney's policies, while hoping that a new leader can escape the odium so firmly attached to his name and personality. But such a leader may not be easy to find. Novelty will no doubt be an advantage in itself, as it was for Mr John Major when he succeeded Mrs Margaret Thatcher. But the Canadian political system, with its federal constitution, its pronounced regional differences, and above all its linguistic divide, is more complicated than the British. Not the least of Mr Mulroney's achievements has been to hold the federation together, during a period which has seen three federal states in Europe break up. To compare Canada with Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union may seem far-fetched; with Czechoslovakia perhaps a little less so. A bi-national state, in which the two nations are far from evenly balanced, is almost by definition a difficult one to manage. The Czechoslovak example shows that democracy is as likely to drive them apart as to keep them together; that divorce is not synonymous with violent conflict; and that relations between the partners are not necessarily easier after divorce than before it. All three lessons merit Canadian contemplation. Although Mr Mulroney's attempts at a negotiated constitutional compromise both foundered - the Meech Lake accord unratified by the western provinces, the Charlottetown one rejected in a referendum - his efforts, and his personal roots in Quebec, did help secure a tacit and grudging consent from the Quebecois to the maintenance of the federation as a lesser evil. It even seems that, since last October's referendum, some of the heat has gone out of that issue. There is a danger that the leadership struggle and the general election may revive it.</p>

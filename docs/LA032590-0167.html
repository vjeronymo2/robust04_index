			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RECYCLING PROGRAM  </P> <P> Orange County is in need of a mandatory recycling program. Cities across the  nation have already adopted routine recycling along with regular trash pickups.  </P> <P> Separating glass, newspapers, aluminum cans, and plastic bottles isn't too much  to ask of this environmentally indifferent society.  </P> <P> For something that takes little or no effort, the results are phenomenal. For  instance, the state of Washington is testament to that fact, as its  metropolitan areas have adopted a requisite program for citizens to recycle  reusable materials, and it is undoubtedly one of the cleanest states.  </P> <P> Orange County isn't exactly pristine (any longer), and something that is so  simple and can be so beneficial is an obvious necessity. It makes one ask how  stupid we are for not having implemented such a plan already.  </P> <P> VITO MAZZARINO  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Boost in view for French television THE Balladur government is planning to give France's audiovisual industry a regulatory and financial boost in an attempt to stem mounting competition from the US. The moves, according to Mr Alain Carignon, France's communications minister, will include freer investment rules and easier licence renewal for France's three main private TV stations, permission for French or European-made programmes (as distinct from imports from Hollywood) to be interrupted more frequently by advertising breaks, and the appointment of France's current envoy to the UN to be its 'audiovisual ambassador' in the Gatt talks. Mr Carignon complained this week that Britain had not incorporated recent EC legislation recommending intra-Community broadcasters carry a majority of EC-made programmes on their airwaves, into its rules on cable and satellite transmission. He warned France might take Britain, which has authorised broadcasts by the TNT and Cartoon satellite channels from September 17, to the European Court of Justice. His officials estimate that allowing the TF1 and M6 private TV stations to increase the number of advertising breaks in French or EC-made programmes from one to two would earn them an extra FFr200m (Pounds 22.7m) a year. The French government already directly pays French feature film-makers nearly FFr1bn a year, and local TV programme makers over FFr 700m a year. The minister plans to present legislation this autumn to raise from 25 to 50 per cent the ceiling on a single shareholder's investment in private TV stations. The government does not intend to privatise the state-owned France 2 and 3 channels. It aims, from autumn 1994, to put a station broadcasting training skills to France's 3m jobless on the airwaves once occupied by the La Cinq channel.</p>

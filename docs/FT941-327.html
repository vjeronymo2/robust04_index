			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Pirelli plans to raise L1,000bn for expansion Pirelli, the Italian tyres and cables group which has completed a two-year restructuring, yesterday announced plans for L1,000bn (Dollars 611m) of new funding aimed partly at a relaunch of its core products on international markets. The holding company is to raise the money through a debenture loan for 1994 to 1998, convertible into ordinary shares, at a price between L2,000 and L3,000. It will use the proceeds to expand activities and finance new products. The funding will also allow it to participate in the recapitalisation of its Amsterdam-based offshoot, the quoted Pirelli Tyre Holding (PTH). PTH plans a share capital increase through the issue of slightly over 31m new shares valued at Fl 10 each. Shareholders will be offered one new share for every three owned, at a discount to be determined at the general meeting in May. The issue is expected to raise Fl 500m, with a further Fl 150m coming from warrants reserved for minority shareholders. The holding company's board will also recommend, for the sake of operating flexibility, that authorisation should be given for further capital increases up to L500bn as necessary. Mr Marco Tronchetti Provera, managing director, said the group expected to return to net profit in 1994. The 1993 net loss, which springs from restructuring costs and will be revealed next month, will be below the L154bn deficit posted in 1992. Consolidated sales rose 12 per cent in 1993 to L9,210bn while the group's net profits before extraordinary items is estimated at tens of billions of lire, compared with a L93bn loss in 1992. Net debt diminished by about 20 per cent to L2,128bn.</p>

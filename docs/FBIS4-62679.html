			<p>BFN     [Text] Press-Secretary of the Armenian Foreign Ministry  Aram Safaryan dismissed a statement by the Azeri side that talks  on the settlement of the Karabakh problem with participation of  defense ministers of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Commander of the  Nagorno-Karabakh Army mediated by Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev were disrupted by Yerevan's fault.    Earlier on Tuesday [17 May] a source in the Azeri Embassy in  Moscow claimed that Armenia insisted on considering the status  of Nagorno-Karabakh along with the withdrawal of troops from  seized Azeri territories.    Press-secretary of the Armenian president Levon Zurabyan  declined to comment on the situation around the talks until the  return of the Armenian delegation from Moscow.</p>

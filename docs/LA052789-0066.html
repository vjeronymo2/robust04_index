			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HOMELESSNESS IN SUBURBIA' AND SHEEN'S OFFER OF A SANCTUARY  </P> <P> Pettepiece's article really angered me. What was this writer doing for five  weeks while he waited for the commission check? Did he ever consider working at  any job, even temporarily, to pay his immediate bills? If he had bothered to  try, there are literally thousands of jobs available for someone who wants to  work. This would temporarily give him money to buy at least the basics.  </P> <P> I've been poor before but I have always found temporary jobs to get me through  lean times. I have absolutely no empathy for Pettepiece. He should try working  for a living!  </P> <P> STEVE KNECHT  </P> <P> Ontario  </P></p>

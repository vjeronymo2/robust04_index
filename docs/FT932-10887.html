			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Funds flow out of the D-Mark THE D-MARK softened against most European currencies yesterday as dealers continued to show concern about the speed with which the Bundesbank is now easing monetary policy, writes James Blitz. In recent days, dealers have claimed to see funds flowing out of the D-Mark into countries whose interest rates are not dissimilar to those in Germany, but whose fundamental economic conditions are a good deal better. The recent fall in German bond prices was a particularly strong indication that dealers think that the weekly cuts in German rates threaten higher inflation. Yesterday, the Swiss franc performed well against the German currency, testing the SFr0.90 level against the D-Mark before closing at SFr0.897 from a previous SFr0.902. With 3-month D-Marks now at around 7.63 per cent, the short term rates for the Swiss Franc, at around 5 per cent, look more attractive than they have in the past. The French franc also performed strongly against the D-Mark, amid speculation that the French authorities might be able to cut their official interest rates again. The franc closed at FFr3.372 to the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.373. Three-month French franc interest rates also came more-or-less in line with 3 month D-Marks, one of the clearest signs yet of the market's new-found confidence in the French currency. Investors in the French currency had demanded a 5 percentage point premium above D-Marks earlier this year. Both the Belgian and Dutch currencies have also strengthened in recent days, widening their differential above the D-Mark in the exchange rate mechanism grid. Last night, the Dutch guilder was some 32 basis points above the D-Mark in the grid, compared to the Dutch government's informal band of 50 basis points. Mr Nigel Rendell, international economist at James Capel in London, believes the Dutch will be forced to cut rates if this trend continues. Two currencies that profited a little less from this trend were sterling and the Italian lira. The pound was only slightly stronger the D-Mark amid continuing fears that the UK government may face a humiliating defeat in the House of Commons on the Maastricht bill. The pound closed at DM2.4750 from a previous DM2.4675. The lira momentarily weakened after news that Moody's rating agency had downgraded Italy's long term currency debt. However, so much bad news has been discounted over the lira that the move down was contained. The lira closed stronger on the day at L928.9 from a previous L933.5 The dollar was slightly stronger against the D-Mark following an unexpected 4 basis point cut in the Bundesbank's repo rate to 7.71 per cent. The dollar closed at DM1.5780 from a previous DM1.5710.</p>

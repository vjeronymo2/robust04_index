			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHBISHOP ROGER MAHONY  </P> <P> The highly charged emotional issues of abortion and cigarette smoking in public  places have this in common: They restrict population growth, one by  forestalling the birth of unwanted children and the other by escalating the  death rate; and they polarize perfectly nice, reasonable people instantly into  bitter enemies, ready to do bodily harm at the least provocation! Take good  Archbishop Mahony, for instance. A pleasant regular guy -- jogs, flies his own  helicopter, says "geez," talks just like you, me and the other fellas down at  the health club.  </P> <P> But when the subject of abortion comes up, watch out! This mild-mannered Dr.  Jekyll metamorphoses -- in a trice -- into fire-breathing Mr. Hyde! Never mind  that overpopulation causes most of the world's problems, and that most Latino  families live in squalor. "There is no such thing as a pro-choice Catholic  public official." To perpetuate such archaic, arbitrary, dilatory dogma, the  archbishop (and the Vatican) must be running scared. And with good reason!  </P> <P> MARVIN H. LEAF, Rancho Mirage  </P></p>

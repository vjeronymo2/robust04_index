			<p>930723 FT  23 JUL 93 / Supermarkets in Sunday protest BRITAIN'S three biggest supermarkets have joined forces to fight off the latest threat to Sunday trading. J. Sainsbury, Safeway and Tesco will cover up to half their goods with plastic sheeting at their stores in Solihull, West Midlands, but will remain open for the combined total of 14,500 people who regularly use the three branches on Sunday. They agreed to sell only goods which do not breach the Shops Act after Solihull Council threatened to seek a High Court injunction to close them down on Sundays.</p>

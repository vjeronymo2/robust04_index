			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report]  <H5>  Samper Leading in Two Polls </H5>   In a poll conducted 23-24 March by Statistics Ltd. for CMI  News and EL ESPECTADOR newspaper, 45 percent of respondents said  they would vote for Liberal Party presidential candidate Ernesto  Samper in the 29 May elections compared with 40 percent who  would vote for Conservative Party candidate Andres Pastrana. All  other candidates received 4 percent or less of the vote. The  results are based on a random telephone survey of 1,200 people  in the five largest cities who said they intended to vote.  Respondents were equally divided between men and women. A 3  percent margin of error was reported. (EL ESPECTADOR, 29 Mar)    When viewed according to city, results were as follows: in  Bogota the two candidates were in a virtual tie, with Samper at  42 percent and Pastrana at 41; in Medellin, the two were tied at  44 percent; while in Cali, Samper had a substantial lead of 54  to 27 percent, in Barranquilla he led 44 to 29 percent, and in  Bucaramanga, he had only a marginal advantage, 44 to 41 percent.    Samper led Pastrana among male respondents obtaining 47  percent of the vote compared with 36 percent for Pastrana;  Pastrana showed a slight lead over Samper among female voters  obtaining 44 percent of the vote compared with 43 percent for  Samper.    When asked who they felt would be better prepared to take  over in the event of the president's absence--Samper's running  mate Humberto de la Calle or Pastrana's running mate Luis  Fernando Ramirez--respondents gave De la Calle 67-80 percent of  the vote depending upon the city, compared with 10-15 percent  for Ramirez. There was no appreciable difference between  preferences of male and female voters.    Pastrana said he was "not worried" by the poll results. (EL  ESPECTAD0R, 30 Mar) Ramirez viewed De la Calle's lead in that  poll as "normal" given that De la Calle had been campaigning for  months, while Ramirez had just begun. Samper expressed his  satisfaction with the results, noting that it showed that his  decision to select De la Calle as his running mate was  "correct." Samper also declared that the candidates' "commitment  to social issues" was emerging as the central factor in the  elections. (EL ESPECTAD0R, 30 March)    A second poll conducted on 25-27 March by the National  Consulting Center and commissioned by the Bavaria firm, showed  Samper leading in the first round with 49 percent of the vote  compared with 41 percent for Pastrana. (EL TIEMPO, 30 Mar) All  other candidates received 4 percent or less of the vote. In a  runoff election, Samper was said to receive 54 percent of the  vote, compared with 43 percent for Pastrana.    When asked whether they intended to vote in the elections,  57  percent said they would, 20 percent said they probably would, 6  percent said they probably would not, and 17 percent indicated  they would definitely not vote.    These results are based on reported face-to-face interviews  with 3,102 persons, selected at random, in urban areas of 40  municipalities.  <H5>  Maza Decries Illicit Campaign Funding </H5>   When asked during an interview with EL ESPECTADOR newspaper  whether he believed reports that money from illicit sources was  being used to help finance the campaigns, independent  presidential candidate Miguel Maza responded that "there is not  the slightest doubt." Maza described the use of such funds as  "an insult to a country submerged in poverty and lacking in  basic services." Maza added that illicit funds originated  either from drug trafficking and other types of criminal  actitivity, or as a result of corruption involving state  contractors. According to Maza, such money is "circulating in  abundance." (EL ESPECTADOR, 2 April)  <H5>  Pastrana Campaigns in Miami </H5>   Andres Pastrana traveled to Miami during Holy Week to bring  his campaign message to Colombian citizens there. He reiterated  his criticism of the renewal late last year of diplomatic  relations with Cuba, declaring that now was not the "proper  time" for such a move. He recalled that during his visit to  Colombia last year, Cuban President Fidel Castro refused to  condemn the activities of Colombian guerrillas. (EL TIEMPO, 2  April) Pastrana also warned that it was important for Colombia  to "act quickly" to gain entrance to NAFTA and said the country  must continue to press ahead with economic integration efforts  in Latin America. (EL TIEMPO, 2 April)    While in Miami, Pastrana attended a Colombian-American  Chamber of Congress luncheon, which drew a capacity crowd. The  candidate also granted interviews to several radio and  television stations, toured Colombian-owned businesses in the  city, and hosted a fund-raising dinner.    Ernesto Samper had originally planned to travel to Miami  that  same week, but reportedly canceled his trip for security  reasons. (EL ESPECTADOR, 31 March)  <H5>  Samper Responds to Bishop, Calls For Hostages' Release </H5>   Before taking a few days off from campaigning during Holy  Week, Ernesto Samper responded to Bucaramanga Archbishop Dario  Castrillon's charge that Samper's appointment of Senator Claudia  Rodriguez de Castellanos, a member of the evangelical Christian  Movement party, to the Commission for the Renewal of the Liberal  Party was politically motivated. Castrillon reportedly made the  comments during a recent homily in which he said that Samper's  action could create conflict with other sectors of the  population who hold different religious beliefs. Samper denied  any political motive, claiming he would not permit  discrimination of any kind in his campaign and adding that he  does not recognize "any differences among Colombians based on  creed, ideology, sex, or race." (EL ESPECTADOR, 31 March)    Samper also called on the country's guerrillas to free all  their hostages, including the father of Luis Fernando Ramirez,  vice-presidential candidate of the rival Conservative Party. (EL  ESPECTADOR, 30 March)  <H5>  Candidates Revise Campaign Itineraries </H5>   As a result of the decision to postpone the presidential  elections until 29 May, candidates are reportedly revising their  campaign intineraries, scheduling visits to additional  municipalities and making plans to revisit certain key areas,  according to EL TIEMPO (2 April).    Although Ernesto Samper is said to be the strongest  candidate  in the Atlantic Coast region, his campaign advisers have decided  he should visit several of the departments in that region as  often as possible during the remaining weeks of the campaign.  They recall that in 1982 former president Lopez lost in that  region of the country, even though it was considered a bastion  of support for both the Liberal Party and Lopez himself, an  outcome they attribute to the feeling of complacency that set in  following the Liberal Party's good showing in the legislative  elections.    Andres Pastrana will also be targeting this region during  the  remainder of the campaign, according to EL TIEMPO. Pastrana is  currently strong in Medellin and Bogota, which, the paper says,  explains Samper's recent decision to name three  "heavyweights"--Carlos Lemos, Carlos Lleras de Ia Fuente, and  former Bogota mayor Sonia Duran--to help direct his campaign in  Bogota.    Antonio Navarro has been trying to garner support among  residents of the poorest municipalities, continuing to promote  his list of "promises" which he signs in the presence of a  notary at each location he visits, according to EL TIEMPO.</p>

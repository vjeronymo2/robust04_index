			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Taylor Woodrow goes deeper into the red LOSSES on several problem contracts and further write-downs in property and land values sent Taylor Woodrow, the UK construction group, much deeper into the red last year. The final dividend was slashed to 0.5p to leave a 1p total, down from 9.5p. Pre-tax losses of Pounds 66.1m, against Pounds 2.7m, followed Pounds 66.4m of exceptional charges as housing land and property values were cut further. Before exceptionals, profits fell from Pounds 43.8m to Pounds 300,000. Contracting, which accounted for 71 per cent of the group's Pounds 1.23bn sales, increased its losses from Pounds 19.6m to Pounds 32.5m. Problem contracts include: the Channel tunnel, for which Pounds 8.5m was provided; the Storebaelt project in Denmark; Euro Disney in Paris; John Wayne airport in the US; and a newly disclosed Pounds 4.2m shortfall in Saudi Arabia. Mr Tony Palmer, chief executive, said: 'It is an unhappy coincidence that we have so many unresolved issues at the same time.' Action taken to cut Pounds 20m from annual overhead costs included shedding 1,400 jobs - among them 30 subsidiary directors as 30 companies were eliminated. Sixteen buildings had been vacated, releasing 150,000 sq ft for sale, rent or surrender. Property contributed Pounds 17.2m to profits, down from Pounds 44m. Disposals amounted to Pounds 32m, rental income increased. The portfolio value has declined from Pounds 802m at the end of 1989 to Pounds 548m. In housing, profits were flat at Pounds 6.6m as UK losses offset improvements in North America and Australia. The write-downs reduced the average land value per plot to Pounds 10,500, about 14 per cent of the selling price. The trading and financial division declined from Pounds 12.6m to Pounds 9m. Mr David Green, finance director, said net debt had gone up from Pounds 156m to Pounds 228.6m. The cash outflow was Pounds 62m, most of it in contracting which had now stabilised. More disposals were expected. Net assets fell from Pounds 677m to Pounds 525m after a Pounds 23.8m extraordinary charge for closing a structural steel business and a Pounds 58m cut in revaluation reserves. Gearing had nearly doubled to 43.5 per cent. The target was to reduce it to less than 40 per cent this year. Losses per share grew to 93.8p from 68.6p. Lex, Page 22</p>

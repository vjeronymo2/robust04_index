			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH GETS IN-THE-BAG FEEL OF SPILL  </P> <P> Angry that President Bush has yet to visit the oil-stained beaches of Alaska's  Prince William Sound, the National Wildlife Federation sent pieces of the  fouled shoreline to the White House today.  </P> <P> The environmental group delivered to Bush and leaders of his Administration  zip-lock plastic bags containing blackened, slime-covered stones from a beach  twice treated by Exxon after its disastrous oil spill six months ago.  </P> <P> Each bag was labeled, "A Prince William Sound rock called 'clean' by Exxon."  Included in the package was another small bag with an unstained stone marked,  "A Prince William Sound rock the way God made it."  </P> <P> "We wanted each of them to be able to touch, to smell, to experience in a very  small way, the effects of the oil spill in Prince William Sound," said  federation President Jay Hair.  </P> <P> Hair accused Exxon of trying to fool the public by claiming the beaches have  been "environmentally stabilized."  </P></p>

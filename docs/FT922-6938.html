			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Yamaha blames sluggish demand for 29% decline YAMAHA, the world's leading musical instrument maker, logged a 37.6 per cent drop in non-consolidated pre-tax profits, to Y6.8bn (Dollars 52.6m). Net profits fell 29.4 per cent to Y2.8bn in the year ended March. Both figures were down for the second consecutive year. The Shizuoka-based company blamed sluggish demand for pianos and other musical instruments for the declines. Overall, sales for the year edged up 0.1 per cent to Y383.7bn after a slight decline the previous year. Domestic sales, however, gained 1.3 per cent to Y272bn, despite weak demand for synthesizers and other electrical instruments. The negative effect of the yen's rise contributed to a 2.8 per cent drop in exports, to Y111.5bn, despite the start of piano shipments to Steinway of the US during the second half of the year. Piano sales fell Y7.4bn to Y60bn, electronic instruments Y3.2bn to Y68bn and audio equipment Y3bn to Y29bn. Sales of other instruments gained Y1.4bn to Y50bn. Yamaha's current assets slipped Y12.6bn to Y150.6bn, including a drop of Y518m in its securities holdings, to Y890m. For the year to next March, Yamaha expects sales and profits to decline further, largely because of a planned shift of household equipment operations to a subsidiary. Pre-tax profits are expected to fall 48 per cent to Y3.5bn and net profits 47 per cent to Y1.5bn, on a sales drop of 10 per cent in sales to Y345bn.</p>

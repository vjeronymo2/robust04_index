			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Jobs: Better than being good in a crisis - Progress in developing computerised test of an ability highly useful in many types of work JUST suppose, if such isn't your job already, that your living depends on achieving top-class results to tight deadlines, whatever fate may betide. Which of the following kinds of workmates would you rather have in support? A - Those who're good in a crisis. B - People who prevent crises from happening in the first place, by anticipating likely problems and ensuring they don't arise. Except madcap youths, slaves to routine and masochists, all of us would surely prefer B: problem- anticipators. So the omens look good for psychologist Clive Thacker of Wolverhampton University. Although a specialist in psychometric tests, he has doubts about an assumption made by most recruiters who use them. It is that job requirements can be broken down into shopping lists of intellectual and personality traits measurable by standard yardsticks: for example, so much skill at mentally manipulating information expressed in words, plus so much at manipulating numerical data, plus such a degree of pushiness . . .and so on. In his view, adding testable traits together in that way is incapable of giving an accurate gauge of the vast complexity of human talents. He is therefore focusing his research, not on general measures of personality and the like, but on developing a computerised test of one specific ability important in many jobs: that of anticipating problems. The prototype combines three elements. The first is a 15-item questionnaire assessing people's disposition to think ahead, a yardstick which Dr Thacker, who switched career to psychology in his early 30s, devised in the course of his doctoral studies. The next checks speed of mental reaction. Then comes a test of ability to think logically about cause and effect. All the elements, he says, are 'modelled to interact dynamically' - a feat which I gather is in its way not far short of the soccer star's legendary achievement of opening a can of peas with his left foot. The whole gauntlet can be run in 30 minutes or so. As for the test's benchmark of problem-anticipating excellence, thereby hangs a tale. Clive Thacker's particular interest in the ability dates from the 12 years he served on the production staff of professional theatre companies, working his way up from assistant stage manager. In that kind of job, he explains, the governing principle is not just Sods Law's ruling that if anything can go wrong, it will. Actors are typically so 'disaster-prone' that, even if it can't go wrong, they'll somehow fix for it to do so. Nor are the dangers thereof limited to distracting the audience from the plot. 'When we did the Caucasian Chalk Circle up in Newcastle, we had two 25ft towers on stage and the cast had to make a rope bridge between them, which the leading lady walked across. That put us on a potential of a death a night. And though there are always plenty of actors looking for work, women who can play big Brechtian roles are rare.' Having come through a dozen years of such exposure without even a small disaster to his debit, Dr Thacker thinks he has proved himself a problem-anticipator of high degree. And his score on the test, 96, is the best yet achieved. But that is far from his only reason for confidence that the instrument is sound. By standard statistical checks, the evidence from the several dozens of people tested to date is encouraging. Even so, much refining work is still needed, and Clive Thacker would like to hear from any organisation interested in helping with further development. The Jobs column has already done its bit by becoming another guinea pig, scoring 79. So I can claim my problem-anticipating ability is at least average . . . although my partner Bill Hall says it would be better described as 'just about tolerable'. W HENCE to the table along- side, which tells the sad tale of events in the United Kingdom executive-employment market as gauged by the MSL International consultancy's three-monthly counts of jobs advertised in the more highbrow journals. As may be seen from the line of totals three quarters of the way down, last year's advertised demand fell 10 per cent short of even the record low of 1991. So much for the optimistic hopes I expressed 12 months ago] The previous worst in MSL's 33 years of checking, by the way, was the 1981 tally of 18,795. The separate three-monthly counts under the totals scarcely point to early recovery either. Although the first three quarters of 1992 brought a slowing of the market plunge from the rates of the year before, it steepened again in the final quarter. The only comfort the consultancy can offer is that October was worse than November which in turn was worse than December. Still, to quote the poet Arthur Hugh Clough's brave words on the failure of previous optimism, 'if hopes were dupes, fears may be liars'. Whatever the totals may say, I'm banking on the two plus signs in the upper part of the table for 1992, especially the one against sales and marketing where demand has improved for the second quarter running.</p>

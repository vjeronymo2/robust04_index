			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: Banks cannot reclaim travel rescue money TOSG TRUST FUND LTD v GIROZENTRALE UND BANK DER OESTERREICHISCHEN SPARKASSEN AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT AND OTHERS Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hobhouse: January 28 1992 BONDED SUMS obtained by an incorporated trust fund from banks on the undertaking that money not used in exercise of its corporate powers will be repaid, are repayable only to the extent that they exceed the aggregate of the sums spent by the fund within its powers as set out in its memorandum and articles of association. Mr Justice Hobhouse so held when giving judgment for the plaintiff, TOSG Trust Fund Ltd, on its claim against the defendant banks, Girozentrale und Bank der Oesterreichischen Sparkassen Aktiengesellschaft and others, for a declaration that it was not liable to repay to the banks bonded sums if, though initially misapplied, they were subsequently properly applied by TOSG in accordance with its powers. HIS LORDSHIP said that TOSG was a company set up by the Tour Operators Study Group, an association of UK travel and tour operators. Its primary purpose was to administer bonding arrangements made for the protection of its members' customers in the event of failure. Its objects and powers were defined by its memorandum and articles of association. In accordance with TOSG purposes a bond was issued by the banks on September 28 1989 in favour of TOSG. The subject matter of the bond was the potential failure of a company called ILG Travel Ltd, a TOSG member. The amount of the bond was Pounds 63.2m. The banks undertook to pay the bonded sum to TOSG on demand in the event of ILG Travel's insolvency. In consideration of issue of the bond, TOSG agreed to undertake to repay the banks 'on demand' such part of the 'bonded sum' as was not spent by TOSG in execution of its powers as set out in the memorandum and articles of association. On March 8 1991 the appointment of administrators of ILG Travel triggered the banks' obligation to pay under the bond. On March 11 Pounds 63m was paid by the banks to TOSG under the bond. On March 13 TOSG provided the requisite letter of undertaking. A problem then arose. The ILG group included other associated companies which were not TOSG members. They were affected by the group's collapse. Believing it was entitled to do so, TOSG made payments for the benefit of the non-members' customers. The banks protested that those payments were not within TOSG's powers. They claimed an injunction to restrain TOSG from spending the bonded sum other than in connection with customers of ILG Travel. Judge Diamond sitting as a deputy High Court judge held that TOSG was entitled to make payments in respect of non-members' customers. The banks appealed. The Court of Appeal said TOSG was not entitled to make such payments (FT, February 5 1992). TOSG had paid Pounds 10m outside its powers (ultra vires) and, because the banks were saying that sum should be repaid, it was left with only Pounds 40m to apply within its powers (intra vires) for customers of ILG Travel. Since TOSG did not have funds apart from those paid under bonds, it was not in a position to repay the banks save out of the funds received from the banks. A body called Air Travel Trust (ATT), established by the secretary of state for transport to provide back-up to meet claims arising from the failure of tour operators, had made loans to TOSG, and had given a conditional undertaking which, subject to the present dispute, should also enable TOSG to reinstate the sums expended ultra vires. On February 11 1992 the banks formally demanded repayment of the Pounds 10m. TOSG refused. On February 18 it issued the present proceedings raising the question, inter alia, whether on the true construction of the undertaking it was liable to repay sums applied ultra vires if reimbursed to TOSG (whether by ATT or any other person) and then properly applied. TOSG asked the court to declare it was not under any such liability. The banks counterclaimed a declaration that it was. Their argument was that the express words of the letter of undertaking required TOSG to repay the banks on demand such part of the bonded sum as was not spent on intra vires payments. The figures to which the argument had to be applied were now reasonably crystallised. On the receipts side TOSG had had Pounds 63.2m under the bond on which it had earned Pounds 3.94m interest, making a total Pounds 67.14m. From ATT it had received Pounds 10.1m, partly by way of loan. On the payments side intra vires payments totalling Pounds 51.4m had been made. Other payments totalled Pounds 11.1m. Accordingly at present TOSG had a reserve of Pounds 14.7m. It estimated that there were about a further Pounds 16m intra vires claims to be met. If TOSG was not required to repay the banks it would be able, with ATT's assistance, to pay the ILG Travel customers' claims in full. TOSG submitted that it should be allowed to make the intra vires payments in full. The banks submitted that it should not, but should repay the Pounds 10m paid ultra vires prior to the provision of further funds by ATT. The relationship between TOSG and the banks was simply one of debtor and creditor. The bond gave rise to an obligation on the banks' part to pay a sum to TOSG on a certain contingency occurring. The letter of undertaking imposed on TOSG an independent obligation to pay a sum to the banks on a certain contingency. The contingency if it occurred created a liability in debt of TOSG to the banks. The question of construction of the letter of undertaking was one of identifying the contingency on which creation of the debt stood. The 'bonded sum' was an amount of money, not a fund in which the banks had reserved any proprietary right or which was impressed with any trust. Therefore one could substitute for 'bonded sum' the words Pounds 63.2m. If TOSG could demonstrate it had spent Pounds 63.2m in performance and execution of its intra vires function, it was not liable to repay anything to the banks. The contingency had not occurred. The Court of Appeal judgment was not concerned with the present questions. It was asked to rule on a contention by TOSG that it could avoid liability to repay by proving it would have been possible to have spent on intra vires functions money which it had in fact spent on ultra vires functions. On that argument it could not escape the express words of the undertaking. It could not show that it had spent the money on intra vires functions. Rejection of the contention was inevitable. On the facts now before the court TOSG was in a position to show that, subject to a small margin, the sum spent by TOSG on intra vires functions would fully absorb the sum paid by the banks together with accrued interest. When the matter was before the Court of Appeal TOSG was not in a position to show that, and had to accept for the purposes of those proceedings that the sums properly expended would inevitably fall short of the sum received by some Pounds 10m. The banks' present argument was that as soon as TOSG spent money ultra vires an automatic liability accrued to make an equivalent payment to the banks. That argument depended on some idea of an earmarked fund. There was not any fund having that character. In reality and in law the effect of the letter of undertaking was that when TOSG came to state what it had spent, it could not bring into account any ultra vires expenditure. It could only bring into account intra vires expenditure that it had in fact made. Before the Court of Appeal TOSG's arguments were bound to fail. Before the present court they succeeded. On the true construction of the letter of undertaking TOSG was liable to repay only the amount by which the bonded sum exceeded the aggregate of the intra vires payments.

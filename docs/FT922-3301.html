			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Watchdog praises sale of generators THE privatisation of National Power and PowerGen, the electricity generators, was yesterday declared a success by the National Audit office, the public-spending watchdog. Sir John Bourn, head of the office, said in a report to parliament that in spite of having to float the two companies during a period of market uncertainty because of the Gulf crisis, the Department of Energy had 'introduced a number of innovations'. The two companies, created out of the former Central Electricity Generating Board, were floated in March last year. The report said the department had largely achieved its aims of maximising net proceeds, increasing individual share ownership and achieving a modest share premium. The office praised the department's handling of the offer, particularly the practice of obtaining indications of likely demand from institutions at various prices. Taxpayers had also shared in the benefits of an upward movement in the market during the offer period, thanks to a back-end tender, where a proportion of shares were earmarked for offer to the highest bidders among overseas and institutional investors after the close of the offer period. This raised additional proceeds of Pounds 44.5m. However, it said incentives offered to individuals may have represented 'less value for money' than in the earlier sale of the regional electricity companies. The incentives, estimated to have cost Pounds 40.9m, were of the same level as those in the previous sale, but had played a more limited role. Lex, Page 20</p>

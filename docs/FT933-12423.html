			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Commission confident ERM will hold THE European Commission yesterday expressed guarded confidence in Franco-German moves to defend the franc and hold together the exchange rate mechanism. EC officials said the goal of currency stability was vital to preserving the single market. A decision to devalue the franc or allow the French currency to float temporarily was not in the interest of either France or Germany. Despite rumours throughout the day that the Community's monetary committee might convene at the weekend, an EC official said last night there were no plans to call an emergency meeting. The latest attack on the franc comes amid a recognition in Brussels that the Maastricht treaty's goal of economic and monetary union by January 1, 1997 risks being undermined by the deeper-than-expected recession, bloated budget deficits, and continuing divergence among member states' economies. Senior EC officials are loath to concede as much in public because it would strip Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal and other weaker member states of the political cover they need to take tough budget measures. But others argue that the Commission risks losing credibility unless it 'comes clean' on the Emu timetable. Despite these internal doubts, Commission officials remain confident in the Franco-German axis, arguing that France has no political alternative but to maintain parity with the D-Mark. 'A decision to float would damage France in a serious and lasting way in the financial and monetary field,' said one official. 'It would also damage France as one of the two columns of European construction.' Earlier this year, EC diplomats said high-level Franco-German contacts took place with a view to a future locking of exchange rates and a possible exchange of observers on the boards of the Bundesbank and Bank of France. This week, EC officials and Brussels diplomats speculated that plans for a bold political move could be revived if Paris and Bonn calculated they could not hold currency parity and the ERM was on the brink of imploding.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / 'Everyone is expecting less in bonus this year' Pay and job cuts loom in the City after a week in which one US investment bank decimated staff and two UK houses issued profit warnings. SG Warburg and Hambros said they were reviewing labour costs after warning that bond markets would depress first-half profits. Warburg is under particular pressure to economise - staff costs rose 40 per cent last year to give the average employee Pounds 105,000 a year, the highest of any UK house. Bonuses, which can make half of an employee's compensation in a good year, are heading down. A fixed-income securities trader with five years experience could typically have made Pounds 100,000 last year, half in salary and half in bonus. A City headhunter said: 'Everyone is expecting considerably less in bonus this year.' Cuts will not be across-the-board. The manager of one US investment bank's London derivatives operation said: 'Good people will get higher bonuses. There will be more disparity.' One crude forecast puts bonuses at US investment banks in London down between 30 per cent and 50 per cent from last year's lucrative year. The guaranteed bonus, a feature of recruitment negotiations in 1993, is now rare. Lowering pay may not reduce overheads enough and redundancies are on the agenda. Both Warburg and Hambros have denied any intention of immediate job cuts. Sir Chips Keswick, deputy chairman of Hambros, said: 'I am certainly not going to rush off and fire people at the wrong end of the cycle.' Salomon Brothers of the US, which has suffered the heaviest reported losses in securities markets, has resisted redundancies. But US investment banks such as Kidder Peabody, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and CS First Boston have announced redundancies. Goldman Sachs will not comment officially but insiders at the firm, until recently one of the most aggressive recruiters, speak of impending dismissals. An executive with a rival firm said:, 'Goldman would hire three people with the view that they would keep one, possibly hold on to another and sack the third.' The shake-out at US investment banks bodes ill for employment in the City. Mr Patrick Alexander, partner at Korn Ferry, the executive search company, said: 'It is like night following day that if people are being cut in New York there will be people eventually cut in London.' Already CS First Boston has shed 10 employees in London, as well as 70 in New York. Lehman Brothers is proud of limiting redundancies at its 1,650-strong London office to 'single figures'. Several City firms said there had been a burst of CVs arriving from nervous Goldman Sachs employees. Banks portray redundancies as a reflection of the performance of the employee, rather than the fortunes of the bank. Most investment banks rate their employees and a decimation would involve sacking the weakest 10 per cent. A senior British investment banker said: 'There are ways of doing it by aggressive quality control.' While employment in trading and sales of bonds is under pressure, other areas of investment banking such as derivatives and advice on mergers and acquisitions are healthier. A hopeful trader at a Japanese bank said: 'They are still hiring people in derivatives.' US investment bankers set great store on training to enable staff to switch from one speciality to another as different markets rise and fall. But some feel there are limits to such flexibility. One derivatives salesman said brutally: 'People in derivatives are clever. People in fixed-income are generally not.' This year's tough conditions may, as in the late 1980s, push some people not just from their current job, but out of the industry entirely. The head of one US firm's UK operations said: 'It is painful but it is just something that happens to our industry every two or three years.'</p>

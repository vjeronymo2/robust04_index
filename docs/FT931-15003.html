			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Mexico sees clear road to Nafta accord THE Mexican government is continuing to work on the assumption that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between Canada, Mexico and the US will be implemented at the beginning of next year. A senior official, commenting on last week's talks between President Carlos Salinas and US President-elect Bill Clinton, said the latter had made clear he had no wish to reopen negotiations on the agreement proper. The official said Mexico had been advised this week that Mr Mickey Kantor, a long-time Clinton adviser and nominee for the post of US trade representative, would be appointed to tackle the bilateral issues that arise from Nafta. Mr Clinton underlined at a two-hour meeting with Mr Salinas in Austin, Texas, that he would not send the enabling Nafta legislation to Congress without first negotiating two side accords: on the environment and on jobs protection. Mr Salinas expressed willingness to talk about them, as long as they did not infringe Mexican sovereignty, that they made economic sense, and would not contradict what had already been agreed in Nafta. The official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said his understanding was that Mr Clinton would not insist on a third side accord mentioned by some supporters: preventing import 'surges'. This, he said, was a trade matter already covered in Nafta, and would mean reopening negotiations. While it was unclear how difficult the negotiations would be on environment and labour, it was conceivable that co-operative agreements would not even require legislation. In any case, many of the issues related to jobs - such as the training of displaced workers - were domestic, rather than bilateral, matters. He suggested that if the negotiations became tough, the Mexicans would be more likely to insist on consideration of two other issues: migration and development funding. The timetable suggests the agreement would be presented for ratification in the Canadian parliament by March, in the Mexican senate in June and in the US Congress before or after the August recess. This would allow it to be put into effect next January.</p>

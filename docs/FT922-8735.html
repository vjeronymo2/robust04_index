			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Letter: Educational foundations Sir, Your leaders, 'Los Angeles, a political test . . .and a warning (May 5), rightly draws attention to the possibility of similar events taking place in the UK. You cite public disorder in North Tyne in September as a threat which it would be foolish to disregard, yet difficult to escape, in view of our failure to educate the present generation of young people in deprived areas. However, I think you are unduly pessimistic in suggesting that perhaps all we can do is to lay better educational foundations for the next generation, and meanwhile hope for the best. The adult education skills in the UK are outstanding, and seriously under-used. Universities, local authorities, colleges, the Workers' Education Association and other bodies have organisational capacity which comparatively modest sums could bring into use. The bulk of the teaching in this field is undertaken, very inexpensively, by part-timers, while training and administration are carried out by a small corps of professionals. A crash programme could be in place within months. All that is required is cash, a strong political will, and a little ingenuity in devising student incentives. By the time the educational targets have been achieved, the government's expanded training programmes, one hopes, will be in place. Adult and continuing education should seize this opportunity with both hands. T F Daveney, The Old Chapel, Whiddon Down, Okehampton, Devon EX20 2QP</p>

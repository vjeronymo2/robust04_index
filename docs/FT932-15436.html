			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average declines as Seoul advances to an 18-month high INVESTORS remained inactive ahead of the government's fiscal stimulus package announcement, expected today, and share prices fell marginally amid low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 10.04 to 19,882.14, having risen to the day's high of 19,940.37 in the first hour of trading before falling on arbitrage related selling, and hitting the day's low of 19,740.53 in the afternoon. However, late arbitrage buying erased some of the losses. Volume fell from Friday's 761m shares to 330m, the lowest level in three weeks. Traders attributed the dull trading to the absence of foreign investors, who have been leading the recent rally, because of the Easter holidays. Declines led gains by 606 to 405 with 171 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 7.87 to 1,555.41. Investors also cited the yen's advance against the dollar as an excuse to remain on the sidelines. The dollar closed at a new Tokyo low of Y112.95, down Y0.20 from Friday. The higher yen prompted profit-taking in exporting sectors such as high-technology and car manufacturers. Traders said that investors were placing funds into smaller stocks. 'Rotation buying, which has accounted for the gains in many first section sectors, has now moved into other sections,' said Baring Securities. The second section rose 9.17 to 2,018.12 and the over-the-counter market advanced 18.09 to 1,597.66. Electronics issues lost ground on profit-taking. Hitachi fell Y9 to Y869 and Sony retreated Y40 to Y4,800. Toyota Motor also lost Y10 to Y1,690 on the higher yen. Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, fell Y2 to Y393, while Japan Airlines, which had surged last week on bargain hunting, lost Y12 to Y758. Profit-taking depressed banks and brokers. Sumitomo Bank fell Y30 to Y2,000, while Nomura Securities lost Y80 to Y2,090. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone closed unchanged at Y1.03m, after falling briefly below Y1m on profit-taking. Some gainers included speculative issues, with Cosmo Oil, the oil refiner, up Y10 to Y822 on rumours that the company has become an acquisition target for a large Saudi Arabian conglomerate. Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry rose Y78 to Y763 on reports that it will start mass-producing biodegradable plastics next year. On the second section, Oriental Photo Industrial surged Y54 to Y404 and Maruhachi Warehouse gained Y55 to Y535. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 123.91 to 21,452.49 in volume of 15.7m shares. Roundup A NUMBER of markets on the Pacific Rim remained closed yesterday. SEOUL finished at its highest level for 18 months on strong buying by individuals, and the composite index climbed 12.63 to 720.96. Turnover was strong at Won933.2bn, up from Won512.8bn in Saturday's half-day session. Small and medium sized companies gained momentum aided by a government decision to provide financial assistance of some Won1.4 trillion. BOMBAY fell sharply in spite of curbs on selling imposed by the stock exchange and the BSE index closed down 88.22 at 2,222.69, the first day of the new account. Some analysts commented that investors remained disappointed at the lack of an anticipated interest rate cut last week. SINGAPORE shed some of last week's gains on profit-taking with the Straits Times Industrial index falling 10.56 to 1,707.84. Some investors commented that Malaysian speculative shares were still active, but demand had shrunk from last week's levels. KUALA LUMPUR was helped by a late rally in Telekom which left the composite index up 1.89 at 657.13. TAIWAN continued to ease following its rise to a 12-month high last week. The weighted index closed 16.59 lower at 4,682.27 as turnover fell to TDollars 32.7bn, its lowest level for nearly two months. Buying interest was weak with many investors believing that the market will consolidate with a downward bias in the near term. MANILA was stronger on renewed optimism for the economy. The composite index rose 8.76 to 1,564.89 as turnover declined to 334m pesos.</p>

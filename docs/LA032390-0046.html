			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'FEAR' ECHOES WOODY ALLEN, MINUS THE LAUGHS  </P> <P> Todd Solondz, the young writer-director-star of "Fear, Anxiety and Depression,"  (Goldwyn Pavilion) wants to be the new Woody Allen so badly, he should walk  around with a sandwich board emblazoned, "Generic Woody: All the urban  neuroses, One tenth the cost." And, unfortunately, less than one tenth the  laughs. Of "Interiors."  </P> <P> Solondz, a recent NYU graduate, has a subject ripe for satire: the proto-punk  Lower Manhattan scene, not quite-starving artists in a landscape of creeping  gentrification. But, with all this Allen mimicry, he's like Rich Little run  amok. He sees everything through a double screen: the world as a Woody Allen  movie.  </P> <P> Solondz appropriates everything: glasses, shaggy wardrobe, nervous oververbal  dialogues, anhedonia and self-pity. He uses that draggy, nasal whine. He flops  his arms, stammers. At one point, he even does Woody's little blissed out  mating dance: those stiff-legged, dopey, smirky pirouettes. His own frizzy mop  is black, but otherwise, he's copied everything but the freckles. And the soul.  </P> <P> Given this performance, one might expect the major character, Ira Ellis  (Solondz), to be a young film school graduate obsessed with Woody Allen. But  Solondz shows greater hubris. Instead, Ira is fixated on Samuel Beckett; he's a  struggling playwright, a nebbish-in-excelsis who inexplicably gets bad plays  produced at the Public Theater.  </P> <P> Ira's neurasthenic roundelay of sexual encounters also swarms with Allen  archetypes. His stud-buddy Jack, the poseur pop painter (Max Cantor) is  Solondz's Tony Roberts. His clinging, sniveling girlfriend Sharon (Jill Wisoff)  suggests Louise Lasser. The coldly promiscuous punk performance artist, Junk  (Jane Hamper), whom Ira vainly pursues, is not an obvious Diane Keaton clone --  though Jack's failed actress girlfriend Janice (Alexandra Gersten) is in the  ballpark. And there's a smarmy yuppie success named Donny (Stanley Tucci), who  suggests any number of Allen nemeses from Paul Simon to Alan Alda.  </P> <P> Some of this is clever, but little of it is funny. Solondz has the husk of  Woody, but not the heart or the mechanics. The movie is frenetic, pushy, thin,  obvious -- and Solondz's comic sense tends toward overblown, over-telegraphed  slapstick.  </P> <P> But, though "Fear, Anxiety and Depression" (Times-rated mature for theme and  language) is a pretty complete failure, its stabs at wit, Angst and Manhattan  occasionally nudge their targets and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky ("Vampire's  Kiss") and Solondz get some zippy-stylish long-take scenes and sidewalk  tracking shots. And Tucci, Gersten and Cantor have their moments. Unfortunately  for all of them, Woody still owns the franchise.  </P></p>

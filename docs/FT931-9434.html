			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Directors' Transactions SELLING remains the key to directors' share dealings. This week's trading was notable for the high value of some transactions. Through Imaging Systems, Serge Crasninaski sold 2,705,000 shares in Photo-Me International, raising almost Pounds 10m. He and Imaging Systems still hold 14 per cent of the company. At Menvier-Swain, Charles Swain, the non-executive president, sold 2,389,583 shares at 573p. Some 1,251,709 were held beneficially and the sale leaves Swain with no holding. The company also announced it was to seek a full listing and a 1-for-8 rights issue. The sale of 72,851 shares in Tadpole Technology at 288-290p by H. Kitchener follows a period of strong price performance since the company came to the market at 65p in December 1992. Last year, the Ashley family announced its intention to reduce its total holding in Laura Ashley from more than 50 per cent to about 30 per cent. Sir Bernard Ashley, the non-executive chairman, sold 10m shares at 78.5p. The family still holds 49 per cent. Directors of Filofax, the personal organiser stationery company, have been acquiring shares regularly since the middle of last year at prices as low as 30p. Three directors, including the finance director, have now bought 1,650,907 at 80p.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Turkey has announced that certain circles want to  disrupt Turkey's bilateral relations with Germany and that one  should refrain from indirectly encouraging these circles.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman, replying to a  question at his weekly news conference, said that Turkey and  Germany are two friendly allies that have extensive,  comprehensive and intense relations in all fields. Pointing out  that one should not allow these relations to be adversely  affected, Ataman said that one should also refrain from acts  that might indirectly encourage such circles. He added that it  is primarily the duty and responsibility of Germany to exert  efforts to achieve this end.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA LIFTS BROW AT GORBACHEVS' TOUR;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: RAISA'S PLANNED STOP AT FISHERMAN'S WHARF IS SEEN AS DECLASSE.  WORSE, THE COUPLE WILL CLOG TRAFFIC BY VISITING THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE AT RUSH  HOUR.  </P> <P> The excitement surrounding Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's upcoming  visit here was tempered Wednesday with the release of his wife's itinerary and  news that the Gorbachevs hope to visit the Golden Gate Bridge -- at rush hour.  </P> <P> To ensure security, Golden Gate Bridge officials and the California Highway  Patrol plan to slow traffic on the heavily traveled bridge while the Gorbachevs  and their 30-car motorcade make their way across, sometime between 4 p.m. and 7  p.m. Monday.  </P> <P> Earlier that afternoon, Raisa Gorbachev is tentatively scheduled to go on an  hour-long tour of the city, viewing some of San Francisco's finest sights and  some of its most blighted and tacky.  </P> <P> "Talk about abominations," one San Francisco native involved in the planning  sniffed upon hearing that Raisa Gorbachev will visit touristy Fisherman's  Wharf.  </P> <P> The itinerary released by PBN Co., the San Francisco public relations firm that  is coordinating aspects of the visit, shows that her entourage apparently will  bypass such monuments to Western consumerism as Union Square.  </P> <P> "I. Magnin said at one point they would close the entire store if she wanted to  shop there. But she's not going to (Nordstrom). She's not going to go to I.  Magnin," said Staci Walters of PBN.  </P> <P> After spending the morning with her husband at Stanford University, Mrs.  Gorbachev will take her tour. She probably will be escorted by Tatyana Kamenev,  wife of the Soviet consul general, and perhaps Sherry Agnos, wife of Mayor Art  Agnos, said Charlotte Mailliard Swig, San Francisco's chief of protocol.  </P> <P> "They won't have much time, but I think she'll like it and come back," Swig  said. "I just hope they don't stop in Civic Plaza."  </P> <P> Her itinerary will include a trip to Golden Gate Park, perhaps a stop at a  museum, and a visit to Civic Center, locale of San Francisco's ornate City Hall  and home to hundreds of homeless people who camp in the plaza there. San  Francisco has been sprucing up the plaza in recent months, but does not plan to  relocate the residents.  </P> <P> "It is part of life," Art Silverman, spokesman for Mayor Agnos, said of the  tent dwellers in the plaza outside City Hall. "It is our own glasnost policy,  you might say. We're not going to try to hide anything."  </P> <P> "I think it's great," said Warden Coleman, 33, who has been living in the plaza  for three months with his dog, Lady. The out-of-work bartender put down his  book -- a spy novel -- and pointed out that if Mrs. Gorbachev drives by or  stops at the plaza, "she'll get to see that her country isn't the only one  having trouble."  </P> <P> The tentative schedule also has Mrs. Gorbachev heading to the heart of the  city's financial district, stopping at the 52-story Bank of America building,  then going on to Fisherman's Wharf.  </P> <P> While she tours San Francisco, her husband is scheduled to speak to business  and political leaders at the Fairmont Hotel. San Francisco police spokesman  David Ambrose said he expects that the largest demonstration of the Soviets'  West Coast stop will take place outside the hotel.  </P> <P> Southern California representatives of ethnic Armenian, Latvian, Estonian and  Lithuanian groups said several busloads of demonstrators will arrive Monday  from such locales as Los Angeles, Santa Ana and Fresno.  </P> <P> "There won't be a shortage of Baltic flags flying around," said Jaak Treiman, a  Los Angeles attorney of Estonian extraction.  </P> <P> At the Fairmont, Gorbachev reportedly is planning to acknowledge Gov. George  Deukmejian's relief efforts on behalf of victims of the Armenian earthquake in  1988. Deukmejian, who is of Armenian descent, has said he does not know if he  will have a chance to speak privately with the Soviet leader.  </P> <P> If given the opportunity, the governor added, he will tell Gorbachev that  Armenians in the United States "hope Mr. Gorbachev and his government would  take steps to ensure greater protection for Armenian people living there, and  greater assistance to help them to rebuild from the devastating earthquake."  </P> <P> After the Fairmont speech, Gorbachev will return to the Soviet consul general's  home, meet with his wife, and head to the Golden Gate Bridge.  </P> <P> Officer Bill Wylie, spokesman for the CHP in Marin County, said the Gorbachevs  tentatively plan to cross the bridge and get out of their cars at the vista  point on the Marin side. After gazing upon the San Francisco skyline for about  15 minutes, they will return to their cars for the drive to San Francisco and  the airport.  </P> <P> "We're very happy that he's coming to view our area and our bridge," Wylie  said.  </P> <P> But feelings of peace and goodwill aside, the sightseeing excursion is likely  to take its toll on the Monday evening commute across the Golden Gate.  </P> <P> Wylie said at the minimum, the CHP will slow traffic, and "they could shut down  the bridge for a minute," while Gorbachev and his entourage cross the span. At  rush hour, 6,000 cars an hour head north from San Francisco to Marin across the  bridge.  </P> <P> "We don't think the motorcade itself will impact traffic as much as people  wanting to get a view of the President of the Soviet Union," Wylie said.  </P> <P> Golden Gate Bridge officials say the 25-minute operation -- 15 minutes at the  vista point and 10 minutes for the round-trip drive -- will not result in  gridlock.  </P> <P> "People in this area stay clear when they know there's going to be a major  event. They go home early or they stay late," said Carney Campion, manager of  the bridge.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Doug Smith in Glendale contributed to this story.  </P></p>

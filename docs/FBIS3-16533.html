The present "generals" of executive power -- two  deputy governors, three heads of rural rayon administrations,  and other officials -- have gotten through in single formation.    The level of Kostroma voters' activeness was as a whole  relatively high: According to preliminary figures at least 38  percent of voters took part in voting. It is true that the city  inhabitants demonstrated no particular eagerness to make use of  their legal right. That is why there was no referendum in  Kostroma to approve the statute on local self-management.  Incidentally, this statute, submitted by the mayor of Kostroma,  Federation Council Deputy Boris korobov, markedly expanded the  rights of the representative municipal organ compared with what  was determined by the Russian president's edicts.    To determine the fate of this document, at least half of the  voters should have gone to the polling stations.</p>

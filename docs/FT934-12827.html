			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / People: Siemens' Dolan signals to Cowes Siemens Plessey Electronic Systems is one of the largest employers in Cowes, Isle of Wight, but whether Clive Dolan, the company's new managing director, will have much time to indulge in his hobby of sailing is open to question. Dolan took over the company, which has offices spread over the south of England with outposts in New York and Germany, at the beginning of the month. With 3,500 people worldwide and sales of Pounds 300m, it is the UK arm of Siemens' defence electronics group. His principal challenge is to find new opportunities for growth in a company traditionally tied to the now declining defence market. Dolan's most recent experience should prove invaluable. Since 1991 he has been managing director of Siemens' newly formed air traffic management division, the fastest growing part of the group. Siemens Plessey has special skills in multifunction radar - a new kind of system which can combine surveillance, tracking and targeting in a single instrument through ingenious electronic control of the sensing beam. It is also bidding with Racal for 'Bowman', the next generation British Army communications system. Dolan, 47, read applied science at Newcastle University and worked initially for Marconi and Philips with spells in France and the Netherlands, during which he rather took to the continental way of life. He has been with Plessey since 1983 and was involved in repulsing GEC's first bid for the company. But he has no intention of letting work get in the way of the occasional game of rugby, he says.</p>

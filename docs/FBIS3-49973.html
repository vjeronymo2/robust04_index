Popovic: "Three Candidates for Prime </F> Minister"]    [Excerpt] The new People's Assembly of Serbia will be  inaugurated on Monday, 24 January. This will also mark the  beginning of the process of electing the new republican  government. As this date approaches, more and more candidates  for this post are being mentioned.    Those who consider themselves to be well informed say that  there are three candidates for the head of the Serbian  Government on 11 Nemanjina Street.    Milomir Minic, secretary general of the SPS [Socialist Party  of Serbia] and director general of a big Serbian firm, ZTP  (Rail-Transportation Enterprise), stands a good chance to form a  new government. Zoran Arandjelovic, chairman of the previous  Serbian Assembly and deputy prime minister before that, does not  have any fewer chances of becoming prime minister either. His  chances are even greater if one bears in mind that he was the  head of the SPS' election campaign team at the last elections --  the party that convincingly won more seats than any other party,  123. Milorad Vucelic, director general of the biggest and the  most influential media in Serbia, the Radio and Television of  Serbia, has recently been mentioned as the third candidate for  prime minister.    Regarding other people who were mentioned as candidates from  time to time, it appears that they do not stand a chance at all  to become the next prime minister of Serbia. [passage omitted]</p>

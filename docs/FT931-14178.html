			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Thailand plans tax incentives to attract investors THAILAND, facing a sharp fall in inward foreign investment, yesterday announced plans to attract new investors and ease congestion in Bangkok by refining tax incentives and putting more emphasis on development in the provinces. Approaches by foreign investors to the Board of Investment (BoI) fell for the third year in a row in 1992, with the value of foreign capital registered in new applications dropping to Bt12bn (Pounds 304m) from nearly Bt25bn in 1991. The total value of proposed investments in domestic and foreign applications fell by a quarter to Bt213bn. Although actual investment in 1992 remained high - reflecting earlier applications - Thai officials are anxious to ensure a steady inflow of foreign money to finance the next stage of the country's industrial development. Mr Staporn Kavitanon, BoI secretary general, told a meeting of the European chambers of commerce in Bangkok yesterday that the decline in foreign direct investment was due to a combination of 'political instability in Thailand, the opening-up of new cheap labour sites in the region, the well-known infrastructure and manpower constraints of our nation, and the recession in world markets'. BoI officials are proposing a number of changes to Thailand's incentive scheme for investors, including benefits for companies which move factories away from Bangkok and increased incentives for investments in the provinces furthest from the capital. The plan, according to Mr Staporn, is to put the emphasis on location rather than export promotion when it comes to granting BoI privileges to potential investors. The BoI board, chaired by Mr Chuan Leekpai, the prime minister, who has pledged to support regional development, will consider the proposals later this month. Despite the downturn in applications, Mr Staporn said he was comforted by the knowledge that investment would be sustained by a series of large infrastructure projects and by the increasing number of new projects in areas that would deepen Thailand's industrial base. Taiwanese investment in Thailand has fallen sharply, as it has in Malaysia, but this reflects the fact that Taiwanese businesses are locating 'screwdriver' assembly operations and textile factories in countries with cheaper labour costs, such as Vietnam. Meanwhile, Japanese and European companies are using Thailand for investments in more sophisticated sectors such as chemicals and automotive components.</p>

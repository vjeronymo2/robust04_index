John Samuel Malecela, prime minister of Tanzania, said that  the question of Korean reunification must be solved entirely by  the efforts of the Korean people themselves and that Tanzania  would support the stand of the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea for the country's reunification.    Anatole Kanyenkiko, prime minister of Burundi, said that the  10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation and  formula of reunification through confederacy put forward by the  great leader President Kim Il-song are peace-loving and  patriotic proposals to reunify the split country and unite the  divided compatriots into one through dialogue, not  confrontation, and by peaceful means, nor war.    Anerood Jugnauth, prime minister of Mauritius, said he  supported the Korean people's efforts to reunify the country by  peaceful means and expressed the hope that the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula would be resolved peacefully.</p>

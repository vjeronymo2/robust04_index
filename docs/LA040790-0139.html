			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS;  </P> <P> PLUMBER ACCUSED IN LEISURE WORLD THEFTS  </P> <P> Orange County sheriff's deputies have arrested a Leisure World plumber on  suspicion of burglarizing homes in the retirement community for more than a  year.  </P> <P> Investigators said they suspect that Thomas Daly Norris, 49, used his access to  make duplicate keys that enabled him to enter homes in the 21,000-resident  complex.  </P> <P> Norris was arraigned in South Orange County Municipal Court this week on 12  counts of burglary and one count of possession of stolen goods. He was released  Tuesday on $100,000 bail.  </P> <P> Norris, who lives in Orange, has worked at Leisure World for about 13 years,  said Lt. Robert Rivas.  </P> <P> "As a plumber in the community, he certainly did have access," Rivas said. "Who  knows when he decided to start this?"  </P> <P> Norris has no previous criminal record, Rivas said.  </P> <P> Norris had called in sick and had asked another employee to look for his wallet  in a work truck, Rivas said. The worker found credit cards and a business card  that led police to an antique shop in Orange.  </P> <P> Police were in the store identifying possible stolen goods when Norris  unexpectedly walked through the door, Rivas said. He was arrested without  resistance.  </P> <P> Following the March 29 arrest, police used a search warrant to enter the man's  home and found antique jewelry, silver and other items that allegedly belong to  Leisure World residents.  </P> <P> Rivas said that about $30,000 in stolen goods have been recovered.  </P> <P> "We've had a lot of calls from people about the merchandise so far," he said.

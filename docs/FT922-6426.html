			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Arts: On God-isms - Radio TOMORROW, Radio 4 begins Who believes in Britain?, a series not political but religious, presented in fact by the BBC's Religious Affairs Correspondent, Mike Wooldridge. It is to examine the condition of six religions current in Britain - Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Sikhism. It rightly begins with Christism, as we should call it consistently, but hardly takes a general view by setting off in Belfast. Here churchgoing is commoner than on the mainland of Britain, but even so, the numbers are going down. One citizen interviewed on mixed marriage said 'I don't see any difference.' A student complained that the church lacked spontaneity and fun. In the Bristol area (where one adult in ten goes to church, and one child in seven) we dealt largely with charity - 'consumer Christianity' as someone called it. It covered a broad ground, from the Jesus Bus that distributes coffee; the Bristol Group, who sing and speak in tongues; the black Bethel United, 'people like anybody else'. There was little talk about doctrine, even in Belfast. It will be interesting to learn if such differentiations exist within the other five religions to be dealt with. The use of belief to serve ones ends was shown last Saturday in A Matter of Conscience, about conscientious objection to involvement in war. Most wartime COs were content to accept their alternative employment (though some farmers complained that they were idle). One who disapproved of war on principle said he would gladly struggle for something he did believe in, but most objectors pleaded the 'categorical imperative', thou shalt not kill. They should go back to their Exodus: this imperative is at Chapter 20, verse 13, yet at Chapter 33, verse 27, the Lord ordered 'Go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, his companion, his neighbour.' Three thousand were slain. One hopes that worshipping a golden idol was something they did believe in. Unsophisticated minds can believe in anything. The first of John McKay's talks on Radio 4 on Sunday evenings, Aesthete's Foot, dealt with the Kirk as misunderstood after a childhood reading of 'The Reverend's Manual' where principles were given to help the Reverend to become as boring as expected ('always visit widows'; 'always patronise children'; 'always have heating problems in the church hall'). McKay, who also reckons the coloured pictures in his Bible were not for preaching but for interior decoration, is not unsophisticated at all, but apt at detecting the state. Tomorrow he deals with sex, the following week with Satanism. Playwright Bill Naughton, who died in January, began as a radio writer, so Radio 3's commemoration this week used his radio plays. Probably few people who think of Alfie as a film know that it began in 1962 as an hour-long radio piece, Alfie Elkins and His Little Life, and this is what we had on Sunday. Bill Owen in the lead was fine, but it isn't much of a play. A series of incidents in the life of a randy, dishonest working man moves easily from seduction to seduction, with an interval for TB, ending with a prospect of poverty that hardly adds any new quality to the generally one-dimensional character. On Tuesday we had a Naughton from 10 years later, The Mystery, also a radio piece. Indeed Edward, the hero (Norman Rodway), keeps advising us to stop listening and go out into the fresh air. Edward has been told by his wife to take the cat and the dog to the vet to be neutered. En route, he has a brief cuddle with his daily, and the vet and he agree that they wouldn't like to be neutered. So both pets return home whole. The mystery is the true nature of love.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Letter: Setting pay of directors Sir, Shareholders and their representatives should consider using the Cadbury recommendation that compensation committees commission independent research when considering executives' remuneration. None of Cadbury's critics disagrees with this suggestion and questioning the independence of such studies can help prevent the spread of upper quartile syndrome, where comparisons are made only with high paying groups and then a figure near the top of the pile is presented as objective. Peter M Brown, chairman, Top Pay Research Group, Upper Ground Floor, 9 Savoy Street, London WC2</p>

Diurnal emission levels shall be adjusted to reflect corresponding results for a nominal 20 gallon fuel tank volume. This demonstration may be based on a diurnal temperature excursion of 65 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F to 105 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F and California certification fuel rather than the EPA conditions and test fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Test procedures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The exhaust emission standards set forth in paragraph (c) of this section refer to the exhaust emissions collected under the conditions and measured in accordance with the procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 86, subpart N, except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section. Assembly line testing procedures are those set forth in 40 CFR part 86, subpart K, except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The evaporative standards set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section refer to the evaporative emissions collected under the conditions and measured in accordance with the procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 86, subpart M, except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Test fuels.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All certification, assembly line, and recall testing performed on vehicles and engines covered under this section shall use the fuels provided for by California as found in the California regulations. Testing performed to demonstrate compliance with the inherently low evaporative emission requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section may, as an alternative, be conducted with fuels meeting the federal specifications of 40 CFR part 86. Assembly line and recall testing shall use the same type of fuel as used in certification testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Recall program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Engines certified to the standards set forth in this section shall be subject to the recall provisions described in this paragraph. For purposes of recall testing under this section, the term ``engine'' includes all emissions control systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The recall provisions for light-duty vehicles contained in &sect;52.2962(e) shall apply to engines subject to the provisions of this paragraph as well, with appropriate references to applicable standards and test procedures, except that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Engines shall be selected by EPA for purposes of recall testing from the vehicle population of the entire state rather than only from areas subject to enhanced inspection and maintenance testing; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The provisions of &sect;52.2965 shall also apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fleet averaging program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General applicability.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The requirements of this program apply to all heavy-duty vehicles of over 19,500 pounds GVWR that are registered in California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Effective January 1, 2000, any person who owns one or more heavy-duty vehicles of over 19,500 pounds GVWR that are registered in California shall submit the following information on each of these affected fleet vehicles to EPA by January 31st of every calendar year. The submittal shall reflect the owner's affected fleet as it existed on January 1st of the same calendar year. Owners may combine their affected vehicles with those of other vehicle owners for the purposes of this program. Required information per affected vehicle:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Vehicle license number;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Engine model year;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Engine identification number; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) GVWR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)(i) The results of the following Fleet Average Emissions (FAE) calculations contained in Tables 2966&hyph;1 and 2966&hyph;2 shall be submitted concurrently with the per vehicle information specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section; separate calculations shall be performed, and results submitted, for affected vehicles of GVWR between 19,501&hyph;33,000 pounds and for affected vehicles of over 33,000 pounds GVWR:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

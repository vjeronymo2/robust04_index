			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Technology: Catching up with bio reactions - An instrument which speeds up experiments A new instrument, which follows the progress of biological reactions as they happen, promises to transform procedures in biomedical research. Arnold Coffer, who runs the Imperial Cancer Research Fund's protein isolation and cloning laboratory in London, says Fisons' IAsys biosensor allows him 'to obtain within minutes information that would previously have required days of experiments with dozens of test tubes, using radioactive tracer reagents'. IAsys owes its existence to a Pounds 620,000 innovation grant from the Department of Trade and Industry, which partially funded its development during the late 1980s. The project involved two UK companies, Fisons and Plessey, with Cambridge University's Institute of Biotechnology as the academic partner. Fisons assumed full responsibility for commercialising the research in 1990, after Plessey's takeover by GEC, and set up a new biosensor company within its scientific instrument division. David Fortune, managing director of Fisons Applied Sensor Technology, sees the project as a classic example of the role government support for pre-competitive research can play in bringing an important new technology into existence. Plessey's Caswell research centre contributed its expertise in transducers and opto-electronics, the Cambridge group its knowledge of biological surfaces and Fisons its experience in instrumentation. 'The collaboration was essential because Fisons entered without any know-how in biosensors apart from some scientific dabbling in the mid 1970s,' Fortune says. 'We wouldn't have been prepared to go into such a speculative new area if the DTI had not paid half the costs of our working with Chris Lowe and his group at Cambridge.' Fortune believes Fisons has emerged with a world-beating technology which is potentially valuable to about 40,000 laboratories involved in medical, pharmaceutical and biological research. 'Many hundreds of labs are looking in detail at this technique,' he says. IAsys can be used to investigate interactions between almost any pair of biological molecules, including antibody-antigen, protein-protein and ligand-receptor binding. Pharmaceutical researchers seeking a molecule to fit into a particular receptor site on a cell can measure both the speed with which candidate drugs bind to the site and the strength of the resulting bond. Coffer's lab is using IAsys for several research projects. One example is the evaluation of new compounds which block the action of oestrogen hormones as treatments for breast cancer; the scientists make copies of the protein that serves as the oestrogen receptor in human cells and then see how strongly different candidate drugs bind to it. 'I don't think one machine will be sufficient here, now that word is getting around about what it can do,' Coffer says. 'Maybe two or three would satisfy the requirements of the ICRF.' The basis of IAsys is 'optical evanescent wave technology'. In brief, it uses light to follow the reaction between a pair of compounds. One is immobilised on the surface of the instrument's transparent cell, which is coated with dextran gel. A tiny drop of the second chemical is then added. Any reaction between the two compounds changes the optical properties of the dextran gel. The instrument detects this by shining a laser beam on to the surface and measuring the light reflected back. The only competition to the Pounds 50,000 IAsys is a more expensive optical biosensor developed by Pharmacia of Sweden, Fortune says. 'It is quite a heavily patented area and we do not anticipate any further competition for at least the next three years.' IAsys will not produce revenue quickly enough to rescue Fisons from its present financial troubles, but it is just the sort of development the company needs to return to long-term growth and prosperity.</p>

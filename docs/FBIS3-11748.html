He reported that the president met last night with  congressional party leaders, but the national defense issue was  not even mentioned.    President Franco never considered resorting to the  constitutional instrument of declaring a state of national  defense to solve the political crisis with Congress and the  Federal Supreme Court [STF]. This was stated by Presidential  Spokesman Fernando Costa, who added that reports indicating that  the state of defense decree is supposedly already lying on the  president's desk are false. The situation in the country is  entirely normal, he added.    The subject was not even mentioned during the meeting held  last night in Planalto Palace between President Franco and 13  party leaders.    The party leaders guaranteed President Franco that they  would  not attend the congressional session today to approve  Provisional Measure No. 434 on the conversion of salaries into  Real Value Units [URV's].    Last night President Franco ordered Fernando Costa to inform  the media that the government makes no agreements with the STF,  that the president of the Republic will not disrespect the law  and the Constitution, and that the day for converting public  employees' salaries into URV's is the 30th of each month, and  not 20th as the STF wants.</p>

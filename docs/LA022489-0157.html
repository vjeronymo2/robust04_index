			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEW;  </P> <P> SCR SHOW ON GROWTH PAINS PROVES A PLEASURE  </P> <P> Making choices and feeling self-worth are the themes of "When I Grow Up," an  inventive new musical from South Coast Repertory's 1989 Educational Touring  Production for older elementary school-age children and early teen-agers.  </P> <P> Usually given in schools, the show will be presented to the general public  Sunday at the Long Beach Jewish Community Center.  </P> <P> A character called Friend (Keith Devaney) stays on the sidelines and guides the  action of three sixth-grade loners who want to be accepted. Tina (Victoria  Hoffman), the worrier, is anxious about going into junior high. Hugo (Michael  Alvarez), a budding writer, is being pressured to join a gang. Melody (Martha  J. New) wants to be cool like the "in" kids.  </P> <P> Friend's advice -- to go along with anything, just to belong -- gets them in  trouble, and some of it is scary, particularly Tina's experimentation with  drugs. In the process, three lessons are learned, although Hugo's ability to  deal with the gang's threats when he decides not to join is somewhat cloudy.  </P> <P> Written by Jerry Patch, with music by Michael Silversher and directed by  John-David Keller, the show may be just a little too ambitious. The issues it  deals with are complex and can only be touched on superficially here.  </P> <P> And, although it is well acted, the adult actors lack the voices to deliver the  show's tuneful musical messages with sufficient impact.  </P> <P> The cast does put the humor over with style, however, and there's plenty of it,  from a demonstration of just what "cool" is to costume and set designer Dwight  Richard Odle's innovative way of extending the cast: Each actor "wears" two  friends of the inanimate, stuffed and sewn variety. The effect is startling and  worth more than one grin.  </P> <P> Throughout, Friend serves as devil's advocate, helping the on-stage kids go  wrong but also pulling the audience in by asking for advice and reactions. That  may be the show's biggest strength: how well it knows its target audience, and  how intimately it involves that audience.  </P> <P>  "When I Grow Up" will be presented Sunday at 1:30 p.m. at the Long Beach  Jewish Community Center, 3801 E. Willow St., Long Beach. Tickets: $3.  Information: (213) 426-7601.  </P> <P> </P></p>

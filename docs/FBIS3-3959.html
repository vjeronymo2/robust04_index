			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, March 23 (XINHUA) -- Tax revenues in  southern China's Guangdong Province have been going up this year  as its steady economic growth goes on and with the new taxation  system which became effective on January 1.    This was revealed by a recent provincial taxation  conference.    The province has benefited most from the country's  opening-up  policy and reforms since the early 1980s and it has enjoyed  increasing economic development as well as steady tax and  revenue growth.    Under the new taxation system, taxes are classified and  collected separately by the central and local governments,  ensuring that both have stable income sources, with the central  government gaining a larger share of increased incomes.    Last year, the province's total taxation revenue reached  36.3  billion yuan, the highest in the country. But its contribution  to the central government in 1993 amounted to less than six  percent of the province's revenues.    Under the new tax revenue-sharing system, 70 percent of  increased revenues collected by the provincial government are to  go to the central government. This means that the province's  contribution this year will be many times the 2 billion yuan  (230 million U.S. dollars) handed over the previous year.    But leaders at all levels of the province have worked hard  to  support the new taxation system in spite of the extra payments  to Beijing under the new system.    By this February, the province's total industrial output  value had jumped to 54.83 billion yuan, up 19.7 percent on the  same period last year, and retail sales to 259.2 billion yuan,  up 32.8 percent.    A total of 1.35 billion U.S. dollars of foreign investment  had also been used, an increase of 47 percent over the same  period the previous year.    The province's tax revenues steadily rose alongside these  increases. By March 10, this year, the province had collected  altogether 7.6 billion yuan in taxes from its industry and  commerce, an increase of 2.11 billion yuan (38.5 percent) over  the same period last year.    In contrast, the province's price hikes showed signs of  rising less fast: it stood at 18.3 percent in January, 4.1  percentage points lower than the previous month.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: UK housebuilding rise behind Marshalls growth Pre-tax profits of Marshalls, the West Yorkshire-based building materials group, jumped by 40 per cent from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 15.9m in the six months to September 30, assisted by a sharp rise in UK housebuilding. Increased investment in commercial and industrial construction as the UK economy improved also helped first-half sales, said Mr Andrew Marshall, chairman. About a quarter of group turnover, which rose by 22 per cent to Pounds 124.8m (Pounds 102.2m), is generated by the UK and US housing market, including sales for repair and maintenance. UK housebuilders, which started work on 12.5 per cent more homes during the first nine months of this year compared with the corresponding period in 1993, have been winning market share in a generally sluggish UK housing market. The increased activity has enabled building materials producers to raise prices for some products, particularly bricks, while increased sales volume has assisted margins. Marshalls' share price rose 6p to 146p yesterday on the profits announcement, which followed a 64 per cent increase at the pre-tax level in the previous 12 months. The interim dividend is increased from 1.25p to 1.5p. Earnings per share, fully diluted, rose from 4.72p to 6.5p. UK operating profits from stone and concrete products, mainly for paving and flooring, rose by 30 per cent to Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 9.78m). The division was helped by a 20 per cent rise in turnover, of which price increases accounted for only a small part. US losses for stone and concrete declined from Pounds 240,000 to Pounds 58,000 helped by 'useful sales' from the Florida-based Paver Systems. UK clay products profits more than doubled from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 3.42m helped by a sharp rise in brick prices and higher sales. Net debt at the end of September stood at Pounds 13.5m, equivalent to gearing of 10.4 per cent. COMMENT Marshalls' share price had out-performed the sector by 30 per cent prior to yesterday's results. It is a well run company, but will find it very hard to maintain recent growth rates. UK margins are already at the top end, although they could rise a little more, but further significant improvement may depend on increased sales volume - or perhaps an acquisition or two, given the strength of the balance sheet. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 30m would put the shares on a prospective p/e of more than 11.5, which is rich enough for the time being.</p>

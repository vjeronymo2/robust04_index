			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Lloyd's expands link with France LLOYD'S of London hopes to increase its share of the French commercial property insurance market following an agreement to make greater use of a computerised direct trading facility linking it with the Paris bourse, the French commercial insurance exchange, Cater Allen syndicate 190 developed the computer link-up, known as Linkline, in 1990 to increase the efficiency of its French underwriting operations. The syndicate heads a facility backed by 15 other syndicates expecting a turnover of FFr30m (Pounds 3.14m) this year. Yesterday's agreement entails other syndicates making more use of the facility, which in exceptional cases enables French risks to be underwritten in less than 24 hours. Twenty-five syndicates including 190 are expected to participate on the new facility, known as the BCR lineslip, which can accept a further FFr50m in premium income. Overall Lloyd's premium income from the French market was about Pounds 200m last year, of which Pounds 119m was in the form of reinsurance premiums. Mr John Worsfold, underwriter of syndicate 190, warned that French commercial risks were highly competitive and largely dominated by domestic French insurers.</p>

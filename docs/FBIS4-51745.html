			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- The Literature and Art  Press Group of Korea recently brought out a long novel  "Victory", a follow-up of the cycle of novels "Immortal History"  (postliberation part).    The novel gives an epical depiction of the leadership feats,  outstanding commandership and noble virtues of the respected  leader President Kim Il-song who humbled the arrogant U.S.  imperialists who boasted of being the "strongest" in the world  and reduced them to the lot of the setting sun by leading the  fatherland liberation war, a war of justice for the Korean  people, to a shining victory. It also tells about the  indomitable fighting spirit of the Korean people and Army.    The novel consisting of three parts covers the period from  August 1952, when the war was going on at the last stage, to  July 1953, till the brilliant victory of the war.    The first part deals with mid-1952 when armistice talks were  under way at Panmunjom and the Korean war seemed to come to an  end through the talks. It gives an emotional representation of  the matchless grit, indomitable will and rare military  intelligence of President Kim Il-song who inflicted an  ignominous defeat, with telling blows, on the U.S. imperialists  who were running amuck indiscreetly, not knowing what the Korean  people were like.    The second part portrays in various aspects the traits of  President Kim Il-song who smashed at one stroke Eisenhower's  "new offensive" with chuche-based war methods and unique and  superb tactics and opened up a decisive phase for victory in the  war.    The third part vividly shows the wise leadership of  President  Kim Il-song, an ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander  and great military strategist, in totally crushing the  last-ditch efforts of U.S. imperialist warlikers who dropped  germ bombs to cut off the supply route to the front and  threatened to use A-bombs, while engaging in massive bombings  everyday behind the scene of the ceasefire talks. It also gives  a truthful picture of the heroic battles of the brave People's  Army soldiers on the hill 351 who remained loyal to the party  and the leader, the country and the people.    The novel lastly gives scenes of the U.S. imperialists  signing the Armistice Agreement at Panmunjom in recognition of  their defeat and of a grand military parade held in Pyongyang in  celebration of the victory in the war.</p>

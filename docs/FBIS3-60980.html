			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed J.F.D.: "Arms Arsenal Found in Brussels"] </F>   [Text] A weapons arsenal, inlcuding various rocket  launchers, grenades, rifles, and explosives was discovered on  Monday [3 January] by the BSR [Special Investigation Brigade] in  a Brussels garage. The seizure was the result of a long  investigation of acquaintances of Murat Kaplan, a major Belgian  criminal, who is now behind bars and who, as is well-known,  escaped from Saint-Gilles prison on 3 May 1993. He fled with  the help of two accomplices: Patrick Haemers [Belgian criminal],  who was recaptured first, and Basri Bajrami, who is still on the  run. Murat Kaplan was recaptured in Zellik on 15 May.    The discovery of this arsenal, which was made possible  because of the close surveillance of Kaplan's girlfriend,  clearly shows that the 31-year-old Kaplan, who is of Albanian  origin, heads a well-organized gang. Did his "friends" hope to  use the arms in support of Kaplan's umpteenth escape from  prison? Kaplan is nicknamed the "prince of escapes."    Kaplan is no longer the gentleman burglar, which he had been  for some time. He is one of Belgium's most notorious criminals.  The arms discovered supposedly were used during an attack on  the Laeken police station, as a reprisal for the the arrest of  Philippe Lacroix. At the time of the attack, Kaplan had not  been captured.</p>

Lomonosov; UDC 541.183]    [Abstract] The effectiveness of three porous polymer  adsorbents, i.e., Polysorb-1, Tepasorb-15, and Tenax-GC, as  absorbers of n-alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, esters,  ketones, and n-alcohols was assessed by gas chromatography on a  Tsvet-106 chromatograph with a flame-ionization detector. For  each adsorbate in that temperature interval in which the  adsorbent peaks were symmetrical and in which the retention time  was virtually independent of the sample size (i.e., in the Henry  interval), researchers calculated the specific volumes retained  (V[.sub]m,1[/]) by each of the three adsorbents. From the  dependence lg V[.sub]m,1[/] on 1/T, the researchers then  calculated the adsorbents' differential heat of adsorption  during the adsorption of zero samples, standard molar changes in  the entropy of the adsorbate, and the extrapolated values of  V[.sub]m,1[/] at 20C. From the dependence of the  differential adsorption heat during the adsorption of zero  samples they determined the contributions of the magnitudes of  the energy of the specific interaction to the total heat of  adsorption. The dependence of lg V[.sub]m,1[/] on 1/T turned  out to be linear for all three polymer adsorbents studied. The  values of the heats of adsorption of aromatic hydrocarbons for  the three adsorbents were lower than those for n-hydrocarbons  with the same number of carbon atoms in the molecule, whereas  the retained volumes were higher for aromatic hydrocarbons than  for n-alkanes throughout all the temperatures studied. This was  taken as an indication of the fact that in the case of aromatic  hydrocarbons, dissolution processes may also be at work in  addition to adsorption processes. The dependences of the  differential heat of adsorption during the adsorption of zero  samples on the number of hydrocarbon atoms in the molecule for  different homologous series on all three polymers were linear.  The adsorption heats found for ketones, ethers, and n-alcohols  were different for the different adsorbents. This fact was  attributed to the adsorbents' ability to manifest specific  reactions with the said adsorbates in addition to dispersion  interactions. Polysorb-1 and Tepasorb-15 were found to be  virtually inert with respect to ethers; however, they engaged in  additional specific reactions with alcohols and ketones on  account of the -electrons of the benzene rings on their  surfaces. The highest values of V[.sub]m,1[/] extrapolated  for 20C were obtained for Polysorb-1, and the lowest were  obtained for Tepasorb-15. Both in the present study and  elsewhere, the properties of Tenax-GC have been found to remain  quite stable from batch to batch. The properties of Polysorb-1,  on the other hand, were found to be quite unstable and to vary  from batch to batch. Figures 2, tables 7; references 18: 6  Russian, 12 Western.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Deception causes Sumitomo loss SUMITOMO Finance International, the London-based arm of the Sumitomo Bank, suffered losses of Dollars 2m to Dollars 3m on its interest rate options book last autumn after an employee concealed his true trading position from senior management. The losses were linked to the partial breakdown of the European exchange rate mechanism, which overturned the assumptions about volatility and market correlation on which options prices are based, making the market extremely difficult to trade. A number of houses suffered losses. But at Sumitomo Finance, the manager of the interest rate options desk falsified prices in order to foil the management's control procedures. Unchecked, the losses mushroomed. The full affair came to light yesterday, when the Securities and Futures Authority, the UK regulator, expelled Mr Zahid Mannan, the manager in question, from its registers. This in effect bars him for life from the business in the UK. There was no suggestion that Mr Mannan was seeking to profit personally. Mr Mannan was also fined Pounds 10,000 and ordered to make a contribution of Pounds 4,000 towards the SFA's investigation costs. As manager of the interest rate options desk Mr Mannan had to record the value of his positions in management reports submitted to his chief executive. He gave falsely inflated values in order to hide his true position. Mr Mannan then persuaded an employee with another firm, which he knew was used by Sumitomo's accounts department to check those valuations, to quote inflated prices that corresponded with those in his own internal management reports. This arrangement was brought to light while Mr Mannan was on holiday and the subsequent investigation showed that his actions had resulted in Sumitomo's qualifying capital being overstated in the preceding months, the SFA said. The amount of capital held by firms is adjusted according to their exposure. Sumitomo Finance declined to comment. Among a number of serious 'hits' as a result of options trading is Allied-Lyons, the UK food and drinks group, which lost Pounds 150m in 1991 on foreign exchange positions taken without the knowledge of senior management. The Sumitomo losses, while much less severe, underline the problems involved in managing the risk generated by derivatives business.</p>

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru aims to attract investment to its oil industry with new laws THREE laws governing development of Peru's oil resources were passed in congress last Friday by a substantial majority. According to Mr Demetrio Patsias, former vice-minister of mines and energy, and now a congressman for the ruling alliance, the laws will give the Peruvian oil industry the boost it badly needs. The legislation is aimed at making Peru as attractive to investors as Colombia or Argentina. Mr Patsias said that in the past two years only eight wells had been drilled in Peru, compared with 100 in Argentina and 50 in Colombia. The recovery of oil reserves was a top priority, he said - levels have more than halved from about 835m barrels in 1981. Some earlier legal limitations will be now lifted, investors will be free to dispose of the oil they extract in any way they wish, and exports will be free of tax. In addition, longstanding restrictions that prevented foreign oil companies from exploring within 30 miles of Peru's frontiers have also been eliminated. A new state organ, Perupetro, is also created. It is charged with the promotion of investment in oil exploration and development, and will replace state-owned Petroperu in the negotiation of contracts with investors. It will also take over administration of taxes and royalties. It is assumed the new legislation will also clear the way for Petroperu's privatisation. A technical evaluation of the state-owned oil giant has already been carried out by Booz-Allen and Hamilton of New York, but the controversial recommendations - which include splitting the company into up to 40 operating units - have not yet been officially accepted.</p>

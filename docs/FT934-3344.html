			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Arts: Today's Television Today's programme in BBC2's admirable series Human Rights, Human Wrongs is presented by American playwright Arthur Miller. He declares that freedom of information is the touchstone of all the freedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but points out that imprisonment is now being replaced by violence, 'censorship by the bullet', as the favoured means used by repressive governments to silence writers and reporters (8.20). Episode 1 of ITV's series Hollywood Women, which looked from the hype as though it was going to be just a good excuse for eyeing lots of gorgeous bodies, turned out to be both better and worse than that. Worse in that it was edited into insultingly brief soundbites, better in that it had a perfectly serious point to make about plastic surgery and the obsession with eternal youth. Today's programme (9.00) is about women and the casting couch. Channel 4's documentary series The Plague looks at the formation of Aids pressure groups and the reactions of government bodies (9.00).</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Lecturers warned against action FURTHER EDUCATION college employers yesterday threatened to remove lecturers from the payroll if they refused to mark college registers. The move is an escalation of the dispute between the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education and the College Employers Forum over the negotiation of new contracts following the transfer of the colleges from local education authority to government control last month. Natfhe staged a national strike yesterday in protest at proposed new contracts, and claimed to have closed most of the colleges in Wales and northern England. It has requested its members to continue action by refusing to mark registers. But Mr Roger Ward, the forum's chief negotiator, said lecturers who did not mark registers would be removed from the payroll. He said that about one third of the 360 college principals involved had already sent letters to staff containing the threat, while the rest would follow within a week. He said: 'This is the regrettable and inevitable result of Natfhe's strong-arm tactics. We look forward to the dropping of industrial action and returning to the bargaining table.' Mr Ward said refusing to mark registers was a 'serious breach of contract' and could leave employers liable under fire and safety regulations. Meanwhile, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, yesterday published draft charters for further and higher education. The charters are meant to raise standards in colleges and universities as part of the Citizens' Charter initiative and mostly concern availability of information for both students and employers. They also require technical alterations to the university admissions system and independent inspections for further education colleges. Principals, lecturers' unions and the National Union of Students generally welcomed the documents. However, Professor Ray Cowell, vice-chancellor of Nottingham Trent University, criticised the omission of partnerships with industry from the charter and described its views on students as 'naive and dated'. University leaders yesterday called for at least Pounds 3.2bn to repair buildings and expand for the future. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said Pounds 1.35bn was needed to clear a 10-year backlog of building maintenance work.</p>

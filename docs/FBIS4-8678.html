			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw </F> Kaczmarek by Krzysztof Golata; place and date not given:  "Capitalists Without Capital"]    [Excerpt] [Golata] Do you have allies supporting the  privatization process now that Minister Borowski has resigned?    [Kaczmarek] Many persons want to implement privatization on  their own. I believe that we must declare war on the belief in  the healing power of branch holdings which are supposed to cure  all Polish ailments. Many countries are currently abandoning  such organizational structures in favor of  manufacturing-commercial consortia, which minimize the risk of  the economic activity that is being pursued.    [Golata] The industry minister suggests that you share the  responsibility for the effects of privatization. Does this  issue concern only responsibility?    [Kaczmarek] The crux of the dispute lies in the following: I  believe that a separate law should be drafted which would define  the rules of commercialization of state-run enterprises -- I do  not think that they should be defined in the privatization law  which is being amended right now. I do not think that we should  start the discussion with the question of who decides the  composition of the supervisory boards. First the relations  between the Treasury and the method of managing the public  wealth must be defined, and only then should we speak about the  tools -- privatization and commercialization. We must humbly  accept that the era of bureaucratic steering of enterprises is  coming to an end; beginning is the time of constructing systems  that regulate the functioning of the economy. In other words,  the point is to specify the rules of the game within the various  sectors. This is what the branch ministries should deal with,  not with the fight for bureaucracy's power in the economy. The  problem of the structure of ownership is of secondary importance.    [Golata] Deputy Bogdan Pek criticizes all your decisions;  Ryszard Bugaj queries the number of enterprises selected for  participation in the Mass Privatization Program [PPP]. The  atmosphere over privatization is not very favorable to you.    [Kaczmarek] I think that Deputy Pek has already stopped  criticizing me. The querying of my activities results from the  fact that at the beginning of my activity I was not able to win  the trust of the chairman of the Sejm committee. The  differences of opinions on privatization were primarily a result  of the different levels of knowledge on ownership  transformations, in which I have been taking part for quite some  time now. Nevertheless, I think that emotions have died down  and a cease fire has gone into effect. Now, the criticism of  Deputy Bugaj is of a definitely statistical, not substantive  nature. I would expect a polemic concerning the changes brought  about in the economy by the process of mass privatization. In my  opinion, the fewer election campaigns, the better the atmosphere  over privatization. It has always been so that in ownership  transformations political capital was made. Now we should start  making capital without this adjective.    [Golata] Do you not get the impression that we are now in a  waiting period? Employees are waiting for free shares, and  enterprises are waiting for a magic law that would improve their  financial condition...    [Kaczmarek] I have come across such opinions. In the  ministry no one is waiting for anything and the privatization  program is being implemented. In two-thirds of all the  transformations, decisions are made in voivodships. The PPP is  in a phase in which it is difficult to expect any spectacular  successes. I believe that people's expectations concerning the  distribution of free shares have been aroused too much.  Therefore, I am not surprised that enterprises and employees  are waiting for a new privatization law. We are not going to  force anyone to take part in mass privatization, even though we  are often attacked for using procedures that are said to be too  democratic.    [Golata] It should be expected that at least 15 percent of  the free shares of the privatized enterprises will bring about  the opposition of all those who will not be able to enjoy this  privilege.    [Kaczmarek] I have already been asked such a question: On  the basis of what norms do I want to divide Poles into two  categories -- those who work in privatized companies and those  outside them? I must admit that the pact on enterprise,  negotiated by the trade unions, does not include any offer for  the employees of the budget sphere, the people of free  professions, senior citizens, disabled pensioners, and the  employees of companies which will not be privatized. I think  that a dispute over who should be given the shares and who  should not does not make any sense. Privatization must be a  result of a well-considered economic decision.    [Golata] Giving away shares does not have much to do with  economics.    [Kaczmarek] Some have said not just "a" but also "b" by  promising 100 million zlotys first, and then 300 million. In a  country whose society does not have very extensive capital  resources, such slogans arouse emotions and hopes. One cannot  go totally "upstream" -- one must give satisfaction also to  those who are not working in enterprises being privatized.    [Golata] They still have the popular privatization and the  National Investment Funds [NFI].    [Kaczmarek] These assure participation in the privatization  process to all those who are willing to try it, and they are  also a form of the state fulfilling its obligations vis-a-vis  some social groups.    [Golata] A post on an NFI supervisory board must be  profitable since a few thousand people have submitted their  applications for the position.    [Kaczmarek] I am not sure whether these posts will be so  profitable. Out of 6,800 candidates, about 100 will remain. I  would like the supervisory boards to include persons with  experience in the area of so-called financial engineering, as  well as persons skilled in strategic planning. I know for a  fact that Poland does not have too many such experts. I am  first of all eager to have economic practitioners who are  capable of showing a record of success.    [Golata] The privatization program for 1994 provides that  12.3 trillion zlotys will go into the budget as profit from  sales of enterprises. So that means we continue to regard  ownership transformations as a source of providing additional  resources to the state budget?    [Kaczmarek] That is unavoidable. We must keep in mind that  every transaction means not just an inflow into the budget of a  sum equal to the price of the sale -- let us not forget taxes  and customs duties which result from increases in the turnover  of companies subjected to privatization.    [Golata] Looking at privatization from the budget's  standpoint often leads to accusations about insufficient prices  of companies being sold.    [Kaczmarek] I would like everyone who makes such  accusations, to be able to listen to negotiations with the given  strategic investor. On the other hand, I doubt whether we will  manage to work out clear criteria for evaluating the ownership  transformations minister's activities.    [Golata] Just one unsuccessful privatization -- for instance  that of Bank Slaski -- may annul 100 ownership transformations  beneficial to the economy.    [Kaczmarek] The lucky part about the whole misfortune of the  Bank Slaski case, was that the bank was privatized by the  Finance Ministry. But it was my ministry that was burdened with  the entire odium. Unfortunately, big social expectations  regarding privatization are accompanied by a small tolerance for  mistakes that are made. Of course, you can always say one  should have predicted a number of situations. But on the other  hand, compare the first and the most recent agreements on  capital privatization. There is a huge difference,  qualitatively speaking.    [Golata] An accusation is often levied that the ministry  sells such companies to foreign capital, which should remain in  Polish hands. This accusation applies for instance to the  tobacco industry.    [Kaczmarek] The dispute surrounding the tobacco industry is  more ambition-driven than it is about substance. I am not  completely convinced as to whose interests the persons defending  the status quo represent -- is it the interests of state-owned  companies, or else of foreign companies which have obtained a  license to build new factories? In a situation where 22 percent  of the cigarettes come from abroad, it is the importers that  gain the biggest advantage from the dispute. I will strive to  have the tobacco industry privatized.    Every strategic investor, before he receives his portfolio  of  the majority of shares, will have to present an investment  program and also the fundamentals of his policies vis-a-vis the  growers. We must be taking care of the state's monopoly in  Treasury issues, but we will not be striving at a monopoly of  state property. We are no match for the competition.    [Golata] Does the need to maintain a national character also  apply to other branches?    [Kaczmarek] In an increasing number of cases, the argument  is also raised in talks regarding the oil branch's  privatization. Unfortunately, a concept for having the branch  privatized is still missing while time flies very fast.  Poland's entry into Europe means we will be flooded with  products made by Western refineries. Not a lot is happening  regarding the privatization of the telecommunications industry.  That is strange, when you take into account how highly  profitable the sector is.    [Golata] It seems that you will be successful in meeting one  goal -- by the end of the year, the number of companies  registered on the stock market will double.    [Kaczmarek] That is not my contribution but just a case of a  correct forecast. What happened at the stock market in March,  must cause concern. But it could be that the Polish stock  market is becoming normal. The fact that private companies are  interested in joining the stock market, is cause for optimism.  The prevalence of petty investors who respond nervously to  changes in the economic situation, is a weakness of the Polish  capital market. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WOULD YOU BELIEVE THE SANTA CLARA GIANTS?  </P> <P> They don't call them the Anaheim Angels.  </P> <P> They don't call them the Arlington Rangers.  </P> <P> The NBA champions aren't known as the Auburn Hills Pistons.  </P> <P> In the NFL, they're not the Foxboro Patriots, the Irving Cowboys, the Pontiac  Lions or the East Rutherford Giants.  </P> <P> Why, then, must they be called the Santa Clara Giants?  </P> <P> From a provincial standpoint, it's understandable why the folks in the Santa  Clara Valley want their name on the major-league sports map. Surely, there's  more to life than cultivating prunes, peaches and computer chips.  </P> <P> But Santa Clara Giants? It has a minor-league ring to it. Can you imagine the  snickering when the National League West standings list Santa Clara with Los  Angeles, Atlanta and Cincinnati?  </P> <P> Granted, Giants owner Bob Lurie has consented to the name change. Spurned by  San Francisco, he simply will take his toy down the street and change its name.  That surely will shake up the boys in the financial district.  </P> <P> What did anyone expect Lurie to do? He has no choice, other than selling to  owners who would move the Giants much farther away than Santa Clara. If he  wants to keep the team in his beloved Bay Area, he would agree to call them  anything -- perhaps even the Milpitas Giants or the Saratoga Giants.  </P> <P> But it's a ridiculous idea. This is a regional baseball team, and it deserves  better than to be named after a suburb.  </P> <P> If a change must be made -- and that's a reasonable assumption given the fact  that San Francisco doesn't care that much about its baseball team -- why not at  least give it a regional identity? Something like Bay Area Giants or Redwood  Giants isn't ideal, but it makes more sense.  </P> <P> Santa Clara Councilwoman Sue Lasher, who spearheaded the Santa Clara Giants  movement by insisting on a name change, has noble intentions. But how would her  voters feel if such a stubborn stance cost them an opportunity for a  major-league team?  </P> <P> Anyone who isn't emotional about the issue might realize that it's far more  important to acquire a team of such stature than to be petty and concerned  about what it is called.  </P> <P> THE RIPPER REBOUNDS -- The San Diego Padres were 1-11 in new manager Greg  Riddoch's first 12 games before entering the weekend with a 9-3 record in their  next 12. Much of the credit for the turnaround goes to Jack Clark.  </P> <P> He was batting .358 with nine homers and 19 RBI in his last 24 games through  Friday, a hot streak that has led him to announce his intention of remaining  with the Padres despite the likelihood of being granted free agency because of  the recent collusion ruling.  </P> <P> "I'm glad there are people in this organization who are patient," Clark said.  "My priority is to stay here. I would like to be a part of this team next  year."  </P> <P> Clark, who is in the final year of a $2 million contract, once again is forming  a solid one-two punch with newcomer Joe Carter, who had seven RBI in his last  four games through Friday. Over a longer haul, Carter has 15 RBI in 13 games  after producing only four in his previous 21 games.  </P> <P> Craig Lefferts also has contributed, bouncing back from a mid-season slump to  register 11 1/3 scoreless innings. He also has 15 saves and has allowed only  four of 30 inherited runners to score.  </P> <P> STREAKING SABO -- While many observers expect Eric Davis to carry the  West-leading Cincinnati Reds down the stretch, third baseman Chris Sabo  continues to be the club's surprising offensive standout.  </P> <P> Sabo homered for the fourth consecutive game Friday night, one away from Johnny  Bench's club record, set in 1972. Sabo is among the league leaders with 27  doubles and has a career-high 21 homers. He leads the Reds with 54 RBI.  </P> <P> Sabo seems a cinch to erase the record for home runs by a Cincinnati third  baseman. Tony Perez, later a first baseman, hit 25 home runs as the Reds' third  baseman in 1971.  </P> <P> The Reds entered play Saturday 11-14 since the All-Star break, losing 3 1/2  games off their lead. A recent 2-10 slump has given new life to the Giants and  the Los Angeles Dodgers.  </P> <P> Davis has been the most notable culprit, going hitless in five of six games.  Most of the other regulars have been hitting, however, making the Reds' lack of  run production even more mysterious.  </P> <P> NO-HITTER INEQUITIES -- When Scott Garrelts of the Giants and Doug Drabek of  the Pittsburgh Pirates lost no-hitters with one out to go in the ninth inning  Friday, it brought the major-league season totals to seven no-hitters and eight  one-hitters.  </P> <P> It also brought to mind that no-hitters shouldn't be awarded unless a pitcher  goes at least nine innings, or eight if accomplished by a losing team on the  road, as was the case with Andy Hawkins of the New York Yankees last month.  </P> <P> It seems unfair that pitchers receive credit for a no-hitter when a game is  shortened by rain, as the Chicago White Sox's Melido Perez did this season.  Many no-hitters are lost in the eighth and ninth innings. Why should those  pitchers be penalized while others profit from inclement weather?  </P> <P> AROUND THE HORN -- Kevin Mitchell has a new hobby. He enjoys watching his new 3  1/2-inch pet boa devour mice. "I dropped a mouse into the fish tank the other  night, and a second later, it was gone," Mitchell said. "Man, those boas are  strong." ... With the Philadelphia Phillies and the Atlanta Braves out of their  division races, the impact of the Dale Murphy trade Friday night was  diminished. "Why block a deal between the Braves and the Phillies?" Giants  general manager Al Rosen asked. One would think Murphy might have gone to a  contender for the stretch drive. It's a strange deal to figure, and with Von  Hayes probably shifting back to first base, Ricky Jordan's future in  Philadelphia appears shaky. ... The Padres are 17-29 since Jeff Brantley broke  Benito Santiago's forearm with a pitch June 14. ... Santiago began his  rehabilitation at Triple-A Las Vegas last week and is expected back next week.  </P> <P> Calvin Schiraldi wants to be a starter for San Diego, and he is proving it by  enabling the last 16 runners he has inherited to score. ... Ryne Sandberg  entered the All-Star break with a .335 average, 24 homers and 57 RBI. Since  then he is barely above .200 with one homer and six RBI.  </P></p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Losses grow for Lloyd's Names NAMES ON two Lloyd's syndicates face significantly worse 1989 losses than previously feared. Spratt &amp; White syndicate 475 and Evennett syndicate 1035, both specialising in catastrophe reinsurance business, have reported a signifi-cant deterioration in their results as claims from hurricane Hugo and other heavy losses continue to mount. Syndicate 475, now part of the Knightstone Group, has suffered worst, with losses for 956 Names - the individuals whose capital supports the market - likely to exceed Pounds 125m, more than 500 per cent of the syndicate's capacity. Capacity is the amount of premium a syndicate is permitted to underwrite. On Evennett syndicate 1035, 1,149 Names face losses equal to 150 per cent of its capacity of Pounds 21.9m, or about Pounds 30m. The accounts of both syndicates were left open last year - when Lloyd's declared overall losses of Pounds 2.06bn - because of uncertainty about the level of future claims.</p>

With the Japanese-U.S. summit meeting on 11 February  nearing, prospects for the Japanese-U.S. economic framework  talks coming to a successful conclusion look extremely bad  indeed. While talks on individual sectors are experiencing  rough sailing, there is no telling when the economic stimulus  package, which was supposed to have been Japan's trump card,  will come into being. The vice- ministerial-level meeting to  resume in Washington on 7 February is likely to be held in a  gloomy mood.    The negotiations on individual sectors are progressing,  albeit slowly. In talks in the area of government procurement  (for telecommunications and medical equipment), an agreement is  nearing as a result of Japan's concession on 5 February in  agreeing to lower the amount of procurement to be subject to  open bidding to 100,000 SDR's (IMF-set special drawing rights;  equivalent to about 19 million yen).    But in the telecommunications market sector, a sharp  confrontation persists between the two countries. While the  United States demands that the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone  Corporation (NTT) be included among organizations to be subject  to open bidding for government procurement, Japan insists that  "NTT is a private enterprise. The U.S. demand is absurd, and it  does not conform to the GATT's rules, either." As far as  procurement by NTT is concerned, Japan wants to satisfy the U.S.  complaints only within the framework of the existing agreement.    In the area of insurance, holding a "two-way dialogue" was  agreed on at the vice-ministerial-level talks in January. This  means the two countries have agreed that the economic talks  should address not only the problems of Japan and the question  of how they should be resolved, but also the problems of the  United States. In the United States, procedures for issuing  permits for the insurance business differ by state, and this  makes foreign companies' entry into that nation's market  difficult. The two-way dialogue is expected to contribute to  liberalizing the U.S. market.    With respect to the talks on automobiles and auto parts,  Japan has also proposed easing rules on issuing permits which  come under the jurisdiction of the Transportation Ministry. The  United States, which has continued criticizing the current  system as "a nontariff barrier to the export of finished  automobiles," considers this a welcome proposal.    However, because of the scrapping of the plan for a 6  trillion yen tax cut, the economic framework conference itself  has become shaky. The most important purpose of the talks is to  redress Japan's huge current accounts imbalance. Consequently,  however difficult the talks on individual sectors might be, "the  real key to the success of the talks lies in whether domestic  demand could be expanded by coming up with a big economic  stimulus package," (according to the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs).    The United States' "basis of evaluation" of the economic  stimulus package is a "minimum of 5 trillion yen," a senior  official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  said. That being the case, the proposed economic package in the  neighborhood of 15 trillion yen including tax cuts of 6 trillion  yen would have been satisfactory to the United States from its  position of wanting Japan to reduce its surplus by expanding  domestic demand.    But the plan for tax cuts has been scrapped. As long as no  action is be taken on the tax cuts and the budget, even if Japan  pledges large-scale economic measures, this certainly would not  be so persuasive to the United States. Besides, President  Clinton's support for Prime Minister Hosokawa, who is for  change, is very warm. As such, the government initially thought  that "they wouldn't do anything to kick him off of a cliff" (to  quote a government source), but the government is now concerned  lest the president's evaluation of the prime minister should  change as a result of this uproar over the tax plan and the  subsequent scrapping of the plan.    Meanwhile, the numerical targets that the United States set  out as objective criteria for measuring the openness of the  Japanese market have become the biggest factor in making  progress in the individual-sector talks difficult to attain.    In the negotiations on the government procurement of  telecommunications equipment, the United States insisted,  "Foreign products' share of the Japanese market is less than 5  percent; over the next several years, it should be raised to  about 20 percent, which is the level found in other  industrialized nations." The United States wants Japan also to  promise to "buy foreign products at levels comparable to those  found in other industrialized nations" in the talks on  insurance, automobiles and auto parts, and other sectors, which  would be tantamount to presenting numerical targets in the form  of market shares.    Japan then rejected this, insisting that doing such a thing  is equivalent to practicing managed trade, and saying that "we  can never agree to setting future targets" (to quote a  government official).    Subsequently, the United States proposed using different  expressions like "indicators" and "trends" to describe the  "objective criteria." When U.S. officials thought they could  not get their way by pushing for increased market shares, they  switched to demanding assurances of "certain continuous rates of  increase."    But Japan rejected the demand very completely, saying,  "those  are nothing more than numerical targets worded differently."  Japan's position is that "the best it can agree to is to say  that it will make efforts to increase the procurement of foreign  products." But within the United States, there are strong  sentiments like that of envoy Mickey Kantor which charge that  "not one of the Japanese-U.S. agreements concluded in the past  has been effective" and that that country is perplexed by the  strong resistance being put up by Japan.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Security Minister Igor Giorgadze by Davit </F> Gvelesiani; place and date not given: "Give Me a Foothold  and...."]    [Text] Life today is so bad for the republic's  population that nobody remembers if life has ever been good.  They "console themselves" with the thought that the refugees  and those people made homeless are in a worse position than  themselves. A person could overcome the economic difficulties  if it were not for the pillage and robbery, murders, terrorist  acts, and so forth. One gets the impression that  apparently nobody is any longer capable of establishing the  peace and order that people long for. However, the republic's  Security Minister Igor Giorgadze does not share this pessimistic  view.    [Gvelesiani] Batono [Georgian polite form of address]  minister, you were in western Georgia for almost one month.  What was the purpose of such a long trip?    [Giorgadze] In accordance with the instructions from the  head of state, I was entrusted with forming a brigade and going  to western Georgia in order to familiarize myself with current  processes there and implement effective measures aimed at  discharging the extremely serious crime situation.    From 20 February until 14 March, we were in Poti together  with the operational brigade, which was carrying out extremely  complex and labor-intensive work. Accompanying me were special  units from the Ministry of Security that were conducting  operations aimed at exposing and seeking reconciliation with  armed groups. These were not punitive operations. We held  talks with leaders of armed groups that fought on the side of  the ex-president and that, until now, have been hiding in the  forests. It is superfluous to speak about a general  reconciliation since all those who have been robbing and  intimidating the peaceful population have committed criminal  offenses and therefore have to be brought to account before the  law. The fact that there no longer exists the fear of the  revival of "Zviadism" in its armed form can be viewed as the  biggest achievement. We can confidently say today that the fear  of a new civil war in western Georgia has been eliminated. I  believe this is due to the work of employees of the Ministry of  Security and others.    For 24 days we held talks with three armed groups. It is  true that we were unable to achieve reconciliation with all of  the 160 persons united in these groups. However, the talks are  continuing and they require prudence, patience, and time.  Certain members of the law enforcement bodies have themselves  complicated our work; it has turned out that they have been  demanding fairly large sums for "reconciliation" from those  people who have been coming out of the forests with their  submachine guns. In addition to weapons that have been  surrendered voluntarily, we have managed to confiscate a large  quantity of firearms. We have retrieved stolen trucks and  equipment. However, this is the material side of the trip,  which I consider to be less important. The main thing is that  people have declared their trust in our department, and this has  the greatest social and political importance.    [Gvelesiani] The incident that occurred between the heads of  the two power ministries alarmed the entire republic [bomb blast  at the Ministry of Security building on 25 December 1993,  physical confrontations between security and defense ministry  personnel, including ministers over loss of Abkhazia, disruption  of signing of military agreement at Ashgabat CIS summit]. How  has it ended?    [Giorgadze] Reason prevailed in the conflict that arose  between me and the defense minister. The government commission  has not yet completed its work. I believe it will establish who  was wrong and who was right. For me, this question was of the  greatest importance in order to prevent a further aggravation of  the conflict. This was an unprecedented event in the history of  the state. If the situation is not cleared up, it could be  interpreted as an attempted coup. The damage suffered by the  Ministry of Security is very great. It amounts to 18 billion  coupons; two employees were seriously wounded and cars belonging  to the ministry were destroyed during the explosion. I think we  managed to avoid further complications arising from the conflict  when armored vehicles and armed persons were brought out onto  the street in order to seize the counterintelligence building.  Everything ended in little bloodshed.    [Gvelesiani] Batono Igor, the violations in the banking and  credit and financial system, the misappropriation of  humanitarian aid, and the removal of raw materials of strategic  importance from the state leads us to believe that a powerful  mafia is operating in Georgia.    [Giorgadze] For almost two years now, there has been talk  about violations in the credit and financial system; several  commissions have been formed and are working; suspects have been  arrested but, as can be seen, the major criminals have remained  free, as not a single serious violation in the banking sphere  has been cleared up.    On instructions from the head of state, our ministry became  interested in this matter. On the basis of investigative  materials, we arrested the vice-president of the National Bank.  Given the reaction that this fact has caused among a number of  senior officials, it can be supposed that we are dealing with  serious violations whose successful investigation will expose  all those who sacrificed the country's interests for their own  gain.    The Ministry of Security has been entrusted with forming an  independent economic service that will be able to control and  examine violations in the economic and credit systems. However,  at the moment, we do not have sufficient funds for this. It is  certain that existing mafia groups have found support both in  state bodies of administration and in executive power.  Therefore, the struggle against them and their exposure will  take a long time. This is a serious problem and the Ministry of  Security alone will not be able to cope with it.    [Gvelesiani] Does the fear exist that Georgia will become a  transit country for drugs?    [Giorgadze] Unfortunately, this process is already under way  and the international narcotics business, which trades in  illegal arms and narcotic substances, is interested in our  territory. The point is that, whereas before, the narcotics  route from Asia to Europe bypassed the USSR, it now runs as  follows: eastern Asia -- Pakistan -- Afghanistan -- Central  Asia -- Azerbaijan -- Georgia. Therefore, Georgia unhesitatingly  took part in the international conference held in Istanbul on  the initiative of the Black Sea countries and devoted to the  problems of the struggle against the narcotics business and  terrorism. Work in this direction is intensively under way. My  deputy and a special group are currently in Bucharest, where a  meeting of special services is continuing at which the latest  means and methods in the struggle against the drugs mafia are  being perfected. Incidentally, a sizable amount of drugs has  already been smuggled via Georgia to Europe. The absence of  borders and strict customs controls and appropriate legislation  are complicating our work very much.    [Gvelesiani] The view is being spread here and supported by  high-ranking officials in the power structures that Georgia is  unable to restore order by itself and, therefore, is calling on  an external force for help.    [Giorgadze] I do not share such a view. Georgia can  certainly establish order in its own land. This is borne out by  the recent intensification of the struggle against the criminal  world and the subsequent positive results that have been  achieved.    The Ministry of Security just like its predecessor -- the  Intelligence and Information Bureau, was not tasked with acting  upon information received. One got the impression that we could  only obtain information while some "distant uncle" would  establish order for us. Now, the situation is different. Those  special divisions that make up the power structures of the  Ministry of Security are well trained and well disciplined and  composed of young men trained to carry out special operations; I  believe it is possible to train similar groups in the Ministry  of Internal Affairs as well. In my view, the power structures  currently existing in the Ministry of Security should also exist  in the future in Georgian military formations in the form of  special subunits. The correct selection of professional cadres  will enable us to form and train such special subunits in all  the power ministries that will be able to restore order in the  country in the shortest period of time. We need more than just  the desire to do this. We need to create the appropriate  legislation, material and technical base, and means for this.  Then, we will no longer be reliant on external help but will be  able to act entirely on our own.    [Gvelesiani] When will the security service's archives be  made public?    [Giorgadze] After Gamsakhurdia became head of state,  "interest" in the security service's archives exceeded all  bounds. There were gross violations of the law. I believe we  should now form a parliamentary commission that will investigate  and determine how unique material, which was stored for tens of  years in the security service, was destroyed. Those documents,  which presented in an "unembellished" form the activities of  persons in the government, were removed and destroyed. Certain  unconscientious employees in the security service have used  archive materials to build their political careers and there  were also cases of archive materials being sold. There occurred  a series of serious violations that have to be exposed as a  matter of urgency.    The archives are now again in a sorrowful state; we do not  have the appropriate storage cases and repository that ensures  the protection of unique materials. As can be seen, we are  unable to appreciate what the Ministry of Security archives mean  for the country's security. There is the experience of other  countries where, after a certain period of time has elapsed,  secret documents become available to the public but only if they  do not compromise the interests of the state. In Great Britain,  when the time arrived to make public a certain number of  documents, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher opposed this and  postponed this measure for, I think, 30 years as the publication  of this material did not accord with the country's interests.    One can say without exaggeration that certain materials in  our archives could cause another civil war in Georgia.  Therefore, we should be very careful with archive materials. I  would like to ask Parliament: True, there are many very serious  problems to be resolved in the country, but a legislative base  should be elaborated in the shortest period of time that would  enable the Ministry of Security and the entire state security  system to function normally. The existence of laws would settle  many questions and also strictly define the problem of the  safekeeping of materials in the archives.    [Gvelesiani] Batono minister, the public is alarmed by the  terrorist acts that are being aimed at certain individuals or  formations. While pointing out the high professional level of  the crimes that have been committed, the leaders of political  parties are clearly pointing the finger at the Ministry of  Security. The inability to solve these crimes strengthens  suspicions....    [Giorgadze] It is naive to think about an improvement in the  criminal situation when there is a huge amount of weapons and  explosive materials in the hands of the population; against the  background of the existing chaos in the banking system, we are  now facing the consequences of the wave of violence perpetrated  by persons who have become unbelievably rich as a result of  illegal commercial operations and mafia clans. Groups that have  been deceived or swindled are settling scores with one another,  dividing spheres of influence, are often unable to agree with  one another.... Nothing new or special is happening in Georgia.  This is a characteristic feature of any capitalist system and  is being strengthened here with the formation of a free market  economy.    As for those leaders of political parties who often travel  abroad, they know very well that the problem of terrorism exists  on a world scale and, in a number of countries, it has been  raised to the rank of state policy. Therefore, such a naive  approach to a most important question is embarrassing, as is  heaping blame on the security service.    You often hear the security service being reproached on  account of its "inaction" -- not a single terrorist crime has  been solved. I am ready to deliver a report on the work carried  out to the relevant commission. Provided you do not claim that  I am trying to justify myself, I would like to give you a few  examples concerning terrorist acts carried out in Great Britain.  Between 20 December 1993 and 29 January of this year (in  London) and between 15 December 1993 and 4 February of this year  in Northern Ireland, more than 20 explosions took place, causing  damage to buildings, the subway, houses, and shopping centers.  There were victims among the law-abiding population. Not one  of these crimes has been solved! It is also significant that  this has been taking place in a democratic country that has a  400-year-old parliamentary tradition, the strongest  investigative and special services in the world, and a police  force equipped with the most modern equipment.    In our conditions, it is particularly difficult to solve  terrorist crimes since, apart from our not having the necessary  equipment, our work is being complicated by other factors. I  will give you some concrete facts. A terrorist act was  committed against the "Mkhedrioni" ["Horsemen" -- a legally  sanctioned armed formation recently incorporated into the Rescue  Corps] leaders Zaza Vepkhvadze and Gia Svanadze. Our  investigators were not permitted onto the scene of the crime;  following an explosion in Rustavi, Temur Talakhadze, the leader  of the "Mkhedrioni" branch in Rustavi, was killed. The scene of  the crime was sealed off and we were not allowed there either.  We were granted access several hours after the event but could  not find any incriminating materials or other material evidence.  The same thing happened following the explosion at [Deputy  Defense Minister] Nikoloz Kekelidze's apartment. Ministry of  Security employees were only allowed in after the second  explosion (at that time the heads of the Ministry of Defense  were examining the scene of the crime). We were able to set  about our work some 12 hours after the terrorist act had been  committed. Naturally, we found that all evidence had again been  destroyed and the scene of the crime had been tidied up.    In spite of the aforementioned or other objective or  subjective reasons, the greater part of these crimes are in the  process of being solved. At the moment I cannot say any more  about this. However, we hope that the investigations will soon  be over and the criminals will be brought to justice.  Therefore, it is possible to make complaints provided they have  some substance. We will accept any kind of criticism but  neither the Ministry of Security nor any self-respecting  professional will accept something that is undeserved.    [Gvelesiani] Batono minister, to what extent is it possible  to forecast the next terrorist act?    [Giorgadze] It is possible to forecast the targets of  terrorist acts but I believe that making such forecasts is an  unenviable and ignoble activity. At the same time, it is highly  risky as the opposing side can use these forecasts to their  advantage.    It is possible that such acts will continue. We know of  high-ranking officials who accumulated vast wealth during the  [civil] war. It is expected that they will redistribute spheres  of influence, which does not exclude the use of violent methods.  I am convinced that these persons, who, for several days were  locked up, hungry and thirsty, in "safes," will definitely try  to pay their opponents back for this. Yes, there have been such  cases. Those who reckon that the other side has cheated them of  thousands or millions of dollars, will try to retrieve these  huge sums by violent means. In clarifying their relations,  neither side will refrain from shedding blood.    [Gvelesiani] Are these terrorist acts perhaps politically  motivated?    [Giorgadze] This also cannot be excluded as there have been  cases of terrorist acts committed against various political  parties. There have been explosions at some of their  headquarters; buildings have been damaged; there have been no  victims although this has possibly been due to pure chance.  Incidentally, a political battle implies the use of terrorist  methods -- in an uncivilized society, of course.    I have often said and emphasize once more: In order to  establish order in the country and put a halt to the wave of  violence perpetrated by criminal bands, the power ministries  must have the very latest equipment and, in order to train  specialists, the state must spend sizable sums of money.  Otherwise, no one will put a stop to the anarchy and disorder.  We will not be able to restore the economy without the  involvement of foreign partners who, precisely on account of the  criminal situation, are refraining from making any investments.    Therefore, I ask the head of state, Parliament, the  government, and the republic's population to invest immediately  the necessary funds into strengthening the Ministry of Security.    Our salvation is in our own hands!</p>

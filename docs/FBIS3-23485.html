			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Defense Ministry is trying to trace the source  of the ammonium nitrate which made up part of an extremely  powerful suicide-bomb found in the back of a truck in Bangkok on  Thursday.    Ammonium nitrate is a colorless, crystalline salt used  chiefly in explosives and fertilizers.    Sources at the Defense Ministry said it is classified as a  "military logistical item" and its distribution is restricted by  law. All purchases and shipments of ammonium nitrate must be  made through the ministry's Industry and Energy Center.    "The center is trying to trace the source of the one ton of  the substance found as part of the explosive device in the  foiled bombing attack believed directed at the Israeli  diplomatic mission," one of the sources said.    The sources said the person who assembled the bomb must have  bought the chemical from authorized users registered with the  Industry and Energy Center.    Buyers of ammonium nitrate must prove they are in the  rock-blasting business or produce fertilizers, as well as have a  license to possess and use explosives from the Interior Ministry.    There are about 20 merchants licensed to sell the compound  in  Thailand, the sources said.    Under the law governing military supply, illegal possession  and use of ammonium nitrate is punishable by a maximum prison  term of five years and/or a fine of up to Bt50,000. Using the  fertilizer to make an explosive device is liable to punishment  under the law on firearms and explosives.    One of the sources said the explosive mixture found on the  truck -- C-4 explosive, diesel oil and ammonium nitrate, known  as "witches' brew" -- would not be very effective if detonated  in the open.    "If detonated in an open space there would be very loud  blast  and not much else," the source said. "But the bomb would be  devastating if set off in an enclosed area, inside a building."</p>

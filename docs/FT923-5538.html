			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Arts: No let-up from America - Radio WHILE the American election is pending, Alistair Cooke's Letter from America is extra-interesting. It always is interesting, as one of the few items of its kind on BBC radio, the equivalent of the 'middles' in the weekly reviews. Cooke's programme offers the view of the intelligent, well-informed private citizen on current American affairs. Election comment has sparse time on our news bulletins as Bush threatens to intervene in Iraq and the United Nations in Yugoslavia. But American electors are not likely to imagine that such matters outweigh a presidential election. Alistair Cooke last week not only reported on the polls, he gave background to the polls' significance, with their minute opinion samples. Both parties, he reckons, are in some awe of the millions of Hispanic and Black voters. The various comments that follow The World at One are often good, but an extended programme like Letter from America is better. We should have more of such things. But back at home: Radio 3. The changes cannot be fairly assessed until the Proms are over - and the cricket season. So far nothing has struck me as insupportable, though the new chatty style of the presenters is not to my taste. But a word must be said about the cricket. There are doubtless folk who need to know, ball by ball, what goes on in the Tests, conceivably others who feel the same about the Texaco Trophy games. I doubt, however, whether the 'large new audience for classical music and opera' at whom controller Nicholas Kenyon says he aims really holds that such coverage is worth the loss of so much music. Why should not Test Matches go on to Radio 5, which happily devoted day after day to the Olympics? True, cricket commentary is slow compared with athletics; but even so, it is not altogether barred from Radio 5. It gets an occasional half-day - sometimes even in competition with Radio 3, for listeners too idle to swap frequencies. While I am on Radio 3, a good mark for repeating Radio 4's fine reading of Joyce's Ulysses, and a bad mark for the Summer Season of drama, which goes on as trivial as ever. The Lyme Regis Food and Fertility Festival was John Fletcher's surrealist (sic) joke about provincial arts festivals. It was awful in just the way you would deduce from its title. Shaun MacLoughlin directed. Not a happy week-end for drama, in fact. Peter Flannery's ambitious Singer on Radio 4 on Saturday and Sunday told of Peter Singer (played by Anthony Sher below his optimum calibre), who survived Auschwitz to become a slum landlord in England, where he became rich and influential enough for a knighthood. The synopsis may have read well, but despite the interposed commentary, there was not enough assurance either in the prison or, in the later scenes, in the Rachmanesque world in London. Michael Fox was the director. What I thought would be a real novelty was Radio 4's Keep It Clean, a serial documentary on Wednesday mornings. I hoped for something like Radio 1's do-good programmes; but no, it was critique. The first programme dealt with soap (and later come aftershave, deodorant, shampoo, handkerchiefs and toilet-paper). We were reminded what an innovation baths are, even washing itself. Between the wars, there were children sewn into their underclothes for the winter, boys who only took their socks off on Saturdays. In the 18th century there was a tax on soap (Gladstone took it off in 1853). We have the great William Hesketh Lever to thank for our present position. Lifebuoy soap was not only for washing but for the relief of typhoid, cholera, even carbuncles. Only after the arrival of Camay, did soap become the luxury it is now, turning women's bathrooms into rivals to their drawing-rooms. Next week starts with Old Spice.</p>

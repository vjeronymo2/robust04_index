			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For example, the per-gallon benzene standard is 1.00 vol%, and the average benzene standard is 0.95 vol%. Under the proposal a refiner could, for each batch of gasoline produced, elect to meet the per-gallon or the average benzene standard. EPA believes that under the proposed approach most refiners would produce gasoline with the intention that the benzene level will be very close to, but slightly below, 1.00 vol%. If the refiner's benzene test for any given batch indicates the benzene level is between 0.95 vol% and 1.00 vol% (which refiners would be able to achieve for most batches), the batch would be placed in the per-gallon compliance category. If the refiner misses this benzene goal for any batch, and the refiner's test result indicates a benzene level above 1.00 vol% (1.05 vol%, for example), the refiner would simply place that batch in the average compliance category, and also produce a corresponding volume of gasoline in the average category (or change a previously-produced batch to the average compliance category) having a benzene level sufficiently below 0.95 vol% that the two batches have an average benzene content of 0.95 vol%. The net result over the annual benzene averaging period would be that the majority of gasoline would be in the per-gallon compliance category with an average benzene content close to 1.00 vol%, while the minority of gasoline would be in the average compliance category with an average benzene content of 0.95 vol%. Under this example, the resulting overall benzene level of the gasoline produced by the refiner would be greater than the approximately 0.95 vol% which EPA would expect if all reformulated gasoline had to meet the per-gallon benzene standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA announced in its 1992 proposal a clear intention that average standards be allowed in order to increase refiner and importer flexibility. EPA also made clear its expectation that the ``margin-of-safety'' normally expected with a per-gallon standard not be lost because of averaging. This change is designed to implement this goal by preventing the potential unfavorable result from averaging described above. The final rule therefore includes a requirement that refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders must elect, for each calendar year and for each parameter, to use only the per-gallon standard or only the average standard for each regulated parameter. This election must be made separately for each refinery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this revised approach to averaging, the average parameter levels for the gasoline produced by any refiner would be approximately the same regardless of whether the refiner elects the per-gallon or the average standards. For example, a refiner who elects to meet the benzene standard on a per-gallon basis probably will plan to produce gasoline with benzene levels sufficiently below the 1.00 wt% benzene standard to ensure that, when the production of each batch is complete, the refiner's benzene test results for each batch will be below 1.00 wt%. EPA estimates that refiners subject to the per-gallon benzene standard would aim for approximately 0.95 wt% benzene, and as a result the gasoline produced by such a refiner would have an average benzene level of about 0.95 wt%. In the case of refiners subject to the average benzene standard, on the other hand, refiners probably would plan to produce gasoline with benzene levels that exactly equal the 0.95 wt% benzene standard, with the result that the average benzene level for the gasoline produced by such refiners would be almost exactly 0.95 wt%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the revised approach for selecting whether to meet standards per-gallon versus average, therefore, the average parameter values in practice will be at the levels intended by EPA and Congress, and not at the less stringent levels that would have resulted from the proposed approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has not included a process for refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders to notify EPA in advance of the per-gallon versus average standard elections. Rather, parties in effect will make this election when the first batch of reformulated gasoline is produced or imported each averaging period, because all reformulated gasoline subsequently produced or imported during the averaging period must follow the lead of the first batch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

The rationale for this category of oxygen averaging was that under the simple model the VOC emissions reductions required for reformulated gasoline would be deemed met only if the oxygen and RVP standards are each met for gasoline designated as VOC-controlled. Under that proposal, the gasoline quality surveys to be conducted in cities during the high ozone season would measure both RVP and oxygen of gasoline; the city would be considered to have passed a VOC survey only if both the oxygen and RVP levels met the per-gallon standards for these parameters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An industry group commented on this approach to VOC surveys and oxygen averaging. This commenter suggested that the VOC surveys should be based on a ``simple model'' VOC equation that would take into account both oxygen and RVP. Under this VOC equation, if the oxygen content found during a survey is below the per-gallon oxygen standard (worse than the standard), this deficiency may be offset by an RVP level that is below the per-gallon RVP standard (better than the standard), and vice versa. This commenter went on to suggest that under this approach, there would be no need to require refiners and importers to separately meet the oxygen standard for simple model VOC-controlled reformulated gasoline. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 55 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Instead, according to this comment, the oxygen standard should apply only on an annual basis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 56 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 55 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under the 1992 proposal, the separate RVP standard would apply only to simple model VOC-controlled reformulated gasoline. The manner in which the RVP standard applies to VOC-controlled gasoline under today's rule is the same as in the proposals. The oxygen standard, on the other hand, would have to be met separately for two categories of reformulated gasoline under the 1992 proposal: VOC-controlled reformulated gasoline and all reformulated gasoline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 56 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under the 1992 proposal, for purposes of oxygen averaging, gasoline intended for use in oxygenated fuels program areas during the oxygenated fuels control periods (or OPRG) could not be averaged together with non-OPRG gasoline. The reason separate oxygen averaging was proposed for non-OPRG gasoline is to ensure areas not included in the oxygenated fuels program receive gasoline that meets the 2.0 oxygen content mandated by the Clean Air Act. If OPRG and non-OPRG gasoline could be averaged together for oxygen purposes, the gasoline in the OPRG areas_where 2.7 weight percent oxygen is required during the oxygenated fuels control period_could be used to offset gasoline with 1.5 weight percent oxygen intended for use in non-OPRG areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No comments were received on this proposed treatment of oxygen averaging for gasoline designated as OPRG versus non-OPRG, and this treatment is unchanged under today's rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

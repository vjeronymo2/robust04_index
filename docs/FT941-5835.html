			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Taming the wild beast: Brazil's latest effort at economic stabilisation For Mr Roberto Macedo, former economic policy secretary, Brazil's latest financial stabilisation effort, under way since December, involves more than bringing down inflation. 'We're running out of animals,' he says. His concern is not ecological. With annual inflation of about 2,500 per cent, the country's central bank needs a steady stream of new designs for ever-larger denominations of notes and coins. The latest set of drawings is nearly exhausted. Brazil's rapidly devaluing currency is the most visible symbol of the country's economic troubles. It is also the knotty problem which the second of a three-stage stabilisation plan is now addressing. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, on Monday announced the creation of an accounting unit called the Urv, which is expected to form the basis of a new and theoretically inflation-free currency in a couple of months. Brazilians remain sceptical that Mr Cardoso's plan will succeed. The country has seen six previous stabilisation attempts fail in the past eight years. But many businessmen agree he has achieved more than they hoped. 'Over the last few months Brazil has started to realise high inflation cannot continue. If the overall stabilisation plan is adopted, it has an enormous chance of success,' according to Mr Wilson Brumer, president of Acesita, a large steel company based in southern Minas Gerais state. Brazil's inflation has two main motors. Following decades of budget profligacy, the government has been forced to issue securities of ever-shorter maturity to fund its deficit. These are issued at higher and higher interest rates, now equal to more than 40 per cent a month. The process is equivalent to printing money, and is inflationary. Second, and mainly in response to the first motor, Brazil created a sophisticated financial system. This uses indices which measure past price changes in order regularly to readjust current prices, rents and salaries. Because the indices are based on past inflation, the process becomes 'inertial', or self-sustaining. Even if prices should be falling, they are kept high by increases based on past inflation levels. According to Mr Winston Fritsch, one of Mr Cardoso's economic team, Brazilian inflation is now 'basically inertial and expectational'. The government estimates that without these two tendencies, for example if price rises were measured in US dollar terms, local inflation last year was below 5 per cent. 'So you need some kind of economic lobotomy to make people forget about past inflation,' according to Mr Fritsch. Such thinking formed the backbone to Mr Cardoso's plan. The first and most important step was to balance this year's budget, which had been projected to show a deficit of Dollars 22.2bn. This only represents about 5 per cent of gross domestic product, less than the deficits of many industrialised nations. But given the Brazilian government's poor international image, the deficit could only have been financed by continuing the inflationary cycle of short-term securities. Following intense negotiations with Mr Cardoso, Congress last week finally agreed a package of cuts and revenue transfers to wipe out the projected shortfall. According to Mr Fernando de Hollanda Barbosa, an economist at the Rio de Janeiro-based Getulio Vargas foundation, Mr Cardoso did well to get his budget through Congress, where the government relies on a weak coalition for support. 'It's been a major victory for him. But the important phase lies ahead. The first steps are just preconditions,' he said. Mr Cardoso quickly moved to phase two and unveiled the Urv - the Unidade Real de Valor, or real unit of value - which is partly designed to pave the way for a new currency, and partly as the 'lobotomy'. The central bank sets the daily value of the Urv in terms of the local currency, the cruzeiro real. At present, one Urv is equal to one dollar. As the cruzeiro devalues each day, the Urv is worth more cruzeiros but the same in dollars. Thus in terms of the Urv, there is little inflation. All salaries have been converted to Urvs, and the government hopes the unit's apparent stability will tempt people to convert prices to Urvs voluntarily. Once the unit is widely in use, it will become a full currency called the Real and will be linked to Brazil's Dollars 32bn foreign exchange reserves to give it credibility. This ingenious plan is fraught with problems, as Mr Cardoso admitted. 'We can get inflation down, that part is easy. What's difficult is to keep it there. There are many difficulties. (The balanced budget) was approved in Congress but it will be carried out by the executive arm, and it's made more difficult by the fact we are in an election year.' Mr Macedo agreed: discipline in the new currency is the most difficult thing. 'But let's suppose they reach two-digit inflation, annually, in the new currency, then that's a good thing. At least they will have gained time.' Several previous stabilisation plans were designed to see a weak government through to the end of its mandate. Political observers say presidential and congressional elections in October may put pressure on the government to increase spending and lead to inflation in the new currency. Mr Cardoso has already agreed to demands from other ministers for a 5 per cent bonus for public-sector workers. This is likely to cost the government about Dollars 310m and already threatens the balanced budget. More worryingly, Brazil's erratic president, Mr Itamar Franco, is thought to be unhappy with the minimum monthly wage of Dollars 65 and wants a substantial increase by the end of the year. The labour ministry wants a minimum wage of nearly Dollars 100. This wage is used as a base in the social security system. Such an increase would lead to an immediate rise in government expenditure of Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn and leave the budget in tatters. Mr Cardoso is dismissive of the wage rise idea. 'This is the real world, that's why we want a real currency,' he said. But businesses are worried, especially since unions in Sao Paulo are threatening to strike for higher wages. The elections are also a problem. Mr Cardoso is widely assumed to be a strong candidate for president, but is short of time to bring down inflation and still resign from the government by April 2, as Brazilian law dictates. He may therefore have to stay in the government, as kingmaker, or hand over to a chosen successor and bask in reflected glory if the plan succeeds. There is also an outside chance the law will be changed to allow him and other ministers to remain in office closer to the elections. Mr Cardoso, 62, is evasive and has become an agile dodger of the issue of his candidature. Asked about his greatest challenge, he replied: 'To defeat inflation will only happen once in history. I hope I will live long enough to dispute an election again.'</p>

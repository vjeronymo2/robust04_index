He said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE that  political parties should realign by this summer to allow time to  hammer out policies and prepare candidates for the House of  Representatives elections.    "The elections for the House of Councillors are planned for  next summer and general elections (for the lower house) under  the new electoral system could take place anytime after January  next year," Ouchi said.    The DSP chief said the biggest challenge facing Japanese  politics today is to lay the foundation for one or two political  parties that could take over the reins of government from the  largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    The LDP ruled for 38 years until Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, head of the fledgling Japan New Party, launched a  seven-party coalition last summer.    Ouchi praised Hosokawa for making a "courageous decision"  not  to reshuffle his cabinet, a move aimed chiefly at getting rid of  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, the head of new  party Sakigake.    He said in the interview that the Hosokawa administration  would have fallen apart if it had proceeded with a 7 percent  national welfare tax program and a cabinet shake-up.    Ouchi blamed Shinseito secretary general Ichiro Ozawa and  his  Komeito counterpart Yuichi Ichikawa for the ill-fated scenarios,  and said such high-handed politicking could lead to a collapse  of the coalition government.</p>

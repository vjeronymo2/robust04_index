			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Progressive Socialist Party; date </F> not given]    [Text] The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, a flagrant massacre,  is a message to Arabs and Muslims and a new mark of shame on the  forehead of Zionism, which has been absolved by international  public opinion through the United Nations of the accusation of  racism. Therefore, we ask the Zionists what they would describe  as their law and regulations, considering what happened in the  Ibrahimi Mosque today, when a Zionist opened fire on a group of  worshipers praying piously to God. In moments, they were  transferred into martyrs in the name of God. The ground of the  Mosque was turned into a lake of the blood of scores of martyrs  and hundreds of wounded, within sight of the army which was  guarding the place and keeping the peace. Tomorrow, they will  claim that a demented person committed the crime or that it is a  revenge operation. They will pretend to condemn and denounce it.    The PSP [Progressive Socialist Party] has sent a cable to  the  United Nations, the Socialist International, the Arab League,  and all other international organizations condemning this ugly  crime and demanding that a stance be taken regarding it. It  would like to make the following remarks:    1. This crime committed by a Zionist settler is not an  individual act. It represents a racist and extremist way of  thinking and behaving opposed to everything that is Arab. This  proves the racist nature of the Israeli culture, which they  teach their children and citizens and present as an example to  the region under the banner of the future Israeli peace.    2. What is the use of reaching agreements with the Israelis  while Israel presents new evidence daily on its continuing  policy to terrorize the Arabs in Palestine and kick them out of  their land? We wonder about the usefulness of the Oslo agreement  and the subsequent agreements, and about how serious the two  cosponsors are about securing peace in the Middle East.    3. We ask the United States and International Security  Council in particular about the usefulness of repealing the  resolution equating Zionism with racism when Israel provides  daily evidence of its extremist racism and deep-rooted fascism.    4. We ask PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat why he is in a hurry to  skip stages. We ask him whether he is now convinced that  unilateral solutions are no good for the Palestinian people,  since they only allow Israeli infiltration into the Arab ranks  and undermine Arab decisiveness. Such solutions do not  constitute progress toward a just peace that secures for the  Palestinian people their simplest rights.    5. We affirm to Israel that the blood which flowed at dawn  today on this Ramadan morning will permeate the Arab spirit and  teach each Arab that the Zionists are deadly enemies.    The masses will avenge you, o martyrs of the mosque, o  martyrs of Palestine and Arabism.</p>

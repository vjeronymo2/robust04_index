Yesterday, the Agriculture Ministry announced that in  addition to petroleum Colombia will sell rice and African palm  oil to Cuba within the framework of new negotiations. Later,  Colombia will also export other products, including pork,  chicken, and grain. In exchange, Colombia will receive  technological and scientific advice for the agricultural and  fishing sectors.    To strengthen relations with the Castro regime, Deputy  Agriculture Minister Santiago Perry Rubio; Jose Ernesto Macias,  the ministry's marketing director; and several officials from  the Colombian Corporation for Agricultural Research [Corporacion  Colombiana de Investigacion Agropecuaria], the Veterinarian  Products Enterprise [Empresa de Productos Veterinarios], the  National Fisheries and Agricultural Institute [Instituto  Nacional de Pesca y Agricultura], and the Colombian  Agricultural-Livestock Institute met with Cuban Agriculture  Minister Alfredo Jordan Morales and Cuba's vice ministers of  agriculture -- Daniel Fajardo Cubelo and Abilio Cardenas Garcia.    The main types of cooperation agreed upon by the two  delegations include Cuba's designing, building, and starting  operations at a pilot fermentation plant to produce means of  biological control [medios de control biologicos]; setting up a  joint project to obtain banana varieties resistant to black  sigatoka; and holding negotiations on ways to produce rice and  palm oil on the island.    Also, Colombia agreed to cooperate in developing solar  energy  and wind power in Cuba and to give advice in the field of  veterinarian medicine. Colombian Agriculture Minister Jose  Antonio Ocampo will soon meet with his Cuban counterpart Alfredo  Jordan Morales in Havana to ratify these agreements. [passage  omitted]</p>

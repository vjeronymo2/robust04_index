			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (At a Glance): Standard Life bonuses Standard Life has announced bonuses on its with-profits policies which should keep it at the top of the performance tables. However, it signalled that bonuses might have to come down next year by reducing the 'interim' bonus which would be payable if people needed to claim life cover from the policies during the next year. Assuming that the policies were started by a 29-year-old man paying Pounds 30 monthly premiums, a 25-year endowment would pay Pounds 66,087 (up slightly from Pounds 65,858) on maturity, while a 10-year endowment would pay Pounds 7,672 (down from Pounds 8,336). The reversionary bonus rate on pension with-profits policies has been maintained at 5.75 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed RIA report in the "In Brief" column: "The </F> Number of Strikes in Russia Is Growing Fast"]    [Text] The number of strikes in Russia in the first  quarter has increased 10.3 times compared to the same time last  year. They occurred at 288 enterprises, whereas in all of 1993,  264 concerns were affected. This was announced by Tatyana  Frolova, secretary of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions  of Russia [FITUR], who spoke at a session of the FITUR  Solidarity Action Coordinating Committee.    Among the main reasons for the strikes, Frolova cited the  federal budget's indebtedness, chronic delays in wage payments,  the absence of a mechanism for mutual settlements, a growth in  unemployment, and continuous increases in prices for foodstuffs  and basic goods. Workers' action has been highest in the Komi  Republic (Vorkuta), western Siberia, and Kemerovo, Tula, and  Rostov Oblasts.</p>

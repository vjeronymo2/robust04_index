			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- The cooperative farms  across the country had finished maize sowing in all fields by  May 31 except northern cold areas and some seedling beds.    Maize is a high-yielding crop which holds a big share  together with rice in the nation's grain production.    The agricultural working people had made substantial  preparations for farming from the beginning of the year. They  selected high-yielding strains on the principle of right crop in  right area and sowed maize in seedling beds on a stage-by-stage  basis and transplanted seedlings in time.    Cooperative farmers in North and South Hwanghae Provinces,  North and South Pyongan Provinces and other areas are manuring  and tending the maize plants with good care.</p>

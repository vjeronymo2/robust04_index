Selivano,  who had applied for political asylum in Finland. Finnish authorities said the  hijacker commandeered the airliner with 26 people aboard during a domestic  flight from Novgorod to Petrozavodsk near the Finnish border and demanded to be  flown to Stockholm. But the airliner landed in Helsinki because it was running  low on fuel. The Soviet news agency Tass said the man turned out to be unarmed.  </P></p>

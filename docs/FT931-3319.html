			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Iranian jets 'bomb Kurdish hospital' THE WIFE of French president Francois Mitterrand, Mrs Danielle Mitterrand, said yesterday at least six Kurdish civilians were killed and many hurt when Iranian aircraft bombed a French-run hospital on the Iran-Iraq border at the weekend, Reuter reports from Paris. Mrs Mitterrand, head of the privately-funded human rights group France-Libertes, added that searches were under way for more bodies in the debris of the hospital at Raniya after air raids on Saturday and Sunday. She said the hospital was on Iraqi soil, in an area controlled by the rebel Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) and inside the Western allies' air exclusion zone set up to protect Iraqi Kurds.</p>

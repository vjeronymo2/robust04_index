			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edyth Bulbring] </F>   [Excerpt] A series of inconclusive inquiries into political  violence overseen by Major-General Krappies Engelbrecht will  come under fresh scrutiny in the next fortnight by a team of  international investigators appointed by the President F.W. de  Klerk. The Goldstone commission, which named General  Engelbrecht as one of three top generals implicated in "Third  Force" activity, has a mass of new information to put before the  investigators. This information is expected to throw the  spotlight on the remarkable record of failure by the SA [South  African] Police [SAP] to resolve a series of cased of serious  political violence.    As head of SAP's counter-intelligence department, General  Engelbrecht is in charge of all investigations dealing with  violence and subversion -- including train, taxi and hostel  massacres. Before that, he was involved in two major  investigations into security force involvement in hit squad  activities.    The sequence begins with the allegations of convicted  murderer Almond Nofomela in 1989 that he and another police  officer based at Vlakplaas, Dirk Coetzee, had murdered  anti-apartheid figures. General Engelbrecht was requested to  assist the McNally commission of inquiry into the allegations.  Tim McNally later led evidence before the Harms commission,  which found there was no proof of a state-sanctioned police hit  squad at Vlakplaas.    Then General Engelbrecht was appointed by former Law and  Order Minister Adriaan Vlok to assist in an investigation of the  SA Defence Force after claims that the CCB [Civil Cooperation  Bureau], a covert military organisation, was involved in  murdering political opponents of the government. He paid  particular attention to the assassination of Wits academic David  Webster, allegedly by a CCB hit squad. At the Webster inquest,  retired police general Jaap Jourbert said General Engelbrecht  had sent a message to detained murder suspect Ferdi Barnard that  he should not speak for six or seven months about CCB  activities. A week before his evidence, the investigating  officer, Warrant Officer Wessel Rousseau, had told the Rand  Supreme Court General Engelbrecht had warned two other CCB  operatives not to talk. They were Calla Botha and Slang van  Zyl. The inquest court could not make a conclusive finding. The  Harms commission later found the CCB was not responsible for the  murder of Dr Webster.    General Engelbrecht is one of three generals placed on  compulsory leave on Friday by Mr de Klerk for allegedly being  involved in providing arms to Inkatha for hit-squad activities,  illegally manufacturing weapons, issuing false documents and  passports, fomenting violence and attempting cover-ups when the  Goldstone commission began its work.    The evidence provided by Mr Justice Richard Goldstone on  Friday, described as prima facie of criminal action, is only a  part of the allegations of illegal activities that will be  provided to a special task team of international policemen.  Evidence received by the Goldstone commission, but not yet  disclosed, includes allegations of car theft and corruption in a  rewards scheme for AK-47 assault rifles and other criminal acts  by policemen.

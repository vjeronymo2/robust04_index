			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (8): Dual attraction - European Competition Last June, the European Community's proposed directive liberalising pension fund investment was sent back to the drawing boards for a re-think, setting back the cause of cross-border investment. Significantly, one of the sticking points was the French and Italian governments requiring that custody of pension scheme assets be held domestically - a measure which flies in the face of the spirit of the internal market. Europe remains an attractive market for custodians, particularly with the growing interest in cross-border investment. Moves to ease restrictions on outward investment in Scandinavia and the Netherlands have made European markets even more attractive to custodians than they had been previously. Moreover, custodians will admit privately, Europe has another attraction; its clients tend to be less sophisticated in their zeal to pare fees to their lowest levels and, consequently, business based there may prove more profitable than in some other centres. Recent liberalisation of Scandinavian investment rules, allowing foreigners to buy domestic shares, for instance, are opening those markets for non-domestic custodians, while the lifting of foreign investment restrictions on some of the Netherlands's largest pension schemes are creating opportunities there. Custodians say that there are very few domestic rules which formally bar them from competing fully for European business. There are, however, a series of local customs and practices which, when added together, have made some centres hard to penetrate. Mr Ross Whitehill, vice-president at Morgan Stanley's European custody operations, says that the so-called 'reciprocity' deals are far more of a barrier to true competition than any formalised local rules. In reciprocity deals, a bank, based, say, in Thailand, will approach a Swiss bank to act as custodian for all its Swiss-based transactions. It will, however, request that the Swiss bank use its custody services for all its Thai business. In that way, competition by non-domestic competitors is avoided. However, custodians cite two European markets - France and Germany - as particularly difficult to penetrate. Mr Colin McClatchy, operations director at Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Ltd, notes that some rules which restrict the activities of foreign fund managers also make life difficult for would-be non-domestic custodians. For instance, any fund manager wishing to offer a spezialefunden which attracts capital gains tax relief will find that the rules require the use of a so-called depot bank as custodian. And, because it is largely the banks themselves which offer spezialefunden, 'a non-German investment manager is going to search long and hard to find someone to act in that capacity'. The door is not entirely closed to those wishing to act as custodians of retail funds, he notes. There is a provision for registered foreign funds to attract similarly generous capital gains treatment as the spezialefunden, but their chosen custodian must demonstrate that it is controlled to the same standard as a depot bank. But as a practical matter, he said, that standard has proven very difficult to match. 'In institutional terms, I know of no one who has cracked the German market. And UK institutions which own German institutions have almost no leverage either,' Mr McClatchy said. And in France, Mr McClatchy notes, 'there is a cultural tendency always to choose a domestic provider'. Small wonder then that the greatest pressure for custody of pension fund assets to remain at home comes from France. And although the argument presented has been about the need to reassure scheme sponsors that their assets are physically within reach, there remains considerable scepticism that the French are most interested in keeping competitors out of what has been a safe business until now. 'Our judgment is that the French and German markets offer potential in the longer term,' said Mr Robert Binney, business executive for Europe in the Global Securities Services division of Chase Manhattan Bank. 'But not in the next few years.' The existence of foreign exchange controls in both those countries has tended to mitigate against cross-border investment, making them less attractive to a global custodian prospecting for new business, he said. Custodians say that perhaps the most significant development in European markets is the Swiss initiative, to be known as Intersettle. This allows all the Swiss banks who choose to be members to bargain collectively for master custody services in other markets. Mr Wolfgang Michaelis, chief executive of Intersettle, said the project should be ready around mid-1994. 'Our goal is to become a cross-border clearer for Swiss participants, with the exception of Euroclear and Cedel,' he said. The two are the giant clearing agents for Eurobonds and international equities with deeply entrenched businesses in Switzerland. 'We are a mouse and they are an elephant,' he said. Intersettle has 146 members and SFr50m (USDollars 34m) in capital. Under the system, the Swiss banks will keep some of the higher margin business of custody but are outsourcing basic business with a single supplier in each market. The effect has been to enable the Swiss banks to obtain the best pricing and servicing of the basic product in each foreign market. In the US, Brown Brothers Harriman has been chosen as the local custodian, while in northern and southern Europe, Citibank has the contract. Citibank has also won the contract in South America, while Barclays will act as agent in Africa. In Japan, Mitsubishi Bank has won the contract while ANZ has done so for Australia. Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank has won the contract for the remaining Pacific rim countries. Membership in Intersettle is not limited to domestic Swiss institutions - any locally - based bank may join, Mr Michaelis said.</p>

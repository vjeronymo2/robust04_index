			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Observer: Make and break Much play has been made with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew's resignation as joint broker to Lonrho, and its impact on City confidence. But it's worth noting that Lonrho has a habit of outliving its brokers. Who remembers Joseph Sebag, for example? They were taken over by WI Carr a long time ago, which in turn has been swallowed by other organisations and regurgitated in virtually unrecognisable form. Capel-Cure Myers then took up the Lonrho brokership and although its name still survives it is no longer a force in corporate broking. Lonrho's remaining broker Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull is not such a name to conjure with, but its Lord Roger Manners and Tiny Rowland go back a long, long way. By contrast, the relationship with UBS Phillips and Drew could never be the same after Lonrho's Terry Robinson quit.</p>

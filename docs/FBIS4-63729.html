			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Meshkov, president of the Crimean </F> Republic, by Karol Wrubel; place and date not given: "A Happy  Place..."]    [Text] [Wrubel] When you were elected president, fears  intensified that Crimea might become another conflict area on  the territory of the former Soviet Union. You are definitely in  favor of stronger ties with Russia, even though your Republic  has been part of Ukraine since 1954. How would you like to  prevent the possibility of exacerbating the conflict over Crimea?    [Meshkov] The only way to avert such a conflict is to force  the Ukrainian authorities to implement the commitments that they  have made. For the time being, however, we have been witnessing  something entirely contrary.    [Wrubel] What do you mean: to force?    [Meshkov] The current elite in Kiev is busy trying to figure  out how to stay in power. However, it is no longer supported by  the people. The Ukrainian people were sentenced to living in  poverty. There are attempts to take advantage of the upcoming  50th anniversary of the deportation of the Crimean Tartars to  aggravate the conflict. Under the pretext that public order is  jeopardized, additional military units are being dispatched to  our territory. We used to have 18,000 soldiers whereas now we  have as many as 60,000. Who needs this? We are concerned about  the economy, but what we get are military echelons, tanks,  special units, and flame throwers. In addition, the United  States and other countries are being appealed to for support.  This may bring about inestimable consequences.    [Wrubel] Your movement is being accused of promoting Russian  nationalism, of separatism, and sometimes even of political  hooliganism.    [Meshkov] The motives of our activities have nothing to do  with nationalism. On the contrary; the goal of our policy is to  protect Crimea from an increase in nationalistic feelings.    [Wrubel] Is the support given to you by Russia sufficient?    [Meshkov] Most important for us is the support of our own  people, of the inhabitants of Crimea. As far as Russia is  concerned, we would certainly be happy if its official policy  were firmer. Nonetheless, we understand, of course, that this  is not always possible and that Moscow's stand depends on many  various factors.    [Wrubel] The forces that are giving support to you in Russia  do not call up good associations. Those forces are accused of  chauvinism and enmity toward reforms.    [Meshkov] Crimea is the happy place on earth where there is  no nationalism. Any attempts by external forces to arouse it  will be abortive, both now and in the future. Thus, the support  given to us by extreme groups will not in any way decide the  character of our ambitions. Moreover, we are supported by  various forces -- first of all by people who are concerned about  the development of the situation in Crimea.    [Wrubel] Many of your decrees have been annulled by  President Kravchuk. Recently Kiev has opposed the changes in  the posts of the minister of security and the minister of  internal affairs -- both changes were made by you. Your powers  are subject to quite considerable limitations, then?    [Meshkov] Both of these cases are the best illustration of  the conditions in which we are conducting our activities. We  are getting ready for the implementation of an economic reform,  whereas Kiev is employing forceful methods in order to aggravate  the conflict. The minister of internal affairs breached  official discipline and the Crimea Republic did not receive even  a small portion of the information that the security services  were sending over to Kiev. Now, this apparatus should work  first of all for its own Republic, even if it considered it to  be part of Ukraine. Therefore, I had to appoint new ministers.    [Wrubel] One of the best-known Crimean problems is the issue  of Tartars, whose leaders are rather critical of your program.  What do you think needs to be done to resolve the problem of  Tartars?    [Meshkov] The issue of how this problem should be resolved  is decided in the general declaration of human rights. Crimean  citizens of Tartar nationality have suffered wrongs that should  be compensated to them. Unfortunately, the Crimean Republic is  not in a position to bear the financial burden of a just  resolution of this problem. This is why we need help. However,  also in this case I would like to stress that there is not at  all an undercurrent of nationalism in the present difficulties  linked to the resolution of the Tartar problem.    [Wrubel] The Russian minister of defense and his Ukrainian  counterpart, who held negotiations in Sevastopol on the Black  Sea fleet, considered your participation in the talks to be  undesirable. Did you feel offended?    [Meshkov] I could feel personally offended, but this would  not be rational behavior. However, the situation looks  different if we perceive this event as an illustration of the  attitude toward Crimea's president. It is a requirement of  diplomatic protocol that defense ministers visiting some  administrative unit advise, at least its authorities, that they  are coming. However, even if the president of Crimea is shown  disrespect, it must be remembered that it is not possible to  show disrespect to the people who have elected him.</p>

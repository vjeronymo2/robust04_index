			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Major's exam search produces six results MR JOHN MAJOR took time off from the affairs of state at the weekend to check his school records. The result was a definitive announcement from his office about his O-levels - he has six. The news was delivered with a touch of resentment that the press had successfully harried a prime minister into crawling about in his attic looking for old examination certificates. There was acknowledgment, however, that suspicion of a hidden 'Schoolgate' scandal was threatening to eclipse the government's success in getting aid to the Kurds and abolishing the poll tax. So once Mr Neil Kinnock had set the record straight over his academic achievements - he has 8 O-levels, but for much of last week thought it was 6 or 7 - the prime minister had to do likewise. For those more interested in what Mr Major did 32 years ago than what his government is planning to do now, Downing Street's response to the 'silly speculation' of recent days was as follows. Mr Major left Rutlish Grammar in the spring of 1959 without exam passes. But he returned in June of that year and secured O-level passes in English Language, English Literature and History. He then added to those through correspondence courses, clocking up passes in Economics, Maths and British Constitution. That was before he passed his Institute of Bankers' examinations, also taken through a correspondence course.</p>

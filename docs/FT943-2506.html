			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Not nearly radical enough: Despite free-market reforms, India's economic upturn is modest rather than spectacular After three years of market reforms, the Indian economy is showing clear signs of revival. But the rebound could prove short-lived unless the government presses ahead with further restructuring. Industrialists in India are now more optimistic than at any time since Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, embarked on liberalisation in mid-1991. The monsoon was good. Industrial output is forging ahead and the Bombay Stock Exchange's index of leading stocks last week reached an all-time peak. Mr Anil Ambani, joint managing director of Reliance Industries, India's largest company, says: 'We are going to see massive investment growth this year.' But the upturn that is causing such excitement is as yet a modest recovery rather than an industrial take-off. The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, last week forecast the economy would grow by 5 per cent in the current financial year, ending in March 1995, up from 3.8 per cent. This is still short of the average 5.5 per cent achieved in the pre-reform 1980s and far below the growth rates of India's economic rivals in the developing world, notably China. 'We are so slow off the mark,' says Mr Hrishikesh Mafatlal, vice-chairman of Mafatlal Industries, a textiles-based conglomerate. 'I don't expect economic take-off . . . of between 7-9 per cent growth . . . in the next three or four years. It may come only 5-10 years out.' The immediate risk in such delay lies in the enormous expectations that Mr Rao's reforms have created among some financial investors. Stock prices have risen 80 per cent in a year, making Indian equities among the world's most expensive with an average multiple of price to 1993-94 earnings of 53. Bombay land prices have doubled in two years. Unless these investments produce real returns, prices could plunge. Certainly, India deserves credit for the progress it has made. After 40 years of economic self-reliance, the country is opening up to the outside world by cutting import duties, reforming the exchange rate and promoting exports and foreign investment. The 'licence raj', a panoply of industrial controls, has mostly been dismantled. In spite of a Rs40bn (Pounds 828m) securities scandal in 1992, when money was illegally siphoned out of banks into the stock market, financial deregulation has gone ahead. But Mr Rao has decided against further radical reforms, such as trimming bloated public-sector enterprises or amending labour laws which ensure jobs for life. With elections due in the next few months in 10 of India's 25 constituent states and a general election to be held by mid-1996, the prime minister wants to avoid electorally-unpopular decisions. Mr Rao believes that, unlike China or other authoritarian states, India cannot rush politically difficult reforms because it is a vibrant democracy. But the truth is that India's democracy may not be vibrant enough. Less than 30m people enjoy the jobs, pensions and other advantages of legally-protected employment in large-scale organisations. They and their families - about 150m people - are the main beneficiaries of the economic status quo. And politicians and bureaucrats are the ones who profit from the patronage that this allows. The rest of India's 890m people are largely excluded from the whole process. If their interests were better represented, the pace of reform might be quite different. Employers have said that if labour laws were more flexible, they would shed staff, but would also create new jobs. Even without restructuring of the organised sector, especially of public enterprises, the reforms are bearing fruit. Exports after two years of stagnation leapt 20 per cent in 1993-94. By June 1994, the government had approved foreign direct investments totalling Dollars 5bn. Foreign fund managers have invested about Dollars 5bn in the Indian stock market and in overseas issues made by Indian companies. Foreign exchange reserves have leapt from Dollars 1bn in mid-1991 to more than Dollars 17bn. Domestic companies are beginning to invest. Output of consumer goods started rising last year. Now capital goods production is rising. Industrial production in April jumped 8 per cent year-on-year. The central bank estimates that after three years of stagnation, private investment will rise 10 per cent in 1994-95. As Mr Amit Mitra, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, says: 'There's an unbelievable amount of energy in Indian industry now.' Moreover, partnerships between Indian and foreign companies are sprouting as never before, including, most recently, the announcement of a joint venture by Volkswagen, the German auto group, and Eicher, an Indian engineering conglomerate, to study building a Dollars 190m car factory. Yet, although India is playing host to more foreign businessmen than ever, there are worrying signs that the first rush of international enthusiasm may be waning. Export growth has slowed sharply since the end of March to an annual rate of 8.3 per cent for the four months to the end of July. Foreign investment approvals fell in the first six months of 1994 by 38 per cent to about Dollars 800m, compared with the same period last year. Foreign portfolio investment has also slowed in recent months. All these may be temporary blips, but they could also indicate some foreign companies are having second thoughts about the speed with which they wish to commit themselves to India. Their doubts reflect a concern that while India's reforms may be substantial and irreversible they may not have gone far enough. As Mr Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard University economist, said during a recent visit to New Delhi: 'India has made remarkable progress but it is only partial progress.' To convince the sceptics, India needs to ensure the bureaucrats' fingers are really being lifted from the levers of economic power. While many controls have been scrapped, the officials' desire to retain influence has not. In the power sector, for example, an outline policy for private investment in power stations was published two years ago, but the details are still being discussed in negotiations with would-be investors. Apart from the delays, this case-by-case approach creates scope for corruption. Similarly in telecommunications, a new policy ending the state's monopoly of basic services was announced four months ago, but crucial issues, such as tariffs, still remain to be settled. India's state-controlled industries and services account for about half the nation's capital, but produce only a quarter of its output. The government has sold minority stakes in public enterprises but refuses to embrace full-scale privatisation. As Mr Sachs points out, the experience of other countries shows that without privatisation other measures to make public enterprises efficient are usually futile. Ministers have made progress in liberalising the capital markets, including Indian companies' access to the euromarkets. However, they are reluctant to relax control of the banking industry. The state-owned banks, which dominate the market, are being allowed to raise private equity, but the government will retain a majority stake and stifle genuine competition. Finally, the government has not put its own financial house in order. After cuts in the first years of reform, public borrowing soared last year to cover a fiscal deficit equivalent to 7.3 per cent of gross domestic product. It is falling in 1994-95, but only slowly. Moreover, the burden of interest payments is rising - from 39 per cent of revenues in 1990-91 to 53 per cent in 1993-94, according to the RBI. Mr Rao has called his economic policy a middle way, but in some government circles it has become known as the muddle way. In an effort to steer a course between a free-market economy and maintaining a large public sector, he seems to have lost his sense of urgency.</p>

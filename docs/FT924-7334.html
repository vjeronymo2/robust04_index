			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Amstrad holders 'unlikely to do better than 30p' AMSTRAD shareholders should accept the 30p-a-share buy-out offer made by Mr Alan Sugar, Kleinwort Benson, financial adviser to the board of the computer and electronics company he founded, has recommended in the offer document. A report commissioned by Kleinwort from Touche Ross, Amstrad's auditor, warned that in the event of the company considering a voluntary liquidation shareholders would be unlikely to get materially more than 30p a share. Amstrad's net asset value was 46.3p per share at its June 30 financial year-end. Shareholders should also vote for the offer because Amstrad depended on the 'expertise and motivation' of Mr Sugar, Kleinwort said in the document posted yesterday. Mr Sugar planned to use a loan from Amstrad to finance part of the Pounds 112.7m purchase of the 66 per cent of the shares he does not own. This arrangement would be 'fair and reasonable' to shareholders, Kleinwort said. The document made it clear that dividends from Amstrad, once it was wholly owned by Mr Sugar, would help repay some of the loans used to finance the buy-out. If shareholders rejected the offer, there would be little prospect in the near future of Amstrad paying 'a significant regular dividend', Mr Sugar warned in the document. If shareholders accept the offer, the price would represent an annual rate of return of approximately 27.9 per cent for those who bought shares at Amstrad's 1980 flotation and subsequently took up his rights at the time of two scrip issues and a rights issue. However, if a shareholder bought nil paid rights at the time of Amstrad's rights issue and took up those rights, the annual rate of return reduces to about 8.6 per cent. Mr Sugar intends to turn Amshold, the Jersey holding company which he set up for the buy-out, into one of his main vehicles. In addition to holding the shares in Amstrad, it would hold Amprop, a property dealing company wholly owned by Mr Sugar and members of his family, as well as Tottenham Hotspur, in which he has a 47.8 per cent holding.</p>

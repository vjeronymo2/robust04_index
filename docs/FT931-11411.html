			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Bonn seeks full isolation of Belgrade GERMANY will ask the US to support a total isolation of Serbia as one of the few remaining options aimed at stopping the war in the former Yugoslavia. But it will not support a selective lifting of the arms embargo, even though Washington appears to be shifting its policy towards arming the Bosnian Moslem forces. The request, which will be made when Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister visits Mr Warren Christopher, his US counterpart, in Washington tomorrow, reflects the growing frustration and fears within Germany that Croatia and Serbia could be moving towards an all-out war. Foreign ministry officials in Bonn yesterday said they have asked President Tudjman of Croatia to stop his offensive into the demilitarised 'pink zones' of the republic. These straddle United Nations protectorates set up last year on Croatian territory seized by Serb forces. 'We want Tudjman to stop this offensive, even though we understand why he is doing it, and to accept an extension of the UN mandate in the republic. If not, then this could provoke the Yugoslav army into attacking Croatia. The pressure must be kept up on Serbia, but pressure should be imposed on Croatia as well,' a foreign ministry official said. Despite pressure from public opinion, both in the US and Germany, Mr Kinkel does not support arming the Bosnian Moslems. 'We would not go it alone in lifting the arms embargo,' an official said, adding that it would be difficult to see how more arms in the region would stop the war from spreading. Germany also recognises that the US will not commit ground troops as a means of lifting the siege off the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, impose a no-fly zone, which is 'fairly irrelevant by this stage', or back selected air strikes either in Bosnia, or Serbia. In Belgrade General Satish Nambiar, the commander of UN forces in the former Yugoslavia, yesterday said the renewed Serbo-Croat clashes had derailed the peace plan in Croatia but dismissed fears of a pull-out by the 14,000-strong peacekeeping force. 'We have gone back to square one. What we are engaged in now is damage limitation. We are trying to assure that the conflict does not spread,' he told reporters. Gen Nambiar suggested that the peacekeeping forces should have their mandate extended in order to deal with the situation on the ground.</p>

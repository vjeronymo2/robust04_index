			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Casio overcomes strong yen to jump 63% at halfway stage Casio, the Japanese manu-facturer of watches and calculators, reported a strong jump in non-consolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - in the first half, helped by buoyant demand for its electronic terminals and cost-cutting measures. Recurring profits increased 63 per cent to Y4.6bn (Dollars 46.83m) from Y2.8bn, while sales rose 5 per cent to Y166.6bn from Y158.5bn. Net profit rose 122 per cent to Y3.4bn, against Y1.6bn a year ago, and the company raised its interim dividend to Y12.5 from Y5.82. Casio said exports suffered from the high yen while domestic demand remained weak due to the continuing sluggishness of private capital spending. However, Casio had a number of successful products which helped it to avoid the worst effects of a difficult trading environment. Children's calculators, which incorporate a simple message transmission function and a function allowing users to draw pictures, were extremely popular. Growth in these products was nonetheless insufficient to make up for a fall in ordinary calculators. The watch division was also depressed by price competition in the market for basic watches, which overshadowed strong demand for telephone pagers. Data processing systems, such as liquid crystal display panels and products using LCDs, saw a sharp rise in demand which took sales for the division up 28 per cent. The business outlook remains uncertain as a result of the strong yen, and a recovery in the domestic market is expected to be moderate. Casio is forecasting a 6 per cent rise in sales for the full year to Y340bn from the previous Y322.2bn, a 63 per cent increase in recurring profits to Y12bn from Y7.4bn and a 42 per cent rise in net profits to Y7bn from Y4.9bn.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Business chiefs want decisive Tory win: FT survey indicates fear of sterling devaluation within ERM under Labour BRITAIN'S business leaders want a decisive Conservative victory on April 9, fearing that the election of a Labour government would lead to a falling pound and higher borrowing costs. In a survey of board-level executives conducted by MORI for the Financial Times, seven out of 10 predict that Mr Neil Kinnock's entry into Downing Street would be followed by a devaluation of sterling within the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Three-quarters of those surveyed believe that interest rates would rise. Only 49 per cent, however, say they are satisfied 'with the way the government is running the country'. Asked to say who would make the better chancellor, 46 per cent opt for Labour's Mr John Smith against the 39 per cent who prefer Mr Norman Lamont, the present incumbent. Some 8 out of 10 of the executives, drawn from many of the country's largest companies, say that an inconclusive election resulting in a coalition government would be bad for the country. A slightly smaller proportion - 6 out of 10 - added that such an outcome would also damage their business. The business leaders are not in buoyant mood; nor are they entirely happy with the present government. Instead, their responses underline deep concern about the impact of the recession. Only 29 per cent accept the Conservative claim that Mr John Major's return to Downing Street would speed up economic recovery. Nearly two-thirds believe that the prime minister's re-election would make little difference to the pace of any upturn. But the clearest message of the survey - published on the day that Mr Smith plans to unveil in his shadow Budget a range of measures to boost industrial investment and training - is that in the highly-charged atmosphere of a general election, the business community is unwilling to give public backing to Labour's economic strategy. Mr Smith has been joined repeatedly by Mr Kinnock in emphasising that a Labour government would not devalue sterling within the ERM. But the executives appear to have concluded that they would be unable to resist speculation against the pound. On overall economic management, 87 per cent say they prefer the Conservatives against only 3 per cent who are convinced by the alternatives offered by the main opposition party. Despite Mr Smith's promise of new tax incentives for investment projects - which he plans to spell out in detail today - a quarter of the respondents suggest their companies might reduce their investment spending if Labour were elected. Some 31 per cent say Mr Major's return to Downing Street would bring a rise in their companies' capital spending in Britain. The respondents to the survey - drawn from the FT top 500 companies - are avowedly Conservative supporters. Only 1 per cent of those surveyed plan to vote for the Labour party on April 9 against the 92 per cent who say they will back the Conservatives. Predictably perhaps, 93 per cent say that Mr Major would make a better prime minister than Mr Kinnock. Only Mr Smith among Labour holders of the main economic portfolios outpoints his opposite number. Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, both outpoint Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown, their respective shadows.

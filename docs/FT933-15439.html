			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Weak foods rally The expected downgrades in the food retail sector began in earnest yesterday as James Capel reduced its profits forecasts for the leading stocks. The gloom over the sector for the past six months deepened on Friday following a bearish statement accompanying Asda's results, which predicted tough trading conditions in the sector for several years to come, prompting a rethink on company profits by several brokers. Capel reduced its food price inflation figures over the next three years, with corresponding reductions in profits estimates for leading stocks. J. Sainsbury, Tesco, Argyll and Kwik Save forecasts were reduced by Pounds 10m for the current year. While the agency broker said the stream of negative news on the sector may inject some buying activity on weakness, it remained negative in the long term. Shares were also cheered belatedly yesterday on the back of Sainsbury's agm statement. It gained 2 to 456p, as did Tesco, to 209p. Asda shares slipped  1/4 to 62 1/4 p, while Argyll steadied at 313p. Kwik Save lost 6 to 715p.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Col. Georgiy Kostenko, academician, under "How </F> Should the Army of Ukraine Be?": "The General and the Lieutenant  Both Need Training, or on the Problems in the Formation of the  Staff Skills of the Officer Personnel of the Armed Forces"]    [Text] In analyzing and comparing World War II  documents, historians throughout the world note a high level of  staff skills of officers of the Red Army, which at that time  predetermined a common understanding of the orders and  directives from the supreme commander down to the platoon leader  and in our time a high readability of front documents. Approved  and crystallized in the battles of the Great Patriotic War,  staff skills have subsequently become that quality indicator  that defines the degree of professionalism of officers.    In the process of the development of the Armed Forces  of Ukraine, our officers have a unique opportunity not only to  bring their staff skills up to world standards but also to give  them a national coloring. Unfortunately, this is not happening.  The author of these lines, being chairman and member of  certification boards at different levels and also being involved  through the nature of his work in the study of official  documents, has reached an alarming conclusion: today it is  necessary to speak not only of the further improvement of staff  skills of officers of command and control agencies but also of  their partial restoration.    Staff skills are a constant factor that represents the  totality of theoretical knowledge and practical skills that the  officer needs to perform his official duties. This does not  contradict military art, which includes the theory and practice  of command and control of forces. In addition, regardless of the  position held, the staff skills of the officer are characterized  by system knowledge of questions having to do with his immediate  functions, by the continuous search for new knowledge and more  advanced practical skills within the limits of the position held  and for a step higher, and also by the possession of the means  to perform duties on the basis of interchangeability.    The qualitative indicators that best characterize the  genuine  staff skills of the officer are knowledge of the achievements of  contemporary military thought; the ability to collect and  analyze the necessary information in a timely manner and to make  the correct conclusions, proposals, and recommendations; and the  capability to comprehend adequately the intention of the  commander (chief) and ability to put his decision into effect  through means guaranteeing a common understanding by all  subordinates. Knowledge of the balance of secrets in his field  of professional interests makes it possible for the officer  dependably to keep secrets entrusted to him and not to overload  regime agencies with obsolete information. The lowering of staff  skills is a sign of the decline of the professionalism of the  officer, which is fraught with the danger of his performance of  official duties at an amateur level.    Each of the indicators enumerated above could be the subject  of a separate conversation. But the intention of the present  notes is to show the basic reason for the lowering of staff  skills and to propose a simple, effective, and inexpensive means  of improving them in the command and control agencies of all  levels. The assertion that it is possible to establish an  effective mechanism of military development in the absence of  the corresponding skills of the officers is the result of  incorrect thinking and profound error.    The lowering of staff skills is the result of a set of  objective and subjective reasons. And as bitter as it may be, it  should be recognized that the determining reason is the second  one, which is expressed in diminished interest in comtemporary  military theory. It is not difficult to see that inadequate  immersion in the theory of the subject is the basis for the  complex situations in which individual leaders find themselves  who try to carry out partial reforms outside of the state  program for the development of the armed forces. In the period  of intensive military development as one of the components of  the development of the state, knowledge of current theory of his  subject of professional interests is the basic indicator of the  staff skills of the officer and a criterion for the assessment  of his professionalism. Errors at the theoretical level lead in  practice to economic expenditures that are inadmissible for us  today.    The negligence of the command and control agency is the  other  side of the low staff skills of its officer personnel. I dare  express the unpopular idea that the responsibility for the poor  performance today must be assigned equally to the author of the  document and to the command agency that is directed to carry it  out. If for guidance use is made of a document wherein it is  impossible to clarify the content of the subject, then there is  no answer to the question: "What is to be done?" and, the main  thing, if there is no clear determination of the final result of  the activity, then such a document was based on negligence in  the planning stage. Personal conversations with the developers  of such schemes permit one to reach the depressing conclusion  that they have a negative attitude toward military theory as the  highest form of organization of military knowledge.    Is there an effective way to raise the staff skills of all  categories of officers? From 1979 through 1989, I carried out  investigations in the course of 46 operational-tactical,  command-staff, tactical, mobilization, testing, and experimental  exercises, including 9 with field firing. My conclusion is that  an exercise on any scale carried out without preliminary  theoretical preparation of the officer personnel comes close to  an experimental exercise not in form but in content and this is  the reason for its poor results. And there is another aspect of  such organization of exercises. To analyze exercises with  theoretically untrained personnel is ignorant from a pedagogical  point of view and immoral from an ethical point of view.    To raise staff skills, it is necessary to give back to  officer personnel their striving for in-depth theoretical  knowledge on the subject of their professional interests. For  this there is a simple, effective, and inexpensive  mechanism--preliminary conferences and seminars on the subject  of the pending exercises and training drills. Such a mechanism  is effective because of the consistent integration of theory and  practice and the possibility of approving the corresponding  theoretical positions under the conditions of Ukraine with their  subsequent adjustment and the refinement of existing plans.  Today this has one other rather important meaning. To begin an  exercise or training drill without preliminary theoretical study  of the theme is wasteful from an economic point of view and  useless from a juridical point of view, because in the near  future the conditions of contract service will prohibit taking  personnel out into the field without preliminary theoretical  training.    In the intervals between exercises and training drills,  up-to-date staff skills of the officer are developed through his  assimilation of the theory of the subject of his professional  interests in the process of daily creative labor and initiative.    In conclusion, I would like once again to stress that staff  skills can be raised only if the officers assimilate current  military theory. There is no other way.</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Arts: Goldoni's 'Clever Wife' - Teatro Della Corte, Genoa Last summer, when I visited Genoa's shining new Teatro della Corte for the first time, there was a not-quite-ready atmosphere about the hall: carpets not laid, some doors still not hung, the wall-covering not in place, bar not functioning; on stage, however, all went well, and the rare Victor Hugo play, Mille francs de recompense, was a deserved success. Now, a second visit to the theatre, after six months of operation, reveals a fully operative house in ordered, constant activity, in a position also to receive guests. This month finds the Teatro Stabile of Umbria in temporary residence, presenting Carlo Goldoni's seldom-seen play La moglie saggia in a thought-provoking production that makes us view the atypical work of the great 18th century dramatist in a new light (or perhaps, given certain aspects of the staging, it would be more accurate to say in a new darkness). Goldoni was a tireless worker. He wrote dozens of librettos, tragicomedies, an extended autobiography and a body of 116 plays, including many undisputed masterpieces. Though he has never been anything but popular in Italy, there was for many decades a tendency to concentrate on those masterpieces and leave the unexplored Goldoni alone. The interpretation of Goldoni, over the centuries, also became codified, stylised. Now and then a great artist - like the late Cesco Baseggio - could breathe life, wit, pathos, intensity into what had seemed stereotypes; but more often, and to most people, Goldoni meant wigs and buckled pumps, mincing and moues. Luchino Visconti and Giorgio Strehler discarded all that excess baggage and, after them, a new generation of producers - including Luca Ronconi - continued the process, both of reviving unknown Goldoni works and of presenting them in a fresh visual frame. A contemporary of Ronconi's, Giuseppe Patroni Griffi - himself a venturesome playwright - has taken a fresh, clinical look at La moglie saggia and has emphasised, with justification, its dark, even sinister nature, somewhat at the expense of the japery of the comic servants, an inescapable ingredient in Goldoni. The apparent story of the play is simple: a dissolute count has tired of his bourgeoise wife and is courting the eccentric Marchesa. When the wife cleverly puts the Marchesa in an intolerable social situation, forcing her to dismiss the count, he plans - and nearly achieves - his wife's murder. But the clever wife foils him, he admires her sagacity, and they are reunited while the Marchesa withdraws from the scene in defeat. Goldoni, in 1752, apparently considered this a happy ending, which was what his public demanded. But, as Patroni Griffi stages it, the ending is positively Strindbergian. The wife tells her feckless husband to love her 'because she is his' - his property - and they apparently settle to continue an unequal marriage, a pact. The concluding mood is resignation. After a near-murder alla Hitchcock (the glass of poisoned lemonade glows like the famous glass of milk in Notorious), in a gloomy, anonymous room, husband and wife and innamorata speak in passionless voices, as if the precedent, terribly proximity of death had drained them. This is a dark play, 'noir' indeed; but the sometimes excessively lugubrious lighting obscured also the work's meaning, vitiating Patroni Griffi's own concept. Thus in the splendid confrontation scene between the two women Anna Maria Guarnieri, the wife, in her black dress practically merged with the black drapery of the setting, and her facial expressions were, most of the time, illegible. We were watching a play of shadows. And since Guarnieri's tone was deliberately subdued (as opposed to the brilliant bravura of Ilaria Occhini as the mettlesome Marchesa), the confrontations were unequal. The title role was not the protagonist's. The Marchesa dominated the action. Goldoni was extremely alert to class distinctions. Characteristically, the bourgeoise-turned-countess speaks academic Italian, while her father, the merchant Pantalone, speaks exclusively Venetian dialect. The producer, also thanks to the appropriate costume by the excellent Gabriella Pescucci, cleverly gave Pantalone a Balzac appearance. Worried about his daughter's unhappiness, he also takes care to come to a shrewd financial settlement with his son-in-law. The daughter, however, rejects the agreement; clearly remaining a countess is more important than being rid of an unsatisfactory husband. The servants are the play's chorus, observantly critical of their employers, ready to exploit them, but also to imitate them. Thus the count's valet Brighella occasionally assumes tones echoing his master's arrogance and sexism. Giovanni Crippa was excellent as the servant, at once sly and ingenuous, matched by Anna Gualdo as his wife Corallina, devoted to her maltreated mistress but totally unwilling to follow her submissive example. Aldo Terlizzi's versatile sets, of agile curtains and columns helped the producer create a flowing performance, slowed only now and then by the unnecessary, protracted clowning of the two fawning parasites (the Florindo of Fabio Rusca was particularly repetitive and, finally, tedious) and the unfocussed bustle of the servants. Still, this Moglie saggia is a welcome revival of a difficult, forgotten, disturbing work by Italy's richest dramatist.</p>

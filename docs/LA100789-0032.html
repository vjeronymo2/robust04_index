			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EMERITUS COLLEGE AIDS SENIORS WITH CLASSES AIMED AT RETIREES  </P> <P> Thousands of students went back to school last month, marking America's  traditional September rite. Young people ranging from big-eyed kindergartners  to seasoned college seniors made their way through classroom doors.  </P> <P> Those enrolled at Emeritus College in Santa Monica may have a few years on such  students, but they seem to have as much enthusiasm. About 3,500 Southland  residents are enrolled in the state-financed adult education program of Santa  Monica College, sampling from 100 eclectic not-for-credit daytime classes.  </P> <P> Offering courses from Shakespeare and foreign policy to post-stroke exercise  and instruction in living with hearing loss, Emeritus College has some new  classes, new ideas and a new home.  </P> <P> Founded in 1974 by Santa Monica College President Richard Moore, the school has  just opened its first permanent facility on the renovated Third Street  Promenade after 14 years of makeshift classrooms in Santa Monica community  facilities and churches.  </P> <P> School director Maggie Hall says this has brought about a philosophical change  in the Emeritus program.  </P> <P> "In the past," she said, "we tried not to publicize the program too much  because we couldn't serve the students -- we didn't have enough locations. But  this year we decided to seek support from the city of Santa Monica to help us  grow, and they're paying for a third of the rent for our new buildings. We've  got 15 new classes, and new faculty members are coming in with excitement and  energy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Transition Period  </P> <P> Emeritus College was designed, Hall said, to ease the transition between work  and retirement. "People have certain specific life learning needs in later  years, and education helps them to cope with diminishing physical capacity and  financial resources. Our prime motive has always been to keep the older adult  integrated into the community with the mind working."  </P> <P> The program is specifically designed for senior citizens, and although most of  the students at Emeritus are retired and between 60 and 70 years old, there are  no age or residence restrictions. Most of the classes are free.  </P> <P> Teachers and students say the program provides a climate conducive to forming  friendships. Sylvia Rothschild, past president of the 34-member Emeritus  advisory board, who has taught a class in autobiography writing for 11 years,  said: "My students write about themselves and share experiences, and from  sharing they get to feel close. There have been wonderful relationships formed.  </P> <P> "Emeritus really satisfies a need so many people have for contact. It relieves  loneliness and makes them feel worthwhile. When you take a class, you feel like  you're going ahead with your life."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Like a Family'  </P> <P> Bill Elliott, who leads another class, the 25-member women's Lyric Chorus,  says: "The group is very close, like a family. It's ethnically diverse, the way  life should be, with people of every background, and we're all there because we  love to sing together."  </P> <P> Elliott, a former professional choral singer with the Fred Waring and Ray  Charles singers, took over the group in 1986. It frequently performs for local  nursing homes, church groups and civic organizations.  </P> <P> He believes the class helps build self-esteem. "I'm trying to show them how  good they are and that they can step into a more demanding situation," he says.  "We've just made our first record, and when they heard the playback, one of the  ladies said, 'Why, we don't sound old.' It was a big moment for them."  </P> <P> Ellie Mae Cramer, 68, veteran of at least 16 classes, ranging from band (she  plays trombone and baritone sax) to stress management, said: "When my husband  died I went into a very deep depression, and I would have committed suicide,  but my college supervisors got me started with classes. Now I can't learn  enough or get to school often enough, and I'm a different person. I never  believed there was this much to life." Cramer's new life has also included an  appearance on a senior citizen segment of KCBS' "Two on the Town."  </P> <P> Rita Bachtold, equally enthusiastic about her auto and home repair classes and  their teacher, Bonnie Kramer, said: "Her idea is that a woman can do everything  she sets her mind to."  </P> <P> "This is definitely not a playpen thing," said Harold Jaeger, 82, of his  Emeritus political science classes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Broad Range of People'  </P> <P> "There's participation in classes, and I never cease to be amazed at the depth  and breadth of experience in the groups," said Jaeger, a retired labor law  attorney. "We have a broad range of people who were active in fields like  finance, statecraft and other disciplines, and it makes for an interesting  exchange of views.  </P> <P> "In regard to getting some of these old fogies up off their duffs and out doing  things, I think Emeritus contributes to their longevity and desire to continue  living."  </P> <P> Jaeger is a member of the school's advisory board, which director Hall said has  always been an important element of the school. "Mostly it's made of community  senior activists who want to put their opinions into action. They make a lot of  excellent suggestions, and some of our new classes are a direct result of their  input," she said.  </P> <P> Hall interviews and selects the teachers, working with a Santa Monica College  committee. Teaching applicants must have a bachelor's or master's degree in  their subject area as well as experience teaching older adults and "a lot of  enthusiasm and energy."  </P> <P> "They're paid $30 an hour, and we've had several people who've donated their  salaries back to the college," she said.  </P> <P> Marriage and family counselor Ruth Dasche, an Emeritus teacher for five years,  is teaching four classes this year, including the popular "Psychodynamics of  Assertiveness."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Positive Changes'  </P> <P> She said: "My students generally want to learn three things: how to demand  respect from their doctors and nurses, how to say no to their friends, and how  to ask their children for what they want. They're proud and independent people,  not used to asking for help, and what they learn from me and each other assists  them in making positive changes in their lives."  </P> <P> Phillip Chandler is one instructor who needs no classroom. Now in his 13th year  of teaching horticulture at Emeritus, his Monday morning class meets in various  public and private parks and gardens all over Southern California. It is  popular with young horticulturists and landscape designers as well as seniors.  </P> <P> Chandler, a former UCLA and Los Angeles City College teacher, said, "We have  some noted garden designers in the class, some of whom began with my course  before they ever became professionals."  </P> <P> One star member of the class is eucalyptus expert Grace Heintz, 84, the author  of "Trees of the Pacific Palisades."  </P> <P> Heintz, a former teacher, recalled with a chuckle how she taught herself to  ride a bicycle at age 65 because it would be easier to ride around town  cataloguing trees. She makes presentations and identifies specimens for  botanical gardens and arboretums all over California. "Phil Chandler," she  says, "has been a godsend -- he's so knowledgeable."  </P></p>

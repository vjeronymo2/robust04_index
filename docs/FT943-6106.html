			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: Manulife buys Confederation unit Manufacturer Life of Canada, the personal life insurance group, is buying the domestic group life and health business of Confederation Life. The deal, signed with Confederation's liquidator, will give Manulife about 15 per cent of the domestic group market, up from 3 per cent and taking premium income to about CDollars 1.25bn (USDollars 913m) from CDollars 250m. Confederation's group business is mainly with corporations, including some of the country's biggest. Confederation was seized by federal regulators on August 11 after being caught in the commercial property market collapse. Its profitable UK unit was bought by Sun Life Canada and the US group business by Great-West. Mr Dominic d'Alessandro, Manulife president, said: 'We're buying something four times our size. It includes expertise, systems and people. We become a credible player in this market overnight.' Manulife, with CDollars 40bn assets, is Canada's second biggest life insurer. Last year it earned CDollars 187.3m on total premium income of CDollars 4.5bn.</p>

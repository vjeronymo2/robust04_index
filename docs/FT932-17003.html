Profits decreased from Pounds 5.03m to Pounds 4.06m in the six months to December 31, on turnover down from Pounds 87.6m to Pounds 80.2m. Earnings per share declined 17 per cent to 27.09p (32.64p).

Trading profits were halved from Pounds 2.29m to Pounds 1.54m, but that was cushioned by higher investment property income of Pounds 2.39m (Pounds 1.98m). Net interest receipts fell to Pounds 516,000 (Pounds 763,000). Looking ahead the group, which was one of the sector's better performing organisations throughout the recession, said 'prospects for building and civil engineering contracting remain poor.'

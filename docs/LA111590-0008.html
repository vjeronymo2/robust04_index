			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> THE TEMPO OF DOOM PICKS UP;  </P> <P> NO ONE SAID SANCTIONS WOULD WORK FAST, BUT THE WHITE HOUSE SEEMS DETERMINED NOT  TO WAIT.  </P> <P> Until last Sunday I'd never seen the Vietnam War memorial in Sacramento. The  bronze statues and reliefs are striking: a nurse bending over some poor fellow  who's just had his arm sawed off; a B-52 with 750-pounders trickling earthward  from its bomb doors; a GI reading, to judge from his expression, a Dear John  letter; a POW. The names of California's dead in that war run the circumference  of the memorial's outside walls. A parks worker was wiping the dust off them  with a swatch of newspaper, watched by three men who looked like Vietnam vets.  </P> <P> The day before, I'd read another call from Henry Kissinger for the United  States to go to war in the gulf, with bombers heading for Baghdad and those  "surgical strikes" that Kissinger loves to summon in his prose. Many of the  names on the wall in front of me belonged to men who died in Vietnam after  Richard Nixon came to power in 1969, Kissinger in tow.  </P> <P> I walked round to see if San Clemente, whence flowed some of the orders that  ended in those deaths, had paid human tribute to Nixon's and Kissinger's  concepts of national security and honor. There were two: "Lt. Whynaught,  Jeffrey L. 22" and "S.P.4 Goodman, Greg F. 22." One often forgets how young are  the soldiers sent to war. Whynaught and Goodman were senior to many of the  names around them, hundreds of boys in their late teens.  </P> <P> There's no doubt that the national sentiment now is not for war. In Congress  they say the mail from constituents is running 5-1 or 10-to-1 against. The  majority don't see the point of it, fear the consequences of it, yet many are  fatalistic. Send that big a force to the gulf, one often hears, and war is  bound to break out. The President and his secretary of state amplify the  rhetorical tempo of doom as they invoke the failure of sanctions "so far" and  claim the consensus of the world that stiffer measures are justified.  </P> <P> Little bits of news or gossip augment the sense of menacing buildup. A  newspaper in New Jersey reports that nurses in hospitals around Maguire Air  Force Base are being put on 24-hour alert to expect casualties; a White House  staffer tells a foreign journalist that one of the first targets of U.S.  bombers over Baghdad would be the satellite uplinks. They don't want footage of  carnage coming through on CNN, or real-time interviews with the Iraqi leaders.  </P> <P> Knowing that everyone knows there's no consensus at home, George Bush and James  Baker exaggerate the degree of consensus abroad. Put the self-interest of Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher and the British aside -- the Sabahs treat London as  their money center and are a big prop to the pound sterling -- and this  consensus is where it was in mid-August. Germany, France and the other Common  Market countries, plus the Soviets, support U.N. sanctions but as yet, nothing  further. The effort to alter Japan's constitution in order to send a token  force collapsed in failure. Turkey's prime minister stresses that Turkey is not  interested in being one launch point for attack.  </P> <P> In Egypt and Saudi Arabia, some now question whether it is in the Arab interest  to have Iraq devastated as it was by the Mongol Halagu in the 13th Century at  the fall of the Abbasid Caliphate. Such destruction -- called for by the  Kissinger war claque -- would leave Israel as the unchallenged military power  in the region, with Iran as a potential threat.  </P> <P> So there is no international agreement as yet for anything beyond the U.N.  sanctions, despite the huff-puff rhetoric from Baker, nor is there significance  in the suggestion that these sanctions are not working. At the time they were  first imposed the most optimistic timetable was, and still is, that Iraq would  come under serious pressure only by next February or March or maybe even later  in the year.  </P> <P> The timetable of the war party has always been brisk. Abuse of the War Powers  Act to launch a war the people don't want is best done swiftly, under cover of  darkness, as Kissinger well knows. The timetable of the peace party has always  been measured: adopt sanctions, enforce them, be open to negotiating proposals  that could settle the crisis without further violence, reduce the vast U.S.  ground deployment in Saudi Arabia and have any remainder under U.N. command.  </P> <P> Though there have been negotiating proposals and diplomatic opportunities, it's  amazing how Bush has wedged himself into the "no compromise" posture that cost  so many lives in Vietnam. If the voices of restraint here had been as powerful  in the early 1960s as they are today, those memorial walls in Sacramento and  Washington need never have been, and countless Vietnamese would still be alive.  Such voices should double in power now, lest new memorials be built tomorrow.  </P></p>

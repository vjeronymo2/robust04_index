			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 4 Feb (EFE and TELAM-SNI) -- The Argentine  Embassy in Yugoslavia has denied that Argentina sent weapons to  the Bosnian Muslims, as charged by the Serbian press, which, in  turn, based its information on a VOA broadcast.    "The Committee for the Control of Sensitive Exports and  Weapons has never permitted the sale of weapons to the countries  of the former Yugoslavia based on the fact that Argentina  strictly respects the UN resolution that prohibits such  activities," states the communique from the Argentine Embassy in  Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).    To avoid the spread of war in the Balkans, the United  Nations  prohibited, in September 1991, the sale of weapons to the  parties at war. However, during the eight months of the war in  Croatia and the 22 months of confrontations in Bosnia, the  Croatian forces and the Bosnian Muslims have clandestinely  obtained weapons to fight against the powerful Army of  Yugoslavia, a country which is currently made up of the  Republics of Serbia and Montenegro, and which inherited the  military arsenal from the government of Belgrade when the  Republic of Yugoslavia was dismembered.    The Argentine Embassy note refers to a commentary by U.S.  military expert Paul Beaver transmitted by the U.S. radio  station which included Argentina in a list of countries that  supplied weapons to the Muslim forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  openly violating the embargo imposed by the United Nations to  prevent the worsening of the Balkan conflict.</p>

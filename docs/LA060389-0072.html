			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MILACKI'S TURNABOUT IS FAIR PLAY; ORIOLES' STREAK HITS FIVE  </P> <P> Although Jeff Ballard has emerged as the ace who has ignited the Baltimore  Orioles' surprising drive to the top of the East, there was another young  pitcher the organization had higher hopes for.  </P> <P> And after a slow start, hard-throwing right-hander Bob Milacki is showing signs  of coming to the top.  </P> <P> Milacki gave up only two hits in 8 1/3 innings Friday night at Detroit as the  Orioles won their fifth in a row, 4-1, to tighten their grip on first place.  </P> <P> Milacki (3-5) gave up both hits, one a home run to Fred Lynn, in the fourth  inning, then retired 15 consecutive batters. Kevin Hickey came in after Milacki  issued his second walk with one out in the ninth and retired the last two  batters for his second save.  </P> <P> In his previous start Sunday against Cleveland, Milacki gave up two hits in  eight innings but lost, 1-0.  </P> <P> However, the Orioles made sure in the third inning that Milacki, who will turn  25 next month, didn't suffer from lack of support again. Larry Sheets singled  in the first run, Rene Gonzales singled in what proved to be the winning run  and Billy Ripken's double made it a three-run inning.  </P> <P> Gonzales was playing third base so that Manager Frank Robinson could let Craig  Worthington take another day off. Thursday night, Jim Traber, giving Randy  Milligan a night off, hit a three-run home run to spark the victory. Both  Worthington and Milligan have minor injuries.  </P> <P> Milacki spent four rather uneventful seasons in the lower minors in the  Baltimore organization. He had a stressful spring training last year -- his car  was stolen and he expected to be released at any moment. However, he developed  a change-up, and the Orioles sent him back to Charlotte (N.C) of the Southern  League for a last chance.  </P> <P> In a startling reversal of form, Milacki streaked through the minor league  system in 1988 with 15 victories. He closed out the season with two wins for  the Orioles.  </P> <P> When asked last fall if Milacki was for real, Robinson answered, "We'll find  out next season."  </P> <P> Said Robinson Friday: "What I like about Milacki is he can go out there and get  the ball over at any time. He's a pitcher. And this wasn't even his best  outing. He pitched better the last time out."  </P> <P> The Orioles are 28-22, the only team in the East this season that has been six  games over .500. Last year, after opening with 21 consecutive losses, the  Orioles didn't win their 28th until July 10. By that time they had lost 59 and  were 25 games out of first place.  </P> <P> Minnesota 8, Chicago 0 -- Manager Jeff Torborg is asking for patience with his  faltering White Sox. After they lost their club-record 10th consecutive home  game, maybe Torborg is having trouble with his own request.  </P> <P> A charter member of the American League, the White Sox had never lost more than  nine in a row at home. But Allan Anderson pitched a strong seven innings, and  the Twins breezed after scoring two runs in the first and two more in the  third.  </P> <P> The White Sox, who are 6-20 at home this season, have lost five in a row  overall and 12 of their last 13.  </P> <P> Carlton Fisk, out of the White Sox lineup since April 11 because of a broken  hand, returned and went 1 for 3.  </P> <P> New York 3, Milwaukee 2 -- Dave Righetti blew the save for rookie Clay Parker  in the eighth inning at Milwaukee but wound up getting the victory.  </P> <P> Pinch-hitter Tom Brookens singled in Steve Sax from third base with the winning  run in the 10th inning.  </P> <P> Righetti, who had not given up a run in his 14 previous appearances, came in  after Parker held the Brewers to four hits in seven innings.  </P> <P> A leadoff walk to Jim Gantner started the tying rally. Robin Yount's squeeze  bunt won it.  </P> <P> Righetti was shaky in the 10th, too. He loaded the bases with two out before  getting Greg Brock on a pop-up.  </P> <P> Toronto 7, Boston 2 -- Junior Felix got the first inside-the-park home run  against the Red Sox in Boston since 1973 to seal the victory.  </P> <P> Felix hit a line drive to the base of the wall in center, and when the ball  eluded Ellis Burks, he scored easily.  </P> <P> Texas 9, Seattle 5 -- Two sets of consecutive home runs at Seattle powered the  Rangers.  </P> <P> In the third inning Ruben Sierra and Julio Franco hit home runs, and in the  eighth, it was Chad Kreuter and Cecil Espy.  </P> <P> Cleveland 5, Oakland 3 -- Joe Carter hit a two-run homer, and Cory Snyder ended  a slump with a solo shot at Oakland.  </P> <P> Carney Lansford, leading the league with a .356 average, left the game after  five innings because of a strained left hamstring. Oakland already has lost  Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire, Walt Weiss, Glenn Hubbard, Storm Davis and Dennis  Eckersley to injuries for varying lengths of time this season. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

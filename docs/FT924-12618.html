			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / International Company News: Capital Cities/ABC rises 17% CAPITAL Cities/ABC, the US television and newspapers group that controls the ABC Television network, said third-quarter net profit rose to Dollars 62.16m, up from Dollars 53.96m a year ago, writes Alan Friedman. Earnings per share were Dollars 3.74, an increase of 17 per cent on the Dollars 3.21 recorded in the third quarter of 1991. Net revenues were effectively unchanged at Dollars 1.22bn. Many of the group's operations continue to be adversely affected by the US economy. Broadcasting revenues for the quarter were flat at Dollars 944.2m while operating income from broadcasting fell to Dollars 89.3m from Dollars 97.3m a year ago. Publishing revenues were 3 per cent better at Dollars 271m, while operating profits from this division rose to Dollars 36.2m from Dollars 31.7m. For the first nine months, Capital Cities/ABC had total net profits of Dollars 251.4m, a 5 per cent rise on the Dollars 240.3m of the same period last year. The results included a gain on the sale of its interest in a German television network, which was partly offset by losses on the disposal of commercial property in New York City and asset write-downs. The group's share price tumbled Dollars 7 5/8 to Dollars 422 1/4.</p>

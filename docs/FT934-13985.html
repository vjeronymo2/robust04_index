			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Avon Products steady at Dollars 54m AVON Products, the US cosmetics, toiletries and jewellery group, is confident that its fourth-quarter and full-year consolidated income and sales from continuing operations will increase, Reuter reports from New York. In spite of softness in some of its largest markets, mainly because of sluggish economic conditions, the group said its third-quarter results, announced yesterday, were a little better than anticipated. In the third quarter, Avon reported net income of Dollars 54m on a 2 per cent increase in sales to Dollars 957.1m. However, earnings per share were unchanged at 75 cents, on an increased number of shares. In the same period last year, Avon posted net income of Dollars 53.9m on revenues of Dollars 938.8m. Third-quarter earnings included a pre-tax gain of Dollars 8m, or 9 cents a share, on the sale of an asset. Avon said that this year's earnings were also helped by lower annual effective tax rate. It added that in spite of weakness in the US, it was confident that both fourth-quarter and full-year consolidated sales and income from continuing operations would show an improvement. Beckman Instruments, the US laboratory systems group, is restructuring and will reduce its worldwide workforce by more than 750 jobs, or about 11 per cent, AP-DJ reports. It will take a significant charge which will be specified in the fourth quarter of 1993.</p>

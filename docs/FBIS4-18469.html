			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Anti-Mafia Chief Calls For </F> Continued Battle"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 3 -- The new Italian government  to be formed following the recent general elections was advised  to strongly pursue the battle against organized crime in a  statement delivered by Bruno Siclari, the head of the National  Anti-Mafia Directorate, who raised the issue of electoral  campaign talk of tampering with legislation on state's witnesses.    Siclari spoke at the weekend of what he said were precise  signals being sent out by the Sicilian Mafia with reference to  the attempts of the Mafia's boss of bosses, Salvatore "Toto"  Riina, to discredit the testimony of gangsters who have turned  state's witnesses. Riina was captured in Palermo in January  last year after more than a decade at large, thanks largely to  information gathered from a Mafia informant, and is now on trial  in Palermo.    The anti-Mafia chief also mentioned recent demonstrations of  some 300 residents of a district of Messina, in Sicily, who  opposed the arrest of Sebastiano "Iano" Ferrara, described by  state's witnesses as a senior Mafia boss and by his neighbors as  a solid family man capable of keeping drug dealers out of his  area of the city.    Now, said Siclari, law enforcement officials are attempting  to understand "whether the new forces preparing to go into  government," the nation's rightist alignments under businessman  Silvio Berlusconi's Freedom Front banner, "have different  intentions, also on the basis of the fact that during the  electoral campaign the intention was shown, though it was vague,  of emptying the law on state's witnesses."    Any move in this direction, continued the prefect in a  television interview, would apparently be linked to "what is  happening in the Campania region with the proposal of some  Camorristi to disassociate themselves from their organization,  but not become state's witnesses."    "All this is to be seen as an attempt to remove themselves  from the responsibilities of the Mafia and the Camorra," the  name of organized crime in and around Naples and the Campania  region.    The head of the Anti-Mafia Directorate declared flatly, "It  is not possible to change the law on state's witnesses. This  must be kept firm and I hope that what was mentioned in the  electoral campaign was mentioned without any precise view of the  phenomena."    He also reiterated the point: "This is no time to give in.  If we should give in now, we'd be set back 50 years. The Mafia  and other forms of organized crime have always been based on the  concept that the state is not capable of keeping pressure on  them for long. And this is the first time the state has been  able to maintain strong pressure on organized crime. If we  again showed that we were not capable, we would really lose the  battle."    After sounding this warning, Siclari said it was his opinion  that the present Mafia strategy would not work and his hope that  the new political parties at the fore "will have the sense to  understanding that it is not possible for this to happen."</p>

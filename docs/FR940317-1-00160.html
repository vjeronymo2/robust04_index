Program Background and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Older Americans Act was first enacted in 1965 and was amended eleven times between 1965 and 1992. The President signed the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;375) on September 30, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 23, 1993, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, pursuant to the authority permitted by section 2 of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953, 42 U.S.C. 3501, and 5 U.S.C. 301, designated the position of Assistant Secretary for Aging to perform the duties and functions of the Commissioner of Aging. The term ``Commissioner'' will be used in these regulations, however, in order to comport with Public Law 102&hyph;375, which retains the title of Commissioner for the head of the Administration on Aging. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1992 amendments to the Older Americans Act reemphasize the intention of the Congress to target services and resources on the needs and problems of those older individuals identified as having the greatest economic need, the greatest social need, and those who are low-income minority. These amendments, for the first time, require that approval of the State plan be dependent on approval of the intrastate funding formula. The basis of these regulations are those provisions of the 1992 amendments to the Act that directly affect a State's intrastate funding formula and which: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Require the Commissioner on Aging under section 304(c) of the Act to approve a State's intrastate funding formula prior to the release of Title III funds; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Require State agencies under section 307(a)(33) of the Act to include descriptive statements about the intrastate funding formula's assumptions, goals, and outcomes based on the allocation of funds to each Planning and Service Area; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Require the Commissioner on Aging under section 305(a)(2)(C) to assist States in the development of their intrastate funding formulas by providing them with guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> II. Purpose of the NPRM <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Administration on Aging (AoA) is proposing to revise the current rules governing the State agencies' development and submission of an intrastate funding formula by providing new guidance and to amend the current rules affecting State plans and State plan submissions. These revisions are designed to be consistent with those provisions in the 1992 amendments to the Act that require greater targeting on those older individuals in greatest economic need, greatest social need, and low-income minority older individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1992 amendments to the Older Americans Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;375) now require States to submit their intrastate funding formulas to the Commissioner on Aging for approval, rather than only for review and comment, as was the case prior to the 1992 amendments. The amendments also require the Commissioner to provide guidance to States in the development of their intrastate funding formulas. AoA has interpreted the amendments to require that this guidance be in addition to the language contained in section 305(a)(2)(C) of the statute which requires State agencies to take into account the geographic distribution, greatest economic and greatest social need of older individuals in the development of their intrastate funding formulas. If the Commissioner does not approve the intrastate funding formula, a new requirement under section 304(c) requires the Commissioner to withhold the State's allotment of funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to comply with these new statutory requirements as well as address the intent of Congress that targeting services and resources on the needs and problems of those older individuals identified as having the greatest economic need, the greatest social need, and those who are low-income minority be accomplished through the intrastate funding formula, the Commissioner has developed standards for review and provided directions to a State agency on how to evaluate whether its formula meets those standards. The proposed regulations are designed to provide a State agency with flexibility to either maintain its current formula or, if necessary to allow for the development of a modified or new formula that addresses the requirements set out by Congress in section 305(a)(2)(C) of the Older Americans Act. These proposed regulations require that careful consideration be given to the geographic distribution of older individuals in the State, and the distribution among the planning and service areas of older individuals with greatest economic need and older individuals with greatest social need, with particular attention to low-income minority individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 304(c) now requires the Commissioner to withhold funds if the Commissioner does not approve a State's intrastate funding formula. In the course of developing these intrastate funding formulas, States are now required, under sections 305(a)(2)(C) and 305(d), to publish their intrastate funding formulas for review and comment by the public. This publication for review and comment must include: ``(1) A descriptive statement of the formula's assumptions and goals, and the application of the definitions of greatest economic or social need; (2) a numerical statement of the actual funding formula to be used; (3) a listing of the population, economic, and social data to be used for each planning and service area in the State; and (4) a demonstration of the allocation of funds, pursuant to the funding formula, to each planning and service area in the State.'' In addition, section 307(a)(33) now requires the State plan to include the statement and the demonstration required by paragraphs (2) and (4) of section 305(d), and provides that the Commissioner may not approve the State plan unless the Commissioner approves the statement and demonstration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of these new requirements, AoA believes it is of critical importance that States have as much time as possible to review their current intrastate funding formulas, and, if necessary, modify them or develop new formulas; to consult with area agencies as required in section 305(a)(2)(C); to publish their plans for review and comment as required in section 305(d); and to seek and obtain legislation or legislative approval prior to submitting the formulas for approval, if necessary. To ensure that States have the time to accomplish these steps, AoA is publishing this NPRM separately from, and in advance of, its notice of other rules being developed in response to the 1992 amendments to the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> III.

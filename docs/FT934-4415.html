			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Kmart confirms sale of PayLess chain for Dollars 1bn Kmart, the second biggest US retailer, yesterday confirmed plans to sell its PayLess drug store chain to a company controlled by Leonard Green &amp; Partners, a Los Angeles investment firm, for more than Dollars 1bn. The purchaser, TCH Corporation, will pay Kmart Dollars 592m in cash and assume Dollars 170m worth of debt. The remainder will take the form of 47 per cent of TCH's equity and Dollars 100m worth of subordinated debt securities. Kmart said it was putting a value on the TCH equity, but preliminary estimates suggested the transaction could result in a Dollars 100m after-tax charge in the current financial year. Kmart is selling the PayLess chain in line with its strategy of shedding specialty retailing businesses to concentrate on its core discount store operations. Last month it announced that most of its 113 Pace warehouse clubs would be sold to Wal-Mart, and the rest of them closed. The company has also indicated it was considering selling stakes in its Sports Authority sporting goods stores, Borders book stores, OfficeMax office supply stores and Builders Square home improvement stores through initial public offerings. TCH Corporation owns two drug store operations: Thrifty Drug Stores, with 494 drug stores in California, and Bi-Mart Corporation, a membership discount drug and general merchandise chain with 41 stores based in Oregon.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A landlord whose White Plains, N.Y., boardinghouse was gutted by a fire that  killed eight people was convicted of criminally negligent homicide because the  building failed to meet safety standards. State Supreme Court Justice Nicholas  Colabella convicted Frank Thomas, 67, of New Rochelle of two counts but  acquitted him of five additional counts. He had dismissed an eighth count  earlier. Colabella's verdict came after a two-week, non-jury trial in New York  state's trial-level court. A fire door was missing in the boardinghouse, and  the front door was secured by a double dead-bolt lock, which required a key  from the inside to open. Thomas was convicted on the two counts in the deaths  of Abraham Wilson, 52, and Allen Piroleau, 61, whose bodies were found by the  door they could not open. The Jan. 15 blaze began in the basement of the  building through a resident's careless smoking.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev today arrived  in Rostov-on-Don to begin his three-day visit to North Caucasus.    [Correspondent A.Murtazin -- identified by caption] With the  changes in geopolitical realities, southern Russian has become a  border region, hence the need for suitable combat-ready troops.    [Begin Grachev recording] Along with Transcaucasia, North  Caucasus is a priority region for us at the moment. We need to  create a strong district manned with strong mobile and  land-based forces which are properly armed. [end recording]    [Murtazin] From the airport the minister went on to the  military cantonment where construction of apartments for the  army officers withdrawn from Germany has been under way for four  months now. In accordance with the agreement on troop  withdrawals, the construction is financed by the German side.  Bulgarian and Russian workers are employed. By the end of this  year 1,548 apartments will be built.    Also today the minister visited the 22d Special Purpose  Troops Brigade transferred here from Baku two years ago. During  their first winter here these servicemen had to live in tents in  the open country. Now their barracks are ready. Soon many of  them will be moving into new apartments.</p>

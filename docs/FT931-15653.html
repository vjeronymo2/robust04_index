			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Change proposed for workplace childcare PROVISION of childcare by employers remains scarce, but there may be a trend towards targeting it according to the needs of the business, the independent research group Incomes Data Services suggests. Its study of 22 organisations says many employers allocate childcare places on a first-come-first-served basis. It points out that this has drawbacks: 'Nursery provision is expensive and only a limited number of places will be available. From the employer's viewpoint it is preferable to target this expensive benefit where it would have the most impact.' The study says Midland Bank allocates nursery places according to staff skills while Sainsbury, the supermarket chain, gives priority to retail staff. Employers also look at social factors such as the needs of single or disabled parents. IDS says that employers have a variety of approaches, which 'range from full-scale workplace nurseries and childcare allowances to holiday playschemes for school-age children and some referral services to help working parents identify suitable childcare facilities'.

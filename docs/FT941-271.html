			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (4): Friendship and an equal partnership - British-Indian relations are being rebuilt on new foundations The Royal Yacht, anchored at Bombay last November, was a potent symbol of the changes in Britain and India during this century, and in the relationship between the two. Far from being an emblem of empire, the Britannia was an instrument of business. Parties and seminars on board were attended by 1,400 people, including 300 visiting British businessmen, and contracts worth Pounds 1.2bn were signed. The week in Bombay was the highlight of the first year of the Indo-British Partnership Initiative, an unusually energetic and close exercise in boosting bilateral trade and investment which has already produced significant results. Meeting last month in London, Mr John Major and Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the British and Indian prime ministers, decided to extend the initiative. Since India gained independence from British rule in 1947, relations had been 'friendly but distant,' according to British officials. Apart from the awkwardness inevitable between former imperial power and subject state, India had opted for Jawaharlal Nehru's brand of self-sufficiency and socialism, which led it to be much closer to Moscow than to the west. By 1991, however, India found itself having to face a new world. The Soviet orbit, which had been a central element of its foreign policy as well as its foreign trade, had disintegrated. And despite sporadic, half-hearted attempts at reform, its economy had finally slipped into a crisis which threatened financial collapse similar to Latin America's in 1982, but in a country of nearly 900m, many of whom already lived in poverty. When Mr Major visited India in January 1993, Britain desperately needed to boost export orders for British companies to help it out of a long recession. The government in New Delhi had shown surprising determination to shape a new economic structure. Mr Major, guest of honour at the annual Republic Day ceremonies, decided to make his visit into a high-powered trade mission from which sprang the IBPI. The visit crystallised a dramatic improvement in bilateral relations, furthered by a rapid series of ministerial visits. Britain's home secretary, foreign secretary, Lord Chancellor, trade minister and others have all been India's guests and, in addition to Mr Narasimha Rao, ministers including Mr Manmohan Singh, architect of economic reform, have visited London. Virtually all such visits over the past year have included activities connected with the IBPI. Mr Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas, was asked to lead the British side. His Indian counterpart is Mr Jamshed Irani, managing director of Tata Iron &amp; Steel. The two men asked other business leaders to become patrons of the IBPI - making it essentially a private sector-driven exercise but with strong governmental involvement on both sides. Among the patrons are to be found British companies which already had considerable experience in India - cumulative UK investment in India is estimated at about pounds 2bn - and those which are at the forefront of UK export efforts around the world, such as GEC Alsthom, Cable &amp; Wireless and British Aerospace. On the Indian side are giants such as Ashok Leyland and Bajaj Auto, as well as companies with old UK links such as Dunlop India, Hindustan Lever and Williamson Magor. The Confederations of British and Indian Industry are both patrons. In addition to several missions of business people to Britain and to India, the IBPI has done considerable work on identifying business opportunities for British industry in individual Indian sectors, such as power generation, agro-food processing, manufacturing technology and communications, financial services and infrastructure. If the IBPI simply brought together the biggest companies, however, it would have limited value since many of their top executives on both sides were already well attuned to the opportunities afforded by India's decision to open its economy. An important purpose has been to raise awareness among smaller and medium-sized companies with less extensive experience. The IBPI says nearly 1,000 British companies have attended its seminar programme on doing business with India, and that 2,000 people visited British technology exhibitions in Bombay and Bangalore. Mr Irani, in a report to the prime ministers, said: 'The IBPI has been a truly unique process, and has been successful in making Britain aware of the 'new' India, bringing with it new opportunities. On the other side, India has become far more aware of British capabilities, technologies and competitiveness.' Bilateral trade, and British investment in India have increased substantially over the past year, although it would be difficult to estimate how much of the gains have been due directly to the IBPI. British exports to India grew 20 per cent in 1993 to Pounds 1.13bn, and Indian exports to Britain rose 26 per cent to Pounds 1.09bn. In 1991, new British investment in India was virtually at a standstill at only Pounds 7m. In 1992 it rose to Pounds 26m, and last year approvals jumped to Pounds 139m, made up of more than 170 new collaborations. The deals done so far vary widely. The biggest are in power generation, which also offers the best potential for British companies in the future. Rolls-Royce Power Generation Systems signed three contracts in November to build power stations worth a total of Pounds 660m, and in March another Rolls-Royce subsidiary, Peebles Electric, signed a technology transfer agreement under which Kirloskar Electric of Bangalore will be able to build transformers. GEC, which had already been involved in a number of agreements, signed a memorandum of understanding in March under which it will build a 1,000MW coal-fired power station in Maharashtra state, and will have a Dollars 100m equity stake. National Power, PowerGen and National Grid have also signed contracts. Other industries in which UK investment deals have been signed include liquor, construction, leisure, finance and aerospace. A number of British companies, including Cadbury Schweppes, Coats Viyella, Reckitt &amp; Colman, Glaxo, Bush Boake Allen, BP and Castrol have increased their stakes in Indian subsidiaries from the previous permitted limit of 40 per cent up to 51 per cent. Among interesting joint ventures is the planned refurbishment of Moscow's old market region by Apollo Enterprises of India in partnership with Bovis of the UK. Clearly, the IBPI can by no means take the credit for all recent Indo-British transactions. But it does provide a useful framework for companies and, importantly, focuses the attention of companies and governments on the impediments to business as well as the opportunities. The British side is most concerned about intellectual property rights, high tax rates and custom duties, labour laws, bureaucracy and exchange controls  -all issues which have been widely identified both inside and outside India as vital for the government in Delhi to address. The Indian side worries about the cost of British technology, equipment and services. It is also concerned that 'there is a preference among British companies for specific contracts rather than long-term investment in India, for new-build rather than refurbishment and for sales to India rather than joint manufacturing ventures,' according to the IBPI report to prime ministers. There are also problems with textile exports to the UK because of sudden changes in quota classifications. For the next year, the IBPI plans to continue its work but to make it more sector-specific, to reach more companies and to encourage greater participation by non-resident Indians. The private sector leaders believe ministerial involvement is important and that India's economic reform programme must continue. 'Faster and simpler negotiating and approval procedures would enable agreements to be realised more quickly,' the leaders said, adding that commercial disputes should be resolved more quickly in the courts. Underlining the belief of the participants in the success of the IBPI, Mr Irani and Mr Evans wrote: 'Although India and Britain have special links which have given the IBPI a unique aspect, there is no reason why it should not be a model for relations between either India or Britain and other trading partners.'</p>

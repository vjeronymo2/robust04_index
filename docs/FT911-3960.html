			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Observer: Mr Major's memory aid Honest John Major continues to be haunted by his past. No sooner has the little matter of his O-levels been sorted out than the hair-shirted folk at the World Development Movement have dug up another embarrassing piece of paper. They have found to their delight that Britain's prime minister replied to one of their questionnaires in 1983 saying he 'hoped' Britain would achieve the UN's aid-spending target of 0.7 per cent of economic output within five years. It would have meant more than doubling the UK's current Pounds 1.7bn budget. The WDM hand-out brigade are hoping that Major is made of more compassionate stuff than his predecessor. The movement's director, John Mitchell, soon to become a World Bank fat cat, says Major is clearly aware of the needs of the Kurds, the 27m Africans threatened by famine, and the suffering and untimely deaths of millions of others elsewhere. The embarrassing revelation has been timed to coincide with a less than complimentary OECD biennial review of British aid policy. Over the last decade the UK has slipped from being the most generous aid donor among the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, to the second meanest. 'We will be watching Major closely, hoping he keeps his word,' says Ann Clwyd, Labour's aid spokesperson. Of course, if the Tories lose the next election, it will be up to Labour to show that its commitment to the UN target is more reliable.</p>

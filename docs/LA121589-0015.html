			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN'S SURVIVORS GET $450,000 IN VERDICT OF DOCTOR NEGLIGENCE  </P> <P> A Van Nuys Superior Court jury Thursday awarded $450,000 to the widow and three  sons of a man who died after a surgeon at Medical Center of North Hollywood  allegedly failed to promptly treat a gunshot wound.  </P> <P> The jury found Dr. Patrick A. Tripe guilty of negligence in the Dec. 18, 1983,  death of Jesus Rocha, 42, of Sunland. Tripe was the surgeon on call at the  hospital when Rocha died.  </P> <P> Medical Center of North Hollywood two weeks ago agreed to pay $100,000 to  Rocha's survivors in an out-of-court settlement, said Superior Court Judge  Robert M. Letteau, in whose court the case was heard.  </P> <P> Paramedics rushed Rocha to the hospital after he was struck by a bullet from a  passing car in a North Hollywood parking lot while Christmas shopping with his  wife.  </P> <P> James J. Armstrong, attorney for Rocha's widow, Marta, and sons, Pierre,  Enrique and Jesus Jr., told jurors that Tripe took 41 minutes to get to the  hospital and then failed to order blood or make other efforts to save Rocha's  life.  </P> <P> Armstrong said Rocha called for help and tried to disconnect emergency  equipment so he could leave the hospital because he feared the quality of  treatment he was receiving.  </P> <P> Tripe was overheard by paramedics and other hospital personnel repeatedly  asking if Rocha had insurance, Armstrong alleged. Rocha, who worked as an  orderly at two hospitals, did have insurance, Armstrong said.  </P> <P> Tripe's attorney, Julius Wachs, denied any negligence. He contended that Tripe  arrived at the hospital within 25 minutes of being called but was unable to  save Rocha because the man had already gone into cardiac and respiratory  arrest.  </P></p>

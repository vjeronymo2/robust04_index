			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Clinton revives US law to fight Japanese trade curbs President Clinton last night signed an executive order resurrecting the Super 301 provision of US trade law, which allows him to impose sanctions on countries with unacceptable trade barriers. The new Super 301 is largely aimed at Japan and comes in the wake of last month's summit at which the US failed to persuade Tokyo to adopt measurable targets on market-opening progress. 'This action will help us reach our objective: open markets that will create better jobs and increase wages at home and abroad,' Mr Clinton said. The US president telephoned Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, to warn him of the announcement. Mr Clinton, who has sought to bolster Mr Hosokawa's reform efforts while putting him under pressure on trade, described the phone call as a 'friendly, forthright discussion'. 'We are not looking to start a war, but we are looking to establish some fairness,' Mr Clinton's spokeswoman Ms Dee Dee Myers said yesterday. Unilateral US efforts are strongly resented by some of its trading partners and yesterday foreign reaction to the re-imposition of Super 301 was sharp. Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), criticised US policy towards Japan as 'misguided and dangerous'. Mr Hideaki Kumano, Japan's vice-minister of international trade and industry, said: 'Such a unilateral approach to solving trade disputes will result in a shrinkage of world trade.' Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade minister, said it was 'disappointing' the US had decided on this action. The new 301, renewed for two years, sets a schedule that could give Japan several more months to institute regulatory reforms before sanctions are threatened. It requires the administration to list countries it considers practise unfair trade, and establishes a formal negotiating process of up to 18 months. The process begins on March 31 with release of the national trade estimates report detailing foreign trade barriers. On September 30, the trade representative will identify 'priority foreign practices' - the most serious trade barriers. Three weeks later he can institute Section 301 complaints against those practices. Cases covered by multilateral rules will be settled under Gatt. The rest will be subject to US law - consultation, negotiation and sanctions, if necessary. The six month period March 31 is considered an 'early warning system'. Mr Hosokawa pledged that his government would concentrate on the trade dispute and the ailing domestic economy. A wrangle within his seven-party coalition bodes ill for any solution to the Japan-US dispute because it marks a reduction in the influence of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's backroom strategist, who was playing an increasingly important role in seeking a compromise with Washington.

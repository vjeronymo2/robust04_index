			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] As the Rwandese Patriotic Army continues its  campaign against the forces of dictatorship, the town of Byumba  has fallen to the Rwandese Patriotic Army [RPA]. The soldiers  from the government forces have been flushed out and they are  now fleeing in disarray.    The Rwandese Patriotic Army has also liberated the whole of  Mutara area and part of (Buganza). In this area the Rwandese  Patriotic Army has taken an important road junction of Kayonza  and from here the RPA has taken control of the road leading to  Rusumo in Tanzania and the Kakitumba Road in Uganda. The only  getaway to the outside world now accessible to the government  forces comes through Burundi and Zaire. Ruhengeri town has been  sieged by the Rwandese Patriotic Army and the government forces  may be flushed out any time.    And in Kigali, fighting continues between the RPA and the  government forces. The Rwandese Patriotic Army has taken a  number of strategic areas in and around Kigali. The RPA in  Kigali is mainly preoccupied with rescuing people who are being  hunted down by the Presidential Guards. [passage omitted]    The campaign by the RPA continues.</p>

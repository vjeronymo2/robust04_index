			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and The Family: Where value comes first - Joanna Slaughter on Boyton Financial Services. Fourth of a series The 1986 Financial Services Act, which spells out the industry's system of regulation, is not every independent financial adviser's favourite piece of legislation. But Richard Boyton identifies it as the turning point in his career. Boyton, founder of the Essex-based firm Boyton Financial Services, entered the industry in 1965 but says: 'After the FSA, I saw that the world was a changing place and that it was no good playing Canute and waiting for the water to come to us. The legislation made us focus on where we spent our time and where we were profitable. 'The public wanted change, and we took the decision that we would be fee-charging. I saw our role here as being a niche player, not all things to all men but doing certain things better than most.' Boyton's office is a Queen Anne house in the village of Castle Hedingham. The business is staffed tightly and he confesses to being a workaholic. He believes that fee-charging IFAs stand or fall by their ability to give their clients added value. 'That is what we are providing. The reason why people get fed up with their solicitor, accountant or adviser is because they see that value patently hasn't been added.' In the past two years, Boyton has lost 29 clients - five of them died - but has taken on 538 new execution-only and advisory customers. He will not quote a figure for funds under management, as he has not decided if the total should include money invested through the firm's execution-only service, business expansion schemes, or even cash on deposit. 'A more relevant figure is the new money flowing into the organisation,' he says, 'and the present rate of new funds is Pounds 1.5m-2.5m a month.' Boyton believes that clients' costs should be controlled as rigorously as his own. He does not think, for instance, that they need always go to Castle Hedingham. He explains: 'We don't deter clients from coming to see us. But if you write and say you want to be a client, we can do that on the telephone. With a meeting, you are looking at spending something like Pounds 280 plus value added tax on something that I know I can do in 10 minutes.' Nor does he give prospective clients a free first interview, arguing that the cost of this special offer inevitably is borne by existing clients. 'If you are giving your time for free, you must be making it up somewhere else,' he points out. Boyton finds that new clients 'tend to be very wary and sceptical of the advisers they have seen in the past. l tell them that I don't trust anyone, either, and that they will get everything in writing. And I tell them that if they are not happy with what is suggested, they should not do it.' The firm offers a comprehensive financial planning service, including advice on pensions and school fee plans. Last year, Boyton established a joint venture with Mcintyre Stuart, a Cambridge chartered accountancy firm, to help clients with their tax returns. He believes, however, that investment management is the firm's pivotal role. 'What we are about is running assets. You can be a rotten planner but, if the portfolio has performed, the client will love you. It is performance, performance, performance.' One big success was investing in the Gartmore Emerging Pacific investment trust in 1992 and selling it just over a year later, making gains of more than 250 per cent. Time spent on a client's affairs is monitored scrupulously, with fees ranging from Pounds 38 to Pounds 140 an hour (excluding VAT). Clients can decide whether to offset any commissions that arise against their fees, or use them to enhance their investment. Either way, Boyton wants their decision in writing. There is no minimum investment. Boyton says: 'The minimum portfolio is not dependent upon size. It is a question of whether the client is prepared to pay fees. We can actually operate for small sums of money if the client tells us what he wants.' There is an execution-only service for those who require no hand-holding and a fund watch service that alerts clients to UK and international launches. But the heart of the firm centres on its investment advisory and consultancy service. This is driven by an in-house data base that can analyse 11,500 institutional funds, and Boyton has links with a number of investment houses and stockbrokers. Where appropriate, advice will also embrace gilts, National Savings and permanent interest-bearing shares. There is no annual management fee for the investment management service; instead, it works rather like a bank budget account. Boyton says: 'We calculate what we think we will spend, looking at the portfolio. We then calculate how much we will spend on specific advice. Clients pay monthly, by standing order, and once a year we look at our estimates and adjust them.' Clients who have opted for the service get six-monthly valuations and are contacted 'when we think the portfolio needs to be rearranged, either because assets are fully valued or because an opportunity to buy under-valued assets has arisen.' Boyton's investment approach appears painstakingly disciplined. He imposes performance parameters on each investment monitored, and acts when there is any movement outside these. 'I'm lethal about cutting losses. I never run them.' He adds: 'We don't always get it right, but what we are looking to do is to get it more right than wrong. We are not paid to lose clients' money.'  --------------------------------------------------------------------                          THE INDEPENDENTS  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Name of financial adviser:              Boyton Financial Services Ltd Address of head office:           PO Box 14, Halstead, Essex, C09 4DY Date firm was established:                    1973; incorporated 1983 Regulator:                                                     FIMBRA Funds under management:                               No figure given Number of clients:                   3,000 (including execution only) Number of offices:                                                  1 Minimum investment accepted:                               No minimum Financial services offered:                 Investment management and                                      comprehensive financial planning Fees:                     Pounds 38-Pounds 140 an hour, excluding VAT  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

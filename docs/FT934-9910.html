			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Beijing ready to soften line in talks on Hong Kong CHINA has indicated a willingness to agree to some of the plans of Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, for the colony's political development but London and Beijing remain far apart on his proposals to increase democracy. It was understood yesterday that Chinese officials had suggested at a meeting with Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador in Beijing, that they might be ready to accept Mr Patten's proposals on voting age and methods, and possibly on local government election procedures. The suggestion, which could be seen as the first sign of movement by Beijing towards an agreement, was communicated to Sir Robin last week after the 15th round of Anglo-Chinese talks on Hong Kong's political development. Sir Robin is leading the British side in the talks which have dragged on for six months with little sign of progress. The latest Chinese offer has not been formally made and Hong Kong officials fear it may be designed simply to muddy the waters ahead of tomorrow's meeting in London of British ministers and officials to decide UK policy on Hong Kong. According to one Hong Kong official: 'It is chicken feed. It has been dangled before us. They have not given anything yet.' A cabinet sub-committee will be chaired by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and attended by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, Mr Patten and Sir Robin. Mr Patten said that the meeting would be a stock-taking exercise which would plot strategy and tactics for future talks with China. Details of China's latest suggestion have not been disclosed but it is understood to include Chinese agreement to reduce the voting age in the colony to 18 from 21 and possible agreement to dispense with appointed officials at local government level. Mr Patten's proposals for political development include direct election of all members of district boards from next year. The Chinese also hinted to Sir Robin that the 20 Legislative Council (LegCo) seats which are to be decided by popular vote could be elected on the basis of one-person-one-vote in single-member constituencies, in line with Mr Patten's proposals. However, the Chinese government is implacably opposed to Britain's attempt to broaden the franchise for the other 40 seats which will constitute the 1995 LegCo. For 30 of these seats, known as 'functional constituencies' which represent business and professional groups, Britain wants to expand the franchise by changing the method of election. It wants the individuals who constitute the groups to vote rather than corporate bodies. China wants to retain corporate voting which it calls a matter of 'principle'. The remaining 10 seats will be selected by an electoral college. Britain has compromised by agreeing a structure to the electoral college similar to that set down in Beijing's Basic Law - its constitution for Hong Kong after sovereignty passes from Britain to China in 1997 - but wants the members of the electoral college to be themselves elected. Beijing favours a form of election close to that used in China where 12 specially selected candidates are offered for election and the college chooses 10.

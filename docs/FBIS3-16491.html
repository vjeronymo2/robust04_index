This was said by Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk at a meeting with Ukrainian and foreign journalists  today in Kiev. He characterized the actions by Yuriy Meshkov as  contradictory to the basic law of our state. At the same time,  Leonid Kravchuk reiterated that during his personal meeting with  the Crimean president, he proposed to the latter that they hold  close contacts and take preliminary steps to sort things out in  Crimea. Meshkov, however, claims that the president of Ukraine  did not adhere to the agreements, and issued an edict on holding  a referendum. By the way, even the autonomous Central Election  Commission expressed hope that he would bring the documents in  line with Crimean legislation. All responsibility for any  possible complications will fall upon Mr. Meshkov, stressed  Leonid Kravchuk.</p>

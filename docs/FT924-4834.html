			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: German banks buy Chartered West LB WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank Girozentrale (WestLB) and the Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank (SudwestLB), two of Germany's leading public sector banks, are paying Standard Chartered Pounds 26.3m (Dollars 39.75m) to buy the 50 per cent stake in Chartered WestLB which they do not already own. The London-based Chartered WestLB, which specialises in pan-European corporate finance, was founded in 1989 out of the combination of Standard Chartered's merchant banking activities with those of WestLB, one of Germany's biggest and most aggressive banks. A few months later, SudwestLB took a stake in the new venture. The two German institutions said the purchase would enable them to expand Chartered WestLB's merchant banking activities and to integrate the common businesses more effectively. The sale of the stake would allow Standard Chartered to concentrate on its core commercial banking business, the statement said. Chartered WestLB, which apart from its London headquarters has branches in Berlin and Dusseldorf, home of WestLB, is active in advisory business, mergers and acquisitions, project, export and special finance. At the end of last year its balance sheet assets stood at Pounds 1.7bn and for 1991 it made an after-tax profit of Pounds 14.6m, which it is expecting to match in the current year. The existing worldwide co-operation agreement between the two German banks and Standard Chartered will not be affected, although in future the main area of co-operation would be foreign commercial business, they said yesterday.</p>

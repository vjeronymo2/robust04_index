And it is  possible that it will escalate at any time.    Russia decided on March 3 to reduce its natural gas supply  to  Ukraine, which, Russia says, owes a large amount of money for  previous supplies.    And Russia threatened to totally stop the supply of gas if  Ukraine fails to pay the debt within five days.    That threat still exists, although Russia agreed to extend  the time limit to April 10 after urgent negotiations.    Russia is Ukraine's biggest supplier of natural gas,  essential to Ukrainian industry. And 60 percent of the  country's natural gas comes from Russia annually.    However, Ukraine cannot pay the debt due to its domestic  economic crisis and the soaring price of gas provided by Russia.  Under the circumstances, it is buying most of its natural gas  on credit.    The Russian Government cancelled a state loan to Ukraine  because of their strained relations. According to Russian  statistics, Ukraine now owes Russia 1.5 trillion rubles.    The dispute was triggered by Turkmenistan, another important  source of energy for Ukraine, when Turkmenistan decided to  discontinue supplying 77.8 million metric meters of natural gas  daily, thus worsening Ukraine's energy crisis.    The lack of natural gas has forced 40 to 45 of the 110  generating units in Ukraine's thermal power plant to stop  operations. And many Ukrainian industries have suffered a heavy  blow by the lack of natural gas and electricity.    National industrial production decreased by 7.4 percent in  1993. And it dropped 32.7 percent in January against the same  period last year.    On the surface, Russia has the right to ask Ukraine to repay  its debt. But in fact, Russia asking for the money at this time  conveys deep economic and political significance.    Exports of natural gas to Western Europe have always been an  important channel for Russia to earn foreign currency. But 95  percent of its exports must be carried through gas pipes across  ukraine, for which Russia must pay a great deal.    Therefore, Russia's threat to cut off the gas supply is  usually met by Ukraine threatening to cut off the pipelines.  And Moscow is worried by the fact that Kiev could intercept  their gas exports at any time.    In addition, Kiev has many underground storehouses to  preserve natural gas for emergency use in case Moscow  discontinues the supply.    Russia must control the pipelines in order to defeat Ukraine  in this dispute.    So it was suggested during negotiations held on March 10  that  Ukraine pay part of the debt with cash and part with shares of  its gas facilities. It has been reported that Russia insisted  on obtaining 51 percent of the shares, thus controlling the  pipelines. This was refused by Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk.    But Ukraine has agreed to pay its debt of about 370 million  U.S. dollars to Russia this year with cash.    Moscow's request for debt payment appears to be politically  motivated.    It is no coincidence that on March 3, when Russia decided to  reduce the gas supply, Kravchuk was visiting the United States,  which is trying to improve relations with Ukraine, and giving  economic and political support to the former Soviet republic.    Worried by the possibility that its influence over Ukraine  will lessen as the country approaches Western nations, Russia  took action on the gas supply to warn Kiev not to harm Russian  interests.    Meanwhile, pro-Russia forces in eastern Ukraine and  nationalists in western Ukraine are both busy preparing for the  upcoming parliamentary elections. The new parliament will play  an important role in the development of ties between the two  countries.    The "KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA" newspaper said Russia raised the  issue of gas supplies at this time in order to back the  pro-Russia forces and create for itself a favorable political  environment in neighboring countries.    This dispute not only has strained economic relations  between  the two countries but also cast a shadow over Ukraine's smooth  implementation of the nuclear disarmament treaty.    The Ukrainian president, while visiting the U.S., said that  the gas supply was not only a question of economics, but also  involved many other issues.    He added that if Ukrainian industries were closed because of  a lack of natural gas, the nuclear disarmament process would be  harmed.    Kiev also accuses Moscow of owing pipeline transportation  fees of about 100 million U.S. dollars, and it does not rule out  the possibility of retaliation once Russia cuts off the supply.    Under these circumstances, this controversy is likely to be  long lasting, regardless of any progress which may be achieved  in the next round of talks.    And the issue will be used by Russia as a way to control  economic and political relations between the two countries, and  to gain concessions on other disputes such as the Black Sea  Fleet, the division of ex-Soviet Union overseas properties and  the Crimea issue.</p>

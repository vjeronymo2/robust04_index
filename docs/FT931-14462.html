			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Russian managers given warning MR Boris Fedorov, the new Russian deputy prime minister in charge of the economy and finance, yesterday warned Russian industrialists that those managers who did not improve their companies' performance would be fired and replaced. Mr Fedorov, now the senior government economic minister, stressed that the new government must crack down much harder on inflation and on the budget deficit than the previous government of Mr Yegor Gaidar. He said that Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the new prime minister, and his team - largely inherited from Mr Gaidar - would be 'more decisive in the battle against inflation'. In a direct criticism of Mr Gaidar, he said: 'The Gaidar government was repeatedly accused of having a rigid monetary policy - but it did not. Billions of roubles were poured into the economy.' A decree backed by Mr Chernomyrdin and signed by him on the last day of 1992 to control prices by extending profit controls on enterprises producing essential foodstuffs had, he said, been rendered null and void. 'This government will not try to extend controls on prices.' The measures to be taken to restructure Russia's vast and generally inefficient state sector appear to conform to the ideas put up by some industrialists for a more active industrial policy by the state. This line was endorsed by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, the Congress of People's Deputies in December and, in a more muted fashion, by Mr Gaidar himself. Promising strong measures to combat unlimited credit advances to the companies, Mr Fedorov said: 'If the state supports enterprises, it has the right to get assurances that they will not exceed the resources given. Where the companies are state property it is the privilege of the state to reorganise those companies and to replace these managers accustomed to live an easy life by lobbying for credits.' Such a policy, he said, would mean that 'you do not need to close enterprises'. However, he did not rule out bankruptcies of companies and said that a 'bankruptcy agency' would be probably created to oversee those companies which were no longer viable. Acknowledging that there were serious differences between the government and the Russian central bank, he said that Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, would join the committee on credit policy set up under Mr Gaidar to attempt to control the Bank's credit advances - an obvious attempt to rein back the chairman. Mr Fedorov said that the central bank's job was to 'strengthen the rouble, not keep up production'. The bank should not, he said, relieve the enterprises of their debt burden by paying off the accumulated debt every six months.</p>

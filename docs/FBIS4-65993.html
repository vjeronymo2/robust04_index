			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, May 26 (AFP) -- The next round of Bosnia  peace talks between the republic's warring parties and the  four-way international contact group will take place June 6 and  7 in Talloires, southeast France, a diplomatic source said  Thursday [26 May].    Two days of talks on a ceasefire and a territorial division  of Bosnia wound up in Talloires Thursday. The source close to  the talks said they had made some progress.    "It was neither a failure nor a success, but we did not  expect significant progress," the same source said.    In Talloires, a diplomat close to the talks said Thursday  that the European, United Nations, U.S. and Russian negotiators  were ready to try to impose a territorial solution on the  warring parties, presumably by threatening to withdraw  peacekeeping forces from Bosnia if the new territorial plan was  rejected.    But a Croat press source earlier the Moslems and Bosnian  Croats were ready to negotiate on the basis of the European  Union territorial division plan, earmarking 51 percent of the  republic for the new Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent for  the Bosnian Serb side.</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Japan The muted response of the markets to Japan's general election suggests that investors were already braced for the political horse-trading which now looks certain. One unanswered question is whether the government which emerges will have sufficient authority to take an economic lead. The downward lurch in the stock market which followed the Liberal Democrats' defeat in parliament last month reflected the waning chances of further fiscal stimulus this year. With no clear winner at the ballot box, investors have little reason to revise that opinion. The economic news in the run-up to the election has been far from encouraging. Industrial production and retail sales figures have cast doubt on the view that the recession has bottomed. Yesterday's money supply figures seem to offer more hope, but broad money growth is being driven by public sector institutions. Lending by private sector banks remains weak. Unless the yen's upward march on the foreign exchange market is thrown into quick reverse, Japanese companies under pressure at home will find scant relief in export markets. If the run of bad economic data - and a period of populist campaigning - has forged a political consensus on the need for further stimulus, the chances of another spending package this year can have only improved. Now the LDP is weakened, tax cuts may be thrown into the policy pot. Yet with the composition of government now wide open the markets may have to settle in for drift.</p>

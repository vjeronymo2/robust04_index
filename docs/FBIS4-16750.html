			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary of the Day" by Nikolay Kishkin: "Decisions </F> Made To Strengthen Commonwealth. The Question Is, How They Will  Look in Practice"]    [Text] How many times have we, after the latest meeting of  the CIS heads of state, received with ineradicable hope the  agreements reached. True, we have just as often found that, as  a rule, they do not work out as planned, or else actually sink  without trace. It is no accident that the question of  guarantees of the fulfillment of adopted decisions was  persistently raised at the summit's concluding press conference,  held on Friday [15 April]. It cannot be said that Boris  Yeltsin's reply sounded very optimistic; he said that the  Council of Heads of State is "not a plant administration in  which hard-and-fast decisions are adopted"; rather the heads of  state outline a general framework of joint intentions. All the  same, the heads of state agreed to monitor the discipline of the  fulfillment of decisions adopted since the formation of the CIS.  Better than nothing, as they say...    Marked dissatisfaction with the efficiency of the  Commonwealth's functioning had been expressed in the proposal to  create a Eurasian union recently put forward by [Kazakhstan  President] Nursultan Nazarbayev. This idea was expected to  receive some kind of development at the Moscow summit, but this  did not happen. The Kazakhstani president himself did not come  to the meeting, and his fellow heads of state did not discuss  the proposal. Judging by the contacts which journalists have  had with them in the lobbies, the idea has so far been cooly  received. [Uzbekistan President] Islam Karimov, for example,  said that it is devoid of practical content and the CIS should  not be abandoned in midstream. Nevertheless, the Kazakhstani  representative stated that the republic would present a  comprehensive program for a new alliance at the next summit  meeting.    However, the CIS' reserves of strength are not yet  exhausted,  as the Moscow meeting showed. Above all, a number of questions  aimed at the practical realization of the treaty of economic  union were examined. Ukraine acceded to it as an associate  member. An Economic Union Commission was set up -- true, so far  just as an expert working organ. No less important is the  agreement on the creation of a free trade zone, in line with  which customs duties, taxes, and nontariff restrictions in  mutual trade between the CIS countries will be gradually lifted.  If this accord proves not to have been a waste of time, it  could have significant impact. This is effectively the  beginning of the juridical formulation of a single trading area,  which will also be more attractive for our "more distant"  foreign partners, who will accept the CIS free trade zone as a  single international economic subject.    At the meeting in Moscow the issue of securing the CIS'  external borders, which had been under examination for several  months, was successfully resolved. A joint memorandum on the  participation of CIS member countries in guarding external  borders in the Central Asian region has now been signed, as has  a similar memorandum involving Ukraine and Belorussia [Belarus].  Moldavia [Moldova] is also to accede to this memorandum. In  this way the unified system of border security is being restored.    In the bilateral meetings which took place during the Moscow  summit let us note the accord between Boris Yeltsin and Leonid  Kravchuk on the future of the Black Sea Fleet, which they  decided to share in the proportions of 15-20 percent for  Ukraine, and the rest for Russia. But this is only a framework  decision. An agreement on the parameters of this distribution  has still to be prepared. Judging by the first reactions and by  how it is being interpreted by some people in Ukraine,  everything will not be so straightforward.    The Moscow summit saw Moldavia's full inclusion in the work  of the CIS, which now embraces 12 states -- the whole of the  former Union except for the Baltic countries. Boris Yeltsin  assessed its prospects as follows: "Despite the difficulties  encountered in the formation of the Commonwealth, it can be  firmly stated that we are now going ahead on the road of  developing and intensifying integration processes."</p>

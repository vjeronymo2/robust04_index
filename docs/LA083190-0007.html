			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO  </P> <P> A 25-year-old man who drove his car into two men outside a bar, killing one of  them, was sentenced Thursday to 15 years to life in state prison.  </P> <P> Ruben Guzman Valle of Escondido also was ordered to pay $6,000 in funeral  expenses to the family of Alfredo Chavez Sandoval, 33, who watched the  sentencing by San Diego Superior Court Judge William Mudd.  </P> <P> Guzman pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the March 20 incident outside  a Southeast San Diego bar. He earlier had been involved in a dispute with the  two men over a woman inside the bar.  </P> <P> Guzman's attorney, Wayne Gomez, told the judge the defendant had no  recollection of what had occurred that night.  </P> <P> Although Guzman had been drinking and had cocaine in his system, the judge  remarked that the defendant probably knew what was happening. "All of this over  some misunderstanding in a bar," Mudd said.  </P> <P> Injured in the same incident was Cirenio Samano, 34, who suffered a broken leg,  but did not appear at the sentencing.  </P> <P> Before his arrest, Guzman was a cook at a Rancho Bernardo seafood restaurant.  </P></p>

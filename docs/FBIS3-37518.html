			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, 16 Feb--It was reported by the Defense  Ministry's press center that a meeting took place between Army  General Vitaliy Radetskyy, Ukrainian defense minister, and  foreign states' ambassadors accredited to Ukraine. The defense  minister stressed that Ukraine was a peaceful state, and the  numerical strength of its Armed Forces would gradually decrease.  Radetskyy added that Ukraine would actively take part in  tackling European security issues. As for the conflict in the  former Yugoslavia, he spoke in favor of its peaceful settlement.    On the subject of the Black Sea Fleet, the defense minister  said Ukraine primarily needed to make an inventory of the Black  Sea Fleet's property as of December 1991 [date as received].  This work could be done by an interstate commission with the  participation of independent experts and observers. The next  stage should be reducing the fleet's existing group of forces,  which now is a burden both for Ukraine and Russia. Putting  these measures into practice, in Radetskyy's view, will prompt  what to do with the Black Sea Fleet in the long run. As for the  main base of the Ukrainian Navy, it is and will be in Sevastopol.</p>

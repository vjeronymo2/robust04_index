			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Kurds prepare for election without a state / A report on a process that some view as a luxury but which takes the 'safe haven' in northern Iraq a step closer to a society IT IS forbidden, according to a notice outside the village of Barzan, to kill wild animals, cut down trees or use dynamite to go fishing. If this is the evidence of how life for Iraq's Kurds is returning to normal, then the 6ft phosphor bomb casing close by is a reminder of just how fragile that rehabilitation remains. A year ago forces of the anti-Iraq coalition entered north Iraq to create a 'safe haven' for the Kurds. Now Massoud Barzani, aged 46, the shy rebel leader, is taking the process one step further as the region under rebel control since the allies withdrew in July prepares for elections for a local assembly on May 17. The Kurds, thanks in large part to the continued allied security umbrella, control more territory than at any time since their struggle for political autonomy began in the 1960s. For all that, they have still to resolve their political future. The poll may well prove a less than perfect exercise in democracy. Many Kurds are still more influenced by the colour of a candidate's waist band than anything said on the stump. None the less the process marks a symbolic transition for Mr Barzani from guerrilla leader to modern-day politician and provides a mandate to rebuild the society. In Dohuk and other towns, the old Iraqi municipal rubbish trucks can be seen sweeping the streets - with the hot summer months approaching this was seen as a health priority rather than evidence of a new found civic pride. A six-month Iraqi blockade has all but paralysed public services. Fuel is in short supply. Aid workers believe the blockade was deliberately timed to coincide with the planting season. As a result there could be a serious grain shortfall. On top of this the eight-party Kurdish Front is hamstrung by political division. The Front has singly failed to stop some of its owns politicians from stripping now disused government projects of hydraulic and other equipment and trucking it to the Iranian border. Any new administration will have to tackle these problems. For three decades the Kurds have suffered unimaginable horrors - from the gas attacks at Halabja, to the systematic destruction of up 4,000 villages by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's forces and the deaths of untold thousands in the government's relocation scheme in 1988, the story of which is only now being pieced together. Turkey, or at least the Turkish military, also remains suspicious of Kurdish intentions. Bombing raids over north Iraq, ostensibly aimed at Turkey's own Kurdish rebels, have inflicted civilian casualties according to aid workers. At Barzan the bomb casing was provided as the evidence. Last Saturday, Barzani and the other Front party leaders each submitted 100 names to stand for a local administration of this disputed corner of Iraq. The main election contest will be between Mr Barzani's Kurdish Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Mam or Uncle Jalal Talabani. A third force will be provided by the so-called Tribal society - former Kurdish militias of Saddam Hussein - the jash or donkeys as they were known. As son of Mustafa Barzani the revered tribal Kurdish nationalist who founded the movement and whose image today adorns almost every street corner in North Iraq, Mr Barzani commands huge support. Mr Barzani is himself no less a proven guerrilla leader. Burnt-out tanks on the Selahaddin road bear testimony to his bravery when last April he held the Iraqi advance at bay with just 59 of his personal bodyguard. But his style is quiet, his authority underpinned by a pragmatism which other Kurdish politicians lack. Victory for him would represent a mandate to return to Baghdad to revive the stalled negotiations on autonomy in a bid to end the current stalemate. The election may seem something of a luxury. The technology deployed also seems somewhat misplaced, with guerrilla leaders already familiar with satellite dishes and fax machines in their mountain hideouts, now smiling from their own television channels, from transmitters seized during the uprising. Television is of course vital to the success of the campaign, not so much in Kurdistan but in Europe and the US where policy towards the Kurds owes much to western media coverage. It is one of the striking features of north Iraq that so many of the political posters are in English, in anticipation perhaps of the influx of foreign journalists. Indeed many seem to echo the legal phrases of UN resolution 688, which for the first time mentioned the Kurds by name and which to many Kurds represents a moral commitment on the part of western governments. The United Nations has given its implicit backing to the elections as have the Kurds' friends in the West - the main reason for Mr Barzani's swing through European capitals last month. Recently, in the latest bizarre twist of its year-long run-in with the regime in Baghdad, the UN sanctions committee gave permission for the shipment of 2.5m voting slips, 10,000 stamp pads and 150 litres of indelible ink, describing it as 'an essential civilian need'. It is a phrase with which few Kurds would argue.</p>

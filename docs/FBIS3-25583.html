Guy] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg Feb 23 SAPA -- African National  Congress [ANC] leader Nelson Mandela told visiting Organisation  of African Unity [OAU] Secretary-General Dr Salim Ahmed Salim on  Wednesday [23 February] not to underestimate the threat the  right-wing posed to the election process.    Speaking at a joint press conference, Mr Mandela told  reporters their meeting had been short because he had a "very  important" appointment in Pretoria at 10.30 AM. He would not  divulge further details.    Referring again to his meeting with the OAU chief, Mr  Mandela  said he had stressed to him that dialogue was the ANC's most  important weapon in dealing with the right-wing.    Dr Salim said the OAU would enhance its team that will  observe the April elections.    Mr Mandela said: "If there's one organisation that has fully  supported our struggle, it's the OAU."</p>

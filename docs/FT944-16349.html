			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Golds help S Africa to recoup losses Johannesburg recovered part of Tuesday's hefty losses as the market found support from firmer world equities and a mild bullion price recovery. However, dealers said that sentiment remained nervous as the gold price was unconvincing and the financial rand continued to pressure rand prices of shares. The overall index advanced 34 to 5,583, golds put on 17 at 2,282 and industrials moved ahead 16 to 6,261. Lehman Brothers has added South African equities, particularly gold miners, to its model portfolio with a 2 per cent weight, taking funds from France and Switzerland. In yesterday's trading, De Beers added R1.75 at R99.75, Anglos rose R4 to R231 and Gencor picked up 50 cents to R14.30 after Tuesday's sharp losses. SAB moved ahead R1.75 to R85.75 and Sasol firmed 10 cents to R35.75.</p>

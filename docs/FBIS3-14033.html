			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irshad Mehdmood: "Panorama of Militancy in </F> Kashmir"]    [Text] The year 1993 will be remembered as an important  one. During this year, while the freedom fighters won some  glorious battles, they also faced heavy losses. They have to  bear the misfortune of the martyrdom of their commanders. During  the beginning of last year, India sent additional military  forces to Kashmir. The leader of the Border Security Forces,  Chander Prakash, made an interesting comment about the presence  of these forces in Kashmir in an interview. He said that in the  jungles and mountains, where even the sun's rays are not seen,  our soldiers are busy in rebellion.    At the beginning of this year, Hizb-ul Mujaheddin's  commander, General Shaib, was killed by the Indian forces in  Srinagar. In addition, Nasir-ul Islam, leader of Jumiat-ul  Mujaheddin; Maqbul Ilahi, leader of Hizb-ul Mujaheddin; and  Shamash-ul Haq, the acting supreme commander, were also killed.  All in all, the most important members of nearly all the freedom  fighting organizations were either killed or arrested. These  include: Khalid Gibran, Sajjad Ahmed Mir, Jaffar Jamali, Maulana  Ilias, Jamal Afghani, Akbar Bhai and Abdulmajid Sheikh.  Al-Jihad's commander-in-chief, Sheikh Abdulaziz, Muslim  Mujaheddin's Master Ahsan Dar, and Dukhtran Millat's leader  Aasia Inderabi were also arrested at one or the other time.    In addition to the arrests and killings, the Indian armed  forces started burning various areas in Kashmir to put  additional pressure on the freedom fighters. Sopore is one  region where everyone has rebelled against India for the last 45  years. A large number of freedom fighters are members of  different organizations in this region. According to the Indian  communications media, this area had become a "little Pakistan"  that housed a strong camp of the freedom fighters during this  movement. The hold of the freedom fighters on Sopore has been so  strong that the Indian armed forces could never enter here. When  they tried to attack Sopore at the beginning of the year, the  freedom fighters not only made the military forces suffer heavy  losses, but also took away their weapons and ammunition. Later,  the mujaheddin had an exhibition of these weapons and ammunition  which was viewed by thousands of people. Taking over Sopore  became a major problem for the Indian forces. The top leadership  of the army decided that instead of fighting the mujaheddin in  Sopore, they would turn Sopore to ashes. Finally, on 6 January,  they set this area on fire and cooled their fire of revenge this  way. Yet, the people of Sopore began to help the mujaheddin even  more, raising Pakistan's green flag over every house. The  mujaheddin openly celebrated Pakistan's freedom on 14 August.  The Hizb-ul Mujaheddin transferred the Pakistani flag to their  headquarters in Srinagar. What is worse, even the prominent  Indian magazine INDIA TODAY had to admit that Sopore is the  capital of the pro-Pakistan group. The Indian forces, after long  determined planning, decided that they would stop only after  destroying Sopore. On the night of 26 December, the Border  Security Force and other paramilitary forces joined the Indian  army and attacked Sopore. About 150,000 soldiers surrounded  Sopore and also received enforcement from the Air Force. Still,  the mujaheddin counterattacked with strong force. As a result,  the Indian forces had to retreat, and the defeated enemy,  demonstrating its traditional "bravery," burned cities, towns,  and mosques and crushed them under their tanks. Sayyed  Salahuddin ordered the mujaheddin to vacate Sopore temporarily.  The next day, dozens of mujaheds who had participated in the  battle returned to the base camp in Azad Kashmir [Pakistan].    This movement was also hurt by the arrest of popular female  leader Aasia Inderabi. She had organized Kashmiri women and  supported the mujaheddin. The role the women are playing in this  movement is unprecedented in the history of the freedom struggle.    Since 1989, several mujahed organizations have been active  in  Kashmir. These organizations have played an important role in  this jihad and in organizing attacks on Indian forces. Among  these organizations, the largest is Hizb-ul Mujaheddin. It  follows a military structure and is the only organization that  has influence statewide. Most of the activities in Kashmir are  carried out by the members of this organization. In 1990, this  group blew up the original structure of the Wooler Barge,  causing billions of rupees in damage to it. Similarly, in the  last part of 1990, it led a successful attack on India's former  core commander and governor's advisor General Zaki, in which he  was wounded. Similarly, on 24 January 1992, Hizb blasted a bomb  at the police headquarters in Srinagar. It took the jihad from  the narrow confines of the valley to Jammu and Laddakh. In 1992,  Shamsher Khan, a Hizb commander, controlled Doda for several  hours.    The Hizb-ul Mujaheddin has invited mujaheddin from all over  the world to Kashmir, welcoming them warmly on their arrival.  They are declared "guest mujaheds." In addition to Azad Kashmir,  mujaheddin from hundreds of other countries are guest mujaheds  in Kashmir. The supreme commander of Hizb is Sayyed Salahuddin,  who lived in Azad Kashmir for a few months in 1991. Indian  military experts believe that if Hizb is removed from the  military platform of Kashmir, things would be easier for India.  The Hizb calls prominent Kashmiri leader Sayyed Ali Gailani its  patron leader. At present, 70 percent of jihad activities are  done by Hizb members. The Hizb has the honor of being the  largest and best organized of the groups.    Liberation Front--It is true that the Front started militant  activity in the valley. The Front got a lot of publicity when it  abducted Rubiya Sayyed. This group was established by Ishfaq  Mujeed Wani, Abdul Mujeed Sheikh, and Mohammed Yasin Malik.  Except for Yasin Malik, the other two leaders have been killed.  At present, the leader of the Front is Javed Ahmed Mir, while  Amanullah Khan in Azad Kashmir is the chairman. The Front is  composed of anti-Pakistan elements. Many of its leaders have  declared Pakistan and India equal enemies of Kashmir. The Front  took the political path instead of militancy. Therefore, it was  not involved in any militant activity during the last year.    The al-Jihad is a sub-group of the People's League. The  Muslim Janbaz Force and the Jihad Force are playing an important  role in the Kashmir jihad. Prominent philosopher and politician  Mohammed Farooq Rehmani and Sayyed Shabeer Ahmed Shah are the  leaders of the People's League. These two leaders learned about  fighting for Kashmir's independence from their cradles.  Unfortunately, however, both of them went their separate ways  because of mutual differences. The influence of this  organization extends all over the valley; however, the Farooq  Rehmani's group Janbaz Force is especially strong in Bandi Pura  and Bara Mula.    In addition to these organizations, Ikhwan-ul Musalmoon,  Alumar Mujaheddin, Jumiat-ul Mujaheddin, Tehrik-ul Mujaheddin,  Harkat-ul Mujaheddin, Muslim Mujaheddin, and Hizb Allah are also  active in the jihad efforts. All of these organizations support  Islam and Pakistan.    These organizations agree on the following point for joining  Pakistan: India is our common enemy; therefore, all efforts  should be made to be free of Indian clutches.    A decision about Kashmir's future should be made according  to  UN resolutions, by holding a plebiscite. All have to agree to  joining Pakistan and forming an Islamic government.    The real participants in the militant activity in Kashmir  are  those anonymous mujaheddin, whose names, deeds, and positions no  one knows save Allah.  *</p>

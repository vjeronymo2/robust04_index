			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Exchanges wary of dollar The dollar was fairly stable on foreign exchanges yesterday, although sentiment towards the US currency remains negative, writes Philip Gawith. The market shrugged off a very positive set of March trade figures, and the dollar closed in London at DM1.6551, from DM1.6596 on Wednesday. Against the yen, the dollar finished firmer at Y104.065 from Y103.665, helped by positive comments about the possible resumption of US-Japan trade talks. In New York the US currency ended at DM1.6577 and Y104.25. Elsewhere, interest rates remained high in Greece, as the government sought to defend the drachma amid talk of a possible devaluation. The Austrian National Bank reduced the GOMEX money market rate to 5 per cent from 5.1 per cent. In the UK, firmer retail sales figures, and comments from the Treasury 'wise men' that higher interest rates were not required now, triggered a rally in eurosterling futures. Sterling closed slightly lower at DM2.4954 from DM2.5002 against the D-Mark, weighed down by the weaker dollar. The March US trade figures were very positive, with the trade gap falling by 18.5 per cent to Dollars 7.46bn. Total exports rose by 9.6 per cent to Dollars 58.33bn, while imports were 5.4 per cent higher. 'In the past these numbers would have led to a stronger dollar via expectations of higher interest rates,' said Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW. But the dollar has been capped by Tuesday's statement from the US Federal Reserve, that monetary policy is approaching neutrality. This is taken to mean that higher US interest rates are unlikely in the short term. Mr Turner added that there appeared to be a standoff at the moment, with the market wanting to take the dollar lower, but wary of the prospect of central bank intervention. European currencies were rangebound, with the D-Mark's performance mixed. It finished at L958.3 from L956.8 against the Italian lira. The French franc closed firmer at FFr3.423, from FFr3.426, against the D-Mark, in spite of the Bank of France trimming the intervention rate to 5.40 per cent from 5.50 per cent. Mr Turner said it was notable that the franc had held up well recently despite the weakness of the dollar. Normally, the franc suffers under these circumstances, because of D-Mark strength. One possible reason for this is that the recent quickening in German rate cuts has brought them down to levels which the French find more manageable. Mr Turner said there were also signs of investors returning to European bonds, with France particularly attractive, and this lent support to the franc. In Greece, meanwhile, interest rates stayed high as authorities sought to defend the drachma. The currency was trading near to Dr149 to the D-Mark from a previous close of Dr148.30. Rates were kept high, with overnight money quoted at 175/250 per cent. Mr Mark Geddes, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, predicted a fairly substantial devaluation in the near future. He said high interest rates were a deterrent to speculators, but not to domestic investors, and it was they who were selling the currency. Portugal trimmed its emergency lending rate by 0.375 percentage point to 11.375 per cent, but the escudo took this in its stride, ending at Es103.2 from Es103.1 per D-Mark. A buoyant set of UK retail sales figures, with year-on-year growth in April of 4.4 per cent, provided the unlikely stimulus for a strong rally in eurosterling futures. The December contract saw nearly 42,000 lots traded, and closed 15 basis points up at 94.05. At one stage it reached 94.14. Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, said the rally had started in the gilt market and spread over into short sterling. He attributed this to covering of short positions, and also to a 'change in psychology and sentiment in the market. It is a good news market now. People are feeling more confident about taking longer term positions.' This rally received further impetus from the six economists who advise the chancellor. In their quarterly report, they said they saw no need for a further increase in rates now. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of about Pounds 385m. Earlier the Bank put Pounds 130m liquidity into the system, against a forecast shortage of Pounds 500m. Overnight rates moved between 4 and 6 per cent. German interest rate futures had a less happy day, with the December Euromark contract closing nine basis points weaker at 95.12. Sentiment was undermined by a comment from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president. According to the text of a speech for delivery at the University of Halle, he said 'it is important . . . that as far as central bank interest rates are concerned, the horizon has now been cleared for a fairly long time'. The market took this to mean that the pace of German monetary easing was now likely to slow. German call money eased to 5.20/30 per cent, from 5.30/40 per cent.</p>

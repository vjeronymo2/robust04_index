			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Questions About Fate of Shaykh Sinan </F> Abu-Luhum"]    [Text] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Various reports have  been circulating in Yemeni political circles and in diplomatic  circles about the fate of Shaykh Sinan Abu-Luhum, leader of the  Popular Forces Union and a senior chieftain of the Bakil tribes  who is known for his opposition to President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih and his sympathy with the positions and policy of the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] throughout the years of Yemeni  unity.    Informed sources note that Shaykh Abu-Luhum has disappeared  from the arena in recent weeks, since his return to Sanaa at the  beginning of the Yemeni war. Despite his state of health and  advanced age, he had made great efforts in bridging the views of  Yemeni president and his Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid since  the beginning of the crisis last August.    The sources say that Abu-Luhum may be under house arrest at  present for refusing to add his name to the list of supporters  signed by a number of YSP and opposition leaders currently in  Sanaa despite their known opposition to President Salih in the  past.    It is worth noting that commercial offices partly owned by  Shaykh Sinan were burned down six week ago while he was in the  United States for medical treatment, because of the positions he  had taken and statements he made to Sanaa's dissatisfaction,  particularly his support for a strong Arab role in settling the  Yemeni crisis after the Sanaa and Aden officials failed to  contain that crisis.</p>

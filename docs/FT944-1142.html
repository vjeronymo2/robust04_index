			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Peres sees early Palestine vote Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, predicted last night that the 2m Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip would go to the polls within the next few months. He was speaking after a two-hour meeting in Gaza with the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Mr Yassir Arafat. The talks failed to resolve their differences, but both men emerged more hopeful that a compromise would be found. Mr Arafat's chief peace negotiator, Dr Nabil Sha'ath, who had earlier predicted a crisis if there were no progress, said that the exchange of ideas had been 'positive'. The Palestinians have insisted that Israel fulfil its pledge under the 1993 Oslo peace agreement to redeploy its troops from Arab towns and villages on the still-occupied West Bank before elections to a Palestinian council. But the Israelis now claim that they need to keep some of them in place to protect the 110,000 Jewish settlers still living there. The Palestinian police, they argue, have proved either unwilling or unable to combat a campaign of violence by Islamic extremists. Mr Arafat acknowledged again yesterday that the Israelis had reason for concern. Mr Peres reiterated his government's commitment to the Oslo terms. Negotiations are to be resumed at senior official level in Cairo next week.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Women may lose Ford jobs WOMEN sewing-machinists at Ford who won a breakthrough for equal pay in 1984, and whose first strike in 1968 influenced the Labour government's equal pay legislation, are likely to lose their jobs. The 150 women, who sew seats at Dagenham and Halewood, are likely to lose their jobs following Ford's decision to put the work out to tender.</p>

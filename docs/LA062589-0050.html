			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXCERPT;  </P> <P> THE SAINT OF HEDONISM  </P> <P> There was once in the south of India a hedonistic king who valued his pleasures  and his treasures above all things. However, this king also enjoyed intelligent  conversation, and from time to time visitors were invited into the royal  chamber, where he reclined on his lion throne, dressed in the most sumptuous of  garments.  </P> <P> One day, a wise yogin came to the court and was granted an audience. When the  king saw his tattered clothing and weathered face, he was filled with pity.  </P> <P> "What a terrible life you must lead, wandering from country to country in such  a miserable state," he said.  </P> <P> "I have nothing to complain about," the yogin replied. "You are the one to be  pitied."  </P> <P> "What makes you think such a thing?" said the king, taken aback.  </P> <P> "I have eyes," said the yogin. "I can see that you live in constant dread of  your own subjects. Above all, you fear the loss of your throne. But I, I am  free from all suffering. The pain of old age, even death itself, is unknown to  me. Were I to leap into a roaring fire, I would not be burned. Were I to  swallow the deadliest of poisons, I would not die."  </P> <P> "How can this be?" asked the king, amazed.  </P> <P> "I have learned the great teachings of the alchemists," replied the venerable  yogin. "I possess the secret of immortality."  </P> <P> The words of the yogin affected the king so profoundly that his faith was  kindled on the spot. "I am unable to wander from place to place as you do," he  said, "but if you could teach me how to meditate while remaining here on my  throne in my palace I would be very grateful. I beg you to remain long enough  to instruct me," and he prostrated himself in humble supplication.  </P> <P> The yogin granted the king's request by initiating him into the meditative  practices of the deity Hevajra. The king learned to concentrate his attention  unwaveringly upon the jeweled ring on his right hand. In time, he was able to  visualize within the heart of the jewel the great Hevajra himself seated amid  his retinue of divinities. When the king succeeded in transfixing this vision  he united both the creative and fulfillment modes of meditation and the state  of realization, the one-pointed trance of samadhi, spontaneously unfolded.  </P> <P> Thereafter the king meditated ceaselessly. The dawning of his understanding had  endowed him with the power and realization of mahamudra as well as other  abilities, such as extrasensory perception. Yet he accomplished all this while  seated upon his lion throne reclining on cushions of silk surrounded by his  queens and ministers and entertained by the court musicians.  </P> <P> His fondness for sensual pleasures soon earned him the name Lilapa, which means  "Master of Play." Nevertheless, he became known throughout the world for  wonderful acts of selflessness, and in the end gained the ultimate liberation  of entering the Paradise of the Dakinis.  </P> <P> Lilapa's story shows us that when the karmic leanings and aspirations of the  disciple blend harmoniously with the teachings of the guru, there is no need to  renounce the pleasures of this life in order to attain liberation.  </P></p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Ulster talks face delay in dispute over venue A DISPUTE over the venue for crucial talks between the Irish government and Ulster's political leaders may delay the start of formal inter-party discussions aimed at producing a historic new agreement for governing the province. Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, was due to chair the first inter-party session in Belfast today but it was unclear last night if the outstanding differences would be resolved in time. Discussions were continuing to try to end the disagreement over the venue for the second series of talks, during which Irish ministers and local politicians will discuss relationships between the Republic of Ireland and a new administration in the province. Unionists prefer London for the talks while nationalists favour a location 'somewhere in Ireland'. However, the indications are that both sides will accept a neutral venue, possibly the headquarters of the European parliament at Strasbourg. Members of the various political teams who will be at the talks were gearing up for a start later today. The Northern Ireland Office was making no official statement on the last-minute hitch, saying only that the process was still at the bilateral stage. Mr Brooke is expected to speak with the various party leaders this morning. If there are no further obstacles, the first formal inter-party talks for more than 15 years will later get under way.</p>

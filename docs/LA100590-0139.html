			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FGS FILES DAMAGE CLAIM AGAINST STATE, 5 AGENCY OFFICIALS;  </P> <P> INSURANCE: THE IRVINE-BASED FIRM, FACING AN ATTEMPT TO CANCEL ITS LICENSE TO DO  BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA, SAYS A TOLL-FREE GOVERNMENT HOT LINE SCARED AWAY MANY  OF ITS POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS.  </P> <P> FGS Insurance Agency Inc., a controversial marketer of high-risk auto insurance  policies, said Thursday that it has filed a damage claim against the state  Department of Insurance, Commissioner Roxani Gillespie and four other agency  officials.  </P> <P> The Insurance Department currently is attempting to cancel FGS's license to  market auto insurance in California, claiming that the Irvine-based company has  systematically defrauded customers.  </P> <P> The company has denied the state's allegations and maintains that the  department is conducting a vendetta against FGS because it formerly was owned  by Coastal Insurance, a high-risk auto insurance company that filed for  bankruptcy and was ordered liquidated last year.  </P> <P> In the damage claim, FGS named senior investigator Dennis Ward, investigators  Hazel McRay and Kim Harrison-Woods and Bruce Wiener, chief counsel for the  department, as defendants along with Gillespie.  </P> <P> FGS says that it was damaged because the department established a toll-free hot  line for agency clients and that callers are told that the company provides  inferior service and that the state will revoke its brokerage and agency  licenses.  </P> <P> The company said that since filing a complaint against FGS in April, the  Insurance Department "has disseminated false and misleading press releases" and  threatened to investigate insurers who do business with FGS.  </P> <P> In addition, FGS claims that department investigators have entered its premises  without permission and have threatened to seek revocation of the licenses of  FGS employees who request legal advice during interviews.  </P> <P> FGS President Alan Greenberg said that most of those activities have been  halted but that FGS has lost thousands of potential customers because of the  state's actions.  </P> <P> The claim, submitted to the Insurance Department, is an administrative prelude  to the expected filing of a $40-million civil suit by FGS against the  department, said Greenberg. A damage claim must be filed and acted on by the  state before a civil suit for damages can be instituted.  </P> <P> An earlier FGS suit asking for a court order enjoining state regulators from  harassing FGS was filed Sept. 7. On Aug. 14, former FGS executives were among  those named in an Insurance Department suit asking for $66 million plus  punitive damages to be paid the state for alleged racketeering, fraud and gross  mismanagement in the Coastal failure.  </P> <P> The new suit will be based on FGS's claims that "the Insurance Department and  its employees have engaged in and condoned a pattern of unlawful misconduct  against FGS," Greenberg said.  </P> <P> Insurance Department officials said Thursday that they had not yet seen the  damage claim and would have no comment.  </P> <P> In April, the state filed a complaint against FGS claiming that the agency in  1989 and earlier had violated state insurance laws. Among the charges were that  FGS:  </P> <P> * Failed to tell customers they were being placed in the state assigned-risk  pool.  </P> <P> * Failed to tell customers who financed premiums through a plan provided by FGS  that the interest rates would run from 20% to 40% while much less expensive  plans were available from the state.  </P> <P> * Aided unlicensed insurance companies to do business in California by  marketing their policies.  </P> <P> Hearings to revoke FGS license began in September but have been postponed until  February.  </P></p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour defends publication of list LABOUR LAST night defended its publication of a list of companies 'implicated' in the supply of defence-related equipment to Iraq, saying its principal purpose was to indicate to Lord Justice Scott some of the ground that could be covered in his inquiry. Mr George Foulkes, a shadow defence spokesman, said Labour's intention was not to criticise the companies individually or collectively. 'It is not meant to be a criticism of the companies but an indication of the extent to which they were being actively encouraged to trade with Iraq,' he said. He said Labour had gone out of its way to be 'as rigorous as possible' in its checking of the information used. He had decided not to release the list at a press conference partly so as not to play it up. The list of 36 companies was compiled from various sources, including local and national press cuttings, anonymous informants and a selection of the previously restricted documents released in the Matrix Churchill trial. Many of those named have been featured in past articles about British trade with Iraq published by the Financial Times and other newspapers. Prior to the publication of the Labour list, a preliminary one was shown to an independent defence expert who had weeded out a number of names. The list was published as 57 Tory MPs signed an early-day motion accusing Labour of resorting to smears in recent attacks on ministers. The motion read: 'That this house recalls that the Labour leadership shabbily and without foundation accused the prime minister of misconduct over the BCCI issue, for which they never apologised and their allegations were subsequently proved to be untrue by Lord Justice Bingham; notes that the Labour leadership has again resorted to smears in the case of Matrix Churchill and feels sure that the prime minister will again be vindicated; and invites all parties to submit evidence to the inquiry by Lord Justice Scott and then to await the outcome.'</p>

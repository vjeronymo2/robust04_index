			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 17 (KNS-KCNA) -- The Federation of  South Koreans in Japan for Democracy and Reunification, the  League of South Korean Youth in Japan and the Democratic  Association of South Korean Women in Japan recently issued a  joint appeal calling on the 70 million Koreans at home and  abroad to unite firmly and rise up courageously in the  anti-U.S., anti-war and anti-nuke struggle in order to defend  the country and the nation from a scourge of war and achieve  peace on the Korean peninsula and national reunification.    "The Koreans at home and abroad should lift up critical  voices and hold higher the banner of struggle in order to oppose  the resumption of the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers,  check the shipment of Patriot missiles and frustrate all the  military provocations," said the appeal. "All the Koreans who  love the country and the nation should join hands and kindle the  flames of the anti-U.S., anti-war and anti-nuke struggle."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Airlines Clear Path for Foreign </F> Investment"]    [Text] China will try to upgrade its domestic air  transport by permitting foreign investment in airlines and  airports.    New policies will permit foreign carriers to invest with  Chinese airlines and also launch joint or cooperative airline  companies.    Foreign firms also can buy shares of Chinese airlines or  help  pay for setting up new airlines.    The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and the  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec) also  announced in a circular yesterday that foreign businessmen will  be allowed to invest in and build flying districts for civilian  airports, including runways and taxiways and parking aprons.    Foreign firms and individuals also will be encouraged to  invest in other ground facilities--terminal buildings, freight  warehouses, ground services, aircraft maintenance, air catering,  hotels, restaurants and fuel.    In constructing flying districts or terminal buildings,  however, the Chinese side should have more than 51 per cent of  registered capital, and both the board chairman and general  manager should be Chinese.    The Chinese agencies said that the government will continue  exclusive jurisdiction over air traffic control.    The CAAC will pick one or two domestic airlines as initial  experiments in joint operations with foreigners.    But in running a joint venture airline, the foreign  investment will be limited to 35 per cent, and foreign voting  rights cannot exceed 25 per cent. CAAC did not elaborate.    The position of board chairman and general manager should  also be undertaken by the Chinese part.    The directives provide that the Chinese general manager can  appoint foreigners as assistant managers and other subsidiary  positions.    Airlines with foreign investments will be treated equally  with airlines owned and operated exclusively by the government    The new policy also will allow foreign investment in  aviation  for crop and forestry spraying.    Foreigners interested in such investments must obtain  approval from CAAC. The contracts must be ratified by Moftec.    Projects with investment beyond CAAC's approval power are  subject to examination and endorsement of the State Planning  Commission. CAAC did not specify the sum.    Businesses from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao will be allowed  to invest in the mainland's civil aviation on the same terms.    Observers said that civil aviation sector is one of China's  latest areas open to outside investors.    They say the new rules are part of its efforts to open its  aviation area wider to the outside world.</p>

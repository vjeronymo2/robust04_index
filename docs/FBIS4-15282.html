			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [John Lloyd report: "Russian Investment Surge Boosts </F> Industrial Shake-Up]    [Text] Moscow -- A surge of domestic and foreign  investment in Russia is boosting the shares of privatised  companies and giving much-needed momentum to the process of  industrial restructuring, according to financiers.    The flow of foreign funds into the country reached $400m  (273m pounds) in the first quarter this year, raising hopes of a  long- awaited breakthrough in investor interest in Russia,  although some experts are less optimistic. Foreign investment  totalled $2.9bn last year.    The prices of vouchers which Russians use to buy shares in  privatised companies have been rising steadily and trading in  shares of some of the "plum" enterprises has been frenetic, say  financiers.    The two-year privatisation programme, due to end in June, is  now releasing shares of companies in the utility, communication  and energy sectors, at knock-down prices.    They include the Unified Energy System, the world's largest  integrated power generation company; the Lukoil holding company,  Russia's largest oil producer and refiner; the Rostelkom  telephone corporation; and the Primorsk and Novorossisk Shipping  companies, which dominate the Russian Far East and Black Sea  maritime routes.    Shares in Unified Energy System have risen from an original  nominal price of Rbsl,000 (70 US cents) when they were sold to  workers to $2.30 when workers sold their shares in  over-the-counter trading and to about $8 in the national voucher  auction, when members of the public bid their vouchers for a 13  per cent stake in the company.    Even so, the valuation of the company was extremely low by  international standards, according to Mr Boris Jordan, head of  the Credit Suisse First Boston [CSFB] branch in Moscow -- the  largest foreign bank engaged in trading shares in Russia and the  only one with a broker's licence from the Ministry of Finance.    "A similar company, producing that number of kilowatts,  would  be worth about $49bn in the US, over $30bn in Europe. Here it  was worth $200m. The world has not yet woken up to the fact  that Russian assets are so extremely cheap," says Mr Jordan.    In this climate, Russian investment funds, many of them  cash-rich from arbitrage activities, are buying enough shares in  some companies to control the management board. These funds,  say CSFB executives, are now sophisticated, knowledgeable and  eager to restructure the companies under their control.    Mr Stephen Jennings, CSFB's investment banking director,  believes the next three to five years will see widespread change  in Russia's industrial sector.    Set against the new-found enthusiasm of Russian and foreign  investors for privatised companies are the growing number of  complaints from foreign business people that rapidly changing  laws and tax regimes make large deals unattractive, that  organised crime is penetrating business practices, and that the  country remains politically and macro-economically unstable.</p>

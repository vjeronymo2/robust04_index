NUB said that North Korea had embarked on a large-scale  restructuring of various production facilities across the  country, after admitting to the failure of the third seven-year  economic development plan at the 21st plenary session of the  party's sixth Central Committee last December.    Through the reorganization, the communist North is  drastically reducing the functions and scale of heavy industry,  while concentrating on fostering trade and light industry to  promote exports, NUB noted.    A NUB official said, "North Korea's reorganization of  production systems is focused on strengthening light industry  and foreign trade. However, it does not mean any change in the  fundamental economic system of socialism."</p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Letter: Bailing out mortgage holders short-sighted expediency Sir, One cannot help but agree with the general thrust of Samuel Brittan's argument (Economic Viewpoint, October 29) that the relative stances of monetary and fiscal policy in the UK need to be reversed. Cutting benefit payments amounts to a tax on the poor - undesirable at any stage, but especially so now. New capital infrastructure such as the Jubilee Line extension is likely to be built at least partly with public funds at some stage anyway, so it seems eminently sensible to pay for it now at reduced prices rather than later when capacity is stretched. But to argue for the bailing out of mortgage holders through the nationalisation of the bad debts of the banks and building societies is to argue for nothing less than short-sighted expediency. Wiping away even part of the current housing-related bad debts of the banks and building societies would water down the prime factor likely to prevent a resumption of an uncontrollable housing book, unlikely as this may seem in the current depressed climate. This is especially so since the UK is (happily) no longer within the constraints of the exchange rate mechanism. Likewise for greater relief on mortgage interest for those with negative equity. This amounts only to a subsidy to property owners, the vast majority of whom could well do without any subsidy. The direction of policy should rather be to remove this distortion altogether, although not until a resumption of growth allows the deflationary effects of such an abolition to be minimised.

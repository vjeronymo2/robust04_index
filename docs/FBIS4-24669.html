			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 28 (XINHUA) -- China has decided to  permit foreigners to invest in its civil aviation construction  on condition that Chinese capital should exceed 51 percent of  the total in any venture.    The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and the  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-Operation promulgated  a circular to this effect here yesterday.    The document stipulates that overseas businessmen are  allowed  to construct runways and parking areas in China by means of  investment or co-operation. But the Chinese investment should  exceed 51 percent of the total registered capital of the joint  venture and Chinese citizens should take the posts of the  chairman of the board and the general manager.    However, the other managing personnel can be Chinese or  foreigners. The taxation rates of these enterprises will be the  same as those for Chinese ones.    Those who invest in the construction of runways or parking  areas will be given priority for investing in the waiting rooms,  warehouses, ground services, airplane maintenance and repair,  flight food, hotels, restaurants, aircraft oil and other  airport-affiliated facilities.    Meanwhile, the circular reiterated that air traffic control  systems can only be funded and administered by the Chinese  Government.    The circular gives the green light to foreign businessmen to  set up air freight companies jointly with Chinese enterprises.  It is also allowed for foreign investors to buy the shares of  Chinese air shipping companies, provided that the foreign  capital is below 35 percent of the total registered capital.    The circular stresses that overseas airports and the  aircraft  manufacturing companies are not allowed to set up air freight  companies in China.</p>

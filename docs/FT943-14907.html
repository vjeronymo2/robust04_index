			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pulp maker defends 50 per cent price rises The 50 per cent rise in pulp prices this year has come just in time for the struggling paper industry, according to a leading US pulp and paper manufacturer. Defending price rises of over 20 per cent for some paper customers so far this year, Mr John Kennedy, president of Federal Paper Board Company of New Jersey, said yesterday: 'For the last two years we were selling pulp at below cost - six months ago substantially below cost. . . We were at the point where we would have had to shut down our North Carolina mill'. Mr Kennedy, speaking before a visit to the company's Tait paper mill in Scotland, said he appreciated customers' concern. 'Three or four price increases in a relatively short period is a surprise and difficult to comprehend,' he admitted. 'But when we analyse the losses over the last two to three years and where we need to be to get a reasonable return on our investment, that's what has to happen.' Federal made a profit of Dollars 40m on sales of Dollars 1.4bn last year, thanks to its separate lumber operations. It made virtually no return on capital invested. 'Last year was probably the worst year in our industry in 40 years,' said Mr Kennedy. He pointed out that the latest rise, which will take world pulp prices to Dollars 620 a tonne this summer, would leave them well below their peak of Dollars 850 a tonne in the late 1980s. However, some paper users are being so badly squeezed by the price rises that they fear for their survival. Hinton Corrpack, a small company in Staffordshire, north-west England, which makes cardboard boxes for supermarkets, says the price of the board it buys is due to rise by 50 per cent by the end of the year. 'Some 60 to 70 per cent of our selling price is the raw material, so it's quite serious,' said Mr John Weedon, managing director of the company, which has sales of Pounds 2.5m. 'We've raised our prices by about 7 per cent, but the market won't bear any further increase. . . It's the small businesses that will give - those who get caught in the middle.' The slump in the paper industry was caused not by a fall in demand, which has grown steadily over the past few years, but by overcapacity. Following the last upswing in the early 1980s, capacity grew at 6 to 7 per cent a year during the late 1980s and early 1990s. It costs about Dollars 750m to build a 1,000-tonne-a-day pulp mill and takes three to four years, so supply is often out of kilter with demand by the time the new capacity comes on stream. 'Demand has finally caught up with that increase in capacity,' said Mr Kennedy. The Tait mill, which buys over half its pulp from Federal's Carolina plant to make white uncoated free sheet - used for photocopying and computer paper  -has itself more than doubled capacity in the past five years to 220,000 tonnes. Mr Kennedy said Tait had been operating at or below break-even for two and a half years until the second quarter. But this year its customers have seen prices rise 24 per cent and the mill is fully stretched, with a 40-day order backlog. The sharp rise in demand as much of the world emerges from recession has taken even the industry by surprise. Demand for cut size paper, which had been growing at 4 to 6 per cent a year, rose by 7 per cent in the first five months of this year. The temporary closure of pulp mills last year in North America, Scandinavia and Spain and Portugal, coupled with low customer stocks, has squeezed supplies of pulp. Mr Kennedy believes another boom and bust cycle could be tempered by the huge environmental costs facing pulp and paper companies, especially in the US, which could hamper hefty investment in new capacity. Environmental regulations proposed in the US are expected to cost the industry between Dollars 8bn and Dollars 10bn.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Matilde Oliva] </F>   [Text] President Frei has said that the government wishes  to include all sectors of national life in the struggle against  poverty. He made a statement to this effect when he presided  over the ceremony at which the National Council Against Poverty  was established.    The organization, which held its first meeting on 24 May, is  made up of representatives of different national groups with  experience in the field of social development. The government's  intention was to bring together persons coming from the most  representative areas of national life, both from the government  as well as from the opposition, including social organizations,  employers and workers, churches, and nongovernmental bodies. The  names of the members of the council speak for themselves:  Alberto Echegaray, president; Benito Baranda, executive  secretary; Gonzalo de la Maza; Claudio Di Girolamo; Roberto  Fantuzzi; Bishop Erasmo Farfan; Jose Antonio Guzman; Juan Pablo  Illanes; Fernando Leniz; Haidee Lopez; Patricia Matte; Manfred  Max-Neef; Ana Maria Medioli; Eugenio Ortega; Maria Rozas;  Alberto Undurraga; Sara Vasquez; Humberto Vega; Monsignor Manuel  Camilo Vial; and Jose Zavala.    According to the decree which approved its establishment,  the  objective of this council is to coordinate the participation of  different social groups in answering the national challenge to  overcome poverty; to propose action, programs, and strategies to  make the social policy of the state more coherent in this sense;  to advise the president and the interministerial, social  committee; to propose ways of reducing poverty at the regional  level; and to contribute to the program that Chile will present  to the Social Development Summit Meeting of the United Nations.    President Frei was the only speaker at the ceremony. In his  speech he said: "From this place we must be able to call on the  conscience of all Chileans so that the task of wiping out  extreme poverty will not just be a government policy but the  fundamental concern of the nation." He recalled that the basic  priority of his administration is to concentrate its efforts on  the nine percent of the population, or about 1.2 million  Chileans, "who live under subhuman conditions in the most  extreme poverty and destitution."    At the same time he added that he will fight to raise  minimum  wages and to improve living conditions among some three million  people who live under precarious conditions.    As to where the emphasis will be placed in the national  program to overcome poverty, President Frei pointed out that  efforts will be concentrated on specific programs aimed at  infants, senior citizens who lack resources, young people,  women, urban and rural small businessmen, farmers, the  indigenous peoples, and the handicapped.    He stated: "In short the program for overcoming poverty will  emphasize the development of backward sectors and will ensure  better opportunities for the most vulnerable groups of society."    He emphasized that he hopes to see that an additional public  effort is made through the "contributions and the generous  initiatives of employers, workers, academic personalities,  church leaders, and representatives of nongovernmental  organizations, who can design a program as ambitious or even  more so than what the government will do."    For his part Luis Maira, minister of planning and  cooperation, announced that within the next two weeks the  interministerial social committee will unveil the national  program for abolishing poverty in the budget of 1994 and the  criteria for the preparation of the budget for 1995. He said:  "These criteria are going to redirect public expenditures and  social priorities toward the poorest groups among the people,  such as the regions and territories which now have the greatest  cumulative problems."    The minister also said that during the second half of June a  meeting will be held of all senior administrative officials,  called by minister of the interior German Correa, to discuss the  implementation of the plan at the national level.</p>

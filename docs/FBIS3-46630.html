			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporters Hideki Asai, Hiroyuki Tamiya, Yasuyuki </F> Hirose]    [Excerpts] The 94 items of deregulation announced by the  Hosokawa administration have raised many ripples throughout  industrial circles. Such established industries as electric  power fear a collapse of the established order. The distribution  and beer industries are awaiting the opening of new business  opportunities. The situation is likely to have a major impact on  the customs brokerage system.    Furthermore, interestingly enough, such reactions suggest  the  future outlook of the various industries. The deregulation is  actually a deregulation of the established economic order. Let  us examine the reactions of the principal industries.  <H5>  Jonan Electric, a Discounter of Cosmetic Products </H5>   "We are not selling this product. We have been notified by  the Ministry of Welfare not to undersell it. Those who want the  product can call the ministry. The number is 3503-1711. Please  use the counter telephone." This notice is posted in the  cosmetic sales section on the eighth floor of the Jonan Electric  Co.'s Shibuya branch.    In June this year, Jonan Electric began discount sales of a  famous foreign brand of cosmetics which it acquired under  parallel import. In the case of cosmetics imported through  ordinary channels, they are imported by dealers licensed by the  Ministry of Welfare, and are sold with labels attached that  indicate the name of the seller and the component materials. The  purpose is to protect domestic consumers. However, Jonan  Electric feared that the importers could pressure the cosmetics  maker, so it removed the labels and began sales. It was a  premeditated violation of the rule.    Regarding this "violation of the rule," the Ministry of  Welfare judged that removal of the labels was a violation of the  Drugs, Cosmetics, and Medical Instruments Law, and ordered a  halt to the sales through the Tokyo prefectural government. It  resulted in the aforementioned posted notice.    The Ministry of Welfare's explanation is as follows. "We do  not state that it is wrong to conduct discount sales. We do not  allow sales of imported cosmetic goods without labeling merely  in order to protect the consumers. As proof, we do not say  anything about discount sales by Jonan Electric of cosmetics  made by Shiseido or Kanebo."    President Toshio Miyaji rebuts this, saying, "Even though we  try to qualify as an importer, the Ministry of Welfare shuts out  new entries. The consumers are knowledgeable about foreign  brands of cosmetics, and what we sell are all brands that are  being sold in Japan. There is also no problem concerning safety."    President Miyaji adds, "The Drugs, Cosmetics, and Medical  Instruments Law is nothing but a law that attaches labels to  foreign cosmetics, and a large number of Ministry of Welfare  bureaucrats are being assigned after retirement to companies  that attach the labels." He also emphasizes: "At this stage, a  great margin is being added on, and the interests of the  consumers are being injured."    With public opinion seeking inexpensive cosmetics as the  backdrop, Jonan Electric is aiming for resumption of sales. For  women, being able to purchase a Chanel lipstick worth 4,000 yen  at 1,800 yen is quite attractive. However, acquisition of a  permit as an importer is difficult under the present  circumstances, and the problem is like to be prolonged.  <H5>  Kawachiya and Daiei Inc. </H5>   In July this year, the National Tax Administration Agency  issued a notice on the revision of the liquor sales license. The  content is as follows: 1) The transfer of the business rights of  a store under business closure is not permitted. 2) Even in a  case where the business rights are being taken over from an  established store that has gone out of business, the store floor  space cannot be expanded by more than 100 square meters, and the  overall space cannot exceed 3,000 square meters. 3) A store  cannot move during its first year of business.    The new class of discount dealers has acquired liquor sales  licenses through capital participation in established liquor  stores. Inability to acquire the licenses of stores with closed  business is a matter of survival for them.    Also, the discount dealers are making broad discounts  possible through mass purchase and mass sales. They require mass  warehousing for that purpose. If they are restricted to 3,000  square meters including warehouses, business will actually be  impossible. The tax agency's notice is merely a joint scheme  between the liquor sales union and the wholesale liquor sales  union--organizations of the established stores--to shut out the  discounters.    In fact, the pressure applied by these groups on the bargain  stores is beyond imagination. For example, Kawachiya Co. opened  a bargain store in the town of Shirane in Yamanashi Prefecture.  However, because the makers and wholesalers in Yamanashi  Prefecture joined to deny deliveries to Kawachiya, it was forced  to ship sake from Tokyo in order to continue business. President  Yukio Higuchi maintains a bullish posture when he says:  "Regardless of the pressure, we are doing good business," but  the transportation costs are not negligible.    A person in charge of public relations at Daiei says: "Ever  since it was reported that Nakauchi went to see Prime Minister  Hosokawa, there has been a rush of reporters covering  deregulation." The announcement that "it would be possible to  lower prices if the various permits and licenses for the opening  of superstores should be abolished" suddenly attracted attention.    According to Daiei, an immense amount of labor is spent on  food-related permits in opening a store. In the case of  superstores, meat, fish, ice cream, and delicacies are sold, and  permits must be obtained from the health bureaus of the various  prefectures for each store. Moreover, in the case of meat, it is  not only sold but also simply cooked, and in addition to  licenses for edible meat, licenses for restaurants are  necessary. Therefore, applications for about 20 licenses must  reportedly be submitted to the health authorities. With the need  for so many licenses, the cost and time spent for renewals are  enormous.    Also, according to the present Food Sanitation Law, every  store must have a washroom. It is joked that the superstores are  overequipped with washrooms. This also an "unnecessary cost"  according to those concerned.    The fact that permits and licenses vary according to the  region and the officials in charge is also a source of headaches  for the superstores. Although it is said to be based on the Food  Sanitation Law, the government agency is able to manipulate  operations in the name of administrative guidance. It is also a  large waste of time to cope with it.    If such a wide range of time, effort, and cost are roughly  calculated in terms of overall cost, it would come to about 160  million yen for Daiei. In order to meet this cost, about 7.5  billion yen in sales is necessary, calculating in reverse from  from Daiei's business profit rate. If the regulatory system is  abolished, there would be room to lower prices by the cost  amount. According to Daiei's estimates, it will result in a  price drop of about 0.4 percent. Although all regulations are  not unnecessary, it must be remembered that it is not only  Daiei, but also the consumers who are forced to carry such cost  burdens. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Customs as a Barrier </H5>   Based on his experience in personally importing an American  car from Australia, Richard Koo of THE ECONOMIST describes his  anger toward the customs office as follows. "Bureaucrats say  foolish things such as the market will be open if customs duties  are abolished. However they do not notice that, amid the rampant  regulations that harass us, Japan is isolating itself. It is  such an ordeal to even import a single car. How can the  promotion of imports be possible?"    Let us continue our discussion of Mister Koo. The customs  duties for cars was zero, and only a consumption tax was  charged. However, the customs-related costs equaled half of the  transportation cost from Australia.    The greatest problem concerns the complicated documents that  must be filed at the customs office and the land transportation  bureau. First, explanations regarding the engine number and the  chassis number are required. Unless everything can be explained,  the documents will not be accepted. Inquiries were made of the  dealer in Australia and the main office in the United States,  and an explanation was somehow submitted based on conversations  with the parties concerned in Japan, but the next hurdle was the  petition for a garage certificate. At the police station near  his residence, he was asked to show a certificate of his  personal seal, which he was not required to submit. When he  protested, the official in charge became defiant and told him:  "That is why we are asking you." There is absolutely no basis  for it, but the petition will not be accepted until he shows it.  Long ago, when an airline company purchased an aircraft, it was  required to submit a list of its stockholders. However, what  relationship is there between a car purchase and a personal seal  certificate?    Such "harassment" by import regulations has been experienced  by numerous domestic importers. In addition to ordinary customs  procedures, import procedures include nearly 30 other statutory  permits and licenses.    For example, if one wishes to import grapefruits, two  permits  under the Plant Quarantine Law (MAFF) and the Food Sanitation  Law (Ministry of Finance) must be acquired before submitting  them to customs. The inspection station is distant and,  depending on the ability of the inspector to respond, the  inspection takes about two days. There is also a check on  whether drugs are present, and the inspections are conducted  separately.    Simplification of the inspections and procedures have been  implemented in many forms. However, it is confined to the  procedural text, and the burden of the importers remains  virtually unchanged. For example, a method has been introduced  whereby the respective inspectors will conduct the inspections  simultaneously, but virtually no importer has requested it. The  actual inspections are left to the discretion of the inspector  on duty. For example, the inspection based on the Food  Sanitation Law is not necessarily done. If one requests an  inspection that might not be conducted, it will mean additional  time and cost (the inspection cost is paid by the importer). In  the case of a request for consecutive imports of the same  product, inspection is omitted under the previous analysis  certificate for period of six months. However, when the  effective period is up, it will take time to wait in turn for  inspection. Therefore, the importer generally conducts voluntary  inspection at his own expense. Deregulation has not taken effect  at all at the lower reaches.    The rigidity of the import procedures has virtually not  improved. When importing beef, mistaking the quantity and  discrepancy between the number of parts (of the animal) and  those listed in the certificate of the exporting country is  almost a daily occurrence. However, inspection reportedly cannot  be passed unless the discrepant portion is thrown out or a new  certificate is acquired. Moreover, it is a problem because only  the original certificate is accepted. In effect, in general, a  separate request reportedly can be submitted to the authorities  for a free pass. If so, why is an inspection needed in the first  place?    Because lawn turf is imported in the form of seeds, a  palette  inspection of the seeds is conducted. Even if a single seed of  another plant is found, the turf must be destroyed because will  be "injurious to Japan's ecosystem."    Such regulations are not only drawbacks of the rigidity of  vertical administration, but they are also a reflection of the  excessive spread of the protection tendency. Of course, there  are such commodities as food products that require safety checks  at the water's edge, but there is undeniably an aspect of  excessive regulation that increases import costs and delays  Japan's structural change. A certain major importer says, "The  customs office still is a checkpoint where one must beg to be  allowed passage." There is a great need for improvement.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Uruguay Round in trouble again over deadline NEGOTIATORS in the Uruguay Round of trade talks are increasingly concerned that the Easter deadline for completing the Round will not be met. On January 13, the 108 countries taking part agreed to accept conditionally a 436-page draft package of accords covering all areas of negotiation. But the European Community said 'substantial improvements' would have to be made in the agriculture text calling for cuts in farm support. Nearly four weeks on, the EC has not yet come up with proposals for altering the draft, still less begun serious negotiations with the US and other trading partners to get changes agreed. This has in turn held up the detailed country-by-country negotiations now underway on lowering tariffs and other barriers to trade in goods. Other countries dissatisfied with the agriculture text, notably Japan which does not want to open its closed rice market, are refusing to bargain over farm products on the grounds guidelines have not yet been fixed. Countries are committed to reducing overall tariffs, including those on agricultural items, by one-third. By March 1, all 58 countries (the EC counting as one) in the tariff negotiations must submit complete item-by-item tariff schedules showing how they propose to meet that objective. After a final balancing of concessions, definitive schedules would be ready by March 31. Failure by any country or bloc to include farm products on its proposed tariff schedule would make it almost impossible to complete the negotiations on time. Today's informal stocktaking of intensive bargaining over the past week will also indicate little progress on Washington's 'zero-for-zero' proposals to scrap completely tariffs on particular products. Negotiators have more or less agreed zero tariffs for pharmaceuticals and steel, with construction machinery and medical equipment also under discussion. But the US needs more sectors covered if it is to meet the one-third target. The EC in particular is holding out in the hope of securing cuts in high US tariffs for textiles and footwear. Disappointing progress in the negotiations on initial commitments to liberalise trade in services, which must also be completed by March 31, has led some trade officials to doubt whether substantial market-opening deals are possible by the deadline.</p>

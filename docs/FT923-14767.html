			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Minister urges bid for ex-SDP votes CONSERVATIVE general election successes have become over-dependent on Labour's failings and the party should try to win the votes of centre party supporters, Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, said yesterday. The Tories were vulnerable to a total collapse of the third-party vote which might occur by the next election, Mr Hunt warned a conference of the left-leaning Tory Reform Group. Mr Hunt, in effect calling on Mr John Major to modify the agenda of his predecessor, said the party should move to attract supporters from the former Social Democratic party who were 'largely motivated by a set of beliefs wholly at home in the Tory Reform Group'. He added: 'It is simply not acceptable or realistic for politicians to disassociate themselves from the notion of society or government's respon-sibility to stimulate and guide social and economic development.' Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday stepped up his campaign to expand 'dialogue and debate' across British political parties while keeping his party's 'distinct' identity. He urged Liberal Democrat councillors at a conference in Eastbourne, East Sussex, to work with other parties 'who might share in our agenda for reform'.</p>

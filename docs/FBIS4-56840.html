The observers focused their attention on the  conditions that surrounded the installation of the voting  tables; the actual voting process; and the vote count at the  voting tables, the Electoral District Vote-Counting Board, and  the National Vote-Counting Board. The OAS observers were also  alert to information provided by the TE on the election results.

Following receipt of the first reports from observers in the  various provinces, the mission can announce the following  preliminary conclusions:    1. All candidates had every guarantee to develop his or  her electoral campaign.    2. The organization and administration of the electoral  process by the TE created an environment of trust among the  political forces and the people regarding the cleanliness of the  elections.    3. The people had every guarantee to vote freely and  express their political will. The voting was conducted within a  framework of calm and cordiality and was highlighted by a high  degree of participation.    4. The isolated problems were solved promptly and did not  hinder the voting.    5. The vote count began as scheduled at the Electoral  District Vote-Counting Board.    The OAS observers will remain in Panama until the TE  releases  the final results of the vote count for president and vice  presidents.    Lastly, at the appropriate time, the secretary general will  expand all these preliminary conclusions in the final report to  be presented to the OAS Permanent Council.    Thank you.</p>

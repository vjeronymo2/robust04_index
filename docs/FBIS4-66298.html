			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on Wang Zhiyuan (3769 5268 6678): "State Assets </F> Being Lost Through Multiple Channels"]    [Text] Editor's note: The loss of state assets  has caused widespread concern among members of the public, but  few people know how the losses occur. This is why we are  printing an investigation report on the loss of state assets  written by Comrade Wang Zhiyuan of the scientific research  office of the State Administration of State Properties. This  report is a clear description of the channels and ways through  which state assets are lost in Sino-foreign joint ventures and  transformed shareholding enterprises, when administrative units  set up the three kinds of wholly or partially foreign-funded  enterprises, and when collective enterprises modify property  rights. It is a good piece of reference material and should be  read carefully. [end editors note]  <H5>  Loss of State Assets in Sino-Foreign Joint Ventures and </H5> Contractual Joint Ventures    Because of China's growing international reputation and the  liberalization of the investment climate at home, foreign  investment in China has been booming and the number of  Sino-foreign joint ventures has increased sharply. This has been  a great boost to economic development in China across the board  and has helped raise the standards of production technology and  management. However, state assets are being lost and their  legitimate rights and interests are encroached upon severely by  the way some localities go about setting up joint ventures with  foreign firms.    Assets of Chinese Partners Not Appraised    To set up a Sino-foreign joint venture, the first thing that  should be done is to have the assets of both parties appraised.  Only then can one clarify their responsibilities, rights, and  interests. There should have been no question about this.  Nevertheless, owing to a variety of reasons -- the lack of  comprehensive laws in this field, government intervention, and  assets appraisal poorly done, sloppy appraisal -- the failure to  performam an assets appraisal has been a widespread phenomenon  in Sino-foreign joint ventures for many years. According to  incomplete data, about 90 percent of Chinese assets in  Sino-foreign joint ventures each year should be but are not  appraised. In 1992, of all Sino-foreign joint ventures approved  by foreign economic relations and trade agencies, about 10,000  involved state enterprises on the Chinese side, And of these  10,000, 2,900 had their assets appraised. On average, appraised  value is 75 percent higher than net book value. Thus over 6,000  state enterprises entered into a joint venture with a foreign  company without having their assets appraised. Their combined  investment in the joint ventures was 86.264 billion yuan. With a  value increase rate of 75 percent, we figure out that the  absence of assets appraisal caused a loss of state assets to the  tune of 64.698 billion yuan.    Assets of Two Parties Not Priced Fairly    It is a common practice among the Chinese entering into  joint  ventures with foreign businessmen to undervalue their assets.  For example, a steel pipe factory proposed using state assets  with a book value of 50 million yuan to set up a joint venture  with a foreign investor. Notified of this situation and acting  in accordance with the pertinent regulations, the local state  properties bureau proceeded to re-appraise the state assets of  the steel pipe factory based on current prices. The assets were  re-appraised at 210,000,000 yuan. The leaders of the enterprise  argued that the assets were over-valued and refused to accept  the figure. After intervention by the local leader, the state  assets bureau did another appraisal which lowered the value to  185,000,000 yuan, a number still considered too high by both the  local and the enterprise leaders. In the end, an administrative  decision was imposed under which the enterprise was to enter  into the joint venture with the state assets valued at 50  million yuan.    Investment by both Chinese and foreign partners in joint  ventures typically takes the form of goods and materials, and  overvalued ones at that. There is a chemical industrial firm in  Xiangtan Shi, a Sino-foreign joint venture. The foreign partner  claimed a value of $1.2 million for its equipment, while the  actual value was just $900,000, thus overvaluing it by $300,000.  It also claimed that its software was valued at $300,000, while  the real worth was only $30,000.    The practices among Chinese partners of undervaluing Chinese  state assets and accepting the inflated values of the foreign  partners' equipment and technology seriously damage the  legitimate rights and interests of the state. Under the  "Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Law," net profit shall be  distributed among the partners in accordance with their  respective shares of registered capital. Undervaluing the  Chinese partner's state assets thus inevitably lowers its share  of the total capital and hence its claim to the return on state  assets as well as other rights.  <H5>  Through "Transfer Pricing," Foreign Companies Encroach Upon </H5> China's State Assets, Evade Paying Taxes to Chinese Government    "Transfer prices refer to the prices multinationals charge  for goods and services sold inside China. They are also called  allocated prices. These prices are not subject to the usual  supply-demand relations on the market and represent a means  through which multinationals can maximize their profits."  "Transfer pricing" is an artificial pricing method intended to  shift an enterprise's profits. On the one hand, the enterprise  achieves its purpose of tax evasion. On the other hand, this  pricing method encroaches upon the Chinese partner's state  assets in a big way. The upshot is an anomaly: an enterprise may  suffer a loss on paper but is really raking in a profit.  Popularly dubbed "zero profit," this is actually a ruse resorted  to by foreign companies to turn a real profit into a sham loss.    Many of the foreign investors in China are multinational  corporations or their subsidiaries. They use a whole bunch of  imaginative "transfer pricing" tactics, most of them in the  following areas:    Buying and Selling of Goods    A foreign investor may move profits around by "importing  high  and exporting low." (This is how it works. It imports raw  materials from overseas, paying a relatively low world market  price, and then sells the raw materials to the joint venture at  a higher price. When it comes to selling the output, it obtains  the goods from the joint venture at a fairly low price and sells  them on the international market at a higher price.)  Sino-foreign contractual joint ventures and wholly  foreign-funded enterprises, where foreign businessmen exercise  managerial power, work hand in hand with affiliated companies  overseas to buy and sell raw materials and products based on  internal prices, creating a "sham loss" or "a tiny profit" and  achieving their objectives of encroaching upon the profits and  eliminating or minimizing their tax liabilities. Take, for  instance, the case of a Japanese electrical machinery company in  Shenzhen, a wholly Japanese-owned enterprise which sells the  bulk of its output to its affiliated company in Hong Kong. For 2  years after it opened for business, which coincided with its  income tax exemption period, it made a small fit. Beginning in  1986, it has been losing money year after year on its exports,  with losses exceeding 15 million yuan in all, close to 10  percent. An investigation revealed that there were two different  sets of sale prices for the enterprise's products. The prices it  charged its non-affiliated enterprises were 20 to 46 percent  higher than those it charged its affiliated company. Foreign  companies which have set up Sino-foreign contractual joint  ventures mostly make money through their control over the sales  channels as a buyer of raw materials and agent for the sale of  products.    Charging Fees for Services Within the Group    A foreign businessman may jack up the enterprise's costs and  corner its profits by overpaying its affiliated company overseas  for services the latter has rendered or undercharging the latter  for services the former has performed. Take, for instance, a  foreign-funded enterprise whose main business was petroleum gas.  For 10 years after it opened for business, it reported a loss  each year. Yet it never charged its Hong Kong affiliate for  storage and transhipment services it had rendered. In 1990 the  tax department ruled that it should charge for services at the  rate of 10 percent, the going rate, and proceeded to look into  its losses and profits. In the 1988-1989 period alone it should  have collected $2.28 million [Hong Kong dollars] in service  charges. Based on these figures, the company actually earned a  $478,000 profit instead of losing money. Its retroactive income  tax liability: HK$71,000.    Lending    When the foreign partner makes a loan to a joint venture, it  raises interest rates and thus siphons off the profit. One  example involves a Sino-foreign joint venture. In 1985 it was  strapped for working capital, so the foreign partner secured a  loan from a foreign bank. Between 1985 and 1988 it took out  loans totalling 37.96 million yuan and paid 5.14 million yuan in  interest at interest rates ranging from a high of 21.25 percent  to a low of 15.25 percent, 50 percent to 100 percent higher than  what banks charge their borrowers on the international market.    Transfer of Invisible Assets    The foreign partner influences the margin of profit of an  enterprise by manipulating the values of invisible assets. There  was a Sino-foreign joint venture. The Chinese partner invested  $8 million in it; the foreign partner, a mere $1.5 million. The  foreign partner's parent company was put in charge of importing  patented equipment and technology transfer, for which it charged  $6 million. Informed sources put the foreign partner's margin of  profit between 30 to 40 percent. Assuming that it was 35  percent, the foreign company's profit already topped its  registered capital. That way the investor made a fortune by  inflating transfer prices even before the joint venture opened  its door for business and sowed the seeds of future losses for  the company.    Through transfer pricing, foreign investors achieve their  goal of shifting profits overseas while condemning th  enterprises to a prolonged state of unprofitability and red ink  and causing colossal losses for China.  <H5>  The Loss Of State Assets as a Result of Transformation of </H5> Enterprises Into Shareholding Enterprises Or Companies    In the course of converting enterprises into shareholding  enterprises or companies, the failure to appraise state assets,  the undervaluing of state shares, the failure to match state  shares with other shares, the failure to issue dividends to  state shares, the issue of a minimal amount of dividends to  state shares, the conversion of state shares into legal-person  shares and personal shares, so on and so forth, have all  resulted in the loss of state assets. These are the principal  ways in which enterprise transformation via the shareholding  route may cause the loss of state assets:    As part of its experiment with the shareholding system, an  enterprise creates "enterprise shares." Some enterprises create  "internal employee shares" which employees may acquire  gratuitously or at a reduced price.    In the five shareholding enterprises set up in Jilin after  1985, for instance, "enterprise shares" accounted for 45.5  percent of the total value of all shares issued. In addition, 20  percent of the "enterprise shares" were set aside and turned  into 2,843 shares at 200 yuan each. They were distributed among  the employees based on the number of employees each enterprise  had and their seniority. Employees were also allowed to collect  dividends.  <H5>  In the Course of Converting an Enterprise Into a </H5> Shareholding Enterprise, State Assets Are Not Converted Into  Shares Based on Replacement Costs But At Low Prices.    Regulations require the conversion of state assets into  shares based on net asset replacement value. In reality, state  assets have been converted into shares according to original  book value in the vast majority of cases. There were six  enterprises in Shanghai whose assets had a combined original  book value of 827 million yuan. An appraisal put their net  assets replacement value at 1.688 billion yuan. In the end, the  assets were converted into shares based on the original book  value of 827 million yuan. In Chengdu, an appraisal raised the  value of the assets of state enterprises adopting the  shareholding system by 29 percent, significantly lower than the  rate at which assets in that city had been appreciating (70  percent) as well as the national average. (Between 1989 and  1992, the average assets appreciation rate nationwide was 54  percent.)  <H5>  When It Comes to the Distribution of Dividends, State Shares </H5> and Personal Shares Are Treated Differently.    The problem of jacking up dividends on personal shares and  holding down dividends on state shares is widespread among most  of the enterprises in Chengdu in Sichuan Province and Wuhan.  This is how dividends were divided up each year by a  shareholding limited-liability company in Wuhan between 1988 and  1992: For state shares, the dividend rate was 11.5 to 13.7  percent; social personal shares, between 17 and 17.5 percent;  and employee personal shares, 20 percent. A shareholding  enterprise in Sichuan followed an even more inequitable  practice. In calculating the dividend for personal shares, it  added the income tax payable to the profit to be distributed and  divided up the amount among the number of personal shareholders.  In contrast, the after-tax profit was used in figuring out the  state share dividend. In effect, the income tax liability was  borne solely by the state, not all shareholders. In 1992 the  enterprise gave out personal share dividends at the rate of 29  percent while the rate for state shares was a little over 3  percent.  <H5>  Enterprises Price Shares Differently, Encroaching Upon the </H5> Profits of the State-Enterprise Legal Person.    When it first started issuing shares, a building in Chengdu  priced personal shares and legal personal shares at 1.15 yuan  and 3.5 yuan each, respectively. The problem has now been  ratified.    Some State Assets Not Being Converted Into Shares    According to regulations, when a state enterprise is  converted into a shareholding enterprise, all its original  assets should be put into production. In pilot projects now  under way, the original assets, particularly non-operational  assets, have not been put into production in a large number of  enterprises that had adopted the shareholding system on an  experimental basis. One company in Tianjin, for instance, failed  to include 176 million yuan in state assets. Most commonly, land  use rights and other invisible assets are excluded. According to  a study on shareholding enterprises in Nanning and Wuzhou in  Guangxi Province, all 11 directional fund-raising shareholding  companies in the two cities failed to convert land into shares,  instead allowing the land to be used free of charge.    Enterprise Mismanagement Causes Loss of State Assets    State enterprises losing money. This is the biggest problem  facing China's state economy. Xiangtan Shi is one of the  industrially advanced areas in Hunan. The city's 79 state  enterprises within the budget had 3.434 billion yuan in combined  assets and 2.720 billion yuan in liabilities, which amounted to  79.5 percent of the former. Mismanagement-related losses  represent a particularly serious problem in former military  enterprises now converted to civilian production. These  enterprises have little funds at their own disposal and meager  self-development capability. As a result, much of their fixed  assets sit idle while they suffer extensive management-related  losses. A munitions factory in Hubei, for instance, had 7.16  million yuan in losses at the end of 1992.    Collective Enterprises Losing State Assets    It is a common phenomenon for collective enterprises to use  state assets gratuitously, even selling them off without  authorization. Hence the massive losses of state assets in  collective enterprises. Collective enterprises lose state assets  mainly in these ways:    Selling Off Equipment Without Permission    Some enterprises take up and use the state assets of  enterprises owned by the whole people without paying for them.  Because of mismanagement, they turn out high-priced but  poor-quality products and suffer extensive losses. To ease their  financial plight, these enterprises take it upon themselves to  sell off without authorization the machinery and equipment they  have been using. Regulations require them to use the income  derived from such sales to modernize and transform fixed assets.  Instead, many enterprises have used the income to cover losses  in their current account or give it out as wages, thus covertly  divvying up state assets.    Enterprises do a poor job in taking care of state assets.  What exists on the books and what they actually have in hand may  be two different things. Both cause state assets to be lost in  large quantities.    The way some collective enterprises manage the fixed state  assets in their use, including their changes, installation, use,  and upkeep and maintenance is utterly chaotic. Equipment is  discarded or lost but the books are not updated, so there is no  consistency between the two. This is a serious and widespread  problem.    Fixed Assests Under Compensated    When a collective enterprise uses state fixed assets, it  should take depreciation on them. In fact, many enterprises fail  to do so and the amount involved is huge. Fixed assets are  woefully underpaid. Moreover, the depreciation taken, instead of  being used to pay for the modernization of fixed assets, is  spent as benefits payments or bonuses. Thus state assets are not  compensated minimally, making even simple reproduction  unsustainable.    Using State Assets Without Compensation    Some enterprises owned by the whole people nominally lease  out their fixed assets to their collective enterprises for use  by the latter. In reality, however, no lease agreement was  signed by a representative of the lessor and the collective  enterprise, and certainly no leasing fee was collected. In  effect state assets are used gratuitously, an infringement upon  the rights and interests of the owner, the state.    Plants and Equipment Allowed To Sit Idle    Due to mismanagement and the poor quality of their products,  a number of collective enterprises have been losing money year  after year. Some of them have even suspended production, idling  many plants and much equipment. They neither report such idling  to the authorities above nor maintain and upkeep the equipment.  Thus the assets affected are not put to the proper use.    Administrative and Institutional Units Losing State  Assets    Administrative and institutional units use state assets  without paying for them to "raise revenue." The loss of state  assets mainly occurs when the revenue thus earned goes into  "mini treasuries," when nonoperational assets are turned into  operational assets, when money-making units fail to take  depreciation or do so minimally, and when the costs and expenses  of such units are not calculated accurately; that is, expenses  that should be paid for by the units are still taken care of by  the state treasury.    An investigation in late 1993 by the Guangxi regional  properties bureau into the loss of state assets by several  administrative and institutional units uncovers the following  problems:    Lack of effective methods to manage the state assets used in  revenue-raising activities and the profits derived therefrom.  Revenue-raising activities by administrative and institutional  units these days take a variety of forms, but for the most part  they involve leasing out state land or renting out stadiums,  buildings, houses, and equipment built or paid for by state  funds or using such land and facilities in joint business  ventures and contracting schemes.    Borrowing public funds to set up economic entities without  going through the regular borrowing procedures. To support their  newly established economic entities, most units make loans to  them from the extra-budget funds as seed money. However, a large  number of units fail to make out the proper loan agreements.  Instead, the loans are entered under the "temporary payment"  category on the books. Should the loan be used to pay investment  dividends or interest on loans? That is not clearly stated. Also  left undefined are the two parties' rights, responsibilities,  and interests. Even the loan's maturation period is unclear. In  the course of time it becomes difficult to track down where  funds have gone, determine whether they have been lost, or find  out who should be held liable.    Buildings, stadiums, and houses are rented out for  excessively long periods without going through the standard  evaluation and bidding procedures. In pursuit of profits,  administrative and institutional units lease out the buildings,  stadiums, and land for overly long periods of time. The land is  not appraised prior to the lease and there is no bidding before  a building is rented out. When land and buildings are leased out  at bargain rates for excessively long periods of time, the  interests of the state suffer directly.    Loss of State Assets in Assets Disposal    Land is being sold off at low prices. Some units allocated  land have made a fortune in real estate speculation. Public  housing is being sold at medium or low prices. Hengyang Shi in  Hunan Province is one city experimenting with housing reform. By  late June 1993, 3 million square kilometers of public housing  had been sold at prices averaging no more than 120 yuan per  square kilometer, while it cost between 950 and 980 yuan to  build one square kilometer of comparable housing in the city and  commercial housing was being sold at 1,200 yuan per square  kilometer. In other words, public housing was sold at one-eighth  the cost and one-tenth the market price.</p>

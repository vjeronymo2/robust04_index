			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: BT British Telecom's latest price cuts show that the company has learnt a thing or two about marketing. Reductions have been mandated by its regulator. But Oftel determines neither the precise timing of cuts nor which services they should focus on. In the past, BT often announced a confusing jumble of price changes once a year. But the company has now woken up to the fact that the timing and focus of price cuts can be used to throw the competition off balance. Cutting long-distance charges by up to 25 per cent is sensible since that is a market where competition from its main rival, Mercury Communications, is stiff. The timing looks designed to spoil the launch of Energis, which opened its long-distance service only this week. Further cuts can be expected to focus on international calls, where Mercury is also strong. But BT will probably hold fire until it has a better idea of the competition it will face from a new breed of international operators and so knows how to cause the maximum damage. BT is also becoming smarter about presenting price cuts. It now picks one service at a time and so can articulate a clear message. That is essential if it is to persuade customers, who generally think that calls are more expensive than they actually are, to use their telephones more. None of this is rocket science. But investors will pleased that BT's marketing department is no longer in the dark ages.</p>

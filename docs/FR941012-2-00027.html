In conducting the analysis, the lead agencies will involve the public and other agencies. The process will be documented in Draft and Final Environmental Impact Statements (EISs). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the Navy reservists in the Seattle area train at the Naval Reserve Readiness Center at Lake Union, located near the center of the city. The City of Seattle wishes to acquire that facility and incorporate it into a development project called the Seattle Commons. In light of this, Congress has requested that the Navy identify and evaluate alternative locations for a new Reserve Center to replace the Lake Union facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Army Reserve training facilities located within the 500 Area of Fort Lawton are in deteriorating condition and require replacement. The Army Reserve will consider replacement alternatives of these facilities in the same EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies' preferred alternative is to construct and operate a new, 120,000 square foot Joint Use Reserve Center at Fort Lawton. This new facility would be at a different location from the facilities the Army Reserve presently uses for weekend training and would accommodate the indoor training needs of approximately 1,300 Army and Navy Reservists. The Chief of Naval Reserve and the U.S. Army Reserve propose that the new Joint Use Reserve Center site be in the southwest corner of Fort Lawton, near the existing Army Reserve Headquarters offices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EIS will evaluate other sites within Fort Lawton, as well as other Federally-owned sites in the Seattle area. The agencies' decisionmakers will also consider alternatives involving separate, rather than joint facilities. They will also consider the alternative of taking no action. The evaluations of the reasonable alternatives will be documented in the EIS and made available for public review and comment before the agencies reach a decision as to how they will meet their needs for new facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agencies will hold a public meeting in November to help determine the scope of the EIS. At this meeting the Navy and the Army will describe the proposed action and will solicit comments from citizens, agencies and organizations about the issues and the alternatives to be addressed in the EIS. The date and time of the meeting will be publicized in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and the Magnolia News. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Navy Reserve and the Army Reserve welcome comments on the process. Questions about the EIS process may be directed to Mr. Don Morris At (206) 396&hyph;5976.

			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT RESIGNS FROM MEDSTONE INTERNATIONAL;  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: THE FIRM HAS FAILED TO WIN FEDERAL APPROVAL OF ITS EQUIPMENT TO  REMOVE GALLSTONES.  </P> <P> A month after suspending efforts to win federal approval for equipment to  remove gallstones, Medstone International Inc. announced Thursday that its  president and chief operating officer has resigned.  </P> <P> Richard Ferrari, who joined the company in April, resigned to pursue other  interests, the company said. His resignation comes less than seven weeks after  the company's founder and chairman, Freeman Rose, left the company in November.  </P> <P> Rose formed Medstone in October, 1984, to produce and market equipment known as  lithotripters, sophisticated shock-wave devices used to shatter kidney stones  and gallstones without surgery.  </P> <P> In November, the company announced it had given up on efforts to obtain Food  and Drug Administration approval to use its lithotripters for gallstone  procedures. The scientific community had raised questions about the  effectiveness of the machines for that purpose.  </P> <P> "The recent suspension of the gallstone lithotripsy program reduced the scope  of Medstone's shock-wave-therapy business, and prompted me to pursue other  personal growth opportunities," Ferrari said in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> Ferrari, a former executive vice president of ADAC Laboratories in Milpitas,  replaced acting president Jack Olshansky in April as president and chief  operating officer. He assumed the duties of chief executive after Rose gave up  the title in July. Ferrari could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> David V. Radlinski, executive vice president and chief financial officer of the  company, said Ferrari will be replaced internally in January from among members  of the executive staff.  </P> <P> Despite the recent setbacks, Radlinski said the company would continue to  market its technology for use in destroying kidney stones and attempt to shift  away from its dependence on medical capital equipment markets toward the larger  health-care business.  </P> <P> "We have $10 million and opportunities in different technologies," Radlinski  said. "No decisions have been made about future investments."  </P> <P> The company's stock closed Thursday at $1.25, down 12.5 cents in  over-the-counter trading.  </P> <P> For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, the company reported a loss of $2.3  million on revenue of $1.7 million, compared with a loss of $1.6 million on  revenue of $1.2 million. The loss reflected heavy competition for the company's  products, Radlinski said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By David Mason and Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister John Major flew into Sarajevo today  and announced a 12 million pound package of immediate aid for  war-torn Bosnia.    The deal includes 5 million pounds of direct aid to get key  public services running in Sarajevo and 7 million pounds to  support international aid agencies working throughout Bosnia.    Overseas Aid Minister Lady Chalker, who has just completed a  four-day review of British aid to Bosnia, said: "It's  pump-priming, it's paving the way for reconstruction. The whole  package of aid can help us get started on the reconstruction,  whether it's basic engineering for water and power, basic  infrastructure, mending bridges or basic medical."    Mr Major, accompanied on his first trip to the Bosnian  capital by Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, was met at the  airport by Lady Chalker and British UN Commander Lieutenant  General Sir Michael Rose.    They drove to General Rose's residence for talks through  streets which have come to life beneath the battle-scarred  buildings during the month-old ceasefire. Mr Major and General  Rose went on to meet Bosnian Vice-President Ejup Ganic to  discuss the peace process and the city's vital reconstruction  needs.    As they were holding talks at the presidency the boom from  an  artillery round echoed over the city, one of numerous minor  breaches of the ceasefire.    Mr Major was later visiting the city's central water pumping  station to meet British emergency aid engineers working to  repair and maintain water supplies, heating systems, power  distribution, sanitation and other key services over a wide area  of central Bosnia.    Their work provides a model for the Anglo-American  initiative  to get the city on its feet again which Mr Major and President  Clinton announced when the Prime Minister visited Washington  earlier this month.    While Mr Major was meeting Mr Ganic, Lady Chalker and Mr  Rifkind set off to visit the 70-strong Royal Artillery troop  manning the Cymbeline mortar-locating radar battery brought in  by General Rose to monitor breaches of the ceasefire.</p>

In a nutshell, the MOF release answers the question of "who  should pay the new tax" in great details while the MAF  announcement dealing with "what it will be spent on and how" is  full of "abstracts and ambiguities."    This is not to say that the MOF has done a good job or that  the MAF has made a blunder but that the plans clearly unveiled  the procedural problems involved. In other words, even before  arriving at a firm decision on future uses of the money from the  taxation in the light of the fundamental purpose of the new tax,  officials came up with numbers on the amount of collection,  e.g., "15 trillion won [W] over 10 years."    Because of the "original sin" inherent in the tax, the  principle of "measuring the need first, then tailoring the levy  to it"--stated in the first chapter of the textbook on public  finance--was ignored from the very beginning.    The MOF, which originally opposed the levying of the farm  relief tax, an earmarked tax, evidently took great pains to find  the revenue sources for it, which are not many to begin with,  while the MAF, which gained an annual W500 billion revenue  source as a result of the upheaval over the rice issue last  year, apparently prepared "in haste" the list of uses for the  money for honor's sake.    There is no denying that the rice issue was a big political  burden--so big that it drew the president's apology [following  the Uruguay Round settlement]. However, at a time when a water  pollution incident would easily lead to discussion of an  environmental protection tax, it is undoubtedly the taxpayer's  position that the process of establishing the new earmarked tax  and priorities involved should be put to a review before any  further steps on it are taken.    In this connection, the MAF explains that it is just  "prudent  with options."    It maintains that it needs to find a consensus of farmers  and  fishermen and their interest groups on how they want the money  to be spent, and that it will finalize its plan before the  collection begins in July.    The explanations, however, cannot convince the public of how  it came up with such a number as W1.5 trillion and why it is  needed.    The government should not handle tax business in a "surprise  show" style as it did when issuing the decree outlawing  financial transactions using aliases or borrowed names.    A glance at the MOF-released "Plan for the Farm-Relief  Special Tax" clearly indicates how difficult it is to collect  W1.5 trillion in additional tax a year. The plan, covering six  large branches, shows traces of a hard struggle to find revenue  from the already limited sources.    It is known that the original MOF plan focused on sectors  profiting from the marked opening under the Uruguay Round  settlement and on absorbing the profits as tax to finance the  relief program, but that it was turned down in the course of  interministry consultations.    Specifically, it was pointed out that profits from farm  imports at cheaper prices are already absorbed into the Farm  Prices Stability Fund and used to finance support programs for  farm and fishing communities, and that therefore, renaming the  levy and collecting them as tax would only be tantamount to  "moving the money from the husband's wallet to the wife's."    So, the MOF was compelled to look for revenue sources  elsewhere. The result was "irrationalities" as seen everywhere  in the announced plan. For example, the earlier tax cuts for  technology development, plant and equipment investment and for  savings incentive will be rescinded; the corporate tax will be  increased at the risk of weakening competitiveness; the  acquisition tax will be increased on houses and cars, even  though it could mean contradicting the existing long-term tax  reform plan designed to gradually reduce the net worth tax.    The unanimous hopes of the public for relief to the farm and  fishing communities must not be reduced to a daydream. The  important thing for the government to do right now is to try to  come up with a blueprint both specific and future-oriented and  showing how much money it intends to spend and on what, as soon  as possible.

Meanwhile, the projected Farm-Relief Special Tax will,  according to the MOF plan, be paid by:    --beneficiaries of the various tax cuts, who will be  required  to pay 20 percent of the cuts. But the levy will not be on every  earlier tax cut but only on the cuts in the income and corporate  taxes under the Regulation Law on Tax Reduction and Exemption  [RLTRE], in tariffs under the RLTRE and the Customs Tariff Law,  and in the acquisition, registration, property, and integrated  land taxes under the RLTRE and the Local Tax Law.    Cuts in the income and corporate taxes under the RLTRE mean  the special investment tax exemption for plant and equipment  investments by businesses; the deduction allowed of the income  from a capital increase when an enterprise has increased the  capital to improve its financial structure, and the cut in the  capital gain tax applied to cases of land expropriation by the  state. Percent cuts in tariffs under the RLTRE and the Customs  Tariff Law mean those applied to imports of ship and aircraft  parts and automation equipment.    Local tax cuts under the Local Tax Law and RLTRE include tax  exemption benefits for real estate acquired and retained by  nonprofit organizations.    Excluded from the foregoing cuts under the RLTRE are those  for state and local autonomous bodies, and for farmers and  fishermen (such as the transfer tax benefits on farmer-owned  land and the exemption granted farming cooperatives); tax  benefits authorized by international conventions (such as  exemptions for diplomats and tourists by international usage).    In the case of the transfer tax exemption under the  one-family-one-house program or the deduction allowed in the  earned income tax withholding from the monthly salaries, it is  not under the RLTRE but the Income Tax Law;, therefore, it is  excluded in principle from the new taxation. The exemption for  houses below the "national house" in size is indeed under the  RLTRE, but it involves neither an income tax nor a corporate tax  but a value-added tax and, therefore, is also excluded.    --earners of interests on tax-free or tax-cut savings  deposits. Currently, 18 types of savings deposits are either  free of the interest income tax, which is 20 percent of the  income (or 21.5 percent with the residential tax included) or  subjected to a 5 percent tax rate. Under the plan, all these  savings deposits are among the objects of the new tax.    The rate will be 2 percent on currently tax-free deposits  (such as the Worker Long-Term Savings Deposit), while  small-amount, family-type savings deposits, currently subject to  a 5 percent tax rate, will be assessed an additional 1.5  percent. Therefore, the current tax burden of 20 percent (or  21.5 percent with the residential tax included), 5 percent and 0  percent will respectively be changed to 21.5 percent, 6.5  percent and 2 percent. However, the long-term savings deposits  to prepare for the purchase of a house and the individual  annuities--to which the government had decided to give tax  benefits to induce long-term savings deposits--will not be taxed  under the plan.    --others:    --sellers of securities, currently paying 0.2 percent of the  proceeds from the sales in the securities transaction tax. They  will be required to pay a separate 0.1 percent in the new tax.  Therefore, the tax burden at the time of transaction will  increase from 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent.    --corporate tax payers, currently paying 18 percent for the  taxable amount less than 100 million won and 32 percent for that  in excess of 100 million won, will be required to pay an  additional 2 percent for the amount in excess of 100 million won  in the new tax for two years, a time-limit measure.    --acquisitors of houses or cars, currently paying 2 percent  of the acquisition cost in the acquisition tax, will be required  to pay 10 percent of that payment (0.2 percent of the  acquisition cost) in the Farm-Relief Special Tax. Houses smaller  than the "national house" in size will be exempted from the new  taxation, however.    --those who buy parimutuel tickets, currency paying 10  percent of the ticket price in parimutuel tax and 2 percent in  education tax, will under the plan be required to pay another 2  percent in the new tax, and the total tax burden will be 14  percent.</p>

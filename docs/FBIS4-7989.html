			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by V. Cvetkovska: "Losses Amounting to 11.7 Billion </F> Denars"]    [Text] What businessmen constantly warned about last year,  and what they constantly feared, became true in practice.  Taking into account the latest indicators about the financial  outcome of last year's business, expressed in the final economic  assessment and summed up in the Balance of Payments Department,  last year there was a real economic debacle.    With the continuing fall in industrial production increasing  to 13.9 percent last year, all other financial indicators  deteriorated. Losses in the economy rapidly increased nine times  over, compared to the slowed-down increase in gross profit of  approximately 2.5 times. Total expenditures last year exceeded  the total income realized by companies by 4.5 percent, because  of the high interest rates paid to banks, and the high costs  involved in maintaining normal production. Moreover, the  liquidity problem greatly deteriorated, because it was unable to  obtain payment for one-third of what it produced and sold. Under  such working circumstances, burdened by the present blockades to  the north and south, increased transport costs for alternative  transit, lost markets, and the minimum use of capacities, the  economy in 1993 succeeded in realizing a total income of 185.8  billion denars. Nevertheless, expenditures were higher than  income, amounting to 194.1 billion denars. Of that, the minimum  gross profit was 2.5 billion denars, just 1 percent of the total  income. That is why last year's loss beat the record, and at  11.7 billion denars, it also exceeded gross profit by some 9  billion denars.  <H5>  The Debts Rise </H5>   Negative tendencies are also evident in the income share, in  that the economy provides less money for economic needs, for  what could revive production, particularly for investment.  Nevertheless, money for salaries is given away in abundance.  The state economy is more pressed by the short-term and  long-term loans, its debts are constantly rising, and according  to some Chamber of Commerce assessments the economy's debts  reached 1.75 billion denars at the end of last year, with a  rising trend, thus they reached 2.2 billion denars in January  and February this year.    Although the companies' final accounts indicated that last  year, compared to the year before, they succeeded in increasing  total income to 4.4 percent, their expenditures also rose 4.6  percent, which was more than the realized income. Regarding the  structure of total income in the economy, it came mainly from  the sale of products, goods, and services (on that basis in 14  percent of cases income was less than in 1992), and what they  succeeded in "getting" was mainly from financing, that is,  interest rates and positive exchange rates. However, not even  that income was sufficient to cover expenses, and one-third of  the companies had greater expenses of 11.6 billion denars, while  the other two-thirds had only 3.3 billion denars greater income.  Thus, the overall account of the economy is for 8.3 billion  denars deficit. Several vital economic branches had greater  expenses than income, for instance metallurgy, the iron  industry, and the textile industry, as well as trade. There are  very symptomatic indications in the expenditure structures, that  is, the least is spent on materials, energy, spare parts, and  small accessories that relate directly to the production  process, thus the previous expenses of one-fifth were reduced to  only 19 percent. Moreover, the private and social sectors in  industry have greater orientation to trade, as something that  pays more at this moment. While production expenses decrease,  the non- material expenses rise, for instance salaries and  interest rates, as well as extraordinary expenses. The bank  interest rates are high, and along with the negative exchange  rates, they were responsible for removing 21.5 percent of the  total income, which exceeds costs for materials. Interest rates  have consumed 8 percent of the total income of private, and 25  percent of the state and mixed companies, which is a burden that  even the best companies cannot sustain.  <H5>  Each Third -- a Loser </H5>   The gross profit in the economy last year, compared to the  year before, has literally been halved and has almost  disappeared, and loss is more dominant. Gross profit has been  calculated as being almost the same in private and state  companies, the reason being that the private ones are more  efficient, have lower interest rates, but they also give smaller  salaries to their workers. The financial experts have  calculated that if private owners gave the same salaries as the  state ones, they would have no profit at all. To illustrate, if  the average salary last year was 3,274 denars, a smaller than  average salary was given to 84.2 percent of the employees in the  private sector, and 54.8 percent in the state sector.    On the other hand, the economy paid out 20 percent more  income than it earned last year, and this uncovered expenditure  is due to salaries and the financing of public consumption.  That is, last year the money for salaries was 5 percent  greater, 2 percent greater for public consumption, and 4 percent  greater for taxes. Half of the money in state companies went on  salaries last year, while the private owners spent more money on  investment.    Losses reached 11.7 billion denars, with every third company  in the state sustaining a loss (over 8,000 companies). Although  over 90 percent of the loss-making companies are private, 91  percent of the loss is in the state sector, and the total sum of  the loss indicates a more difficult situation than ever in the  economy.</p>

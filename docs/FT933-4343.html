			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Arts: Late premiere - Theatre THE American writer Jane Bowles (1917-73) wrote just one play, and here it is, receiving its British premiere, 40 years on. In the Summer House, colourfully located in southern California, belongs to the Tennessee Williams tradition of psychological-cum-social drama - a tradition descending from Ibsen, Chekhov, and Freud. Mainly about the interior lives of women, it not infrequently recalls the darker paths investigated in the same postwar period by Martha Graham's psychoanalytic dance-dramas. We see no less than three mother-daughter pairings, each one marked by selfishness, intimacy, vulnerability, insensitivity, and manipulation. The most 'dramatic' event is a death offstage, and it is Bowles's most audacious touch to make this occur during Act One. Was it an accident? It is officially accepted as such by all. But we are never sure; and we keep watching how the survivors react, months after. Yet Bowles is boldest of all in not making this death central to anyone's life. This is not a Patricia Highsmith thriller, where complicity and guilt colour everything. The death simply intensifies psychological threads that already run through the characters. The plot centres on the relationship between the passive, repressed Molly (in her late teens) and her elegant, controlling mother Gertrude. The summer house, in Gertrude's garden, is where Molly lingers sullenly: a womb-like symbol for the prepubescent state of protected dependence which Molly clings to. It is Molly who may or may not be responsible for the death of a sibling rival, Vivian Constable. During Act One, both Molly and Gertrude get married, but, whereas Molly does not want to leave home, her mother is ready to break from her daughter. The thrill of Act Two lies in our discovery that, 10 months later, neither mother nor daughter has really accepted the new men in their lives. Molly craves her mother and former home; Gertrude uses her daughter in her effort to flee from wedded non-bliss. All of which is complicated by the eerie presence of Mrs Constable, mother of the late Vivian. It is she who changes most during the play - from nervous fusspot, following awkwardly in her daughter's shadow, to half-crazed drunk, realising in her cups that her daughter and husband never loved her, tending some of Molly's filial scars. Derek Goldby's direction of this play at the Lyric Hammersmith has complete fluency and - thanks also to Hayden Griffin's designs - Californian atmosphere. Small roles are played with force, wit, and conviction. Only in Tom Bowles's playing of Molly's husband is there any of the usual British discomfort with American accents. Gertrude, Molly, Mrs Constable and Vivian Constable, four tricky roles, are acted by Rosemary Harris, Sophie Thursfield, Dana Ivey and Robin Weaver with assurance, skill, but not enough danger. Especially from Harris, who is so nearly a great actress, I wanted less charm, more edge.</p>

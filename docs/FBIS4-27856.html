			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 3 (YONHAP) -- South Korea, the  United States and Japan held a series of contacts here Friday  and discussed details of their plans for a U.N. Security Council  resolution imposing economic sanctions on North Korea.    The U.S. ambassador in charge of the North Korean nuclear  affair, Robert Gallucci, met separately with his South Korean  counterpart Kim Sam-hun and the Japanese Foreign Ministry's  director-general of the Diplomatic Policy Bureau, Shunji Yanai.    They are scheduled to hold a tripartite meeting Saturday  morning to coordinate their positions on possible U.N. sanctions  against Pyongyang.    Following his meeting with Gallucci, Kim said that since the  chance of measuring nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor  has been lost, it is even more important for the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to conduct special inspections of  nuclear waste facilities at Yongbyon. "There is no need to  abandon dialogue with North Korea if suspicions over North  Korea's nuclear intentions could be dispelled through (the  IAEA's) special inspections," Kim said. Kim thus indicated that  the international community plans to apply economic pressure on  North Korea while demanding that it permit special inspections.    Asked about the possibility of resuming dialogue with North  Korea, Kim said that at this juncture it is important to propose  and adopt a Security Council resolution on economic sanctions.  But the Security Council's main aim is to resolve the dispute  over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program, Kim said.  "Therefore, dialogue with North Korea can be resumed depending  on North Korea's attitude and if there is a possibility that the  fundamental problems can be solved."    South Korea, the United States and Japan are pushing a  Security Council resolution on economic sanctions that could  have a practical impact, Kim said. Kim hinted that the three  countries would press for the resolution at the earliest  possible date, grabbing the opportunity as IAEA Director-general  Hans Blix is scheduled to explain the agency's inspection  results to the council Friday afternoon.    The Korean ambassador said he understood that U.S. and South  Korean military officials are conducting close coordination in  preparation for a possible rise in tension on the Korean  peninsula.    Meanwhile, Gallucci held a special press briefing Friday and  explained that the United States has already begun consultations  with its allies on appropriate action against North Korea.    "Thus far, with our brief initial meeting, I detect no  differences between us and our South Korean allies," Gallucci  said. He stressed that international sanctions against North  Korea would not destroy the basis for resolving the issue.  Gallucci said there were three ways to determine what happened  in 1989 at the 5-megawatt reactor:    -- by additional information provided by North Korea.    -- by special inspection of the radioactive waste sites'  operating history through non-destructive analysis of fuel  discharged from the reactor.    -- by reconstruction of the reactor operating history  through  nondestructive analysis of fuel discharged from the reactor.    Blix has said that the third way has been irrevocably  destroyed as a methodology for the IAEA and therefore the  overall ability to ascertain what happened in the past has been  seriously eroded, he said. But Gallucci was quick to add that  "that does not mean (they are) destroyed."    The IAEA, with the full cooperation of North Korea, could  still get at it, he said. In effect, Gallucci hinted that there  was room to resume negotiations, depending on the North Koreans'  attitude.    Asked about the purpose of economic sanctions, Gallucci  said:  "We are looking for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, we are  looking for full NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] adherence  (by North Korea), we are looking for full-scope safeguards, the  acceptance of special inspections and the implementation of the  North-South declaration on denuclearization."</p>

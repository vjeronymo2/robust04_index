			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under &sect;121.1603(a)(4), a protest is considered premature until identification of the prospective awardee. Traditionally, this identification occurs at bid opening or, in the case of a negotiated procurement, at the point the contracting officer notifies other offerors of the intended award and names the prospective awardee. SBA believes that the concept of notification applicable to protests filed by other offerors is not appropriate with respect to contracting officers, since it is the contracting officer who does the notification. Thus &sect;121.1603(a)(4) will merely require that a contracting officer wait until he or she has identified the apparent successful offeror before filing a protest concerning that firm's size status. Such a restriction will ensure that SBA does not impose the burdens of an unnecessary size investigation on other offerors or expend its limited resources rendering size determinations that are unlikely to have any practical significance for the procurement in question. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This clarification of SBA's procedural regulations governing premature protests applies to all pending protests as well as all size determinations for which a final decision has not yet been rendered by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance With Executive Orders 12866, 12612 and 12778; the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.; and the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. CH 35 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of Executive Order 12866, SBA certifies that this rule will not have an economic effect in excess of $100 million, result in a major increase in costs for individuals or governments, or have a significant adverse effect on competition and, therefore, will not constitute a major or significant rule. SBA has made this determination because the rule is purely procedural in nature and will impose no additional filing or other requirements and, as such, does not represent a significant regulatory event. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of Executive Order 12612, SBA certifies that this rule will not have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of Executive Order 12778, SBA certifies that the rule is drafted, to the extent practicable, in accordance with the standards set forth in section 2 of that Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, SBA certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities, for the same reason that it will not be a major or significant rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, SBA certifies that the rule will not impose a new recordkeeping or reporting requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 13 CFR Part 121 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure; Government procurement; Small business. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth above, part 121 of title 13, Code of Federal Regulations, is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 121_[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

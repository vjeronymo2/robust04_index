"The death  sentence must be carried out, regardless of whether the renegade  (Rushdie -- NRC HANDELSBLAD editor's note) is repentant," read  the statement issued yesterday by the official Iranian press  agency IRNA. The comment was made on the fifth anniversary of  the death sentence against Rushdie declared by the late  Ayatollah Khomeyni due to the supposedly blasphemous nature of  his book The Satanic Verses.    Minister Kooijmans wants to push within the Council of  Ministers for action to be taken against Iran. The Greek  presidency, according to a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry,  is considering approaching the Iranian Government on behalf of  the 12 member states of the European Union, in order to show its  disgust over the Rushdie affair. The Netherlands does not plan  to scale down its diplomatic relations with Iran, said the  spokesman. [passage omitted]</p>

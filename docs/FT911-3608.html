			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: McCarthy &amp; Stone losses rise to Pounds 6.4m MCCARTHY &amp; STONE, the UK's biggest builder of retirement homes, announced deepened losses of Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 5.7m) on turnover down from Pounds 38.3m to Pounds 33.1m for the six months to end-February. Basic losses per share were 14.4p (9.6p). The interim dividend, however, is maintained at 0.5p. Mr John McCarthy, chairman, said he remained cautious about the level of sales for the rest of the year. Volumes were virtually unchanged during the first half with 404 units sold compared with 408. Reductions in working capital meant group borrowings, excluding a convertible loan stock of which Pounds 14.8m is outstanding, fell from Pounds 90.4m to Pounds 87.4m, cutting gearing to 96 per cent. Inclusive of the convertible, gearing was 112 per cent. The half-year period was affected by a drop in the contribution from land sales and other operating income, including sale of fixed assets and commissions earned by Peverel, the management company. The company said land sales resulted in a profit of Pounds 200,000, down from Pounds 500,000, while other operating income accounted for Pounds 1.1m, against Pounds 2.6m. In anticipation of an upturn next year, the company has recommenced construction on a number of sites. Stocks at February 28 comprised a land bank of 2,189 units plus 253 units at various stages of construction and 1,413 available for sale. Interest took Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 9.1m). The tax credit arising on losses is not yet being accounted for. COMMENT There was some encouraging news in these results in that, after a very sharp fall last year, volumes appear now to be trundling along the bottom. That still leaves all those long-term investors who bought into McCarthy &amp; Stone a few years ago, when sheltered housing was all the rage, almost as woeful as the elderly would-be customers of the company who found they could not sell their existing homes. Still, the company is a reasonable play on the expected recovery in its market niche. However, it should be remembered that as a longer-term strategy McCarthy has turned its back on nursing homes - thought by many to be coming thing as the elderly survive for ever more years - having complained it could not make decent returns. After losing Pounds 10.8m last year, it should produce a deficit of about Pounds 8m this time before the pre-tax line moves back into the black in 1992. The shares presented a buying opportunity at a low of 33p last December, but that evaporated with a subsequent sharp recovery. Yesterday they stood at just above 90p.</p>

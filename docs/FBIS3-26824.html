Chen Zhili, an  activist of the "Shanghai clique" and the former head of the  Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee,  did not take up the post as director of RENMIN RIBAO, as the  news spread among the people. The ultra-leftists still have  considerable influence in the ideological field.    According to a source from Beijing's intellectual circles,  Xu  Weicheng, a trusted person in the Cultural Revolution and the 4  June incident, still holds the position as executive deputy head  of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee in  charge of ideological and political work. In the Central  Propaganda Department, except for the department head Ding  Guangen (a member of the Politburo highly trusted by Deng  Xiaoping), Xu Weicheng holds the highest position. Although  Cheng Bijian, former political secretary of the late General  Secretary Hu Yaobang, has been transferred to the Central  Propaganda Department to take charge of theoretical and  propaganda work, his actual position is lower than Xu Weicheng's  because of the latter's seniority in the Central Propaganda  Department.    Recently, Xu Weicheng made a speech at a national meeting to  review experience of ideological and political work in  enterprises. He criticized the view that "ideological work in  enterprises is not indispensable," and expressed the necessity  of strengthening the confidence of cadres in charge of political  work in enterprises.    At present, CPC committees and branches are being set up in  Hong Kong- and Taiwan-invested enterprises in various localities  so that CPC committees are able to exercise control over the  workers and staff members in foreign-invested enterprises. Xu  Weicheng has participated in the activities of enterprise party  committees to strengthen ideological and political work. He  stressed the necessity of guarding against Hong Kong and Taiwan  investors who may take advantage of investment to carry out  "peaceful evolution."    A noted personality in Beijing's intellectual circles  disclosed that Deng Liqun (the former head of the Propaganda  Department and secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central  Committee), a "leftist prince" who is more famous than Xu  Weicheng, harbors "resistant sentiments" against the replacement  of the planned economy by the market economy, and is privately  writing articles of criticism on this subject.    In addition, the "leftist princes" in the literary and  artistic circles -- including Lin Mohan, Liu Baiyu, Malqinhu,  Zang Kejia, and so on -- who had murderous looks on their faces  during the 4 June incident, also are controlling some  ultra-leftist publications and are resisting in-depth economic  structural reform by roundabout ways.    Personalities from Beijing's intellectual circles pointed  out: Deng Xiaoping has always employed his "political left hand"  and "economic right hand" simultaneously so as to exercise  absolute control over the ideological field in order to prevent  the recurrence of the Hu Qili and Zhu Houze error of stressing  material progress at the expense of cultural and ideological  progress. That is why he still installed Xu Weicheng and Wang  Renzhi, former head of the Central Propaganda Department, in  important positions.    Previously, Xu Weicheng, a trusted follower of Zhang  Chunqiao, had been in charge of Shanghai's party newspaper  JIEFANG RIBAO for a long time, and was transferred to be  editor-in-chief of BEIJING RIBAO during the Cultural Revolution.  At that time, he set up the "Model of Huang Shuai" who,  "although a pupil, dared to scold her teachers," and became a  pawn of Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao in Beijing's propaganda  circles. Xu and a number of leftist princes still hold power in  the CPC's propaganda, theoretical, cultural, and educational  departments and their affiliated organizations, which signifies  that the "leftist poison" on the mainland has not been  eliminated.</p>

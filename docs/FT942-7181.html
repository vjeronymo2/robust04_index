			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Viag forecasts a full recovery by year-end Viag, the German industrial conglomerate, yesterday said it was on the way to a full recovery following a 19 per cent drop in group profits to DM302m (Dollars 183.27) from DM371m the year before. The dividend will remain unchanged at DM9. Mr Alfred Pfeiffer, chief executive, said profits in the first quarter of this year rose about 33 per cent and were expected to grow at the same level for the year overall. He said the group's industrial sectors, including aluminium and chemical units, were performing particularly well. Viag said it was 'confident' it would win the bid for a data transmission contract, due to be awarded by the post ministry later this month. In July the company will complete its takeover of Bayernwerk, Germany's third largest utility, for which it will pay the Bavarian government DM5.515bn, including a cash payment of DM2.3bn. Viag said the deal was 'not cheap', but 'still pretty attractive' given Bayernwerk's annual pre-tax profits of about DM1bn and the high liquidity of the electricity generation business. The takeover of Bayernwerk will increase group turnover to about DM40bn, moving Viag into the top 10 German companies in sales terms. Mr Pfeiffer said the company would still consider acquisitions to extend its chemicals unit but this would only happen once Bayernwerk had been fully consolidated. Group turnover in 1993 fell two per cent to DM23.7bn, from DM24.3bn the year before, due to losses in the aluminium and packaging operations. The company has spent DM120m on redundancy costs for about 10 per cent of its workforce and said it would shed a further 4,000 jobs this year.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: The threat to interest relief on mortgages / A look at the cost of Miras, increasingly seen as a burden by government JUST two years after Norman Lamont, the chancellor, abolished higher rate tax relief on mortgage interest, speculation is mounting that the sacred cow of Miras, mortgage interest relief at source, might again be under threat. With a public sector borrowing requirement approaching Pounds 37bn this financial year, and expectations that it might top Pounds 50bn in 1993-94, there is no shortage of guesses about the measures the government might take to reduce it. The cost of Miras to the government has been falling but it is still expensive. It is expected to cost the Treasury Pounds 5.2bn this year, down from Pounds 6.1bn in 1991-92. The fall is a reflection of the sluggish housing market and the lowering of interest rates last year. In 1990-91, the last year of marginal rate tax relief, the cost of Miras peaked at Pounds 7.7bn. Miras has been criticised for being an inefficient subsidy since it is applied at a flat rate to all borrowers, regardless of financial position. It has also been blamed for helping to keep house prices high. But two measures have watered down the distortionary effects on the housing market. The first was the Pounds 30,000 ceiling on loans, increased from Pounds 25,000 in 1983 but not raised since. This was followed in 1991 by the abolition of higher rate tax relief. The announcement that dual mortgage tax relief would be abolished in 1988 was highly inflationary but its disappearance has now helped to reduce the importance of Miras to home buyers. Nevertheless, experts believe that abolishing Miras might have a disastrous effect on confidence in the housing market, unless it were accompanied by other measures, for example encouraging first-time buyers. There are 9.7m people who benefit from Miras. The greatest number - 5.8m - earn between Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 25,000. None would welcome, but many could afford, to lose the existing relief - Pounds 637 a year on a Pounds 30,000 mortgage - particularly if it were phased out rather than removed in one go. Those who would be most affected by abolition are at the bottom end of the market. The interest at 8.5 per cent on a Pounds 50,000 mortgage is Pounds 354 a month and Miras brings this figure down to Pounds 301 a month - a 17 per cent difference. Ian Darby, of mortgage brokers John Charcol, says that this could make the difference between buying or renting for prospective first-time buyers. At current rates of interest, there is little difference between the cost of buying or renting and most people would therefore prefer to buy. He says: 'Removing Miras might tilt the balance again against buying. Those at the middle and top end of the market are reliant on the bottom end to get the chain moving.' Estate agents have been reporting increased activity in December and January. David Goldsworthy, president of the National Association of Estate Agents, says that it would not be helpful of the government to abolish Miras when such interest has just started to pick up. 'House prices would fall and it could make the negative equity situation worse,' he says. Mindful of the possibility of such an effect, there have been a number of suggestions to change Miras but to use the the savings to galvanise the bottom end of the market. Halifax, the UK's largest lender, has suggested raising the ceiling for first-time buyers only. The extra relief could then be phased out over a number of years. But this measure might still prove more costly than the existing system unless mortgage relief was withdrawn from other borrowers: Halifax suggests phasing out tax relief for existing owner-occupiers. However, there is concern about penalising those who already have mortgages. 'We would want existing borrowers to be protected,' said Adrian Coles, of the Council of Mortgage Lenders. 'We are in deep recession with high arrears and repossessions. It would not be sensible to make existing mortgages more expensive.' Michael Shaw, chief executive of Britannia building society and chairman of the Building Societies Association, agrees. 'I would rather the government left Miras untouched because in the present state of the market, any changes could be disruptive,' he said. However, Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, supports the gradual phasing out of Miras but, in the current state of the property market, believes it could be combined with incentives for first time buyers. He would also like the government to use the money saved by providing low income mortgage owners with a subsidy similar to the housing subsidy to which those in the rental sector are entitled. Short-term incentives, however, carry their own danger. The temporary abolition of stamp duty on properties worth up to Pounds 250,000 at the end of 1991, is now agreed to have been little short of a disaster. 'It didn't create more sales - it just bunched them up. There was a rush of activity and then the market went dead,' said Paul Burgin, of Abbey National, the second largest lender. 'We welcome moves to help the housing market but not short-term measures that distort it.' John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips and Drew, is another critic of Miras but thinks that withdrawing it without a substitute would cause psychological damage to a stagnant market. His idea is to withdraw Miras but give instead a lump sum grant of Pounds 3,000-Pounds 4,000 to all house buyers to encourage movement in the market. In order to avoid the stamp duty syndrome, when buyers rushed to complete before the tax was reimposed last August, he says the government should not announce the suspension of the lump sum payment long in advance. But it could be removed once the housing market started to pick up. Daniel Dorling, housing research fellow at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, regards Miras as a waste of money. 'The problem with Miras is that only a small proportion of it goes to the people who need the relief. It doesn't help young buyers. It is a badly-targetted, inefficient subsidy. ' He suggests phasing Miras out by reducing the Pounds 30,000 ceiling by Pounds 1,000 each quarter on mortgages. The money saved could be used to support the bottom end of the market by buying up properties for social housing. Dorling does not believe the effect on the property market would be negative but prospective housebuyers could be given an incentive in the form of the removal of stamp duty. It is clear that the government would have to apply any changes to Miras carefully so that confidence in an already fragile housing market is not further undermined. It may begin with gentle tinkering of the subsidy but it seems increasingly certain that Miras's days are numbered.</p>

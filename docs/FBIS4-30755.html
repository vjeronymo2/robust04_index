			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by correspondent Eva </F> Hulkova at the Lany presidential residence; date not given; from  the "Conversations at Lany" program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Hulkova] At a news conference in the Forum  Hotel, which was attended by many journalists, you said that on  principle the Czech side will not comment on the election  contest in Slovakia. [passage omitted]    [Havel] A process of shaping views, political shaping is  under way there. It is a new phase of shaping democracy in  Slovakia. It is very important that we are aware of all this.    However, at the same time, we should be very careful when  commenting on individual political entities. The fact that the  standard norm among states is not to intervene in others'  internal affairs is one reason for us to observe this. The  other reason is that both sides, and especially the Slovak side,  are still very sensitive. It is difficult to guess what  intention, be it even a good intention, might produce opposite  results--whether a statement in support of someone will not be  used by someone else against the person in whose support the  statement was made. The current situation in Slovakia,  especially in the pre-election period, simply demands certain  restraint, certain caution, and calls for work on specific  issues.    At the same time, no scope should be given for turning any  Czech step, or any step taken by a Slovak official concerning  the Czech side, into something that causes an emotive playing of  the so-called Czech card on the Slovak internal political scene.    I would like to add that my meeting with President Michal  Kovac concentrated on the theme of spiritual, cultural  coexistence. [passage omitted]    During my talks on coexistence I came across interesting  phenomena. On one side Slovakia has achieved its own statehood  and many citizens have begun to feel part of that community.  Regardless of their previous support or lack of support for  Slovakia's independence, nowadays they perceive Slovakia as  their own state. They have begun to feel proud of their state.  This of course is all right. However, at the same time, they  seem to miss something they were used to, something as natural  for them as breathing--that is the common Czech-Slovak spiritual  dimension. [passage omitted]    An interesting thing is that this loss is paradoxically felt  more intensively in Slovakia than in the Czech Lands--this a bit  of a paradox given the fact that it was above all Slovakia that  expressed the desire to have its own state. This situation is  as it is because our relationship has always been a bit  asymmetric, as if Slovakia was more used to receiving impulses  from Bohemia than the Czech Lands receiving them from Slovakia.  [passage omitted]    However, I think that it is also in our interest not to  allow  links to be severed that do not need to be, and whose severance  will be damaging to us, in fact. [passage omitted]    [Hulkova] Let us take a look at one, I would say, highly  contentious moment in your work, at least in terms of the  reaction. You signed a document that put a definitive seal on  the restitution of property to physical Jewish persons. It  aroused a very lively array of rather negative reactions. So  what do you think about it?    [Havel] [passage omitted] Citizens of Jewish belief or  nationality had their property confiscated during the war by a  law derived from the Nuremberg laws. In addition, other  property was also seized, but this was usually done by executive  means and such cases were more a minority. After the war,  President Edvard Benes issued a decree from which there later  stemmed legislation rectifying injustices concerning property.  It is stated in the original decree that property must be  returned to people persecuted because of their race,  nationality, or politics. This amendment applies to restitution  of property solely to those people who were persecuted for  reasons of race. This is because on account of the Communist  coup in 1948 it proved impossible to realize. Even though  claims were laid, they were never finally met.    Objections to this law referred to the fact that the law  applies only to people persecuted for reasons of race and not  those others who were persecuted for reasons of nationality or  politics. I would naturally also prefer it if the law applied  to all groups of people referred to in the original Benes  decree. It would be cleaner. Nevertheless, there is no reason  why a law should not be ratified that refers to only one group  of these people. The fact that it uses the expression that they  were persecuted for racial reasons is entirely unavoidable  because that is how this group was defined even in the original  Benes decree, in spite of the fact that there were other groups  in addition. If we wish to rectify this injustice, we must use  this definition again. This group was by far the worst  affected. The use of the word racial does not constitute  introducing any kind of racial criteria into the law, but it is  not possible to rectify injustice inflicted on somebody without  using the same term, whereby that person was defined when the  injustice was committed. In other words, there was no reason of  principle nor any moral or constitutional reason for not  ratifying such a law, the more so given that if I had not  ratified it and returned it to parliament it is questionable  whether it will ever have been passed a second time.    Let us go to a more general question now. As it is known, we  do not have a Senate. One of the Senate's tasks is to monitor  the work of the Chamber of Deputies and act as a safety net  should some laws not be very good. [passage omitted]    Because we do not have a Senate, many expect the president  to  play the Senate's role, they expect the president will somehow  improve the laws or propose various changes in the laws.    There are always some who frequently criticize the laws I  sign. They reproach me for signing them. But this boils down to  the fact that these people do not understand the essence of the  right of veto. [passage omitted]    The president's task is not to veto laws just because he  dislikes this or that in them. Although, in this particular law  there are things I quite dislike, it is not a good enough reason  for me to return the law. Thus, the president cannot be  continually required to play the Senate's role. The parliament  will have to make a decision whether or not we should have the  Senate and on ways of electing the Senate. But it is impossible  to have the Senate equipped with certain powers written in the  Constitution, and yet to fail to form the Senate and, at the  same time, to unwittingly expect that its powers should be  executed by some other constitutional institution.    [Hulkova] Your claim that you are going to veto the laws  only  if they seriously fail to meet your ideas seems to me to be a  bit of an excuse because the legislators in this country do not  greatly differ from you and will not create something where  there will be a chance of you absolutely disagreeing with it. I  fear that (?given this context) you will never use the right of  veto.    [Havel] I will use it. I have already done so on one  occasion. Other situations when I will use it will undoubtedly  arise. But to a certain extent these will always be exceptional  situations. That is how I understand this Constitution and that  is how things should be, I think. [passage omitted]    [Hulkova] Do you really think it is bad that since there is  no Senate, you are expected to play a certain role that will  temporarily replace the Senate, as it were? Is this such a bad  situation?    [Havel] I think it is. The roles of individual  constitutional institutions should be clearly defined, they  should be indisputable, and should not be confused. [passage  omitted]    [Hulkova] So we have returned to the topic of the Senate and  I reckon we could launch another edition of Conversations from  Lany.    [Havel] [passage omitted] There is one thing I would like to  say about this topic, though. I think that to maintain the  present state of affairs is untenable from the long-term  viewpoint. This means that on the one hand, the Senate has been  written into the Constitution, and yet we do not actually have  one. There are yet other consequences of this state of affairs.  At the time when the Chamber of Deputies is dissolved, it is  the Senate that takes over its work. Since we do not have the  Senate, it appears there is no one to take over the role of the  parliament if it is dissolved and that is why the final clauses  of our Constitution say that our Chamber of Deputies cannot be  disbanded.    But this state of affairs is unthinkable in democracy. It  means we lack one of the basic instruments for solving possible  political crises. [passage omitted]    That is why I think that the present, very turbulent climate  surrounding the issue of the Senate in political circles is a  genuinely important factor for this country. At first glance it  appears that citizens are not interested in it, that it does not  concern them, and that they are not experiencing it as a burning  issue of paramount importance. I absolutely understand it. But  the consequences of it could very seriously affect society  later. [passage omitted]</p>

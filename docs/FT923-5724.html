			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Observer: Ready-to-wear Recognition at last for the world's condom industry. Recent news from as far afield as Japan and Russia demonstrate that the industry is finally coming out of the closet. Japanese couturier Michiko Koshino, has launched the country's first designer condom. This season's colours are pink, blue, and natural. Called Michiko London, it will be produced in a tie-up with Fuji Latex, Japan's second largest condom maker, and sold through the 50 retail outlets in Japan which bear her name. The American and European markets are next on the list. Koshino says her 31 licensees who run the shops were at first uneasy but had been won around. 'Having a condom in the handbag is fashionable for a young woman', she avers. Koshino will donate her share of the profits - she expects annual sales of Y2bn - to AIDS causes. Japan no longer thinks of the HIV virus as a foreigner's problem. Meanwhile, Observer hears that shopkeepers who run short of small change in the Russian port of Severomorsk have found a novel solution - they give their customers condoms instead. Newspaper kiosks have started using contraceptives as small change instead of more traditional alternatives like bus tickets, sweets or tiny packets of salt. It is not clear whether the kiosk owners are trying to promote safe sex or simply getting rid of excess stocks.</p>

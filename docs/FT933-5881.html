			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Deserving winner in LWT share scheme Sir, In your article on the beneficiaries of the LWT share scheme, Anwer Bati is quoted describing Barry Cox as 'a very nice guy, was an ordinary programme maker. Now he's worth Pounds 1.5m'. At the time of Bati's brief spell at LWT as researcher in features, Cox was controller of current affairs and features, known throughout not just LWT but the industry. He had been originating editor of The London Programme, still going after nearly two decades and, as a quality local series, a prime earner of brownie points for franchise renewal. Cox invented a range of other programmes, including The Six O'Clock Show, a pioneer among 'infotainment' ventures which gave Greg Dyke his first chance to shine as editor. As controller of corporate affairs, Cox had a key role in formulating and implementing the strategy that won the new franchise on which the current share price is based. In LWT's game of chance, Barry Cox is one of the deserving winners. Paul Neuburg, Pulse Productions, 41 Crediton Hill, London NW6 1HS</p>

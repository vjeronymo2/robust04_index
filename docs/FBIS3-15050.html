			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] St. Petersburg Fifth Channel Television  in Russian at 2000 GMT on 20 February 1994 as the final item of  ITOGI, broadcasts an interview with Sergey Filatov, head of the  Russian President's administration and Viktor Ilyushin,  Yeltsin's first aide by announcer Yevgeniy Kiselev.    Kiselev begins his report by saying that a plan for  restructuring the presidential staff was submitted to Yeltsin  and, according to Kiselev, was approved by the president on 18  February. Rumor has it that two conflicting plans were drawn up  by Filatov and by Ilyushin, Kiselev say. Did this mean that the  presidential entourage was split into two conflicting groupings  led by these two people? The joint interview by Filatov and  Ilyushin was given specially to clarify the situation.    Kiselev asks them which of their two plans Yeltsin had given  preference to. Filatov says: "We have a joint, agreed version  on which we worked together. We are in fact continuing to form  the presidential administration -- a process started last year.  It has two aspects. The president's aides are in charge of one  aspect that involves day-to-day organization of work and  operational assistance. The other is the bureaucratic aspect  that deals with the purely administrative facilities for  implementing this work."    When Kiselev asks again whose plan Yeltsin had chosen,  Ilyushin answers: "I would like to say that there is only one  leader in the administration, Sergey Aleksandrovich Filatov. I  would like to stress that all presidential aides are members of  the presidential administration, and that all structures within  the administration are working for the president. It is simply  that a certain part of it, the president's cabinet as we call  it, or his aides, is working in a slightly closer contact with  the president than some other structures."    Filatov and Ilyushin both say there were no disagreements  between them.    Ilyushin then says: "An episode comes to my mind that  occurred about a month ago. Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin invited  me to his office and asked: `Viktor Vasilyevich, is it true that  you are preparing a plan for the presidential administration  where the president's aides would play the decisive role in all  organizational matters?' This question surprised me because  there had been many different plans."    Kiselev then asks if the current reorganization of the  president's staff meant its expansion. Filatov says that the  overall number of people employed in the administration will  remain the same, about 2,000, including technical personnel.  Ilyushin adds that the aides' department consisted of 38 people  and that the aide for national security issues was soon to have  his own staff.    The conversation than switches to President Yeltsin's state  of health. Kiselev asks if Yeltsin really had a severe cold or  if there were political reasons behind his illness. Ilyushin  replies: "I have known Boris Nikolayevich long enough to be able  to say that he does not fall ill easily, but if it does happen,  it takes him a long time to get over it. I think this is a  typical feature of strong people. As for the present situation  -- yes, he is a bit unwell but of course we must take his age  into consideration, and anyway, if all invalids worked as he is  working now, things would be moving much faster in Russia."  Kiselev says that Yeltsin has a tendency to withdraw from  public at times of serious crises and recalled several occasions  from the past three years when this happened. Ilyushin  disagrees: "True, our president sometimes reserves his judgment  but eventually he always states his opinion. And it seems to me  that he always does it at the right moment. It is  characteristic of Boris Nikolayevich to know when it is the  right time to state his views."    Kiselev and Ilyushin then discuss the question whether  Yeltsin's personal life should be in the focus of public  attention as much as that of U.S. presidents. Ilyushin says it  was a foreign tradition alien to Russia and moreover, that  Yeltsin disliked being in the public eye. However, they agreed  that he ought to be warned that a greater openness was expected  of him. Filatov says: "Such matters usually get whipped up  before some very serious political events. Apparently,  preparations for another period of tension and confrontation are  under way. God save us from this," to which Kiselev replies:  "Well, in that case a greater openness to the press on the part  of the president could knock the trump cards from the hands of  his opponents."</p>

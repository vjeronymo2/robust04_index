			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Russia and the IMF RUSSIA's economic reform strategy is showing alarming signs of drift. But if Russia's reform collapses, the west will bear a large part of the blame. Further reforms will remain on hold until the International Monetary Fund finally reaches an agreement with the Russian government and unlocks the promised western aid. The longer the IMF prevaricates, the less likely it is that these reforms will occur. At first sight, the IMF's caution appears justified. The promotion of Mr Gaidar to prime minister cannot disguise the fact that in recent weeks the grip of the reformers has slipped and the influence of the military-industrial lobby within the cabinet has risen along with the inflation rate. Yet western advisers do not have to travel many miles from the sheltered grandeur of Moscow's Metropol hotel to understand the source of the political and economic tensions with which Mr Yeltsin and his government are struggling. While the government's macroeconomic policy failures are easily visible to Moscow-based statisticians, it is Russia's distorted and backward industrial structure that is the root of the budgetary and monetary mess. The disintegration of the old command system has left many enterprises without markets for their products or money to pay their workers. They are currently being kept afloat by unpaid debts and subsidies from the government budget deficit financed by the central bank. To withdraw these subsidies would mean the collapse of enterprises and the disintegration of the economic and social stability of whole cities and regions. Such an implosion would be economically wasteful. For Mr Yeltsin it would also be politically inconceivable. Convertible rouble If reform continues, privatisation and the growth of the service sector will soon begin to provide alternative sources of employment, while a convertible rouble will open up new export markets and provide the viable enterprises with imports at reasonable prices. A more gradual withdrawal of government subsidies would then inevitably lead to the closure of many enterprises. Yet the government will need both time and western aid if these structural reforms are to work; and the reformers are unlikely to receive either unless the government can sign an agreement with an IMF which apparently wants it to close its budget deficit now. Hyperinflationary threat The IMF is, of course, correct to argue that hyperinflation will quickly de-rail these necessary structural reforms. Only when the government stops printing money will the hyperinflationary threat recede and currency convertibility have any chance of success. Moreover, commitments from the Russian government mean little or nothing if the rouble printing presses in the other republics are working overtime. The sooner that Ukraine - the worst culprit - follows Estonia's example and leaves the rouble area, the better. Harder to understand is the IMF's apparent desire that the Russians should not only stop financing the budget deficit by printing money, but should also balance the budget before aid is made available. Economic logic does not require such a commitment; and political logic makes meeting it impossible. The motivation for the west's Dollars 24bn aid package was surely to allow the government to bridge the gap between its commitments and outgoings. What the Russian government needs is creative ideas on how to finance its budget deficit in a non-inflationary way. For the moment, the gap will have to be partly closed by foreign aid, conditional on structural reform as well as macroeconomic stability. But western aid should be a short-term crutch, not an artificial limb. A resource rich country should have little trouble in raising finance from abroad: by selling oil futures, land or even index-linked debt. The west is running out of time. The interminably slow pace of the IMF negotiations must be accelerated - and the current ream of petty disputes solved - before the chance of reform is lost. Even if an agreement were to be reached in the next fortnight, the economic and political pressures would make the risks of failure high. But for the IMF to delay for so long that the opportunity to sign an agreement with a reformist minded government disappeared would be a greater failure.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Royal Bank sells Pounds 116m stake in 3i Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday disclosed that it had sold its entire Pounds 116m stake in 3i, the largest European investor in unquoted companies. The announcement came as 3i set a price of 272p per share for the flotation of Pounds 711m of equity. Royal Bank sold because a diluted stake would have stopped it taking increases in 3i's net assets into profits. Bank of Scotland retained its shares, while National Westminster remained the biggest holder, with 17.9 per cent. 3i confirmed that it was pricing the shares at a 13.5 per cent discount to net assets, and that it was selling 45 per cent of its equity - rather than 40 per cent - because of strong demand. The company, jointly owned by seven high street banks and the Bank of England since its formation in 1945, revealed details of a Pounds 36m share option scheme for 140 senior managers intended to discourage them from leaving. The options would cost Pounds 18.7m to exercise and net the managers Pounds 17.3m at the offer price. The scheme has been in place since 1984 and requires managers to wait for three to 10 years to exercise options. Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive, said that although 3i had a unique franchise, it was 'an extremely good training ground for a variety of other companies'. 3i confirmed it had received bids of Pounds 1.2bn from mainly UK institutional investors during the bookbuilding exercise. This was more than twice the Pounds 533m placed firmly with institutions. The remaining Pounds 178m is to be offered to retail investors, of whom 385,000 have registered for details. The public offer, underwritten by Baring Brothers, closes on July 6, and share dealing is due to start on July 18. Sir George Russell, chairman, said he was 'delighted' with the response. 'The fact that we are able to come to the market under such difficult and volatile conditions sets us apart,' he said. 3i is to float as an investment trust, so gaining tax advantages. Mr Simon Borrows, a Barings director, said that the 13.5 per cent discount had been chosen to ensure liquidity in the shares. With a market value of Pounds 1.58bn, 3i may enter the FT-SE 100 Index later this year. The gross dividend yield at the offer price is 3 per cent. Mr Brian Larcombe, finance director, said the 13.5 per cent discount had not necessarily been narrowed by the stock market's fall since March because 3i's net assets had gained from flotations since then and companies' earnings were growing.

			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GROWERS PUT THE SQUEEZE ON AVOCADO THEFTS  </P> <P> Avocado thievery has reached such epidemic proportions in northern San Diego  County that a statewide avocado commission is planning to contract with the  county Sheriff's Department to help stem the rustling of the fruit known as  green gold.  </P> <P> Sheriff's officials said they at first didn't understand the scope of the  problem, but, now that they do, after having met with industry representatives,  they have entered contract negotiations with the quasi-governmental California  Avocado Commission, which wants three deputies assigned full-time to work on  the problem.  </P> <P> The preliminary plan calls for deputies not only to patrol North County's  groves day and night to deter thieves, but to establish sting operations to try  to nab thieves attempting to sell hot avocados to packing houses and farmers  markets.  </P> <P> The deputies would fill new positions to be financed by the Avocado Commission.  The commission already has allocated $197,000 to fund the program in San Diego  County, part of a $743,000 campaign statewide that is funded by avocado growers  to battle the increasing problem.  </P> <P> Avi Crane, a commission spokesman, said $10 million worth of fruit was stolen  last year -- about half of that from San Diego County groves -- and the losses  are expected to increase this year because of the high price that avocados  fetch at the market.  </P> <P> Growers now receive 80 cents to $1 per pound for avocados at wholesale packing  houses, and Crane said thieves are willing to get 50 cents on the dollar for  their stolen fruit.  </P> <P> Some thieves brazenly walk into groves by daylight, secrete themselves in the  midst of the trees and walk off hours later toting burlap bags, each containing  90 pounds of avocados, growers say. Others will make their forays under cover  of darkness, and their presence will not be discovered until the next morning  when a grower sees his stripped trees -- or perhaps not for days or weeks, when  the absentee owner finally inspects his trees.  </P> <P> "We have no compensation once the fruit is taken. We have no insurance, and we  don't get a tax write-off," said Ed Holtz, who has hired private security  guards to patrol his 50-acre avocado grove in Valley Center 12 hours a night.  </P> <P> "Even if they eventually find stolen fruit, we can't prove it's ours," he said.  "The stolen fruit still gets in the marketplace, the middleman still gets his  cut, and we get nothing."  </P> <P> Earlier this year, authorities in Riverside County arrested 10 people and  seized more than 11,000 pounds of stolen avocados that were being stored in  Temecula, awaiting distribution to wholesale and retail markets. Authorities  estimate that 10,000 pounds of stolen avocados daily were being moved by the  ring.  </P> <P> How does the 42-year-old Holtz, who has been growing avocados 20 years, measure  the monetary loss of avocados through theft last year? "It was enough money  that I could otherwise have bought a new car. A nice new car."  </P> <P> Holtz hired private security guards two months ago, after 3,000 pounds of  avocados were stripped off his trees on each of back-to-back nights, costing  him $6,000 in lost revenue.  </P> <P> Holtz is now paying $1,000 a week for the security service, but he figures that  he has to spend some money to save even more. And, although the unarmed guards  are now routinely chasing would-be thieves off his property, the thieves  haven't stopped trying.  </P> <P> Last Tuesday, Holtz said, the guards ran thieves off his groves. But, on  Thursday, Holtz discovered a cache of empty burlap bags that had been dropped  off that day in a field across from his groves on Circle R Drive, apparently  for a theft attempt that night. Indeed, early Friday morning his guards heard  -- but couldn't see -- men in the groves trying to take fruit off the trees.  For the second time that week, they were chased off the property.  </P> <P> Holtz says he doesn't ask his guards to capture the thieves -- partly because  it would be too dangerous and partly because he doesn't want to lose time in  court when he needs to be in the groves working. Even if one particular group  of men were caught red-handed, Holtz figures, they would never be held behind  bars because of the crowded jails and, besides, the avocado ringleaders would  simply hire other people to do the job.  </P> <P> Sighs Holtz, "I pick my trees in the day; they pick them at night. It's like a  cat-and-mouse game because they know I won't stay out there all day and all  night, so they'll wait until I go inside for the night."  </P> <P> There was a time, Holtz said, when he would go back into the groves and hide,  hoping to deter thieves who were sure to arrive. But his wife became so worried  for his safety -- other growers have been assaulted by thieves they confronted  -- that Holtz hired the security guards instead.  </P> <P> "Chain-link fences won't keep them out, because they'll cut right through them.  I've had chains and locks to my gate cut by bolt cutters," Holtz said. "Some of  the guards are Marines who tell me it's too bad I can't use some of the  security devices they've seen at Camp Pendleton because they would work for me.  But, of course, I don't have access to military security devices."  </P> <P> Even all the security in the world might not deter thefts, Holtz said.  </P> <P> "I've seen trucks inside of groves with the gates locked behind them, which  tells me they already had a key to the gate and let themselves in. They could  be men who work for the irrigators who have keys to the property, or people who  have access to the grove managers' keys to the property."  </P> <P> Some grove owners -- especially those who don't live on the property and who  own the grove simply as an investment or revenue source -- might not ever miss  the fruit and know they've been hit because they don't personally monitor their  trees, industry officials say.  </P> <P> The Avocado Commission had a pre-existing, annual $283,000 anti-theft campaign  statewide, including programs to investigate wholesale and retail markets for  evidence of stolen fruit, and a $50,000 reward fund for persons who report  thefts to authorities.  </P> <P> But, on March 15, the commission voted to authorize another $460,000 statewide  -- including the nearly $200,000 in San Diego County -- for the hiring of law  enforcement officers to specifically deal with avocado thievery.  </P> <P> Myron Klippert, a San Diego County sheriff's commander, said officials were at  first ignorant about how serious avocado thievery was, since much of it had  gone unreported to authorities -- perhaps because, by then, the damage already  had been done and growers felt there was no point.  </P> <P> Klippert says he has now learned how serious the problem is and is sympathetic  to the growers, with whom he is negotiating a contract tailored to attack the  avocado problem.  </P> <P> "These thieves are getting pretty good at what they're doing," he said. "They  won't even pick the fruit at the edge of a grove. They'll go into the interior  and strip the trees absolutely clean.  </P> <P> "Some show up with 40-foot trailers in the middle of the night. Other guys will  go to a street corner where migrant workers are standing around, give them  burlap bags and tell them, "I'll meet you at 2 and pay you $30 each if those  bags are full of avocados."  </P> <P> The migrant workers may believe they're being hired by the grove owner or  manager and have no sense that they're participating in a crime, he said.  </P> <P> Sometimes, avocados are simply taken from large wooden bins already filled with  picked fruit that are placed in groves or near the road, ready to be picked up  by the packing house the next morning.  </P> <P> The larger packing houses say they don't believe stolen fruit moves through  their doors. Some packing houses are cooperatives, owned by the growers  themselves, and accept only that fruit that is known to come from one of the  members.  </P> <P> Other packing houses say they don't pay cash for fruit -- in itself a deterrent  to thieves, who want to unload their hauls, get the cash and run.  </P> <P> "Most of the people we deal with, we've known for years," said Tim Hanify,  director of field operations for Eco Farms, a regional packing house in  Temecula. "If we get someone we don't know, we'll find out from him where his  grove is, how many trees he has and his mailing address. And we won't send him  a check for a month, which will give us time to check him out and make sure he  is who he says he is.  </P> <P> "It's the general feeling in the industry that the stolen fruit is ending up  with the smaller, cash buyers," he said.  </P> <P> Growers like Holtz say they hope the avocado cops will help their plight. "But  sting operations won't necessarily help us," he said. "From the growers' point  of view, we have to catch these guys in our fields, and that won't be easy."  </P></p>

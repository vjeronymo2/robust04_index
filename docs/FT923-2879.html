			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Aegis meeting approves reorganisation plans AEGIS'S extraordinary meeting in London yesterday marked several turning points in the life of the trader in advertising space which has experienced considerable managerial volatility since July, along with a share price slide from a peak of 215p in October 1991 to 27p last night. It also provided a final platform for Mr Peter Scott, its departing chairman, who was ousted from the board in July and departed with Pounds 2.2m in compensation. Mr Scott presented the group's reorganisation plans. These include a Pounds 19.8m rights issue, the acquisition of minority stakes in seven French media-buying companies and the rescheduling of deferred payments due to vendors of Carat, the group's main operating business. All the resolutions were passed. One of Aegis's main shareholders is Mr Gilbert Gross; the other is Warburg Pincus, the US investment bank which is underwriting the issue. Mr Gross is still due deferred payments from Aegis after it bought his Carat business in France in 1988. Under the debt rescheduling, SFEC, a company controlled by Mr Gross, will receive Pounds 18.8m in new shares and Pounds 25m in cash. The new structure accelerates the share element of the payment and reduces the cash. As a result SFEC's holding will increase from 26.8 per cent to 42.4 per cent. The transaction received a waiver from the Takeover Panel. SFEC will transfer its rights to the convertible loan stock to Warburg Pincus. Its voting rights will increase from 14.8 per cent to 16.4 per cent, while SFEC will hold 33.8 per cent of the voting rights. The group has relocated its headquarters to Paris. Its main source of revenue is buying and selling media space in France, which is the world's fifth biggest advertising arena. This year Aegis reckons that it will take a 12 per cent share of the west European display advertising market - in total worth some Pounds 29bn. But there are three mid-term doubts hanging over the group: The French authorities have initiated an investigation into alleged lack of transparency in the French advertising and media-buying markets. Aegis has particular reason for concern; more than 70 per cent of the revenues of Carat, its main operating business, derive from France. There is a pending law suit filed in the US against Pascoe Nally International (PNI) - a sports marketing subsidiary of Aegis - seeking damages of up to Dollars 308m (Pounds 156m). The suit alleges that PNI defrauded a US company, C&amp;W Associates, of its share of a lucrative joint venture set up to market soccer in the US. The activities of PNI sit uneasily with Aegis's core business and Aegis's new executives may dispose of PNI, perhaps by selling it back to Mr Alan Pascoe, the former British Olympic athlete who chairs PNI. Finally, by relocating its managerial headquarters to Paris, Aegis's status as a UK-based company has entered a kind of limbo. Aegis will retain its London quote but it will no longer fall under the British takeover code. According to a statement from Aegis yesterday, the French regulatory authorities are due to meet today to decide whether the stock will be admitted to the Paris Bourse. If Aegis can weather the current unknowns, its aim is to be in a strong position to meet an accelerating demand from advertisers for pan-European marketing campaigns. This year pre-tax profits are forecast to fall from Pounds 55.1m to Pounds 40m, but some of that lost ground may be recovered in 1993.</p>

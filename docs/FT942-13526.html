			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Ministers' resistance to SDR increase weakens Finance ministers from the industrialised countries are showing a greater willingness to listen to the International Monetary Fund's ideas for expanding the level of currency reserves. Yesterday's meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries once again rebuffed the IMF's requests for a new issue of special drawing rights, the basket of currencies which the Fund uses as its own accounting unit and which serves as a reserve asset. Nevertheless, officials indicated they were sympathetic to the shortage of international reserves experienced notably by the countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, which were not members of the IMF the last time new SDRs were issued. A G7 official said other ideas could involve changing IMF limits for access to loans by borrowing countries, calculated as a percentage of each country's stake in the Fund. Germany, along with the US and UK, opposes new SDRs which it fears could spur global inflation. However, ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 24 large developing countries endorsed the IMF call for an allocation of SDRs. Mr Willy Waldemar Zapata, president of the central bank of Guatemala and chairman of the G24, said the IMF's proposal to spread the allocation out over five years had already answered German and US fears that the issue would be inflationary.</p>

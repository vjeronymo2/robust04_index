			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by D.P.: "January Results of Public Opinion </F> Research Institute for RZECZPOSPOLITA; Correction: Coalition  Loses Support"]    [Text] In reality, the poll [conducted for RZECZPOSPOLITA  by the Sopot Public Opinion Research Institute] showed a  noticeable drop, not a slight increase, in the popular rating of  the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], as well as a declining trend  in sympathies for the Polish Peasant Party [PSL].    Growing is support for the Democratic Union [UD], which is  the strongest opposition party; support for its closest ally,  the Liberal-Democratic Congress [KLD], is on the wane. There  would be seven parties in parliament: all of the present  parliamentary parties plus the KLD.    The SLD has lost a lot of support where it felt strong in  November: among the employees of state enterprises, unskilled  workers, as well as inhabitants of small and medium-sized towns.  Support for the SLD especially dropped among people who have  the best educations and the highest incomes. Also people  employed in private companies back the party of Aleksander  Kwasniewski much less frequently than they did before. The SLD  is still supported by the poorest people, as well as by the  unemployed, who back this party more often than any other.    Over the past two months, the PSL has discouraged many older  voters--60 years old and older. It is still the  second-most-popular grouping in this milieu (the most popular is  the now nonexistent election coalition "Fatherland," comprising  such parties as the Christian-National Union and the Party of  Christian Democrats). However, support for this party among  60-year-old respondents is no higher than in the other groups.  The PSL is still the favorite party of peasants and  agricultural employees; almost 60 percent of respondents in  these groups would vote for it today.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Election Preferences(in percent)                                           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Nov 93            |Dec 93            |Jan 94            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |SLD               |&gt; 25               |24                |19                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |PSL               |20                |19                |118               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |UD                |16                |14                |14                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Union of Labor    |9                 |9                 |9                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Confederation for |5                 |5                 |8                 |  |an Independent Po-|                  |                  |                  |  |land              |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |KLD               |7                 |6                 |5                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nonparty Bloc in  |3                 |4                 |5                 |  |Support of Reforms|                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Business and the Environment: A fruitful alternative - St Lucia needs tourism but hopes to escape the ravages seen in other resorts In his bright new hillside office above the St Lucian capital of Castries, Richard Peterkin regrets that his Caribbean island did so little to prepare for life without bananas. 'We knew what was coming,' says Peterkin, a partner in the local offices of management consultants Price Waterhouse, referring to St Lucia's shrinking banana market in Europe. 'The unfortunate thing is that in these islands there are not a lot of alternatives to bananas,' he adds. A lush, sunny island, blessed with sandy beaches, does have one alternative, of course: tourism. Whatever their misgivings, most people on the island accept that tourism will have to support the livelihoods of a growing number of its 150,000 people. For decades, St Lucia's bananas, along with those of other former British and French colonies, have had privileged access to much of the European Union, which has applied quotas and tariffs on bananas from Latin America. However, the drive for freer world trade has led to St Lucia's privileges being gradually reduced. As its agricultural sector shrinks, the island, a relative newcomer to tourism, is striving desperately to avoid some of the environmental and social ravages that have followed the development of the industry elsewhere. The growth of tourism on the island, which gained independence from Britain in 1979, has been accompanied by debates echoed in holiday destinations around the world. Should the island build large resort hotels, with their own restaurants and leisure facilities? Or should it encourage smaller hotels, so that tourists buy their food in local shops and restaurants? How can it ensure that the benefits of tourism spread to the wider population rather than being restricted to a few, usually foreign, hotel owners? Above all, how can St Lucia persuade the 375,000 visitors to the island each year that it has a history and culture worth learning about? 'There is more to this country than just lying on a beach and drinking rum punch all day,' says Stephen McNamara, one of the island's leading lawyers and chairman of the St Lucia Tourist Board. Despite its small population, St Lucia has produced two Nobel Prize winners: Sir Arthur Lewis, for economics, and the poet Derek Walcott, for literature. There is some resentment in St Lucia over the attitude of tourists from wealthier countries who often regard the island as little more than an alluring escape from harsher climates and a more frenetic pace of life. In 1948, long before tourism became the international industry it is today, Walcott worried about his island: 'Found only In tourist booklets, behind ardent binoculars; Found in the blue reflection of eyes That have known cities and think us here happy. St Lucia has made several attempts to present itself to the tourist market as a country with much more to offer than sun and sea. It recently hosted an international jazz festival, its third. McNamara says the tourist board is looking at ways of developing St Lucia as a destination for fishing tournaments. The most vigorous debate on the island, however, concerns not what tourists should do when they get there but where they should stay during their holiday. Cletus Springer, permanent secretary at the tourism ministry, says that two-thirds of the island's 3,100 hotel rooms are in inclusive resorts - those in which the visitors pay for their meals in advance. Restaurateurs on the island have complained that the growth of all-inclusive hotels has deprived them of business. Other critics say the hotels are denying St Lucians access to the publicly owned beaches and that they buy most of their supplies abroad. The reputation of the hotels for being unsympathetic to the island's population has been exacerbated by allegations of maltreatment from a local barrister and a musician. The complaints from the restaurateurs have led to the establishment of a government task force, chaired by McNamara, which reported earlier this year. It found that all-inclusive hotels have the advantage of achieving higher occupancy levels and room rates than their conventional counterparts. The task force says, however, that local farmers should view all-inclusive hotels as a market for food and vegetables. This would enable farmers to move away from their dependence on bananas. The island has launched a scheme called Adopt-a-Farmer. Under the scheme, hotels offer a guaranteed price to a local farmer for specified quantities of fruit and vegetables, provided they are of sufficiently good quality. The scheme is still in its infancy, with six farmers so far participating. But there is some scepticism about its prospects. One local businessman says: 'They've been trying to do this sort of thing for donkey's years. You can buy these things much more cheaply in Miami. That's a fact of life.' The government is attempting to boost business in other areas. Current legislation provides import and other tax exemptions for hotels, allowing them to bring in many of their supplies free of duty. A new law is being prepared to extend these privileges to restaurants, owners of water sport facilities and other tourism-related businesses. But, above all, the government says it is determined to keep the development of tourism under control. Springer says St Lucia does not want to have more than 5,000 hotel rooms available on the island, a figure it expects to reach by the end of the decade. But with unemployment on the island running at 20 per cent, many doubt whether the government will keep hotel developers out after the 5,000 rooms have been built. Keith Martel, general manager of Windjammer Landing, a local hotel and resort, says: 'At the end of the day, money talks. If there is a proposal for another all-inclusive resort there will be an absolute hue and cry on the island. But I can't see the government turning it down.'</p>

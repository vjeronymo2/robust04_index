			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACCIDENT REVIVES DEBATE OVER STREET'S  SAFETY  </P> <P> The death of a motorcyclist last month on a residential street in Studio City  has intensified a decade-old debate over ways to control the traffic that jams  the road.  </P> <P> The fatal crash June 3 on Laurel Terrace Drive, a narrow street running  diagonally south of the intersection of Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards,  was similar to a collision at the same spot in 1984 and another fatal accident  on the street in 1976.  </P> <P> Although the city installed stop signs at the site of the two most recent  crashes and restricted access to the area during the morning commute, some  residents say tougher action is needed.  </P> <P> Joe Rinella, a member of the Studio City Residents' Assn., wants the city to  block his neighborhood off from outside traffic.  </P> <P> City officials say Rinella's plan would increase traffic on Ventura and Laurel  Canyon boulevards, both of which now are operating at what the city considers  to be capacity.  </P></p>

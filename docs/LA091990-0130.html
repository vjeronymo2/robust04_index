			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOME SALES RISE TO HIGHEST LEVEL IN 12 MONTHS  </P> <P> Orange County homes sales in August reached their highest monthly total in the  past 12 months, a regional real estate data firm reported Tuesday.  </P> <P> But last month's sales remained relatively flat in contrast with August, 1989,  dropping a scant 1% to 4,432 units, from 4,475 units a year earlier. At the  same time, the average price of a home in the county -- new and resale units  combined -- rose 1.7%, to $256,993 from $252,645 in August, 1989, according to  TRW Real Estate Services Inc.  </P> <P> And average new-home prices in August dropped below the average for resale  homes. That is just the third time that has happened since TRW began tracking  the data in January, 1988, a company spokesman said.  </P> <P> The average new home sold for $255,465 in August, slightly less than the  $257,431 price tag on the average resale home.  </P> <P> That disparity underscores the efforts developers have made to slash prices on  existing inventory and to bring smaller, less expensive homes onto the market  in a bid to revive new-home sales in the county.  </P> <P> TRW's monthly report tallied home sales that closed in August -- meaning that  the actual sales contracts in most cases were signed from one to three months  earlier. TRW's report includes all new and resale transactions, for both  attached and single-family homes.  </P> <P> Despite the downturn in sales from a year earlier, the report shows a spurt of  new activity in August after a relatively slow summer. August sales were 10.1%  higher than the 4,024 sales reported in July.  </P> <P> That increase was expected, the spokesman said, because TRW's data reflects  sales contracts signed at the beginning of the summer season -- typically the  best time of the year for residential sales.  </P> <P> Resale homes made up most of the August activity, with 3,743 units -- 84.5% of  the total -- changing hands, TRW said. Sales volume for resale homes was up  0.9% from a year earlier.  </P> <P> The average August resale price was 2.1% higher than the $252,127 reported in  August, 1989.  </P> <P> New-home prices, which have been falling as developers strive to move existing  inventory in a slow market, picked up a slight 0.4% from a year ago but  continued the current downward trend, falling 1.2% to $255,465 from the July  average of $258,640.  </P></p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Highland Distilleries dips 2.5% as whisky sales volume falls HIGHLAND Distilleries yesterday reported a 2.5 per cent dip in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 14.7m, in the six months to the end of February as volume sales of Scotch whisky were hit by the recession. The results surprised the City which had been forecasting profits of about Pounds 16.4m. The shares lost 11p to end the day at 259p. Group operating profits fell 9 per cent to Pounds 11.8m, compared with Pounds 12.9m. However, the pre-tax result was helped by increased net interest income of Pounds 1.96m, against Pounds 1.16m, a rise of 67 per cent. Investment income was a lower at Pounds 911,000 (Pounds 987,000). Mr John Goodwin, Highland chairman, said the fall in profits was because of lower sales of new and mature whisky to blenders who had reduced their orders as industry volumes fell 7 per cent in the UK and 2 per cent in export markets. The contribution from Famous Grouse, the UK's second-best selling Scotch brand which accounts for half the group's profits, had held steady, Mr Goodwin said. Industry sales of bottled whisky in the UK had fallen 12 per cent over the six months to the end of February and competitors' prices were discounted during the Christmas period. However, Famous Grouse had maintained its premium pricing and margins and, though suffering some decline in volume, had increased market share from 13 per cent to 14 per cent. Export growth of Famous Grouse was continuing, Mr Goodwin said. Volumes rose 7 per cent and the value of export sales increased 21 per cent. The brand has benefited from a distribution deal with Remy Cointreau in 1990 which linked it with Krug and Heidsieck champagnes and Remy Martin cognac. When the deal was signed, exports of Famous Grouse accounted for only 27 per cent of total sales. The proportion has now risen to 40 per cent. Mr Goodwin said: 'We remain confident about the medium and long-term growth prospects.' Industry analysts underlined that view by downgrading full-year forecasts from Pounds 29m to Pounds 28.5m, putting the company on a prospective p/e of 17.5, still a substantial premium to the market. Turnover improved by a little more than 1 per cent from Pounds 95.6m to Pounds 96.8m. The pre-tax figure was struck after a higher depreciation charge of Pounds 828.000 (Pounds 683,000). Lower tax of Pounds 4.78m (Pounds 5.23m) and minorities this time of Pounds 291,000 left earnings per share lower at 7.7p, compared with 7.9p. The interim dividend is increased 5 per cent to 1.45p.</p>

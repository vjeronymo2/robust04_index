This is why they will  never be eliminated. This was explained in the newspaper  TRABAJADORES, which also explained the difference between  subsidies to enterprises and social security benefits. The  newspaper stressed that subsidies are given to state enterprises  to make up for losses and drops in prices. Social security  subsidies, on the other hand, are money allowances given to  workers when they are disabled, either temporarily or partially,  due to illness or accidents.</p>

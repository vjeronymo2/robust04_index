			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Overfishing protest by Canadians A FLEET of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia trawlers is today due to claim two areas of the high seas for Canada, in protest at overfishing by foreign vessels. The deep-sea trawlers, which left from St John's, Newfoundland, at the weekend, will anchor a fishing boat near the 200-mile limit in a symbolic assertion of rights over valuable fishing grounds. Canada's continental shelf extends beyond the 200-mile limit at two points. Canadian officials say this has left its fish stocks, which straddle the limit, prey to the unregulated activities of foreign vessels. In February Canada reduced its quotas for northern cod in its own waters for this year to 120,000 tonnes from 185,000 tonnes, warning of environmental catastrophe unless catches were reduced and the stocks allowed to recover. The federal government is coming under political pressure to act against foreign vessels. Mr John Crosbie, fisheries minister, warned last week that Canada would press the issue at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June.</p>

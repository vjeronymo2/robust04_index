			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Serbs blamed for attack on German relief aircraft UNITED Nations officials last night claimed that anti-aircraft fire which hit a German relief aircraft over Croatia on Saturday came from Serb forces, Ariane Genillard in Bonn and agencies report. The UN has protested to Serb authorities at the incident and the German Defence Ministry said Germany would halt all relief flights to Sarajevo  - where the aircraft was bound - until further notice. Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister, will consider resuming aid flights only after examining a report from German experts, who returned yesterday from the Croatian capital Zagreb. The German flight from Zagreb was shot at over the Croatian town of Karlovac but landed safely. One crew member was injured. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees said a UN airlift of humanitarian supplies to Sarajevo would resume today. Flights would leave from Split, on Croatia's Adriatic coast, and US bases in Germany. Laura Silber, in Zagreb, adds: Croatia is calling for Nato forces to back up the 14,000-strong UN Protection Force in disputed Serb enclaves of Croatia, whose one-year mandate expires on February 20. A Croatian document issued on February 3 states: 'Croatia suggests that in the near future UN forces on the territory of the republic of Croatia should be assisted by Nato naval and air forces, whose major task should be to provide air cover and essential and logistical support.' The proposals reflect Croatia's exasperation with its failure to gain control over more than one-quarter of Croatian territory. Serb militias have refused to disband, in violation of the UN plan. But the revised plan also reveals Croatia's backing of a military option - rather than a political solution - following its first military offensive across UN lines. As 3.6m Croats were due to cast their ballots in municipal elections, Croatian and Serb rebel forces yesterday exchanged artillery and rocket fire in the Dalmatian hinterland near Zadar, the Adriatic port.</p>

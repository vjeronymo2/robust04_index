			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia Feb. 21 (OANA-BERNAMA)  -- Parti Bersatu Sabah [Sabah United Party] (PBS) President  Joseph Pairin Kitingan whose party won the just ended state  election with the narrowest margin possible was sworn in as  chief minister of the East Malaysian state of Sabah Monday.    He took his oath of office before the yang dipertua negeri  (governor), Mohamed Said Keruak, at 10.05 am local time.    Pairin had stationed himself by the istana [palace] gates  since 9.40 pm on Saturday soon after his party won a simple  majority, to stop any other person to be sworn in as head of  state government. His action was to prevent a recurrence what is  now known in local political circles as the 1985 incident.  [passage omitted] Eight PBS winning candidates were sworn in as  state cabinet members after Pairin took his oath of office. They  are Bernard Dompok (Moyog), Amirkahar Mustapha (Banggi), Chau  Tet Onn (Api-api), Joseph Kurup (Sook), Wilfred Bumburing  (Tamparuli), Lajim Ukin (Klias), Lau Pui Keong (Karamunting),  and Adib Sigoh (Nabawan). Dompok, Amirkahar, and Chau were  appointed deputy chief ministers. [passage omitted]</p>

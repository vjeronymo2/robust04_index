However,  the unit commander has organized a 24-hour tour of duty by the  unit personnel, maintaining regular contact with the local  military and civil authorities. What caused such precautions?    "The hospital base personnel, where citizens of our state  are  serving, decided to take an oath of loyalty to the people of  Ukraine," Aleksey Yutsyuk, deputy commander of the Ukraina  cruiser, told UKRINFORM-TASS. "But Captain First Rank  Halaychev, the commander of the Black Sea Fleet ship repair and  construction team, decided to ban the oath-taking by force. He  arrived at the base, together with a subunit from the Slava  missile cruiser sailors, after which his subordinates broke into  the supply depot and began to load equipment and medicine stored  there onto their vehicle. However, servicemen of the  neighboring Ukrainian unit prevented the illegal removal of the  fleet property."    The hospital base personnel eventually did take an oath of  loyalty to the people of Ukraine. Their commanders are  currently drawing up papers to report an unauthorized attempt to  seize the unit's property to the Procurator's Office.</p>

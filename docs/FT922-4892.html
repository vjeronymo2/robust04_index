			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe considers second gilt futures contract THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) is considering introducing a second gilt futures contract. The proposal is a response to growing demand for a means of hedging longer-dated gilt issues. The existing contract, known as the long gilt contract, is based on gilt issues totalling at least Pounds 500m which mature between 2003 and 2009. The contract specification was set in December 1988, when the UK government was repurchasing substantial amounts of paper. The exchange decided to set the parameters of deliverable gilts in this way to counter fears of diminishing supply. However, the nature of the specification means that the maturity of the gilts has been steadily declining, so that the long gilt future is now based on 11 to 17-year paper. The UK government has now resumed issuance of gilts, with two new gilts, maturing in 20 and 25 years, launched so far this year. More long-dated supply is expected. As a result, there is growing demand from traders for a contract based on long-dated gilts. Based on 15 to 25-year gilts, it would be known as the extra-long contract. Liffe plans to sound out members on potential demand for such a product. The exchange may also change the specification of the existing contract at a later date, in order to align the contract with other 10-year bond future contracts, common to most markets. Ironically, Liffe's medium gilt contract - which was based on 10-year gilts  -failed to take off after its introduction in 1987 and was suspended in 1990. Dealers complain that the lack of a 10-year gilt future makes it more difficult to trade gilts against other futures markets. First Chicago Futures and James Capel have joined the four existing marketmakers in Liffe's three-month Ecu interest rate future.</p>

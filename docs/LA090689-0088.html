			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIZE OF ROSTER AT OAK PARK IN QUESTION  </P> <P> If the high school football season started today, Oak Park High would not be  able to field a team, according to Coach Ron Veres.  </P> <P> The Eagles have only eight healthy and eligible players on their roster,  according to Veres, and have three days to rectify the situation. They are  scheduled to open the season Friday at home against Boron.  </P> <P> Veres' contention is news to school Athletic Director Fred Yamano.  </P> <P> "I'm unaware that there is a problem," Yamano said. "According to the roster I  have, there should be 19 players. I've only received one accident report."  </P> <P> If Oak Park can't suit up at least 11 players, it will be forced to forfeit its  first game, and possibly the season.  </P> <P> "It's terrible. It's a terrible situation," Veres said. "We're trying to be  positive to maintain team morale. We'll see what happens."  </P> <P> Veres, who is a walk-on coach, and his seven-man staff were scheduled to meet  with Yamano on Tuesday afternoon, but Veres was late leaving his teaching  position at Simi Valley High so the meeting was postponed a day.  </P> <P> Veres said that he has talked to school administrators about the problem since  the first day of practice. Only 12 eligible players showed up when practice  began Aug. 21.  </P> <P> The roster had increased to 19, but one player was declared academically  ineligible and 10 others suffered an assortment of minor injuries, Veres said.  </P> <P> Last season, the Eagles suited up 14 players in a 24-0 loss to Carpinteria.  </P> <P> Veres could try to coax the remaining six sophomores on the junior varsity team  who are eligible to play varsity football, eliminate the JV team and form a  freshman team with the remaining 21 JV players.  </P></p>

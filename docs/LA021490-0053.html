			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EPA DISCOVERS MILITARY SALES OF TOXIC WASTES;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: A HOUSE PANEL ACCUSES THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT OF FRAUDULENTLY  DISPOSING OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TO AVOID DISPOSAL COSTS.  </P> <P> In selling a wide variety of surplus materials, the Department of Defense has  at times resorted to public sales as a mere sham for hazardous waste disposal,  according to an internal memorandum of the Environmental Protection Agency made  public Tuesday.  </P> <P> The memorandum, from the EPA's regional administrator in San Francisco,  included an account of six instances in California where hazardous substances  originating with the military had wound up endangering the environment.  </P> <P> The department "has gone to great lengths to sell as much hazardous material  and hazardous waste as possible to the general public," said Rep. Vic Fazio  (D-Sacramento). "While the Department of Defense contends this is a means for  generating revenue for the Treasury and providing the public with access to  usable, surplus items, in reality the sale of many of these hazardous materials  is nothing less than a fraudulent disposal of hazardous waste in order to avoid  the high cost of proper disposal."  </P> <P> Fazio's comments came during hearings he and Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.)  co-chaired in Sacramento Tuesday.  </P> <P> The problem came to light last summer when EPA regional administrator Daniel W.  McGovern in San Francisco wrote agency headquarters after the discovery that  40,000 gallons of hazardous solvents, thinners, lacquers, and acids were  purchased by a businessman and left in a warehouse in the town of Collinsville.  </P> <P> The leaking drums created a million-dollar cleanup task whose bill is still  being debated. The memo noted five other cases in which military surplus items  auctioned to civilians created similar hazards.  </P> <P> On the basis of those cases, the EPA regional office warned that the Defense  Department's sale of a sweeping variety of hazardous items to the public had  become a national problem.  </P> <P> The report, along with a follow-up study by the General Accounting Office, was  made public in Sacramento Tuesday as the Government Operations subcommittee on  energy, environment and natural resources heard calls for tighter regulations  of government sales of hazardous materials.  </P> <P> The Collinsville case and the investigations that followed, Fazio said, shows  that the Defense Department "mismanages the hazardous materials it uses and the  wastes it generates at unnecessary expense to the taxpayer, and in some  instances at substantial risk to human health and the environment."  </P> <P> In the investigation requested by Fazio and Synar, the GAO found the Defense  Department had sold hazardous materials and waste with an original acquisition  cost of $116 million for about $7 million between October, 1986, and March,  1989.  </P> <P> The Defense Logistics Agency, it said, estimated that the sales had avoided  disposal costs of $170 million.  </P> <P> The GAO said the government should provide safeguards against improper use of  hazardous items that it sells. It added that steps should be taken to ensure  that buyers are informed of special handling requirements.  </P> <P> After receiving the report from the regional administrator in San Francisco,  the EPA's federal facilities compliance office asked the agency's nine other  regions for reports on similar experiences.  </P> <P> It is now preparing an agency position paper on the issue. It is also preparing  actions against the Defense Department to recover cleanup costs in cases in  which auctioned materials created environmental hazards.  </P></p>

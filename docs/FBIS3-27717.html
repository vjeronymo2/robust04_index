Talks, set tentatively for 8-9 February, will also focus on  official preparations far His Majesty the King's visit to  Vientiane on the eve of the historic April 8 opening.    The bridge, financed and built by Australia, completes the  first land link between Thailand and Laos.    The opening will be presided over by the King and the  President of Laos, Nouhak Phomsavan, in the presence of Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai, Laotian Prime Minister General Khamtai  Siphandon, and Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating.    However, the build-up to the handover is being plagued by a  lack of agreement on the question of boundaries. Visa issues  have also yet to be settled. [passage omitted]    Thailand maintains that the boundary on the bridge should be  drawn at the deepest point of the river, the same line which  marks the frontier along the Mekong River between Thailand and  Laos.    Laos has argued that the two nations should each have  jurisdiction over and responsibility for half the bridge, in  accordance with international practice. This boundary would not  replace the official frontier.    The differences have embarrassed both sides, as such basic  issues were supposed to have been smoothed over earlier in  anticipation of the historic inauguration of the "friendship"  bridge that symbolizes cordial ties between the two neighbors.    The sources however said the talks are unlikely to focus on  measures to facilitate the two-way entry into both sides through  the bridge.</p>

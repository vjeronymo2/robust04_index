			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Izetbegovic Meets With Leaders of </F> RPR-UDF and PSF Lists"]    [Text] Dominique Baudis and Michel Rocard, the leaders of  the two main lists of candidates for the European elections who  had talks with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday,  stood by their positions on the arms embargo on Bosnia. It is  known that Izetbegovic has come to Paris at the invitation of  philosopher and writer Bernard-Henri Levy, who is presenting a  list called "Europe Begins at Sarajevo" in the elections.    Dominique Baudis (UDF-RPR [French Democratic Union-Rally for  the Republic] majority) stressed the risks of lifting the  embargo, while Socialist Michel Rocard expressed the view that  it is the ultimate means of pressure in view of the UN  "paralysis."    "I noted a series of proposals which I will submit to Prime  Minister Balladur and Foreign Minister Juppe in the next few  hours," Mr. Baudis said after meeting with Izetbegovic for  almost one hour. Expressing the view that there were  "opportunities for speeding up the peace process rather than the  war," he said he understands "the Bosnian president's concern to  achieve a balance of forces on the ground." "At present," he  said, "there is an imbalance in favor of the Serbs and to the  detriment of the Bosnians."  <H5>  UN Resolutions </H5>   Judging the desire to restore a balance of forces to be  "legitimate," Baudis saw two ways of achieving it: a reduction  in the level of armaments of the Serbs, or arms supplies to the  Bosnians. The first [as published] option, he added, "presents  risks of the fighting intensifying with hundreds of thousands  more people being killed, and the fighting spreading to the  whole Balkan region and perhaps elsewhere in Europe. There is a  different solution," Mr. Baudis said, which consists not in  supplying arms to the Bosnians but in "ensuring the  implementation of the UN resolutions which involve the  withdrawal of Serbian heavy weapons from Bosnia. I advocate the  solution which kills least people. I prefer to see weapons  leaving Bosnia rather than new weapons arriving there. Fewer  weapons means fewer victims," Mr. Baudis said.    Mr. Rocard, for his part, said it was necessary for "the  United Nations to implement its own resolutions and use force.  If that does not happen," he added, "it becomes vital to allow  the Bosnians the right to defend themselves, in other words to  lift the embargo." He termed a question on the link between his  stance and the European elections "insulting."    Brice Lalonde had a telephone conversation with the Bosnian  president while he was holding a political meeting near les  Saintes- Maries-de-la-Mer. According to the leader of Ecology  Generation, "Mr. Izetbegovic knows what support we have been  giving him for two years."    Yesterday, Bernard-Henri Levy said he and his friends  planned  to officially submit their list by the closing date of 27 May,  "unless there is a major development -- in other words either a  change in government policy, which must take a stance against  the partition of Bosnia, or a major parliamentary initiative."  According to Mr. Schwartzenberg, Izetbegovic said he was  satisfied with the position taken by Michel Rocard, who  "understands" the situation.</p>

Ways To Integrate Economic and Ecological  Reforms in Ukraine"]    [Text] Centralized administration of Ukraine's economy over  a prolonged period of time caused it to develop with huge  structural disproportions. The ecological problems it inherited  are primarily the result of the improper use of natural  resources.    The inefficient economic system with ownerless property and  administrative redistribution of funds promoted wasteful use of  resources and inefficient energy consumption in monopolized  production. Heavy industry with its resource-intensive  technologies accounts for 61 percent of the gross domestic  product in Ukraine's economy as against 34 percent in the  economies of EC countries. The power-output ratio in Ukraine's  gross national product is the highest among the countries of the  former Soviet Union. It is nine times higher than in the  countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development [OECD], and nearly four times greater than in  countries with higher than average per capita income.    This is what has created the "Ukrainian phenomenon" in the  economy, which combines world prices with meager wages and a  scarcity of goods. This same situation provides a key to  defining the ways and methods for conducting economic reforms.  The transition from centralized planning to a market economy  must also include improving the environment by imposing harsh  penalties for massive, unwarranted squandering of resources.    The principal factors that could promote progress in  improving the state of the environment include ending political  and administrative interference in price formation and setting  wage rates, introducing a system of incentives through taxes and  payments, using economic methods to equalize starting conditions  in state enterprises and sectors, eliminating the  interdependence of prices and revenues and material outlays,  demonopolizing and restructuring production potential,  restricting the access of enterprises to government money  (budget restrictions), and abolishing subsidies for the use of  such natural resources as energy, minerals, and water.    The decline in production is significantly reducing  pollution. Market reforms provide an opportunity to preserve and  reinforce this effect for the next decade by encouraging a shift  towards resource-conserving and clean technologies and forms of  activity. As industrial capital renewal proceeds, the dumping of  most substances that pollute the environment can be maintained  at a stable level or even reduced if there is rapid economic  growth. Industrial restructuring will affect water pollution to  a lesser degree, because most of these wastes come from  agriculture, household plots, and public utilities.  Consequently, in the long term, attention will have to shift  from air to water pollution.    In the process of economic reform, we may discover  advantages  in stimulating investments in environmental protection in the  private sector, especially if it can reduce undesirable results.  Investments in environmental protection in the industrial and  power sectors must conform to the lowest-cost principle and to  the process of making decisions in the private sector. On the  whole, the key factor in improving the state of the environment  lies in the integration of environmental needs with the  structure of sectorial policy. Abolishing subsidies for energy  will result in reducing consumption and promote the use of new  resource-conserving and cleaner technologies.    As a result of the critical shortage of available resources,  divergences between economic and environmental interests will  grow. Some of the old enterprises will continue to operate,  because closing them would cause substantial social losses. Such  enterprises must be required to implement environmental  protection measures that do not require large financial outlays.  Improvements can be achieved at most old enterprises simply by  introducing "efficient management" (more painstaking repairs,  combatting waste, installing improved regulating and monitoring  equipment, applying more stringent standards in managing  production and processing methods). These measures are very  important, because it is not possible to introduce clean  technologies on a large scale until new markets for the sale of  various kinds of production are created and until the economic  capability of enterprises is assured.    Privatization will promote market reforms. The government  can  speed up privatization and promote progress in the field of  environmental protection by establishing clearly defined rules  regarding responsibility for causing damage (harm) to the  environment in the past and by making new owners liable for all  pollution by toxic substances that results from their activity.  In many cases, the state itself must assume responsibility for  causing damage to the environment in the past. An audit of  balance sheets (inventory) in the field of environmental  protection must be conducted immediately in order to distinguish  between the pollution caused in the past and that being caused  now. And if production at privatized enterprises does not meet  the necessary standards, stricter antipollution standards should  be gradually phased in.    In the future, the structural reorganization of industry  will  lead to a reduction in the harmful effects of pollution on human  health in a specific region as those employed in inefficient and  harmful industries, which are subject to closing, are provided  with opportunities to find new jobs, as economic activity picks  up, and as the surviving enterprises accumulate sufficient funds  to invest in new technologies.    Conducting an ecological and technological audit will enable  us to collect the most important data on enterprises that do not  lend themselves to privatized operation and to plan tasks for  the short term.    In an economic system based on achieving gross production  indicators, the state allocated less than half a percent of the  gross national product for environmental protection, which  failed completely to compensate for the damages and losses  caused by the technogenic volume. Until now, an enterprise's  economic liability for polluting the environment has been purely  symbolic and has not exceeded 1.5-2.0 percent of its profit.    The creation of a new economic system of environmental use  and environmental protection measures as part of the transition  to a market economy must become an integral part of the system  for managing and regulating the economy.    The principal elements of this economic mechanism must be:    Payment for special use of natural resources;    Payment for polluting the environment;    A system for financing and extending credit for  environmental  protection measures (state and local budgets, environmental  protection funds, banks, enterprise funds, foreign investments,  etc.).    To ensure that these fundamental goals are achieved and to  create a system for financing environmental protection measures,  a fixed percentage of the gross national product must be  earmarked in the state budget for spending on measures to  protect the environment. According to estimates prepared by the  ministry of environmental protection and the ministry of the  economy, this amount can and must be no less than 0.9-1.0  percent of the GNP. The greater portion of this money should  come from payments for the special use of natural resources  (water, minerals, etc.) and payment for land. The remainder of  the environmental protection costs should be met by the local  budgets, ecological funds, and the enterprises' own funds. An  effort should also be made to encourage the development of  ecological business enterprise and the extension of credit by  banks for investment in environmental protection. Taking into  account the present ecological state of Ukraine, it is necessary  to increase the proportion of environmental protection  expenditures to 3-5 percent of the GNP.    The funds earmarked in the state budget of Ukraine for  environmental protection measures should be kept separate and  used to finance priority national and regional programs and  measures. The construction of environmental protection projects  using centralized capital investments must be conducted on the  basis of government contracts. The ecological funds and banks  must protect these funds against inflation. It is also necessary  to create a favorable climate for investments and an effective  system of realizing foreign investments in the Ukrainian economy  in general, as well as in the protection of the environment.</p>

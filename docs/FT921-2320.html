			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Maxwell support for MGN shares discovered THE late Mr Robert Maxwell secretly purchased shares in Mirror Group Newspapers as the price of the stock plunged in the weeks after he floated the company last May. This newly discovered share support scheme by Mr Maxwell closely parallels an extensive one he employed on the shares of Maxwell Communication Corporation, his other public company. In both cases he was under great pressure to support the share prices because he had pledged stock in the two companies as collateral for huge bank loans. The support schemes formed a large part of the 'black hole' through which hundreds of millions of pounds worth of Maxwell pension fund assets and Mr Maxwell's bank borrowings disappeared last year. The Serious Fraud Office launched an investigation into the alleged MCC share support scheme last December. The MGN purchases, increasing his stake from 51 per cent to 54.8 per cent, had been made by a Liechtenstein trust company but they were funded by Maxwell private companies, administrators to the companies said last night. The purchases should have been made public. MGN shares plummeted from 125.5p on May 17, the first day of dealing, to 91p July 22. Mr Maxwell bought 10m shares in late May and a further 10m in June, Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen, the administrator, said. He declined to comment on which investment bank had handled the transactions worth about Pounds 20m but it is believed to be Goldman Sachs, the US firm which also handled some of the MCC share purchases. Goldman Sachs has said previously it had been assured by Mr Maxwell that the MCC purchasers were unrelated to him. It is believed that a US and a Swiss corporation among the Maxwell private companies funded the share purchases. After the MGN flotation Mr Maxwell came under pressure from some of his lenders to improve the collateral he had offered them. Much of the banks' collateral was MCC shares which were also under pressure on the stock market. In some cases, he offered them MGN shares instead and by early last summer he had pledged most of his MGN holding to his creditors.</p>

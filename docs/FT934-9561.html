			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Bottom line on assets and liabilities: A look at the openly contested battle for the top job in UK accountancy When Mr Brandon Gough, chairman of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, let it be known early last year that he would be standing down in April 1994, he could not have envisaged the upheaval that would ensue. Since then, a hotly contested and distracting election battle has brewed in the fight for the top seat in the UK's largest accountancy firm. Ballot papers naming the four candidates are being sent out to all 700 UK partners today. 'Everywhere you go in or out of the firm, whatever you're doing, the subject comes up,' says one Coopers' partner. 'A chairman greeted me at an AGM like an old friend the other day, and his first question was how the race was going.' A partner from a rival accountancy firm adds: 'Suddenly everybody there has got involved in politics. There is so much canvassing that no one is doing any work.' At stake is a five-year term as the head of a fast-changing organisation which last year generated Pounds 553m in fees, and employs 9,800 staff in 36 offices around the country. The chairman also has considerable influence in Coopers' separate international network, which has more than Dollars 5.3bn in billings, 4,500 partners and 67,000 staff in more than 730 offices worldwide. 'The job of the leader is to get 700 highly talented, highly egocentric partners to go broadly in the same direction most of the time,' says one partner. Those vying for the post are: Adrian Lamb. Partner in charge of the regions, and previously a regional partner for the south and east regions of the firm with a number of prestigious audit clients. His image is that of a quiet consensus-builder. Alan McFetrich. An executive partner who was national managing partner at Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells before it merged with Coopers in 1990. He has worked outside the firm on secondment to government, but has relatively little client contact now. He has a reputation as a tough, single-minded administrator. Peter Smith. Head of Coopers' City office in London, with many financial service clients. Described by one partner as 'closest to Brandon's command and control approach'. He has an image as a relative traditionalist in his attitude to management. Richard Stone. Head of corporate finance, and previously head of the firm's insolvency practices in London and Birmingham. The only candidate not part of the firm's current senior management team. A drawback is his reprimand by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales late last year for a breach of ethical guidelines in accepting the appointment as administrator to Polly Peck International when Coopers had undertaken other work for the company and its chairman, Mr Asil Nadir, now a fugitive in northern Cyprus. Coopers has done its best to keep the election debate private. Candidates have been urged not to speak to journalists, and many other partners loyally remain silent when the subject is raised. By contrast, the election process has been unusually open, pitting the four candidates against each other in open competition. Traditionally, the senior partner or chairman in a British professional firm has tended to be just that: the longest-serving partner, who assumes the job almost automatically before retiring. Where that has given way to a search among rivals, a small group has generally been established to 'take soundings' and select a consensus candidate in secret. For instance, at KPMG Peat Marwick, the UK's second-largest accountancy firm, all partners formally voted on Mr Jim Butler's replacement as senior partner in April. But there was only one candidate, and the ballot papers were all numbered, which raised fear of reprisals against those who might have contemplated voting 'no' to Mr Colin Sharman. Brandon Gough himself did not endure a public process at Coopers &amp; Lybrand before taking up his position in April 1983. He says he was one of four candidates considered by a nomination committee, which then 'culled' the others. Five years later, he says, 'there was not much stomach for a competition', and his term was automatically renewed. It was extended for a further year following management changes as a result of the merger with Deloitte. If Gough had prevailed, his successor would have been chosen behind the scenes. But in an unusual display of power, the partners - who are also the firm's shareholders - exerted their ownership rights. The firm's 'partnership deed' decrees that the governing board - 13 partners selected by the chairman - is responsible for determining the process to select a new chairman. Early last year it got to work. It proposed, according to Gough, that a nomination committee be chosen, to include all members of his board who were not themselves standing as candidates. It said this committee would identify one partner to 'emerge' as winner. Coopers' partners were not convinced. Their objections culminated at their annual meeting at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham last December. The dispute led to revised proposals for a 35-member nomination committee elected from among all the partners, which would draw up a shortlist of four - all of whom would be seen and voted on by the entire partnership. The first few months of this year were spent electing from a list of about 80 candidates those who would sit on the committee. Each represents a constituency of other partners. In July, invitations were sent out for potential candidates for Gough's job to submit their nominations and supporting manifestos. By the end of August, 16 had been received. Through two days of internal presentations, the committee whittled the list down to four. 'It was one of the most ghastly processes and procedures ever devised,' says one partner who was involved. In the past two weeks, the four have been on the hustings together, giving 15-minute presentations and then responding to partners' questions: twice in London, once in Birmingham and once in Manchester. Here they have laid out their vision of the firm's future: including proposals for reorganising internal management, simplifying the regional structure and boosting the firm's international activities. Given that the election is by single transferable vote, and administered by the Electoral Reform Society, the process leading to a result on November 23 seems open and fair. Some insiders say the choice is between administrators and leaders; or between those who believe the firm should respond to clients' needs against those who will allow it to be driven by the services it has traditionally offered. Many partners say they will be swayed by performance on the hustings, or by the management team each candidate has publicly proposed. As Gough says, the job is that of 'a steersman, not the oarsman'. Some tensions still run deep from the Deloitte merger three years ago, which may persuade former partners of that firm to support McFetrich. Those linked to London or the regions may opt for Smith and Lamb respectively as the candidates they know best. For Stone, the principal challenge is whether his image has been tarnished by Polly Peck. A few weeks ago the nomination committee received a memo from Sir Christopher Foster, a senior Coopers' partner and consultant to the government, suggesting that eyebrows in Whitehall might be raised were Stone appointed. In response, Sir Tim Bell, Mrs Thatcher's public relations adviser, wrote in support of Stone that the Polly Peck issue would be a 48-hour wonder, which would not damage the firm's reputation with clients, including the government. Whatever the outcome, many partners will be glad when it ends. 'The process has been dreadfully over-democratic,' says one. 'But it is useful after a big merger to show 700 people that democracy can work. Whether it's going to produce the right result is a different matter. I'd have thought we won't necessarily get the best man.'</p>

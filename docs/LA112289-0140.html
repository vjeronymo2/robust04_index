			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> HOLIDAY TRAVEL CRUNCH BEGINS  </P> <P> Snow, dense fog and ice-covered roads slowed many people heading home for  Thanksgiving today, one of the heaviest travel days of the year with people  packing highways, buses, trains and planes.  </P> <P> Because of fog on the West Coast and snow in the Midwest, the Federal Aviation  Administration implemented a nationwide air traffic quota system early in the  day, keeping planes on the ground until weather improved near their  destinations, said Rob Doughty, a spokesman for United Airlines in Chicago.  </P> <P> "We're going to try to get everybody over the river and through the woods to  grandma's house, but they have to be patient," said Tom Troske, operations  manager at Salt Lake City's airport, which was socked in by heavy fog part of  the day.  </P></p>

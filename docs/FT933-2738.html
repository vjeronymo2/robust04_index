			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Schools show wide variation in spending STATE SCHOOLS in England and Wales show wide variations in the way they spend their budgets, the Audit Commission said yesterday. The public-spending watchdog said that some schools had five times as many administrators per pupil as others, while the percentage of school budgets spent on salaries for teachers varied between 60 per cent and 80 per cent. Schools in some areas have a much greater ability to raise funds from donations and parent-teacher associations. Mr Andrew Foster, controller of the commission, said that schools should examine areas where their performance was significantly different from the average, and take action to improve it if necessary. Headteachers and governors now oversee total budgets of Pounds 11.6bn following the government's introduction of local management of schools. Governing bodies have made widely differing use of their power to set headteachers' salaries, introduced in 1991. The commission found that most schools had not increased headteachers' pay at all during this period. But one primary school had awarded its head 11 points on the 50-point pay-scale (each point is equivalent to roughly Pounds 600), and two had awarded eight points. Total variation is from Pounds 22,404 to Pounds 50,682. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the finding showed that delegated budgets had left many headteachers without any pay rise. Grades awarded in GCSE and A-level examinations are fair and accurate, the Independent Authority for Schools Examinations said yesterday. It heard just nine appeals for exams last year.

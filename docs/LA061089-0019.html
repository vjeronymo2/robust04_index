			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE ARTIST RELISHES HER FREEDOM TO SPEAK OUT  </P> <P> Now, I even see an element of revenge in this work; it is as if I were  intentionally thumbing my nose at those nameless and faceless authorities who  controlled my life and art in China.  </P> <P>  -- Li Huai  </P> <P> Those fateful words, written months ago by Li Huai about her art, resonate with  the spirit of the pro-democracy demonstrators slaughtered by Chinese soldiers  last weekend in Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> Li Huai, 34, is the subject of an exhibition, "Li Huai: An Artist in Two  Cultures," that opens today at the San Diego Museum of Art. Though she is  elated about the exhibit of 60 of her artworks made before and after coming to  the United States in 1983, Li Huai's attention is divided between San Diego and  her hometown of Beijing. "We try to follow what's going on there as close as  possible," Li Huai said Thursday at a press preview. "We call our friends in  different fields -- some in art, some working-class -- to get as broad a view  as we can."  </P> <P> Some friends talk candidly with Li Huai and her husband, Paul Pickowicz, a UC  San Diego Chinese history and film professor. Others, reminded of the years of  terror and betrayal during China's Cultural Revolution, speak in guarded  phrases.  </P> <P> The midnight phone calls to China have drawn out a picture "much more ghastly  than the U.S. media has given," Pickowicz said. Her friends say that bodies of  the hated 27th Army soldiers lay rotting in the streets for days because the  people would not touch them. Similarly, corpses of people from outside Beijing,  whom nobody knows, go unclaimed.  </P> <P> But other friends give conflicting accounts of the army's carting off of the  bodies to cover up the numbers of people killed.  </P> <P> "I'm not surprised," Li Huai said. "People have seen the problems all the way  along -- the problems of freedom of speech." One of the worst problems in China  is self-censorship, Li Huai said.  </P> <P> "People have had bad experiences, terrible, horrible experiences in the past,"  she said, referring to the dark days of betrayal during the Cultural Revolution  of 1966-76. "They don't trust each other. In China, the relationship between  human beings is very intense, full of doubts, full of concerns. I feel that it  is very, very abnormal.  </P> <P> "They count on self-censorship. I think it is very sick."  </P> <P> Such paranoia in China is entrenched. Even Li Huai declined to give the names  of family and friends out of concern for their safety.  </P> <P> Li Huai left China because of the restrictions on artistic expression. Though  conditions had improved  </P> <P> dramatically since the Cultural Revolution,the expression of intellectual  curiosity was still limited.  </P> <P> "In China, talent is allowed to die on the vine," Pickowicz said. "The reality  is that, if Li Huai had not come to the United States, her talent could not  have been realized."  </P> <P> In the exhibit, extensive text panels on the museum's walls give a surprisingly  in-depth account of the impact of the Cultural Revolution on artists and of Li  Huai's efforts to plumb her native artistic roots after the revolution.  </P> <P> Many of the pieces in the exhibition refer to traditional Chinese art forms --  frescoes and brush drawings -- and Western styles such as French  Post-Impressionism. These forms were proscribed during the Cultural Revolution.  </P> <P> It was only until the loosening of restrictions following the decade of  cultural repression that Li Huai felt free to soak up and paint "forgotten  ancient Chinese motifs." But, even under the new freedom, she felt restrained  from painting her true feelings.  </P> <P> It was not until she came to this country that Li Huai was able to throw off  political, artistic and philosophical restrictions. Working in a burst of  energy, she exorcised her anger at the repression she had lived through by  painting a series of hot, angry paintings.  </P> <P> The violence and horror of the Cultural Revolution are captured in "Ferule," a  52-panel work in oil, her husband said.  </P> <P> "Each of the panels is a self-contained prison," Pickowicz said, and a protest  against the atrocities of the cultural revolution. But "Ferule" also speaks  eloquently and presciently of the current events in Tian An Men Square, he  said.  </P> <P> "This show is basically about the freedom of speech, the freedom to express  yourself in art and in daily life," Li Huai said. "If I have a chance in art to  speak out, I do it."  </P> <P> Underscoring this commitment to speak out are her recent Voice of America  broadcasts aimed at China.  </P> <P> "I've had a chance to speak in Chinese on the Voice of America," she said. "I  remember listening to the Voice of America during the Cultural Revolution after  midnight. Now, I feel like, 'Gosh, I want to let them know that people outside  China know and support them.' "  </P> <P> As for the crisis that has rocked China, Li Huai views it as the collision of a  society that has glimpsed a better life and of a government that is slow to  change. She feels that recent liberal progress in Chinese arts and cinema will  certainly be rolled back.  </P> <P> "In the past, the government has let the door open a little bit and exposed the  people to different cultures," she said. "Then, they go to a certain stage, and  they have to pull you back. They don't want to feel out of control.  </P> <P> "But, when the people taste a life that is better and brighter, they want it.  It doesn't matter how bad the situation is, people should struggle and try to  reach what they believe is right.  </P> <P> "I think it's a long struggle. It will take positive and negative directions.  It will be a long struggle. It's hard work."  </P></p>

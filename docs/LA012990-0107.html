			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> NEW KIDS' GOAL: ROLE MODELS  </P> <P> New Kids on the Block, the hottest teen-age pop group since the Jacksons and  Menudo, say they want to be role models for the youth of today.  </P> <P> "A lot of people associate musicians with drugs, and craziness, and being bad  people," said New Kid Jon Knight, 20.  </P> <P> "But that's not what we want to be with this group."  </P> <P> Last week, New Kids was named Favorite Pop Rock Group at the American Music  Awards. Their album, "Hangin' Tough Live," has sold 7 million copies and was  named the Favorite Pop Rock Album at the awards show.  </P> <P> "Joining the group was something like basketball: If you play basketball you  can stay off the streets, you can set a goal. Music has made a goal for us,"  Danny Wood, 19, said in an interview published in The Tennessean Sunday.  </P> <P> The other members of the quintet are Donnie Wahlberg, 20, the group's oldest  member; Jordan Knight, 18, and Joe McIntyre, who was 13 when he joined in 1984.  </P></p>

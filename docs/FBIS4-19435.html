			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alessandra Longo: "That League Member is an </F> Anti-Semite'"]    [Text] Rome -- As soon as the news spread, she herself  said: "Me, speaker of the chamber of deputies? We are in the  Lord's hands...." This was yesterday afternoon, at Montecitorio  [Chamber of Deputies]. A somewhat flustered Irene Pivetti,  Giorgio Napolitano's [outgoing lower house Speaker] purported  successor, was giving the first interviews -- surely a great day  for her, the day when the development of new events was granting  the soap opera a place in history: 31 years old, a Catholic  fundamentalist, first-time deputy in 1992. Here was League  member Pivetti suddenly being raised to the highest seat, that  of the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. A meteoric,  irresistible career in the second legislature.    Yet, some people were spoiling the party, not with the usual  behind-the-scenes teasing and vulgarity, but with a sensitive,  specific, extremely serious accusation: "Pivetti is an  anti-Semite." It was being said by [Radical leader] Marco  Pannella (who identified "anti-Semitic accents" in the newly  nominated speaker); it was being said by [Forza Italia Deputy]  Marco Taradash, "documents at hand"; it was being denounced by  Democratic Alliance [AD] Republican member Luciana Sbarbati  ("among Pivetti's virtues, there is also anti-Semitism"); it was  being asserted, indirectly, by progressive list deputies Sandra  Bonsanti, Miriam Mafai, Luigi Manconi, and Giovanna Melandri,  who were accusing her of fostering "a fundamentalist and  intolerant idea of the relationship bewteen different religious  denominations."    A rather unpleasant matter, on the eve of such an important  appointment. The Jewish Youth Federation also voiced its  protest. Suddenly, the smile on the face of Irene Pivetti, the  "evil nun," as she is called by Michele Serra, turned into a  grimace of annoyance and concern. The journalists pressed her,  she had to give an answer: "Me, an anti-Semite? Political  maneuvering, nonsense. Religion pervades my life, but it will  not interfere in the least with my role as lower house speaker,  which I intend to fulfill with the utmost sense of  responsibility, giving assurances to all those involved."    In the meantime, her accusers did not let up, making  remarks,  statements, taking up positions. What did Irene Pivetti write  in November 1992, following a raid in Rome against a number of  Jewish-owned shops, which were branded with the star of David?  That the events had been exaggerated for political reasons: "A  roll of adhesive tape, a few sheets of paper with the Star of  David printed on them, stuck on the shopwindows of a few Jewish  shopkeepers...." Why "blow the racist hot air balloon out of all  proportion?" In CORRIERE DELLA SERA, a concerned [journalist]  Arrigo Levi cited the soon-to-be house speaker's analysis: "In  our country, since the postwar period, Pivetti writes, Jews have  always been able to preserve that racial, religious, and  cultural minority's identity which they so treasure: marrying  only among themselves (if practicing), considering themselves a  people chosen by God, extending their considerable economic,  intellectual, and political influence within the community...."    Among the spoilsports, Marco Taradash brought up an old  question: Did his deputy colleague remember referring to a  "Jewish Freemasonry" in relation to a list of Italian citizens  who were considered anti-Semites, a list in which she was  herself included, "in black and white?" No, in response to this  specific question, the deputy said she did not remember: "Did I  speak of a Jewish Freemasonry? One should look at the  context...."    That would be enough to make anyone's nerves crack, but not  those of Napolitano's successor -- icy stare, Vandee  [18th-century Catholic monarchist opposition to French  revolutionary forces] cross round her neck. Speaker of the  house at 31, with Forza Italia's and National Alliance's [AN]  blessing; she, Algo Bagrielli's granddaughter, curator of her  grandfather's dictionary; she, CEI [Italian Bishops' Conference]  and Ruini's passionate enemy; she, the bandwagon's [League  nickname] runaway horse, that only [League secretary] Bossi can  rein in ("I owe him everything, I owe him the fact that I  engaged in politics, I would never criticize his decisions....")  -- she is just one step away from a miracle; we will see what  happens today.    What can she do if journalists insist on this anti-Semitism  story. The deputy goes her way and, " knife in mouth" (one of  her expressions), upholds her ideas. She tore to bits Law 194  on abortion ("but it is a state law and must be implemented,  particularly the part fostering contraception"); had something  conceited to say about [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi 9  [outgoing lower house Speaker] ("a lucky man, who is also  showing he is a good politician"); drew a distinction when it  came to the latter's TV networks ("He cannot get rid of them in  15 days. The essential thing is that he serve the country's  interests"); made a noncommital remark about Mussolini, in line  with an irrepressible instinct for appeasement ("whether for  better or worse, he made part of this country's history").  <H5>  Ironical Colleagues Consider Her a "Doll" </H5>   Here are some reactions to League Catholic member Irene  Pivetti's nomination as speaker of the lower house: Alfredo  Biondi (Center Union): "Me, deputy speaker? With a speaker who  is not absolutely below standard, in fact with a high-quality  one, I might agree. I am thinking of Iotti, Napolitano, or  Rodota, but I have no intention of being an employee, a civil  servant, giving lessons to kids or...dolls." Later Biondi  explained that he was joking with some friends when a journalist  overheard these comments and published them.    Massimo Scalia (Greens): "For thousands of years we Romans  have been used to tolerance and to history's vicissitudes. Ever  since Caligula nominated a horse as senator, nothing surprises  us any more."    Rocco Buttiglione (Italian Popular Party): "I am very much  in favor. It will raise the institutions' esthetic standards.  It will help us bear the incredible boring sessions in store  for us. This, however, is not enough to become the speaker of  the house. I am very much afraid I cannot give her my vote."    Vittorio Sgarbi (Forza Italia): "Pivetti for speaker of the  house? I would also have nominated her. I cannot imagine a  more representative and appropriate personality: We move from  the contemplation of the Madonna [reference to President  Scalfaro's frequent references to the Virgin Mary] to the  Madonna herself."</p>

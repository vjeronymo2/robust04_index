			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Tapie's recovery unnerves Socialists: Surge in Euro-polls has party big guns aiming at Marseilles' favourite son Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French politician and businessman, yesterday sought to quash speculation that he might contest next year's presidential election by claiming that his main political ambition was to become mayor of Marseilles. 'The next election, the only one that interests me, is the Marseilles election,' he said on French radio. 'None of the others interests me at all.' Mr Tapie, who holds a parliamentary seat near Marseilles and was briefly minister of urban affairs in the last Socialist cabinet, has come under fire from the Socialist establishment because of the success of MRG, his radical left group, in the campaign for next month's European elections. MRG, recently dubbed Les Tapistes by the French press, has risen steadily in the opinion polls. It now commands the support of around 10 per cent of the electorate, thereby jeopardising the Socialists' hopes of repairing the damage caused by their defeat in last year's parliamentary elections by building on their gains in this spring's local vote. Ms Martine Aubry, a former Socialist minister who is the daughter of Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission and a contender for the Socialist presidential candidacy, on Sunday accused Mr Tapie of having 'no concrete ideas' to offer voters and of 'showering people with illusions'. Her criticism was echoed by Mr Michel Rocard, Socialist first secretary and Mr Delors' chief rival for the presidential candidacy, who said that he was 'in complete intellectual agreement' with Ms Aubry on the Tapie issue. So far the opposition of the establishment appears to have enhanced Mr Tapie's popularity with the French public, rather than detracting from it. He has always cut a flamboyant figure in the elitist world of French politics as one of the few self-made men ever to have made it to the top. His popularity has even survived a series of scandals over his business dealings. Mr Tapie has not only been implicated in the allegations of match-rigging against Olympique-Marseille, his football club, but is under investigation in a fraud trial. He was last week fined FFr1m (Dollars 170,000) by the French stock market authorities for releasing misleading information about one of his old business interests. These revelations, coupled with the recent decision by Credit Lyonnais, his bank, to cal in his loans, have served to reinforce Mr Tapie's maverick reputation and have helped fuel Les Tapistes' rise in the opinion polls. The French media has been swift to draw parallels between Mr Tapie and Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the new Italian prime minister.</p>

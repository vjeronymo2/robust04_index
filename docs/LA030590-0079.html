			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOTTLED MESSAGE TRAVELS THE PACIFIC, REACHES PHILIPPINES  </P> <P> When radio talk show host Ross Olney began throwing bottled messages into the  Pacific six years ago, he never dreamed that one would end up in the central  Philippines.  </P> <P> Every whale-watching season since 1984, Olney -- the host of an afternoon news  and entertainment show on radio station KVEN in Ventura -- tosses at least two  marked wine bottles out into the waters of Southern California. The lucky  finder of such a bottle wins a gift, which, in the past, has included water  beds, diamond ring sets and stereo systems.  </P> <P> "All the things that have happened in the world in the last four years, and  this bottle has just been floating around!" said Olney, 60, of Ventura. "A  little tiny bottle in that big ocean is very hard to find. This gives me some  hope that some others have been found by others just as far away."  </P> <P> The latest winner, Darwin Pena Randa, a fisherman from the Philippines, found  the bottle in January and wrote a letter to Olney to claim his guaranteed prize  -- a 35mm camera and 10 rolls of film.  </P> <P> Meteorologists told Olney that for the bottle to have arrived in the Surigao  del Sur region of the Philippines, it must have traveled more than 10,000 miles  along a Pacific tidal current. "It went past Washington, Alaska, the Aleutian  Islands, just passed Russia, and came down to the Philippines," Olney said.  </P> <P> The bottle included a letter on KVEN stationery and a personalized gift  certificate typed by Olney. The directions told the finder to call the radio  station collect to claim the prize, Olney said.  </P> <P> Rather than a call, however, Olney earlier this year received a letter from  Randa that read: "I am the founder of the lucky bottle. We found the bottle at  the sea coz I am a fisher man," Olney said.  </P></p>

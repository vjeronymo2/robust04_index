			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Repsol sets offer price at Pta2,735 after high demand A STRONG demand for Repsol equity has allowed the Spanish energy group to waive a discount in its global offering to institutional investors and set a price of Pta2,735 (Dollars 23.68) a share, its closing share price on Tuesday on the Madrid stock exchange. The issue is likely to be one of the largest this year to be aimed at international institutions, and will realise Pta110bn. Repsol will be issuing 40m shares, which is the maximum amount of equity that it was authorised to offer by the government. The book-building process, in which Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, acted as global co-ordinator with Banco Bilbao Vizcaya as joint co-ordinator, reportedly indicated a demand for 70m shares. Repsol said a total of 35m shares had been allocated to the five tranches of the offering and that it was issuing a further 5m 'greenshoe', or over-allotment, shares - 15 per cent of the total offering - in an over-allocation option in order to stabilise the market. In the allocation, the US tranche, led by Goldman Sachs, is offering 14.5m shares and 8.45m shares are being offered in the UK where SG Warburg and Banco Santander de Negocios are co-lead managers. The continental European tranche, jointly led by Paribas and Credit Suisse First Boston, totals 6m shares; the Spanish one, which has Banco Central Hispano as lead manager, amounts to 4.25m; and the rest of the world tranche, which is being led by Morgan Stanley, has been allocated 1.8m shares. Madrid stockbroking firms FG and Ibersecurities, which had earlier hoped that Repsol would set the offer price at Pta2,700 a share, yesterday recommended the shares at their higher price as an attractive long-term buy with a target of Pta2,900 to Pta3,000. The global offering represents 13.3 per cent of Repsol's equity and it will reduce the government's shareholding in the energy group from 54.4 per cent to 41.1 per cent.</p>

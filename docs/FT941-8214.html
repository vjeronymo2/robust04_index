			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sega sees downturn in profit for year Sega, the Japanese video games group, has warned that pre-tax profits will drop this financial year, the first fall in 12 years. The company blamed the decline on the strong yen and the recession in Europe, which led to fierce price competition. Pre-tax profits will fall by 24 per cent this year from Y55bn to Y42.5bn (Dollars 407m), it said. In November, the company forecast a rise to Y57.5bn. Turnover, which was expected to increase from Y346bn to Y380bn, will only reach Y351bn, it added. The group said it expects profits to increase in the next financial year, helped by the opening of a series of theme parks in Osaka, Yokohama and Chiba. It also has plans for a joint venture with Universal to open a park in the US. Profits next year will also be boosted by the launch of a new home multimedia video game system called Saturn using 32-bit microprocessors. Current consoles use 16-bit technology. Sega forecast consolidated sales for the year to March 31 of Y385bn, compared with a previous estimate of Y480bn and last year's figure of Y416bn. Consolidated pre-tax profits would be Y20.5bn, compared with the previous forecast of Y65bn, and last year's result of Y57.4bn. The international credit reputation of corporate Japan was further damaged when Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) was stripped of its triple-A rating by Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency. About Dollars 38bn of rated debt is affected, writes Antonia Sharpe. The one-notch cut in Tepco's senior debt rating to double-A plus follows a series of downgradings over the past year of some of Japan's best-known companies, including Nissan, American Honda and Sony. S&amp;P said the downgrade of Tepco's rating, which has now been removed from CreditWatch, reflects the erosion of its financial profile.</p>

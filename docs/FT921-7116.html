			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Peru hits back at Argentina over cholera PERU'S transport ministry indefinitely suspended Aerolineas Argentinas' permit to fly in and out of Lima at the weekend, in retaliation at the Argentine flag-carrier, writes Sally Bowen in Lima. Two days earlier Aerolineas Argentinas halted all flights via Lima following the death from cholera of a passenger after a Buenos Aires-Los Angeles flight revictualled in Lima. Some 60 other passengers on the same flight are said to have experienced cholera symptoms. The transport ministry criticised the 'rash declarations' made by executives of Aerolineas Argentinas, who quickly laid the blame for the cholera outbreak on food taken on at Lima. Exhaustive investigations, said the ministry, had disproved the allegations.</p>

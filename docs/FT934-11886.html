			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Dollars 200m aircraft deal for Malaysia MCDONNELL Douglas, the US aircraft manufacturer, has signed an agreement with Malaysia allowing Malaysian participation in the manufacture of equipment for McDonnell Douglas aircraft, writes Kieran Cooke from Kuala Lumpur. The agreement, said to be worth more than Dollars 200m to Malaysia over a 10-year period, is part of an offset programme resulting from Malaysia's decision earlier this year to buy eight F/A-18D McDonnell Douglas fighter aircraft. Mr Najib Abdul Razak, Malaysia's defence minister, said the offset programme would give the Royal Malaysian Air Force and local defence industry companies access to the lastest aerospace industry technology.</p>

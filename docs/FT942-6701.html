			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Shares take a tumble Those who thought last year's wave of liquidity would sweep equities ever upwards must be truly distressed to see the FT-SE 100 index fall below 3,000. As before, the problem originates with bonds. This week's decision by the Bundesbank to cancel an auction of debt securities and an upward revision in US first quarter growth seemed calculated to upset bonds and therefore equities too. It is striking, though, that London equities, which fell 5 per cent this week, have been worse hit than their US equivalents. The Dow is little changed. Perhaps European markets were relatively more exposed to speculative international flows. That would explain the violent nature of the downturn. Perhaps too the earnings story was not strong enough to sustain equities at higher levels. The London market does not look expensive on fundamental yardsticks. The prospective yield of around 4.5 per cent is not far short of what is available on cash. The prospective multiple of about 14.5 times is not very demanding. Yet such ratios do not make the market an unequivocal buy. While the bond markets remain nervous, there is a temptation to cling on to cash. Index-linked gilt yields are again uncomfortably close to those on equities, and unsettling talk of government interference on dividends continues. The market could have some way further to fall before it bounces.</p>

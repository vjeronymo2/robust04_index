			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOULD NEVER RETURN  </P> <P> Jerry Hulse's article on Raiatea (May 21) was delightful, as was his piece on  Bora Bora. We have just returned from our seventh visit to the islands.  </P> <P> I'm sorry to disagree with his observation of the Relais Mahana. I'm certain  that because of his position and the fact that he was with travel agent Ted  Cook, he no doubt had royal treatment. I do not want royal treatment, but the  charming French family was anything but. They were rude, unhelpful and  discourteous. The rooms were small and had an extremely obnoxious odor -- we  could not use the pillows (because) they smelled so bad. Other American  visitors were treated poorly there also, we were told. The French guests were  treated very well. The beach is beautiful, but I would never return.  </P> <P> ALLE SCHUMACHER  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach  </P> <P>  Editor's note: All of Jerry Hulse's expenses were paid for by the Los Angeles  Times. Ted Cook, of Islands In The Sun, was traveling independently, not with  Hulse.  </P> <P> 6/18/89  </P></p>

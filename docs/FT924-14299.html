			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Brussels wary of Danes' plan for looser EC ties DENMARK drew a cautious response from Brussels yesterday when it proposed a series of options for loosening its links with the European Community. Senior EC officials stressed that the long-awaited Danish white paper was just a first step in a long process of negotiation between Denmark and her 11 partners on how to secure Danish ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Denmark made the proposals in an attempt to find a viable framework for its relationship with the EC. These links have been put in jeopardy by Denmark's rejection of the treaty in its June referendum. The British government, which holds the EC presidency, took an optimistic line yesterday on the Danish paper. The UK expressed confidence that the Community would respond quickly to Danish concerns over Maastricht with a declaration at the special summit in Birmingham next week committing the twelve to decentralisation and protecting national identities. Brussels, by contrast, is focusing more on the considerable legal and political hurdles hampering resolution of the 'Danish problem'. 'It will be very difficult to get unanimous agreement among the 11 on what we do for Denmark,' a Brussels diplomat said yesterday. One of the eight white paper options likely to draw particular attention is one under which Denmark could ratify the Maastricht treaty, subject to a time limit. It could then withdraw if the EC develops in ways not compatible with Danish interests. Another option in the paper proposes introducing additional clauses to the treaty. These would affect all 12 member states. The paper also proposes giving Denmark a special status in the Community. The EC's fundamental problem is that the treaty cannot come into force until it has been ratified by all 12 member states. For the moment, there is a consensus among Denmark's partners that there can be no renegotiation of the treaty. Diplomats and legal experts in European capitals are urgently examining wording which could accommodate the Danes without amounting to an amendment of Maastricht which would require re-ratification.

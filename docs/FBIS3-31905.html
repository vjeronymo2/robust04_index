Industrial output in the Czech Republic in December 1993 was  4.0 percent lower than in December 1992. It fell by 5.3 percent  in 1993 as a whole compared with 1992. Organizations with 100  or more employees had a decisive influence on the decline. In  1993, the average monthly wage in industrial organizations with  25 or more employees was 5,962 korunas [Kc] and was thus 23.8  percent higher than in 1992. The number of state enterprises  declined; on the other hand, the number of business associations  and cooperatives increased. Construction output fell at the end  of 1993 and, in December, was 20.5 percent lower than in  December 1992. The volume of construction output for 1993 as a  whole was 7.5 percent lower than in 1992. The average gross  monthly wage in organizations with 25 or more employees was  Kc6,566 and 28.6 percent higher than in 1992.    The volume of goods conveyed by public freight  transportation  in 1993 was 200.6 million tonnes; it declined by 13.2 percent.  Railroad freight transportation declined by 9.4 percent. In  view of the increasing exports, however, 14.9 percent more  wagons were used to transport cargo abroad. In public road  haulage, the percentage of international truck transportation  increased.    In 1993, the potato harvest increased by 21.7 percent, rape  by 25.9 percent, sugar beet by 11.2 percent, fruit by 13.1  percent, and vegetables by 19.1 percent. The cereal harvest  declined by 1.5 percent. Compared with 1992, the sale of  agricultural products from primary producers was 26.1 percent  lower for slaughter poultry, 10.5 percent lower for milk, and  3.1 percent lower for slaughter cattle. The sale of slaughter  hogs and eggs increased by 8.6 percent and 22.4 percent,  respectively.    Foreign trade turnover (excluding the Slovak Republic) in  1993 amounted to Kc599 billion and was 10.6 percent higher than  in 1992. Exports rose by 20 percent and imports by 2.7 percent.  Exports fell in relation to the countries of the former East  bloc. The balance of trade was in the red by Kc3.7 billion.  When trade with Slovakia is included (exports of Kc74.6  billion; imports of Kc65 billion), the overall balance was in  the black by Kc5.9 billion. The physical volume of retail sales  rose by 1.0 percent in 1993, compared with 1992.    The number of registered job seekers increased gradually  from  July and, by 31 December, had reached 185,200 (50,400 more  compared with the end of 1992). The unemployment rate at the  end of the year was 3.5 percent. The average monthly rate of  increase in consumer prices in 1993 was 1.4 percent. Following  a more substantial rise in prices in January and February,  caused in particular by the introduction of value-added and  consumer taxes, the rate of increase in the succeeding months  was approximately 0.5 percent. The exception was a higher rise  in prices in September and October. This was influenced by  increases in the prices of meat, meat products, and  communications tariffs.    In December 1993, the level of consumer prices was 18.2  percent higher than in December 1992. The prices of services  increased fastest (by 25.3 percent), and the prices of food  products increased slowest (by 13.2 percent). The rate of  inflation, expressed as the annual sliding average of the  aggregate consumer price index, was 20.8 percent.</p>

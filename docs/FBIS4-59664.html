			<p>BFN     [Text] Communications with Yemen these days are very  difficult. Despite this, we succeeded in establishing telephone  contact with 'Abd-al-Qadir Bajammal, former minister and deputy,  and member of the general committee of the General People's  Congress [GPC] under President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.  Regrettably, the telephone contact was poor from the technical  point of view.    In this interview, Bajammal confirmed to us the fall of  al-'Anad base. He also said that the Central Command in Sanaa  has no intention to storm Aden militarily. We asked him about  Sanaa's stand on Arab mediations after we asked him, of course,  about why Sanaa has rejected the Yemeni Socialist Party's [YSP]  recent proposal to immediately stop the fighting and resume  dialogue.    He said: [Begin recording] [Bajammal] First, about the talk  that the YSP has submitted a proposal. In reality, the proposal  should have been the basis for tackling the Yemeni crisis which  the YSP has concocted. The YSP wants to destroy the  constitutional and legitimate institutions through military  rebellion, and through political rebellion. That's why those  who ask such a thing should first of all respect constitutional  legitimacy, the legitimacy of the elections, and the law.  That's why this request cannot be accepted from one party which  has destroyed legitimacy, has flouted legitimacy, and has  undermined all the results of the democratic actions that have  been scored over the past unionist years.    [Salamah] There are Yemeni delegations from the north and  the  south that are currently visiting Arab countries, and Arab  mediations, as yet, have not attained any tangible result on the  ground in Yemen. Are you ready to deal with Arab mediations and  calls to stop the fighting and resume dialogue?    [Bajammal] First, the mediators, or those who are concerned  over Yemen, its safety, and its security should primarily be  concerned that safety and stability in Yemen consists of respect  for its legitimacy, and the respect of the people's will in the  elections. This is a basic rule. To respect the Yemenis, we  must respect their will. This is the most important thing. If  we want a any mediation to have any effect, this mediation first  of all should not be biased to a specific viewpoint, and assess  it as being a dispute outside thr framework of legitimacy. It  is a dispute to entrench legitimacy and the Yemeni popular will.  If any mediation does not respect this, the mediation, in my  opinion, will become useless. In other words, it will be a  mediation that proceeds from an erroneous understanding of the  Yemeni state of affairs, a concept that is no longer valid  because we possess a constitution, and a House of  Representatives that came into existence as a result of general  and democratic elections. What do we want after this? What is  more important than this is that they address the forces within  the YSP which rebelled against legitimacy and inform them that  this is absolutely unacceptable. This is the real introduction  to any mediation, and not to equate those who abide by  legitimacy with those who undermine it and force Yemen to take a  leap into the unknown. [end recording]</p>

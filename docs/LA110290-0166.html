			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEASURE M;  </P> <P> TAX OPPONENT ACCUSES REED OF REAPING PROFIT  </P> <P> Launching a last volley before the Tuesday election, a leading opponent of the  Measure M sales tax proposal made a personal attack Thursday on Dana Reed,  chairman of the Orange County Transportation Commission and a leader of the  Measure M campaign.  </P> <P> Slow-growth activist Tom Rogers, chairman of Citizens Against Unfair Taxation,  charged at a news conference that Reed's Costa Mesa law firm is improperly  profiting from the Measure M campaign. He cited campaign finance disclosure  forms that show Reed's law partner, Cary Davidson, has received $7,590 in fees  from Citizens for Yes on Revised Measure M for serving as the campaign  treasurer.  </P> <P> Also, Rogers accused Reed of buying support for Measure M by doling out money  from his abandoned supervisorial campaign to other candidates.  </P> <P> But Reed said his law partner is acting as an individual and no money is coming  through the firm. Also, Reed said the money given to candidates, including  $1,000 donated to Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates, was his own and not leftover  campaign funds.  </P> <P> Thursday's news conference was the most visible activity to date from opponents  of Measure M. Except for a televised debate on KOCE-TV Channel 50, opponents  have maintained a very low profile.  </P> <P> Supporters of Measure M also maintained a very low profile until this week when  mail began arriving at homes throughout the county, including some pieces from  the Automobile Club of Southern California and some from local officials  exhorting residents to vote for the ballot measure as an act of good  citizenship.  </P> <P> If approved by a majority of voters countywide, Measure M would increase the  tax on retail sales from 6% to 6 1/2%. It would raise about $3.1 billion for  transportation projects over a fixed, 20-year period.  </P> <P> Accompanying Rogers at the news conference were representatives of groups that  oppose Measure M for a variety of reasons.  </P> <P> Placentia Mayor Norman Z. Eckenrode said his city and other towns in North  Orange County would not reap benefits equal to the sales tax revenue that those  cities would generate.  </P> <P> Others who showed up included Westminster Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer, who  is challenging incumbent supervisor Harriett M. Wieder; Norm Grossman, an  environmentalist and candidate for Laguna Beach City Council, and Libertarian  Party Chairman Jack Dean.  </P> <P> Neugebauer contended that the growth controls in Measure M transfer decision  making from local, elected officials to a panel of appointees, while Grossman  argued that Measure M isn't strong enough on growth management.  </P> <P> Dean argued simply that private enterprise should be allowed to solve the  county's traffic mess without tax increases.  </P> <P> All participants said OCTC should either be disbanded or its members subjected  to a countywide election.  </P> <P> Referring to Reed and the issue of his law firm's role and Reed's campaign  donations to candidates, Rogers said: "I think it's highly inappropriate. This  is the height of arrogance."  </P> <P> "I agree with Tom that this is improper," Reed responded, "and that's why I  structured things this way -- precisely so it wouldn't be a problem. I derive  no financial benefit whatsoever from the Measure M campaign. In fact, it's  hurting the firm, because my partner could be spending his time on the firm's  business and he's not."  </P> <P> Reed provided The Times with copies of his campaign reports, which showed that  he reported the donations to Gates and other candidates as personal  contributions, and not those of his campaign committee. Reed said there was no  mingling of his personal funds and campaign receipts.  </P> <P> Reed said the disclosure format is easily misunderstood because it asks  candidates to list their personal contributions in the same reporting package  that requires disclosure of the campaign committee's receipts and expenditures.  </P> <P> "No campaign money of mine went to any candidate," Reed said.  </P></p>

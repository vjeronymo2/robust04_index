			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Armscor Executive General Manager Tielman de </F> Waal by defense correspondent Norman Chandler; place and date  not given -- first pagragraph is THE STAR introduction]    [Text] Amscor's [Armaments Corporation of South Africa]  executive general manager, Tielman de Waal, speaks about the  organisation and its future role in southern Africa in general:    Q: What problems has Armscor faced in adjusting to its new  role and function since converting to its new status as the  acquisition organisation for the SANDF [South African National  Defence Force]?    A: It has primarily been an organisational and functional  change. We had to change our vision of the present and future  South Africa as well as our view of Armscor's position in the  country's economic household (and this) involved scaling down  manpower activities in certain areas, and strengthening manpower  in others. Our relationship with the arms industry has never  been healthier.    Q: Do you place a high premium on local companies increasing  their international market share?    A: Exports are of paramount importance for the economy to  grow to required levels over the next 10 years. Companies have,  for too long, suffered from a "blockade mentality" and need to  broaden their outlook. The only way our economy can grow is  through active participation in international markets. To be  successful, however, we need to become far more productive and  competitive.    The arms industry has a tremendous advantage over other  players who have been manufacturing under licence agreements  from overseas companies for a considerable time (as) Armscor's  producers are mostly unique and that is why the arms industry is  the [as published]    Q: How do you see Armscor's future as the acquisition  organisation for the SANDF?    A: Since the SANDF will need to replace most of its major  equipment over the next two decades, or face a massive reduction  of its capabilities, Armscor will still have a vital function to  fulfill.    The local military industry will have to contend with full  foreign competition, and this means it will have to look closely  at performance, value and cost-effectiveness.    We are not only acquiring capital equipment for the army but  are engaged in procuring everyday necessities, which may sound  mundane but are important for the well-being of the soldier --  items ranging from basic foodstuffs to socks and boots.    Q: What specific areas of growth would there be for Armscor?    A: There are tremendous growth opportunities, not only in  servicing established clients, but also extending services to  government institutions. We can also be of invaluable help to  other countries in southern Africa, and this is an area in which  I perceive growth potential.    The whole of the sub-continent has a wealth of military  vehicles and equipment left over from recent wars (and) these  need to be maintained and upgraded. Armscor's biggest growth  area, however, lies in the field of counter trade, in which we  are the leaders in this country.    By being active in this field, we can contribute towards the  growth of industrial enterprise and contribute further towards  the saving of foreign exchange and new job opportunities.</p>

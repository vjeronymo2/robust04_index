			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Ilyas al-Hirawi addressed a Ramadan  banquet he hosted at the B'abda Palace this evening. He said  the Lebanese people are firm in their unity no matter how often  they are faced with challenges and danger. He added that the  abominable crime [explosion in a Beirut church] committed in the  midst of the peace process surprised us but the Lebanese  people's unanimity on denouncing it came as a plebiscite that  confirmed the confidence in our march. The president added:  Hence, it is our responsibility to be frank. Committing a  criminal act inside God's houses reflects the extent to which  moral, spiritual, and civil backwardness has reached. We are no  longer able to tell whether the call for peace ushers in the  21st century or whether it stoops with humanity to the world of  treachery. We appeal to the wise people and thinkers to rush to  launch a major cultural awakening campaign to uproot the desire  for violence and extremism. We uphold the cause of peace and  democracy, and man's life is dearer than shedding blood in vain.  The Lebanese people's denunciation of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre was no less than the denunciation of the massacre in  the Sayyidat al-Najat Church. We are united for the sake of  Lebanon as we are united against violence and extremism.  Lebanon, which held the shield of defense of all Arabs, is  against the defamation of Arab dignity anywhere, even against  our brothers [reference to Palestinians], for whom we bore the  heaviest burden when they believed that the road to Jerusalem  passed through the destruction of Lebanon. When they thought  they had obtained their rights, they broke away from us and  bypassed Arab solidarity, to which we committed ourselves when  the negotiations began.    President al-Hirawi continued: Our security has been  achieved, but before we could rebuild and recover our rights,  certain factions have rushed through crime to revive fear and  doubt in our unity and accomplishments. However, the national  unity proved how fruitful our efforts have been and proved that  our peace process is genuine. He added: You all know that any  incident smaller than this crime was enough to foment sedition  and destroy the country. We have won the wager, the bet on our  unity. The Lebanese people decided on coexistence as their way  of life and as the message of their country. Any violation of  this method is a blow against the Lebanese people's will and  against the whole world, which was unanimous on supporting  Lebanon's reconciliation, independence, and sovereignty.  Foreign plots will not succeed if people at home are not  (?deceived) by wrong convictions and allured by a handful of  money. In any case, the state will not hesitate to deal with  any breach of security because security, freedom, and national  unity take precedence over politics and its ploys. What  happened did not target the Christians as much as it targeted  the state, the citizen, and all of Lebanon.    The president said that what is needed is a link between  freedom and fact. He added that decisive options are necessary  in various economic, political, cultural, and educational  spheres and noted that loyalty to the country is not determined  according to relations with officials.    He asked: How can we be healthy and how can democracy be  healthy amidst sectarian squabbling? What is required is a  thought that will develop citizenship and combat sectarianism  and tribalism.    He emphasized commitment to seeking a comprehensive and just  peace based on international resolutions and in coordination  with the brothers, especially Syria. He said: We will not go  separately and will allow no one to take exclusive control of  us. We will not be insignificant in peace time. We are  following up the process with every confidence and faith.    President al-Hirawi affirmed that everyone will rush to  receive his holiness the pope, who will see the truth in our  country and realize that the greatest of nations is the one that  grows stronger when there is danger.</p>

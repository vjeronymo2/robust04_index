			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Shop crime hits morale and profit: 1.2m customers and 28,000 staff detained in connection with offences Retailers' profits would have been 23 per cent higher last year without the growing problem of retail crime, the British Retail Consortium said yesterday. The consortium, which represents 90 per cent of UK retailers, said its first comprehensive survey of retail crime revealed that the true cost of crime to retailers was about Pounds 2bn a year. That was more than the cost of running the magistrates' courts system for a year, and almost twice the annual cost of running the Crown Prosecution Service. The survey found a total of 2.1m criminal incidents in the retail industry including 1.5m customer thefts. The consortium warned that 'small retailers' profitability and morale can often be so affected by crime that continued trading is no longer viable'. The 120,000 incidents of criminal damage - or 54 for every 100 shops - compares with only eight in 100 individuals who have their cars vandalised each year, and seven in 100 whose homes are vandalised. The survey's other main findings included: Almost 3,700 arson attacks. More than 14,400 robberies. More than 31,000 incidents of theft or fraud by staff. Pounds 21.7m losses to retailers through fraud using payment cards, cheque cards and other means. More than 7,000 incidents of terrorism, including confirmed incidents and hoaxes. Incidence of burglary was highest for grocery stores (95 per 100 stores). Retailers detained 1.2m customers and 28,000 staff in connection with crimes, but dealt with 450,000 of these themselves, without passing them on to the police. Many retailers do not bother to hand over shoplifters because of the slim chance of a conviction under the present system. But the consortium said the answer was not necessarily tougher laws or a clampdown on shoplifters. 'If every shop thief was handed over to the police, the whole criminal justice system would grind to a halt,' said Mr James Mays, director-general. He added that there were ways in which retailers could improve their co-operation with the Crown Prosecution Service to increase the arrest rate of persistent and professional shoplifters, and make sure they were 'prosecuted to the full extent of the law'.

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Change of heart by US on Gatt The US is expected this week to withdraw its threat to leave the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade soon after the World Trade Organisation, Gatt's successor, comes into force on January 1. The move would have left those countries which were not WTO members by the date the US left without legal protection for existing Gatt benefits. Washington's change of heart follows a deal between the leading trading nations under which WTO members will have the right to pull out of Gatt after the end of next year. Since virtually all Gatt's 124 members are expected to be WTO members by then, Gatt will effectively cease to exist. During 1995 Gatt and WTO rules will run in parallel, a legally uncomfortable arrangement that the US had wanted to avoid. WTO rules and commitments will take precedence where the two overlap or conflict. Trade diplomats said yesterday that the deal, worked out last weekend between the US, European Union, Japan and Canada had won broad acceptance among Gatt members. It was expected to be formally endorsed at tomorrow's WTO implementation conference which must decide on transitional arrangements. However, to the alarm of trading partners, the US was sticking to its intention to leave the various voluntary Gatt codes of fair trade practice early next year. This would deprive countries of the right to challenge US anti-dumping and anti-subsidy actions initiated under Gatt rules. The WTO anti-dumping and countervailing duty accords, which will apply to all WTO members, allow recourse to the organisation's disputes procedure only for suits filed after January 1. Suits filed before that date could result in duties being imposed which could not be challenged either under the WTO or under the Gatt codes because the US would no longer be a member. Washington has said it is prepared to acknowledge cases already going through Gatt procedures, which include an important EU challenge on anti-subsidy duties on steel. US officials claim withdrawal will not make much difference to the outcome of these disputes, since under existing Gatt rules any nation can block adoption of panel rulings it disputes. Trade officials were also trying to sort out before tomorrow's meeting a wrangle over who should chair the key WTO committee which will monitor the dismantlement of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement restricting imports of textiles and clothing from the Third World. The decision on who should head the WTO, could be postponed to early next year.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up - Hungary The Budapest Stock Exchange is to increase its disclosure requirements from next year, writes Virginia Marsh. From January, quoted companies will have to present consolidated accounts to the BSE. Listed companies will have to report within 45 days of the end of the quarter, while traded companies will have to report half-yearly rather than quarterly as at present. Companies will have to report comparative figures for the previous year and provide an analysis of their forecasts and results, including sales and profit. The move is designed to bring the BSE closer to European norms.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / IG Metall in offer to swap pay for power IG METALL, Germany's most powerful union, has offered to abandon its traditional negotiating stance, based on demands for higher wages, in return for more worker participation in industry. The proposal for a complete overhaul of pay and conditions strategies was presented yesterday by Mr Klaus Zwickel, incoming IG Metall president, as the union's contribution to overcoming Germany's economic crisis. His offer represents a belated attempt by the union to stem the tide of one-off in-house deals eroding its influence over the engineering and metalworking industries. It also follows a persistent campaign from employers, government and the Bundesbank for longer working hours, non-inflationary pay deals, weekend work, fewer holidays and less lavish fringe benefits to combat German industry's fast-fading competitiveness. IG Metall members at a Stuttgart bus factory recently agreed to return to working a 40-hour week, while national policy remains the institution of a 35-hour week. Bosch, the electronics group, has won agreement for Sunday working in a new plant after threatening to build the factory outside Germany. According to the latest estimates, there are about 2,000 plant-level agreements in operation, many with better conditions than those offered in national settlements. Mr Zwickel told a conference that the union would give up its demands for high pay rises 'in the coming years' in exchange for improved working and performance-related conditions and more say in the running of companies. The new character of industrial work in a high-wage country such as Germany demanded a qualified workforce with more scope for taking responsibility and working constructively in teams. 'The reform of agreements should increase humanity and efficiency and also help preserve jobs,' Mr Zwickel claimed. Employers had to accept new arrangements, but only within the framework of national pay and conditions agreements, and not in piecemeal deals, he added. His proposals mark a radical change in thinking which has been fiercely debated for months within the union's headquarters. The offer follows a less refined proposal from Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the former union president who resigned over an insider trading scandal. Mr Steinkuhler said last year that the union was prepared conditionally to accept five years of pay settlements which did no more than preserve members' purchasing power.</p>

(Gasco) in Morgan County, Ohio, under Columbia's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83&hyph;76&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Columbia proposes to establish a new point of delivery to Gasco at a location where it currently receives volumes from Gasco. Columbia states that it will deliver up to 100 dekatherms per day, 36,500 annually, to Gasco at the new point. Columbia further states that the new point has been requested by Gasco for interruptible transportation service for residential and commercial use. Columbia states that the quantities to be provided through the new point will be provided on an interruptible basis, and therefore, will have no impact on Columbia's existing design day and annual obligations to its customers. In addition, Columbia states that the estimated cost to establish the new point of delivery will be $15,778, which Gasco has agreed to reimburse Columbia for the total cost, plus any gross-up for tax purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> November 18, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Standard Paragraphs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F.

In a statement to Radio Novi Sad, he assessed that UN  forces are attempting to calm the situation only in places where  the Muslim forces are not having successes. "It is for precisely  this reason that we have sent a protest to the United Nations,  stressing in particular the examples of the battlefields near  Maglaj, Bihac, and some others," Krajisnik added. He stressed  that forecasts of a Muslim offensive have turned out to be true  and he confirmed that Muslims are obtaining weapons from abroad.</p>

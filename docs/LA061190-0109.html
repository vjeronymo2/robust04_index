			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> 2 GET MAXIMUM TERMS IN RACIST KILLING OF BLACK N.Y. TEEN-AGER  </P> <P> Two 19-year-old whites convicted in the mob beating death of a black teen-ager  received maximum sentences today.  </P> <P> Joseph Fama was sentenced to 32 2/3 years to life in prison for his conviction  on murder and other charges.  </P> <P> Keith Mondello, the reputed ringleader of the bat-wielding mob who was  convicted of lesser offenses, was sentenced to the maximum 5 1/3 to 16 years in  prison.  </P> <P> "Without Mr. Mondello, there would not have been the death of anyone. It was a  senseless death," said state Supreme Court Justice Thaddeus Owens.  </P> <P> As Owens delivered Fama's sentence in the packed courtroom, Moses Stewart, the  father of slain teen-ager Yusuf Hawkins, watched intently and whispered loudly,  "Yes!"  </P> <P> Mondello had been sentenced earlier in the day.  </P> <P> Mondello was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges but convicted of  riot, unlawful imprisonment and discrimination in the Aug. 23 incident that  spurred racial tensions in the city. Fama was convicted of murder and other  charges.  </P></p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Barrs name their choice for chairman Nicholas and Robert Barr, the brothers who lead the rebel shareholders at Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust, yesterday named a chairman designate to replace their uncle on the board of the leisure and motor distribution group. The brothers, who claim majority support among ordinary - voting - shareholders, announced that Sir David Rowe-Ham would be their candidate as chairman in place of Mr Malcolm Barr. Sir David, a former Lord Mayor of London, is a non-executive director of Williams Holdings and Apta Healthcare. The brothers, who have called an EGM to unseat the group's present chief executive and finance director, also appointed NM Rothschild as their financial advisers. They plan to run the company's two core divisions as stand-alone businesses, and enfranchise the non-voting A shares, owned almost entirely by institutions. The board has called another EGM to discuss its own plans for enfranchising the A shares. A document is expected imminently.</p>

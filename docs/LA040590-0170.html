			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VIEW FINDER: ODDS &amp; ENDS AROUND THE VALLEY  </P> <P> Portrait of a Full Life  </P> <P> You think you're busy. At 84, Sam Tash of Northridge still has more to do than  he has time for.  </P> <P> "I've got lots of painting to do," he said with a shake of his head. Tash  paints life-size portraits from snapshots for family, friends and friends of  friends.  </P> <P> "When I paint a portrait, it looks just like the people," he said. His fee? "I  ask them to make a $25 donation to the Wilkinson Senior Center."  </P> <P> The Northridge facility, operated by the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks  Department, is a past recipient of Tash's artistic generosity. Three years ago,  he donated a 4-by-8-foot painting to the center, which shows senior citizens  engaged in some of its many activities, such as bingo, ballroom dancing,  billiards, painting, crocheting and card-playing.  </P> <P> "I admire that mural every day and I've been coming here for four years," said  Satch Fleming, 83, of Northridge. "It's a real work of art."  </P> <P> So how many paintings does Tash, a former orchestra leader, finish in a month?  "It depends on how ambitious I feel," he said with a laugh. And on how much  time he's spent playing his violin instead.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lots of Controversy  </P> <P> Homeowner groups in Encino and Tarzana are dealing with a very  Beverly-Hills-ish problem: tear-downs.  </P> <P> "Developers buy a piece of property, take down a one-story ranch-style home and  put up a two-story house that they take to either side of the lot lines," said  Joel Palmer, president of the board of directors for Tarzana Property Owners  Assn.  </P> <P> "It means a loss of privacy for the neighbors because now they have a huge  house looking down into their yard. These new houses are simply too big for the  lots and they're changing the character of the community."  </P> <P> Richard Smith, past president of Encino Property Owners Assn., pointed out  another problem plaguing neighborhoods. "There are a number of one- and  two-acre lots in this area, and they're being bought up and then subdivided  into as many as four to six lots," Smith said. As Palmer elaborated, "It  creates a density problem."  </P> <P> The nonprofit group Homeowners of Encino regularly receives notices from the  city's planning department regarding lot splits. "We used to get one every six  weeks, and now we get two a week," said Gerald A. Silver, the group's  president. "The neighborhood is getting chopped up into postage-stamp sized  lots."  </P> <P> The economics of the situation have pitted neighbor against neighbor. "It's  creating a near-warlike environment between homeowners," Smith said. Some  homeowners are adamantly against any changes in lot sizes, and others want to  cash in on the gold mine their property has become.  </P> <P> Smith keeps the issue in perspective. "It's not really poor versus rich when  you're talking about $700,000 houses being torn down," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Message of Hope  </P> <P> "Two-thirds of people with multiple sclerosis -- MS -- are doing relatively  well 20 years after the onset of the disease," said Audrey Goldman, of the  Multiple Sclerosis Society's Southern California chapter.  </P> <P> "It's an adult-onset disease, but it's not terminal. It affects the central  nervous system, which is made up of the brain and spinal cord, so that  basically it's a conduction problem: The brain's messages get interrupted. In  severe cases, though, the messages just can't get through anymore."  </P> <P> About 25 people in the San Fernando Valley with severe cases of MS will soon  participate in a three-month study directed by Robert Winslow, professor of  leisure studies and recreation at Cal State Northridge. The goal is to develop  individual recreation programs that are based on their abilities and interest.  </P> <P> The problem for most people with severe MS, according to Winslow, is that they  led very active lives before the onset of the disease and they have an  overabundance of free time. "They can't do the things they used to and  consequently they feel very isolated because they're homebound," he said.  </P> <P> Goldman, who is also involved with the study, said, "They're bored and don't  feel as productive. We want to help them develop a menu of activities so they  can actually make selections during the day. We want to expand their choices."  </P> <P> The study is being conducted with a $15,125 grant from the National Multiple  Sclerosis Society. More than 1,200 Valley residents are registered with the  Southern California chapter. "And we figure there's one person who doesn't  contact us for every one who does," Goldman added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overheard  </P> <P> "All my life I looked up to ballplayers -- they were my heroes -- and now  they're all younger than me. It makes me feel old." -- Man in early 40s to  friend in line at Cineplex Odeon in Universal City  </P></p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (5): A good year despite bad debts - The Non-Banks Among the casualties of the deterioration in asset prices in Japan are the country's non-banks - the group of financial companies which sprang up in the 1970s to meet market demands ignored by the banks. But despite their bad debt problems, non-bank stocks performed well last year. The non-bank 'other financial' sector rose 32.17 per cent last year, compared with 10 per cent for the broad Topix index, according to Nomura International. Mr David Snoddy, an analyst at Jardine Fleming, says the three factors which drove share prices higher were falling interest rates, a perception that the risk profile of the sector had improved and the liberalisation of commercial paper issuance rules for non-banks, allowing some of them to raise funds more cheaply. However, he believes that these factors have provided a relatively short-term boost and that non-banks will only continue to out-perform other sectors of the stock market if 'the basic businesses of the non-banks are growth businesses.' So what are these basic businesses? In fact, the non-bank sector covers a wide range of areas: credit cards, consumer lending, loan guarantees, corporate loans and leasing - and different companies focus on different businesses, often exclusively. Broadly, those active in consumer rather than corporate lending tend to be viewed more positively, partly because any pick-up in the economy is expected to show first in greater consumer spending, rather than in corporate borrowing for capital investment. In particular, Japan's credit card business is expected to expand rapidly in the 1990s, given the relatively low base for credit card use in Japan. In 1991, the last year for which figures are available, the ratio of credit card transactions to total consumption was 7.1 per cent in Japan, compared with 17.6 per cent in the US. 'For Japan to go to only 10 per cent means an almost 50 per cent growth in the credit card business, even assuming that consumption stays flat,' Mr Snoddy points out. Among the large non-bank companies set to benefit from the expected growth of the credit card market are Daiei Finance and Credit Saison, which have extensive retail affiliations, and Nippon Shinpan, which already has a large market share and a relationship with Citibank, one of the largest US issuers. Credit Saison, which is linked to Seibu, the country's largest retail sales group, has had an annual increase of 1m cards for the past 11 years, with an estimated 11.5m cards in circulation as of March 1994. However, there are a number of black clouds on the horizon for the credit card companies. One threat is the rise of discount stores, most of which only accept cash. Another is competition from banks. According to Mr Snoddy, of the 203m cards in issue in 1992, 76m were issued by bank-related companies, of which the largest is JCB. In the past 10 years, the banks' share of the card market has risen from 27.6 per cent to 37.5 per cent. Others question whether the credit card business in Japan will reach the same relative size as in the US. Some analysts argue that in a country where it is still safe to carry large sums of money in cash, and savings rates are high, there is less need for consumers to carry credit cards. Other consumer lending businesses are less attractive. Instalment loans, for example, are widely seen as a declining business. They are being replaced in part by greater use of credit cards for financing all but the largest consumer durables. In part, this stems from the relative fall in prices of consumer durables such as televisions. Instead, lenders are concentrating on instalment loans for cars. However, the finance arms of car companies are becoming increasingly aggressive competitors in this market. Some non-banks are retaining the guarantee part of the loan business. For example, Aplus, which used to have a monopoly on financing BMWs sold in Japan, lost its monopoly to BMW Japan Finance but continues to handle guarantees for the finance company's instalment lending. Straightforward consumer lending is still the mainstay of the group of companies known as the sarakin - or loan sharks. They too are under pressure from the banks, and tend to lend on an uncollateralised basis. However, because their interest rates are higher - the maximum allowed is 29.2 per cent - they can tolerate greater losses. Mr Kyosuke Kinoshita, president of ACOM, predicts 10 per cent growth for his company. However, the prospects of many non-banks are blighted by bad debt problems, largely stemming from property investments which went awry. For many companies, the loans were not just straightforward commercial property loans for office blocks in Tokyo, but ambitious resort developments, such as condominiums on the Australian Gold Coast. 'Many of these investments are so far under water' that the low interest rate environment in Japan will do little to help, according to Ms Alicia Ogawa, vice-president, equity research at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. 'More important is support from their lending banks.' Worse, the extent of individual companies' problems can be hard to trace. 'The problem with non-banks is that each has dozens of unlisted, unconsolidated companies involved in real estate development. Many of these companies are in serious trouble,' says Ms Ogawa. For example the exposure of Nippon Shinpan to affiliates in real estate is at least three times the size of its own capital, she said. However, some companies believe that they are nearing the end of the tunnel. Mr Yoshihiko Miyauchi, president and chief executive officer of Orix Corporation, believes that 'we are now very close to the bottom', having marked most of the company's property exposure to market. While Orix Corporation, whose main business is leasing, has already announced a 5 per cent decline in net income on the previous year, there are some bright spots. 'We are depreciating questionable accounts more than we had planned,' said Mr Miyauchi. 'We are taking a more conservative approach.' While leasing is Orix's core business, it also has some property exposure. However, Mr Miyauchi believes the company has benefited from its geographical diversification. 'International transactions account for one third of our income,' he points out. The prospects for the industry as a whole depend largely on the impact of the government's economic package announced earlier this year. Japanese banks lent heavily to non-banks in the 1980s and are now faced with a heavy burden of bad debt. The package allows banks to shift deteriorating assets off their balance sheets by securitising the loans. However, according to David Marshall, an analyst at IBCA, 'The measures could be viewed as another round of shuffling problem assets and not a real solution to the banks' asset quality problems.' It seems likely that the bad debt problem will continue to hang over the sector for some years to come. 'The general pattern here in Japan is that writing off loans takes a long time,' says Mr Kyosuke Kinoshita of ACOM.</p>

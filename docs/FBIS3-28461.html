			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Speaking to reporters, Deputy Foreign Minister Surin  Phitsuwan said he could not confirm the report by a foreign news  agency that the suspects in the bombing of the World Trade  Center are hiding in Thailand. Surin said he did not know where  the agency got its information. The National Security Council  is checking the report. If this is true, it will give Thailand  a bad reputation. The Foreign Ministry will make clarifications  later.    [Begin Surin recording, in progress] ...U.S. Government  authorities in Thailand have confirmed to me that they have no  information on this matter -- no proof; no evidence. They  themselves know nothing about it. They do not know who the  source of the report is or how reliable it is. Therefore, we  will have to check on it. We cannot remain idle; still, we  cannot take the report at face value because there has been no  confirmation. We have only read this in newspapers that quote  sources and make headlines about it.

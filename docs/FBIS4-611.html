			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town April 9 SAPA -- The African National  Congress must now say whether Mrs Winnie Mandela will still be  on its list of candidates because people wanted to know for whom  they were voting on April 27, Law and Order Minister Hernus  Kriel said on Saturday [9 April].    Mr Kriel, who is NP [National Party] premier candidate for  the Western Cape, was referring to an article published in a  Cape Town newspaper about an ANC commission of inquiry into  money collected by Mrs Mandela for the social welfare  department, which has gone astray. "This is the kind of person  the ANC is asking you to vote for. I want to make an offer to  the ANC. They should approach the South African Police and they  will find out who took the money. Any organisation that finds  funds have gone missing goes straight to the police, they don't  hold commissions and then say it is a pity details have been  published. People want to know the truth so they know for whom  they will be voting on April 27. If money goes missing from the  organisation even before they are in power, what is going to  happen if they come to power? The ANC cannot even govern a  township properly and yet it wants to govern the country."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis  said that the objective of his visit to Cyprus, which will begin  tomorrow, is to promote the coordination of defense plans  between Greece and Cyprus. In a statement, Arsenis also said  that the coordination is necessary because the two countries  face a common danger. The Greek national defense minister noted  that a prerequisite for the coordination of defense plans is the  coordination of armaments programs. That is why, during his  visit, he will be accompanied by the president and other  officials of the greek arms industry. Asked why a common  defense goal had not been promoted in the past, Arsenis said  that perhaps in the past there was too much optimism about the  initiatives for a diplomatic solution. In order to promote a  diplomatic, political, and viable solution, Arsenis stressed  that we should have high credibility in the area of defense.  [passage omitted]</p>

Addressing a working conference on economic development held  here recently, Wang Baosen, vice-mayor of China's capital, said  that some 35.5 billion yuan will be invested this year in the  city's social fixed assets, up 31 percent from last year.    Wang noted that some 12.5 billion yuan will be poured into  such infrastructure projects as power production, highway  construction and gas and water supply systems.    According to sources from the meeting, some 23 projects have  been listed as key construction projects for this year by the  municipal government, which include the renovation of the Third  Ring Road, the second phase of the Ninth Water Works and gas  supplies being brought to further areas of the city.

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Israel eases currency curbs Israel yesterday announced a further step in liberalising its currency. From tomorrow Israelis going abroad on holiday will be free to take up to Dollars 7,000 in cash, instead of the present ceiling of Dollars 3,000. They will also have unrestricted use of credit cards for buying goods and services, though not for drawing cash. Previously, any credit card transactions were subject to the Dollars 3,000 limit. A Bank of Israel spokesman acknowledged that the change was mainly psychological. The average Israeli tourist drew only Dollars 1,500 when travelling. But it would affect the climate and enhance the sense of a free currency. Business travellers already enjoy a ceiling of Dollars 9,000, which can be increased where justified.</p>

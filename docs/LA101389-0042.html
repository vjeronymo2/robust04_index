			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> Leza Lidow loads her oils with deceivingly humorous and deliberately macabre  images. In "Holding Court," a queen in a Marie Antoinette gown and tiara sports  the head of a poodle. She struts regally in a semi circle of other female-dog  hybrids whose nude bodies are perched on statuesque, furry legs. This rings of  silly surrealism, but the thrust here is more disturbing than cute. Lidow uses  the saturated, smoothly applied color, acute even focus and illogical Freudian  concoctions of photo surrealism to lure us into nettlesome realizations about  the female role through history. It is not simply perverse humor or an accident  that Lidow makes "I Loathe Publicity," a visual parody and a verbal  contradiction. The work depicts a dog headed baroness preening ridiculously for  some unseen camera. The show's philosophical focal point is a triptych of a  quaint cobblestone village dotted with clothes lines and romping children.  Trapped inside the diaphanous drying laundry are the stiff, self conscious  poses of nude women. Lidow would have done well to stop here. She also shows  barely mediocre sculptures of paint splattered female mannequins that dilute  her impact. (Ankrum Gallery, 657 La Cienega Blvd. to Nov. 11). MARLENA DONOHUE  </P></p>

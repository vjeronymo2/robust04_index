			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada by Haroldo </F> Shetemul; date and place not given; first paragraph is  introduction]    [Text] Following a brief period of calm, Monsignor Rodolfo  Quezada's life has returned to its hectic pace. As a result of  the agreements between the government and the URNG [Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity], the Civilian Society Assembly  [Asamblea de la Sociedad Civil] was created. UN Moderator Jean  Arnault has asked the Guatemalan Bishops Conference to head the  coordination of this body, which must discuss and propose  positions of consensus to the sides that are holding the talks  abroad.    [Shetemul] Why has the Bishops Conference decided to name  you  president of the Civilian Society Assembly?    [Quezada] The conference had always said it wanted to assist  in the peace process, and the bishops have noticed the sides  showed a political commitment when they signed the Overall  Agreement on Human Rights and Immediate International  Verification [Acuerdo Global de Derechos Humanos y la  Verificacion Internacional Immediata] and agreed to establish a  timetable for the process. Another reason was the assembly will  be convened at the request of the United Nations and the sides,  unlike the Permanent Forum for Peace, a unilateral proposal by  the government. Pope John Paul II had asked us to help in the  reconciliation.    [Shetemul] What will be the assembly's purpose?    [Quezada] To convene and gather all nongovernment civilian,  political, religious, business, mass, and Mayan sectors. We  will discuss the substantial topic of the Mexico agreements to  reach a consensus and expedite the end of the confrontation.    [Shetemul] Wouldn't the diversity of interests involved pose  an obstacle to a consensus?    [Quezada] It is certainly something which is very difficult  and complex. The easiest thing would be not to participate, but  I believe taking the risk is worth it. For that reason, the  conference has set its conditions to make the assembly  effective. One of them is that we will not discuss  circumstantial topics, only substantial ones. We will hold the  assembly if most sectors participate, and it will last five  months. We will avoid the distortion of topics and seek a  consensus, but if we do not find it, we can present qualified  majority opinions; besides, minorities' opinions will always be  present.    [Shetemul] What role will you play in the assembly?    [Quezada] The assembly president's responsibilities are to  moderate the meetings and create the mechanisms to make  everybody's participation effective, all within a democratic  atmosphere. The president must try to have a group coordinator  in every sector to assist him. In the end, when a consensus or  opinions are agreed on, he must take them to Mexico for  submission to the government and the URNG. Upon returning to  the country, he has to report to the assembly the results of the  agreements made in Mexico.    [Shetemul] What are the topics to be discussed?    [Quezada] The resettlement of those uprooted by the armed  confrontation, the rights and identification of ethnic groups,  the prevalence of civilian authority, and the Army's role in a  democratic society, socioeconomic aspects, farming issues,  constitutional amendments, and the Law on Electoral and  Political Parties.    [Shetemul] Those are the same topics up for discussion in  Mexico. What decisive role will the assembly play on the peace  accord?    [Quezada] If the social sectors do not participate, the  government and the URNG will make the decisions, regardless of  what we, as civilian society, think, meaning we are going to  delegate the decisions to eight or 10 people. If we participate  and reach a consensus, our opinions will carry a very strong  moral weight at the negotiations table.    [Shetemul] The Coordinating Committee for Agriculture,  Commercial, Financial, and Industrial Associations (Cacif) was  opposed to joining the national dialogue in the past. What  would happen if it does not participate?    [Quezada] When Cacif states whether it will participate, the  assembly, not the person presiding over it, will have to decide  how to move forward. I personally trust the business sector  will understand the need to participate.    [Shetemul] Considering there are many similar organizations,  what criteria will be employed regarding the sectors'  representation?    [Quezada] We are talking of legality, representation, and  legitimacy. Many institutions do not have legal status, while  others have difficulty proving their legitimacy. In sum, the  main condition is that they not be outside the law.    [Shetemul] What about the groups that lack legal status,  such as the Peasants Unity Committee (CUC)?    [Quezada] I have not analyzed it specifically, but during  the  national dialogue such organizations as the CUC participated  under the umbrella of the Labor and Popular Action Union (UASP).    [Shetemul] Why has the Bishops Conference deemed the  government's peace plan unviable, and now that it is working,  why has it decided to join the negotiation process?    [Quezada] We bishops have always thought the break in  negotiations was due to the parties' lack of political resolve,  not to the arrangement of the negotiations. This is why the  Bishops Conference has decided to withdraw from the process,  refusing to participate in the Permanent Forum for Peace,  because it was unviable and too broad. In addition, the  government unilaterally conceived the 4 October 1993 peace plan.  We could not accept it. We had to stay away from the  conflicting parties. There is an agreement between the two  parties, and it has been specified what the assembly must do.  We bishops will cooperate in the process, because it is an  evangelical mandate.    [Shetemul] The government did not want you to continue in  the peace process last year. Do you think it has changed its  mind?    [Quezada] I know that at least Ramiro de Leon Carpio is glad  I have accepted the presidency of the assembly.    [Shetemul] Alfonso Cabrera and Rigoberta Menchu will submit  alternate peace plans separately. Will their proposal be  viable, or are they trying to assume starring roles?    [Quezada] I have not talked with Alfonso lately, but I  talked  with Rigoberta. I understand she will participate in the  ecumenical meeting that will take place next week. She will  propose a plan, but I do not know what it is.    [Shetemul] Menchu is skeptical of a possible signing of a  definite peace agreement by the end of the year.    [Quezada] I respect her opinion. There is a calendar,  however. Should the Civilian Society Assembly be successful,  should there be political resolve by the parties to reach an  agreement, and should the international community support us, I  truly believe peace will be possible by the end of the year.  This process is irreversible, but we must think if we want a  peace on paper or a sound peace to prevent the emergence of  other guerrillas.    [Shetemul] Could it be the advancements made are due to  international pressure and not to parties' political resolve?    [Quezada] I cannot give an opinion from the outside, but it  is obvious the international community has indeed helped  expedite the process.    [Shetemul] The public sectors are saying militarization of  the police is a setback for society. Does this situation affect  the negotiation process?    [Quezada] I am not in the position to say so. I want to  steer the vessel toward national consensus. I do not want to  waste time on secondary issues that could tangle up an already  complicated negotiation.    [Shetemul] Could your attitude be interpreted as ignoring  reality?    [Quezada] I have been commissioned to reach consensus on  five  issues. In this case, the country's governability is an issue I  refuse to discuss, regardless of how important and significant  it is.    [Shetemul] Is the political system ready for a postwar  period?    [Quezada] This is an issue the government and the guerrillas  will have to address when they discuss the grounds for the URNG  to join the country's political arena, but that is another bowl  of fish.    [Shetemul] When will the assembly begin work?    [Quezada] I want the group of sectors to be ready by next  week at any rate. This group will address the issue of creating  settlements for the uprooted civilian population. We do not  want to be late for the May meeting in Mexico.    [Shetemul] What will be the financial source of your new  task?    [Quezada] We already have the necessary infrastructure. I do  not want governmental funds. Money will come from friendly  countries.    [Shetemul] Media reports indicate the guerrilla commanders  could attend the next ecumenical meeting. Is that true?    [Quezada] No, but I do not dismiss the possibility the  guerrilla leadership may send a communique. The U.S. Lutheran,  Catholic, and Evangelical Churches are organizing that meeting.  We want the people to give their opinions.    [Shetemul] Do you still criticize the secrecy of the peace  process?    [Quezada] Yes. Secrecy is one of the main problems plaguing  the peace process, because it prevents the media from being well  informed to prevent speculations. In short, the parties have  decided to maintain this secrecy, and I only hope the process  will continue.</p>

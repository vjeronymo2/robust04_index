			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Sales of commercial vehicles rise 9.5% UK SALES of new commercial vehicles were 9.5 per cent higher in August compared with August last year, halting the decline that has seen the commercial vehicle sector suffer its steepest slide into recession in the post-war period. New commercial vehicle registrations rose to 31,704 from 28,946 in the same month a year ago, according to figures from the Society of Motor and Manufacturers and Traders. This was the second monthly year-on-year increase in the last three months. The tentative sign of recovery from a very low level follows a period in which demand weakened for 32 consecutive months up to the end of May. Higher sales than a year ago were achieved in all the main sectors of the industry last month for the first time since the steep decline started in the last quarter of 1989. New truck registrations (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) rose 7.3 per cent in August to 4,097. Sales of medium vans, such as the Ford Transit and the Volkswagen Transporter, rose 22 per cent year-on-year to 15,156. Sales of small vans, such as the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Astra car-derived vans, showed a 1.2 per cent rise, while registrations of buses and coaches rose 12.9 per cent to 184. Truck sales were higher than a year ago for the second successive month, following a year-on-year increase of 6.7 per cent in July. The truck sector has been hardest hit during the recession with sales at the lowest level since 1954. Commercial vehicle sales of 142,098 in the first eight months of the year were still 6 per cent below the very depressed level of a year ago. Registrations have fallen 46.5 per cent in the last three years. Truck sales of 20,633 in the first eight months were also 6 per cent below the level of a year ago, although sales of heavy trucks (above 15 tonnes) at 10,588 have fallen only 0.7 per cent from the very low level of last year. The main demand in the heavy truck sector is still coming from private hauliers for heavy tractor units for articulated trucks. Demand for rigid trucks, most importantly from the construction industry, remains very depressed. The Iveco group, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat of Italy which includes Iveco Ford and Seddon Atkinson, has narrowly regained the lead in the UK truck market in its see-saw struggle with Leyland DAF, the UK subsidiary of DAF of the Netherlands. In the first eight months Iveco has captured a share of 24.7 per cent of UK new truck sales, just ahead of the 24.3 per cent held by Leyland DAF. In the heavy truck sector the strongest performances have been achieved by Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and ERF, which have benefited from the higher demand for heavy articulated truck units. Mercedes-Benz heavy truck sales in the first eight months of the year were 12 per cent higher than a year ago, while ERF has boosted its UK sales in this segment by 9.9 per cent and Volvo by 8.5 per cent.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Horror tax video set to terrify You've had the nightmare, now see the video. The Investigators, a 20-minute film produced by accountants Pannell Kerr Forster, may be short on action but makes up for it in chilling detail. It tells the everyday story of a businessman running a small furniture company, and his unsuspecting accountant. A tip-off from an aggrieved associate leads to an Inland Revenue investigation. Our hero, the accountant, and his client, are called to an interview with the inquiry branch. The businessman disastrously underestimates the situation: 'I'm supposed to be playing golf that day.' He ends up admitting to fraud, much to the amazement of his accountant, and the film ends with the tax inspectors searching his home safe for further evidence. The video, which will be shown to chambers of commerce and other groups, is designed to emphasise the growing need for businesspeople to have expert tax advice. Pannell Kerr Forster says it believes everyone has the right to the best advice possible. 'The Investigators leaves the audience with no illusions about the Revenue's power to gather information and their willingness when they consider it appropriate to visit business premises and taxpayers' homes in their quest to recover tax interest and penalties,' said the film-makers. The video comes at a time when the Revenue has increased its investigations work to the point where the yield was Pounds 4.7bn in 1993-94, or the equivalent of 2.5p on the basic rate of income tax. The government is also to consider a report by Mr Phillip Ely, former president of the Law Society, into proposals for the powers of tax investigators to be widened to include access to accountants' papers.</p>

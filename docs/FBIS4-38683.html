			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 2 Jun -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin and  ROK President Kim Yong-sam, who is in Moscow on an official  visit, today signed a joint Russian-Korean declaration in the  Kremlin on completion of their bilateral summit. The document  proclaims the raising of bilateral relations to a level of  mutually complementary constructive partnership, and reflects  the two sides' approaches to the main problems of both world  politics, including the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula,  and to questions of cooperation between Moscow and Seoul in the  economic, political, and other spheres.    A number of other bilateral documents were also signed,  including intergovernmental agreements on cooperation in  protection of the environment, on preventing incidents at sea  outside territorial waters, and on the protection of migratory  birds, and also a protocol on consultations between the  Ministries of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the  ROK.    The South Korean side was handed more than 200 archive  documents relating to the Korean War during 1950-53. They  include correspondence conducted by the then leaders of the  USSR, the DPRK, and the PRC, with telegrams from Josip Stalin  and Mao Tse-tung, and they reveal the degree of the former  Soviet Union's involvement in the Korean War. "History should  stand revealed in its true form," a high-ranking official of the  Russian Federation's Foreign Ministry said in a conversation  with the ITAR-TASS correspondent. He said the handing over of  archive documents would make it possible to "close one of the  pages of the past." At the same time, the sides are united in  the opinion that the sad past in relations between Moscow and  Seoul should remain in the past and should not affect the  present and future.</p>

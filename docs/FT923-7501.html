			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Brokers drive a hard bargain - Just the job If you possess a passable telephone manner, a flair for negotiating, and a modicum of knowledge about the motor trade, you could become a car broker - someone who offers new vehicles for sale at well below list price. The returns from this line of business can be high. Brokers add a 'mark-up' to the reduced 'on the road' price of the vehicle after negotiating with the dealer. They get around 15 per cent discount on the list price from a dealer and then sell on at a 13 per cent discount. On average, an experienced car broker can earn more than Pounds 1,000 per week, and a beginner can expect to earn around Pounds 350. But how do you begin? You should start by renting a small office equipped with a phone, stationery, and a copy of the Yellow Pages, which contains a list of car dealers who hold the appropriate franchise. You will then need to advertise in local newspapers. Before you take that step, you would be wise to study the ads in motoring magazines to learn how the experienced car brokers operate. When a customer responds to your advertisement, take down the details of the requested car model, then contact the dealers. Begin by telling them you are a car broker, or they will not be willing to negotiate. Once the quote has been accepted by the car-buyer, the dealer delivers the vehicle directly to the buyer, receives payment and forwards the agreed commission to the broker. This symbiotic relationship between the car dealer and broker is flourishing now that car tax has been halved. Furthermore, because cars in several European countries can cost 40 per cent less than cars made in the UK, the EC's competition directorate has drafted rules which may force down UK car prices.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHAMBER ORCHESTRA GIVES THOUGHTFUL INTERPRETATION  </P> <P> Frequent concert-goers probably fear two things above all: the same tired  repertory and bland, faceless interpretations.  </P> <P> But a combination of imaginative programming, thoroughly professional playing  and thoughtful interpretations Sunday afternoon by Micah Levy and the Orange  County Chamber Orchestra eliminated nearly all evidence of this same-old-thing  syndrome.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, Bach's Concerto in D minor for two violins fell victim to the  malady. Concert mistress Diana Halprin and principal second violinist Joseph  Goodman provided well-matched tone and articulation. Levy led neat  accompaniments and balanced his forces well enough, yet a lack of softer  dynamics throughout could not be blamed on any acoustical flaw in the  auditorium at Loyola Marymount University in Orange.  </P> <P> The finale came to life with a great deal more spirit, but the first two  movements seemed little more than a polished run-through.  </P> <P> The balance of the performance proved eminently satisfying, however. "Prologue  and Variations" by Ellen Taaffe Zwilich presents tremendous challenges of  ensemble, intonation and interpretive shaping, conquered in every respect by  Levy and his musicians. The 1984 work gratefully provides evidence that  Minimalism does not reign supreme in contemporary compositional technique, and  this expressive piece passes the most important test: one wants to hear it  again.  </P> <P> Haydn's Symphony No. 83 "The Hen," received a persuasive reading, with  full-bodied sound that belied the actual number of players (22), and  responsiveness to every shade of the nuances of Levy's direction. Proof was at  hand that this group articulates as one, particularly in true accents with bite  at any dynamic level.  </P> <P> The program opened with another alternative to tried-and-true programming,  Vaughan Williams' "Five Variants on 'Dives and Lazarus.' " Levy skillfully wove  the subtly exchanged lines of this gentle work into warmly haunting music.  </P></p>

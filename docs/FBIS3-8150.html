			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry </F> on 6 March; place not given -- read by announcer]    [Text] As reported, on 5 March 1994 in Pogaj village in  Has District, near border marker D-7, 100 meters into Albanian  territory, 20-year-old soldier Saimir Pal Zefi from Mirdite  District was wounded by fire from the Yugoslav border post of  Goruzhup.    The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Albania strongly  protests this act by Yugoslav border forces, which is another  flagrant and revolting act with open anti-Albanian aims. This  act refutes the demagogy of statements and memorandums of the  Yugoslav side, which blame Albania for the incidents on the  border between both countries as well as for the so-called lack  of alertness of the Albanian side to resolve problems between  them.    The wounding of the Albanian soldier yesterday increased the  number of the Albanians killed or wounded on the northern border  to 22 people, when no Serb has been wounded or killed by  Albanian border forces.    Such criminal acts, both in the past and now, are  premeditated and are committed at a time when the international  community is engaged in resolving, peacefully and through  dialogue, the conflicts that have broken out in the former  Yugoslavia and preventing them from expanding to other areas.  These acts are committed to increase tension on the border  between both countries, to consequently increase the level of  insecurity and tension in the Balkans by instigating situations  with unprecedented consequences, and to accompany the  intensified movements of the Serbian Army on the border with  Albania and within Kosova.    Such acts, along with the murder of an Albanian by Serbian  soldiers on the Kosovar-Macedonian border, the trial  fabrications against Albanians, and the closure of the Academy  of Sciences and Arts of the Republic of Kosova, complete the  tableau of the Serbian policy of genocide and oppression against  the Albanian population in Kosova and the methods of pressure  and political and military blackmail by Milosevic against the  Albanian state.    Albania protests such irresponsible acts and, before the  world public, again denounces the provokers of such dangerous  situations, who are the same authors of the bloodshed in the  former Yugoslavia, the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the ethnic  cleansing, and the massacres against the simple people.</p>

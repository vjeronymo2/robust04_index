			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 27 Apr (Pl) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro  awarded Zambian President Frederick Chiluba the Order of Jose  Marti during an event honoring the African guest today.    The medal of the order, the highest award granted by the  Cuban state, was pinned on Chiluba at the Palace of the  Revolution during an official reception which his delegation and  other guests attended.    Jose Ramon Balaguer, a member of both the Council of State  and the Communist Party Politburo, cited the Zambian statesman's  efforts in the struggle to eradicate colonialism and the  disappearance of the obsolete apartheid regime. Balaguer also  spotlighted Zambia's active role in the Nonaligned Movement and  the Frontline Nations.    Chiluba expressed thanks for the award, saying this gesture  strengthens the traditional fraternal ties between the two  people, and he recalled Cuba's role in the liberation of several  African countries.    He also said the end of the Cold War will lead to the  establishment of a new international economic order and the  achievement of a world in which equal opportunities will be the  basis for international relations.    The Zambian president arrived here on 25 April for an  official, friendly visit. It has been learned that he held  official talks on 26 April with his Cuban counterpart to reach  bilateral cooperation agreements in the sugar industry,  agricultural, and health fields.    Speaking to national television, Chiluba said the Angolan  situation and the processes related to the disappearance of the  Soviet Union were among the international topics addressed  during the talks.    The Zambian delegation was also honored today at the  Biotechnology and Carlos J. Finlay Institutes, vanguard  scientific institutions involved in the development of Cuban  medicine.    The visiting president and his delegation are carrying out a  tight working agenda that includes touring industrial,  agricultural, health, and sports centers.    Sources from the two countries have said he will also meet  with Zambian students who are studying in different Cuban  provinces and African diplomats accredited here.    Chiluba, 51, concluded political, governmental, economic,  and  English studies in London and New York and union and industrial  relations studies in Germany. He also has lengthy experience as  a labor leader in such areas as health, construction safety, and  labor productivity.</p>

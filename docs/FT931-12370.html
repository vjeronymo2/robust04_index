			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Arts: Nikolay Demidenko - Recital Demidenko's latest Wigmore Hall recitals are ambitiously devised. There are six of them, one a month until June, under the umbrella title 'Piano Masterworks'; their programmes (planned for the Russian pianist by Ates Orga) cover a span of keyboard writing from Scarlatti to Gubaydulina, making up a personalised 'History of the Piano' as traced by a grand virtuoso of the instrument. The young Russian pianist is evidently now a favourite of the London public: on Wednesday, for the first concert of the series, the Wigmore was jam-packed. He has virtuosity to spare. His fingers are astonishingly agile, precise, muscularly clean. His range of dynamics, texture, touch and tone is formidably wide. The programme, subtitled 'The Classicists', opened with a group of Scarlatti sonatas and closed with Mozart's C minor Fantasia (K475) followed by the sonata (K. 457) of the same key. While big pianistic gestures may not have been in demand, speed, delicacy and crisp articulation undoubtedly were, and Demidenko supplied them with easy mastery. What he appears to lack in this music is charm, imaginative alertness, sensitivity to melodic delight, idiomatic conviction. He evinced not a smidgen of that buoyant pleasure in contrast expected from a Scarlatti group when tackled by a front-rank pianist: the despatch was brisk, unsmiling. Two of the works on offer were complex sets of variations - CPE Bach's on Les Folies d'Espagne in the first half, Haydn's celebrated F minor piece in the second. The gift of dramatisation that imbues the unfolding of these pieces with ever-growing excitement seemed conspicuously absent; the Haydn was taken so slowly that the sound of the music remained thoroughly ventilated, the sense dispiritingly chilly and fugitive. It was a similar story in the Clementi F sharp minor Sonata (once recorded, with wonderful elan, by Horowitz) and the Mozart Fantasia. Demidenko's characterising imagination seems largely asleep in this repertory. Because he is a performer of such profuse gifts, one longs to give him - metaphorically, at least - a jolly good prod.

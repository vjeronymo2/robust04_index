			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Baldwin rises to Pounds 2.8m on back of acquisitions Baldwin, the tour operator, catering and publishing group, reported sharply improved pre-tax profits in the 12 months to October 31 following increased bookings for both holidays and restaurant tables. The company said buoyant sales of its European camping holidays and contributions from Simpsons of Cornhill and the Muswell chain, acquired during the year, led to pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.83m (Pounds 1.33m). The shares rose 22p to 130p. The comparative figure was restated under FRS 3 to take account of a Pounds 1.14m loss, taken previously as an extraordinary item, arising from a legal dispute over its shareholding in London Clubs Inter-national, the casino group. The pre-tax figure also benefited from profits on disposal of assets of Pounds 694,000 (Pounds 363,000). Turnover rose 19 per cent to Pounds 34.6m (Pounds 29.1m) of which Pounds 5.91m related to acquisitions, which contributed Pounds 468,000 to operating profits of Pounds 2.48m (Pounds 2.33m), a rise of 6 per cent. Of the three divisions, tour operations continued to account for the bulk of profits - Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 2.23m) on unchanged turnover of Pounds 20.6m. The improved results, however, were due mainly to a first time contribution of Pounds 197,000 from the restaurant business and Pounds 305,000 (Pounds 123,000) from the print division. Earnings rose to 10.1p (3p) and a final dividend of 1.9p makes a 3.5p (3p) total.</p>

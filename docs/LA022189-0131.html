			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHANCE TO BUY COTO DE CAZA PARCEL DOESN'T PROMPT A LOT OF INTEREST  </P> <P> Coto de Caza residents have a rare opportunity today as the first to be offered  a chance to purchase vacant lots in the exclusive development. But so far, the  occasion has not attracted much of a crowd.  </P> <P> Coto de Caza Development Co. officials expected a throng of would-be buyers to  camp out at its sales office over the weekend for the chance to pay up to  $435,000 for one of 10 lots alongside the community's golf course. These lots  are being made available first to existing Coto de Caza homeowners. Later, the  company will offer 20 others, along with any of the 10 that might remain, to  the general public.  </P> <P> A line of 10 prospects Friday had dwindled to 5 by Monday. It appeared --  unless a crowd assembled overnight -- that a buyer could have skipped the  camp-out and picked up one of the lots after normal business hours began  Tuesday morning.  </P> <P> "We didn't know what to expect," said Rod Gilliland, a Coto de Caza vice  president. "If 200 people had been waiting on the lots, we might wonder whether  we priced it fairly."  </P> <P> The 10 lots to be sold today are priced from $365,000 to $435,000. The highest  priced is No. 36, a 10,408-square-foot lot near the No. 3 green.  </P> <P> Gilliland, who said the sale of lots to individuals is part of the master plan  for the up-scale community, said the company had little history to go by in  trying to determine buyer interest.  </P> <P> Lot sales to individuals are a rarity in Orange County, especially small  parcels of prime golf-course frontage in an area such as Coto de Caza, which  includes some of the most expensive homes in the county. Orange County  developers almost always sell land to builders, who then sell a house and its  land together.  </P> <P> Realtors and real estate observers said Coto de Caza probably included the sale  in the master plan to increase interest in its development. "If you're selling  one lot to an individual you can also get a higher price than if you're selling  several lots to a developer," said John Karevoll, a spokesman for TRW Real  Estate Information Services in Colton.  </P> <P> Gilliland and several real estate observers said they could not recall another  sale of individual parcels of land adjoining a golf course in Orange County.  </P> <P> As attractive as owning land next to a golf course might be, the prices  probably kept many people from taking a second look, Gilliland said. And the  cost to build a custom house on it means that the total expense would be  prohibitive for all but a few.  </P> <P> "We're not going to have any log cabins out there," Gilliland said. "They'll  spend at least $500,000 to build some very fine houses."  </P> <P> Rick Alderette, a real estate agent and former builder of custom houses, said  lot owners usually build houses that cost twice as much as the land. "But  10,000 square feet is too small to build an $800,000 house," he said.  </P> <P> The five prospects, who would have to make $25,000 deposits today to secure  their lots, could not be reached for comment on their plans for the land. Each  of the prospects had paid surrogates up to $500 to stay over the weekend to  keep a place in line.  </P> <P> "You don't expect one of them to come out here and spend a cold weekend in the  rain waiting," said Ken Gilbert, a Honeybaked Ham Co. employee who took time  off from his job to borrow a friend's Winnebago and wait it out for one of the  prospective buyers.  </P></p>

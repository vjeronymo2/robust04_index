			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Major prepares Tories for talks with Sinn Fein Mr John Major yesterday began preparing the Conservative party for talks between the government and republican leaders while insisting that he would not be rushed into a premature response to the loyalist and IRA ceasefires. As Northern Ireland enjoyed its first day free from the threat of sectarian violence for 25 years the prime minister told Conservatives in Bournemouth that his cautious approach had paid dividends. 'If I had listened (to those urging me to hurry) we would not today be where we are with the guns stilled and the bombs stopped,' he said. But he balanced this with an assurance that the government would enter the 'window for peace' if it could do so 'with honour and with consent'. He said: 'We cannot let history freeze us into inaction.' His speech followed a lunch-time telephone conversation with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, in which the two men took stock of recent developments. They discussed the much-delayed framework document with which their two governments hope to inject momentum into the political talks process involving the province's main constitutional parties, but are not thought to have fixed a date for their next meeting. Downing Street said both prime ministers were 'greatly encouraged by the loyalist ceasefire in the context of overall progress over the past six weeks'. Dublin described the exchange - which came after Mr Reynolds reacted to Thursday's loyalist announcement by urging Mr Major to respond positively to the new situation - as 'very useful'. The idea that London should open a 'reversible' dialogue with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, will be considered by Mr Major and cabinet colleagues next week. Ministers have acknowledged that talks could start by Christmas. Sinn Fein representatives will probably have started by this time to participate in Dublin's Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which Mr Reynolds expects to get running next month. The forum will be attended by all leading political parties in the Irish Republic as well as the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party and the non-sectarian Alliance party. Unionists have declined to take part. Speaking on the eve of the Ulster Unionist party conference in Carrickfergus, Mr Major paid tribute to Mr James Molyneaux, saying the UUP leader had been right that the most significant aspect of the 44-day-old IRA ceasefire was 'the victory of ordinary people over the terrorists'. The loyalist ceasefire was 'another victory for ordinary people', he said. 'Today, for the first time in a quarter of a century, the people of Ulster have woken up to peace. Our determination must be to make that peace permanent.' Speaking within days of the 10th anniversary of the Brighton bomb, when the IRA attempted to murder the British cabinet, he sought to reassure unionists that British troops would not be withdrawn from Ulster prematurely.</p>

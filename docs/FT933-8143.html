			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices dip as the market closes THE UK stock market ended the first session of the new three-week trading account relatively unscathed in spite of a bout of nervousness triggered largely by a flurry of selling in the German bond market and a modest decline in UK gilts late in the session. A faltering equity market was bolstered by a strong opening performance on Wall Street, which was around 20 points higher shortly after it commenced trading, stimulated by takeover activity in the telecoms sector and better than expected capacity utilisation numbers. At the close of trading the FT-SE 100 Index showed a 1.8 net decline at 3,008.3. Turnover in equities remained at relatively high levels. Some 604m shares changed hands yesterday, with the lion's share, almost 400m shares, or 66 per cent, accounted for by trading in non-FT-SE 100 shares. The market began the day in subdued fashion, with ex-dividend allowances accounting for a fall of almost nine Footsie points at the outset of trading. However, the early downside trend, which took the market down to 3,002.0 shortly after trading commenced, proved short-lived and prices began to edge higher in line with the Footsie future and following renewed keen support for selected issues, notably the electricity and water stocks, which offer well above average yields. The market reached the day's high point, up 6.5 at 3,016.6, in mid-morning before running out of steam and marking time ahead of the opening of Wall Street. The US market came in on a firm note, with interest stimulated by news of AT&amp;T's move to acquire McCaw, the cellular telephones group, and a better than expected figure on capacity utilisation during July. The July figure for industrial output was in line with expectations, according to dealers. However, downside pressure on German bonds and to a lesser extent on UK gilts began to unnerve the UK equity market, which receded into negative territory in mid-afternoon. Dealers in the equity market were mostly unperturbed by events yesterday, taking the view that intermittent bouts of selling pressure had enabled marketmakers to fill in many of the hefty short positions that have built up in recent weeks as the big push drove the FT-SE 100 Index through the 3,000 level. 'The market is now better balanced than it has been for some time and will not go down too far as long as Wall Street performs,' said a leading institutional salesman. He warned, however, that the market remained unforgiving towards companies whose results do not come up to the market's best expectations. Argos was a case in point yesterday, the shares sliding in spite of middle of the range profits. Senior marketmakers adopted a fairly bullish view of the market, saying that much of the late pressure in equities was triggered by the Footsie future, which ran into strong resistance at the 3,030 level. 'There was very little pressure in the cash market,' said one. Mr Peter Thorne, equity strategist at Nikko Securities, warned that in the short term the news flow will not be positive for equities. 'We expect further evidence of slow economic growth in the UK and US; further earnings disappointments; a tax-raising budget in November; and concerns that inflation will rise in 1994.'</p>

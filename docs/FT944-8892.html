			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Survey of Massachusetts (8): Sacred cod no longer works its miracle - The Fishing Industry Not many states think enough of fish to build a statue of one, but Massachusetts does. The 'sacred cod' a wooden effigy of a fish, was hung in the state's House of Representatives two centuries ago to symbolise its importance to the Massachusetts economy and is still a big tourist attraction today. The fishing industry itself has had less staying power. Stocks of cod and other key commercial species have dwindled to dangerously low levels, and fishermen have seen their daily catches fall to just a fraction of what they once were. Faced with a desperate situation, the State Division of Marine Fisheries, which oversees fishing regulation, put in place in May a number of rules which limit days at sea and the hole size in fishing nets. The agency now says that those regulations are insufficient and wants to have important fishing areas declared off limits. The latest moves, fishermen say, will mean devastating unemployment for many coastal towns which still depend on the industry. The Gloucester Fisheries Commission, which represents fishermen, predicts that half the people employed in the sector today will lose their jobs. Although fishermen say pollution is partly to blame for the decline in fish stocks, environmentalists and the Division of Marine Fisheries say the real problem is overfishing. 'This area has been overfished for years, and if we don't do something about it now, stocks of cod and other fish could completely disappear,' said Mr Philip Coates, director of the Division. Local congressmen have succeeded in winning some federal support for the fishermen. About Dollars 30m in aid is being directed to re-training programmes and other initiatives. But fishing activists say while young fishermen may be able to learn other skills, older fishermen will have a hard time changing professions. 'A lot of the fishermen in Massachusetts immigrated from Sicily and Portugal and may not have got past a fourth grade education,' said Mr Howard Nickerson, director of the Offshore Mariners Association in New Bedford. 'This is all they've ever done and all they've ever wanted to do. I don't think they'll be getting into computer programming.' For those who remain in the business, times will be tough. Some of the federal aid money may go towards promoting species such as mackerel and dogfish, which traditionally have not sold well. But the fishermen say marketing can only do so much. 'Housewives just don't like to prepare mackerel,' said Mr Anthony Verga, executive director of the Gloucester Fisheries Commission. 'They think it's too oily and smelly.' Fishermen and environmentalists are looking to the Canadian model of fish stock management. Canadians have used generous benefit packages, which include buying fishermen's boats and settling their debts, to reduce the number of people in the industry. Because fishing stocks are near collapse, environmentalists say strict rules must be enacted now, and fishermen themselves agree that something drastic must be done to turn fish populations around. It will probably take many years for the regulations to make a difference to fish stocks. In the meantime, many fishermen will be forced out of business, and towns built on the fishing industry will probably suffer profoundly. The sacred cod no longer works its miracle on the Massachusetts economy.</p>

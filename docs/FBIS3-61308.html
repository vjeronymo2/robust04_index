			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kazakh </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tursynbay Zhandawlet: "Department of </F> Migration."]    [Text] One third of all Kazakhs live outside the Republic.  We must be unsparing in the help we offer to our kinsmen who  long for their homeland and long to return and claim their  heritage. In these hard times it is extremely difficult not to  migrate from one country to another and from one village to  another. However, it is fitting that we extend a helping hand to  our kinsmen in areas where the flames of war are burning where  there is environmental disaster. The Migration Department under  the Ministry of Labor provides such aid and operates for the  purpose of rendering specific assistance to our Kazakh relatives  who desire to return to their homeland.    We have a duty not only to bring our kinsmen home, but to  supply them with residential housing and with work. In so doing  we must bear in mind the situation of our government, with its  tightened purse strings and difficulties in local economies. For  that reason, having looked into the above circumstances, our  President has set quotas (numbers) for those migrating to  Kazakhstan. Thus, a quota is set for 1993 of 10,000 families  moving to Kazakhstan. It is well known that limits are placed  today among independent nations on the tendency towards  uncontrolled migration and that migration processes are advanced  only under the limitations of the laws established by each  country.    Thus at present the return of Kazakhs living outside of  Kazakhstan to their homeland is carried out through the  Migration Department. For that reason, Kazakhs living outside  the country communicate directly with this department, make  known what oblast in Kazakhstan they wish to migrate to, tell  what their needs are, and come to an agreement with the  department. It is possible that not only individual families,  but a clan, a village, or a settlement will get together and  jointly write a letter. If they establish direct connections  with that department, specific help is given to those migrating.  For example, the expenses of shipping their goods are met.  However, documents confirming travel expenses for this purpose  (ticket stubs, receipts) must be shown.    Migrants are sent to the appropriate settlement according to  their own request or according to the instructions of the  Ministry of Labor. Enterprise heads of the area where they go  provide them the needed assistance. They must provide them with  housing, or, if this is impossible, they must provide them with  a plot of land to build a house and with a loan needed to buy  construction materials. However, the amount of the loan should  not exceed 5 million rubles. In rural areas, they are given a  cow and 10-15 sheep, according to what is economically possible.  Separate from this, a seasonal payment-in-aid is paid to the  head of a family of migrants at a rate 15 times the average  lowest salary and to the remaining members of the family at a  rate 7 times the lowest average salary.    Divisions of the Migration Department have been established  in every oblast. Those migrating can apply to the migration  division in the oblast directly regarding any special problems  they encounter. We believe that the situation has been brought  under control and a stop has been put to the confused flow of  too many newcomers. Indeed, foreigners have equal rights with  Republic citizens under the law to buy housing. It would seem to  be necessary, while correcting and improving law in this area,  to specify under what circumstances foreigners have a right to  buy housing and when they do not. As is shown by the practices  of other democratic countries, every country has full rights to  carry out a migration and visa policy convenient for itself.  Limitation of those coming to a country is also not contrary to  international law. It appears that the documents of all of those  migrating are to be delivered for review by workers of the  Migration Department through the divisions of this organization.  What this means is that such things as illegal registration and  housing purchase will not be allowed.    There are areas in migration where we do "the best we can."  For example, some migrants understand their return to their  homeland differently and want an apartment in the center of  Almaty out of turn or demand a free house in the vicinity of the  capital. These things, in fact, do not happen.    Up to the present the Migration Department has done a number  of good things: it has assisted 3,000 families from Mongolia  this year, 300 from Iran, and 5,000-6,000 from CIS countries.  Plans are for the migration of a thousand families from Iran and  Turkey in the future. At present the department is devoting  special attention to evacuating Kazakhs in regions afflicted by  war or conflict. The reasons are understandable.    Shortage of financing is creating barriers to the  development  of Migration Department services. The fates of so many Kazakhs  and the beating of a hot heart longing for the homeland are  connected with migration. For that reason full financial support  is needed for this areas.    It would be proper that, in addition to counting tasks  accomplished, we look to the future of such immigration for a  moment. We note that our reception of migrants is still without  reproach, compared to how Germans returning to the homeland are  received there. There are so many things we should do in this  area. I am hoping for a time when we will receive our returning  kinsmen by doing everything possible for them like a truly  civilized and cultured countries. So said Nurlan Raqymzhanov,  deputy chief of the Migration Department. Some of our kinsmen,  while they know how to speak Kazakh, do not know how to write  Kazakh using the Cyrillic script, or they lack the needed  specialties. In addition, when we bear in mind many  peculiarities and differences in customs of our Republic, there  should be centers to acclimatize and teach migrants. At the very  least it would be proper to organize courses lasting three-four  months. [Policy] directions are needed for the entire migration  system.    One thing I want to mention at the end, lest any  misconceptions be created, is that there is no prohibition  preventing our kinsmen from migrating on their own without  informing the department. However, it would indeed be good to  remember that migrating through the department is considerably  more convenient.</p>

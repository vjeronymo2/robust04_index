			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Rough ride gives way to smoother passage - Volvo Volvo, Sweden's biggest manufacturer, will make its contribution tomorrow to a post-recession surge in half-year profits from Swedish companies when it announces its results for the first six months. Analysts expect a pre-tax profit - excluding capital gains - of between SKr4-5bn (Pounds 420m) as the car and truck maker rides a boom in sales, especially in the US, its biggest market, and Sweden, and cashes in on painful cost-cutting measures taken over the past three years. In addition, the pre-tax figure will be doubled thanks to a SKr4bn capital gain mainly stemming from the disposal in April of Volvo's controlling stake in Cardo, an investment group sold to Incentive, an industrial arm of the Wallenberg family empire. The decision to refocus on its traditional vehicle making followed the traumatic collapse in December of a plan to merge Volvo cars and trucks with France's Renault. Investors will be looking to hear more from Volvo on its plans for the disposal of its two biggest non-core holdings - BCP, a food and drinks group, and its 28 per cent stake in Pharmacia, the pharmaceuticals group. Volvo has yet to answer what models it will develop to extend its car range. But for the time being it is cruising faster than since the 1980s and analysts do not expect the present profits spurt to peak until late 1995 or 1996.</p>

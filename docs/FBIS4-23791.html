			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in French  to Rwanda at 1030 GMT on 15 June reports that 40 children, ages  10 to 14, who were abducted yesterday by MRND-CDR (Republican  National Movement for Democracy and Development-Coalition for  the Defense of the Republic) militias, have been killed. The  children were reportedly taken from the Sainte-Famille Church in  Kigali, where they had been sheltered. The radio says that,  upon hearing of the abduction, UNAMIR (UN Assistance Mission in  Rwanda) -- which was mediating talks between government forces  and Rwanda Patriotic Army representatives -- sent government  soldiers to investigate the incident. "Upon their return, they  lied that the abductors had returned their victims," the radio  said. "The truth is that after the abduction, the children were  taken to a swamp. There were some shots. Not one child  survived. They were killed because they were Tutsis."</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Heseltine plans to expand training Proposals to expand youth training credits, to extend the Minis management information system and to privatise the Civil Aviation Authority's air traffic control are all expected in the government white paper on competitiveness to be published on Tuesday. The document, postponed for a week after the death of Labour leader John Smith, will be given a high-profile launch by the prime minister and seven cabinet ministers. But it is expected to include few policy initiatives and even fewer financial commitments. One senior Whitehall official said: 'There is a lot of diagnosis of the competitiveness problem and a lot of pulling together of existing initiatives to show that we do have a strategic approach, but there is not much genuinely new in it.' The area which receives the most critical analysis is education and training. The white paper will unveil an extension of career development loans, provide a new training package for small companies and spell out the funding details for the new modern apprenticeship scheme, with the government expected to fund the college-based element of the training. On youth credits it had been planned to expand the existing experiment, now covering about 60,000 people, to all training and enterprise councils, which deliver government training initiatives in England and Wales. The new proposal embraces people aged 16 to 19, who will be able to use a credit to buy an academic sixth-form education, technical training at a further education college or a modern apprenticeship place with an employer. Funding through credits should help bring more equality of status between academic and vocational education. But in the past it has been resisted by the Department for Education and the Further Education Funding Council. It has been pushed hard by the Confederation of British Industry and will raise the status of careers guidance officers. Most of the funding for credits will come from existing budgets. The government plans to spend Pounds 185m on youth credits and modern apprenticeships in the current year, rising to Pounds 706m in 1996-97. The white paper is likely to please most wings of the Conservative party and business opinion. Rightwingers will be wary about the broad range of interests being pursued by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, under the mantle of competitiveness. But they may also be pleased at the lack of expensive, interventionist proposals and the aggressively de-regulatory tone in parts of the document.</p>

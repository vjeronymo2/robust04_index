			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Bolivia monitored through 16  June.    The Central Bank reported that net international reserves  were $498 million through May, the highest in the past few  years. The reserves have risen $37.2 million so far this year,  an increase of 10 percent compared with December 1993, and $22.2  million in May, an increase of 5.75 percent. The level of  reserves has been positive in all months except for January.  (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 25 May 94 National Section p 1)    Finance Secretary Gaby Candia reported that public  investments totalled $60 million in the year's first quarter, 10  percent of the amount projected for this year. She explained  that this conservative disbursement was caused by the late  approval of the general budget. A total of $566 million was  approved for the current public investment program, an increase  of 18 percent compared with 1993. According to official reports,  52 percent will be invested in economic development, 44 percent  in human development, and 3.2 percent in sustainable  development. This program seeks to guarantee an economic growth  of 4 percent with projects to improve the economic  infrastructure. La Paz accounts for 23.2 percent of the  investments; Santa Cruz 22.7 percent, and Cochabamba 22.7  percent. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 25 May 94 National  Section p 1)    A record monthly stock exchange operation of $100.2 million  was registered in the Bolivian Stock Exchange Market late in  May. It rose $36.1 million compared with April, an increase of  58 percent. (La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 4 Jun 94 p B4)</p>

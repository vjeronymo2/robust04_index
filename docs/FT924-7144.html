			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Government borrowed Pounds 1.78bn last month GOVERNMENT borrowing totalled Pounds 1.78bn last month, making it the first October since 1984 in which there has been no net repayment of government debt. The figure reflected high government expenditure and weak tax revenues resulting from the recession, and was in line with the Treasury's latest forecast for a public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 37bn this financial year. Last month's total, announced by the Central Statistical Office yesterday, represented a significant deterioration in public sector finances. There were net repayments of Pounds 0.6bn in October last year and Pounds 2.4bn in October 1990. The cumulative total of government borrowing this year reached Pounds 20.2bn including privatisation proceeds. That compares with a cumulative total of only Pounds 8.7bn in the first seven months of the financial year 1991-92. However, ministers have made clear that the government is experiencing no problems funding this year's greatly increased PSBR and has no intention of abandoning its policy of fully funding the deficit. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, told the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee this week that the PSBR had been overfunded this year, largely because of the effects of supporting sterling in September. He said the government would act to compensate for this overfunding over the rest of 1992-93, indicating that it would slow down gilts sales. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the committee yesterday that the chancellor's intention 'on the whole' was not to make foreign currency borrowing a feature of the government's funding policy. Proceeds from privatisation were negligible last month. In the first seven months of the present financial year they amounted to Pounds 5bn, taking the cumulative PSBR excluding privatisation proceeds to Pounds 25.2bn. The high figure came as little surprise to the markets. Many observers had been expecting a poor figure following the big revision to the Treasury forecast in last week's Autumn Statement. Mr Lamont disclosed how badly government finances were hit when he revised the PSBR forecast for this financial year from Pounds 28.1bn - as forecast in the Budget - to Pounds 37bn. The Treasury estimates that government borrowing in 1993-94 will rise to Pounds 44bn, although many City economists consider that optimistic. 'I think that in the absence of any massive increases in taxation and drastic cuts in expenditure, the PSBR is going to be a headache for this government for the rest of this decade,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank.</p>

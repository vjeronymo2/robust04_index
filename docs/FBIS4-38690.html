			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Yuriy Kozlov and </F> Valeriy Sevryukov]    [Text] Moscow June 1 TASS -- Russia and Greece have  identical approaches towards resolving the Yugoslav crisis,  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his Greek  counterpart Karolos Papoulias said on Wednesday.    Kozyrev said the Bosnian problem featured prominently at the  talks because Russia and Greece "have traditional interests and  influence in that region."    Additionally, he continued, "both of us are members of the  initiative group of ministers which gathered in Geneva and we  support direct contacts with Belgrade and other sides involved  in the conflict. We have mapped out a number of additional  steps to support the settlement process and stated practically  full coincidence of our views."    "We also believe it necessary to strictly observe all  international agreements, particularly the regime (of  navigation) in Black Sea straits established in Montreux. Our  positions on the Cypriot problem also coincide. It is important  that the next U.N. Security Council discussion of the U.N.  secretary-general's report on the talks on Cyprus lead to  progress," Kozyrev said.    "Our contacts are developing on a firm basis established  during (Russian President) Boris Yeltsin's visit to Athens last  year," he added. He said Greek Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou is expected to visit Moscow this autumn.    Kozyrev admitted that some complications may arise in  bilateral relations, but what is much more important is that  both countries have the political will and determination to  develop multifaceted ties.    Papoulias also pointed to the coincidence of the positions  of  Russia and Greece on international problems, including on ways  to settle the Bosnian conflict, Cypriot problem and navigation  in the Black Sea.    He described relations between the two countries as  "friendly  and cordial" and said that there are no problems between Moscow  and Athens. Papoulias invited Kozyrev to visit Greece in order  to "continue the fruitful dialogue in the interests of the two  countries."</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: IN BRIEF:;  </P> <P> *** EN VOGUE, "BORN TO SING," ATLANTIC.: ALBUMS ARE RATED FROM FIVE STARS (A  CLASSIC) TO ONE STAR (POOR).  </P> <P> Unlike most female groups, these four R&amp;B singers can really sing -- and do  some passable rapping too.  </P> <P> Best known for the hit single "Hold on," En Vogue, on its debut album,  admirably performs a batch of mostly well-crafted ballads and medium-tempo  songs. Grating, dissonant vocal blends do spoil a few otherwise strong songs.  The ingeniously arranged "Time Goes On" is the class of this collection. DENNIS  HUNT  </P></p>

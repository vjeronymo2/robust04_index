			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Bart Sturtewagen: "Collective Weakness"] </F>   [Text] Financial markets are perverse. If companies close  factories and make their people unemployed, they are rewarded  with a higher share price. If the economic cycle picks up and  more people find a job, investors throw their shares into the  market in panic so that prices drop.    Such mechanisms give outsiders the impression of  irrationality. That is wrong. Everything is a question of  timing. All those seeking to acquire (additional) income  through investment must dare to look to the future. If they do  not do so, then other people will get there before them and the  chance of profit will have gone.    In recent years, the way markets run ahead of events has  accelerated and the intensity of market reactions has increased.  In part that is because the speculative element was given an  enormous lever by the development of indirect financial  techniques like options and futures.    The reason why the long-term interest rate has climbed so  strongly on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean in the last two  months is that dealers with money borrowed over the short term  are the main players for the moment. They are moving capital as  if the financial world was a village. The differences in the  underlying real economies do not interest them.    The justified increase in U.S. short-term interest rates, as  a weapon against a rise in inflation, made speculation more  expensive and had a destructive effect on the bond markets,  including in Belgium, although the economic cycle is still in a  far weaker phase here.    For that reason, most specialists think that the interest  rise in Europe is temporary. Investors with a long-term vision  can calmly wait to be proved right. The Belgian Government,  which has made itself totally dependent on the mood of the  financial markets, cannot do that.    For the federal government, the drop in interest rates in  1993 came as a blessing. It hopes to be able to continue to  quench its thirst at this source this year as well. The savings  they have made so far by refinancing loans more cheaply have  been greater than the lost income as a result of the poor  economic cycle. The unbridled accumulation of debt in the past  also had its advantages.    But it is unwise to allow oneself to be intoxicated by the  drug of cheap money and, with an eye on the elections, postpone  necessary actions. The recent events on the bond markets show  how fragile interest forecasts are.    At the start of this year, the Treasury's agenda included a  debt mountain to be financed of 1.2 billion Belgian francs.  That is 120 million 10,000-Belgian franc notes. Three-quarters  of that work has already been completed. Finance Minister  Philippe Maystadt got nearly 200 billion Belgian francs last  month from long-suffering private investors.    The interest rate on the bonds which are still to be  replaced  is an average 9 percent. So a profit can still be made with a  market interest rate of slightly over 7 percent. But if the  investors realize that the interest rate trend has turned, then  they will keep their hands on the pursestrings. They will no  longer invest their hard-earned pennies over the long term and  calmly wait until the conditions have become more attractive.    The hasty refinancing of a large share of state debt could  only happen because the most important market players, the  Belgian financial institutions, did not put up any obstacles.  But their market specialists still punish mercilessly players  who show their cards.    The following iron rule applies here: Anyone who owes the  bank 1 million is in its debt. Anyone who owes the bank 100  million has the bank in his power. The fact that the extension  of our debt got smoothly to this point is more a sign of our  collective weakness than individual strength.</p>

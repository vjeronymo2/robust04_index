			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Playwright Arthur Miller has added his voice to the growing number of writers  and artists around the world calling on Czechoslovakian authorities to free  jailed playwright Vaclav Havel. "I can't imagine a government in Europe in 1989  doing this to a writer. It is beyond belief, it is a horror," said Miller.  Havel, a founder of the Charter 77 human rights movement, was arrested Jan. 16  for calling for protests to mark the 20th anniversary of the suicide of student  Jan Palach, who took his life to protest the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of  Czechoslovakia. Havel's plays are acclaimed abroad but banned at home. Miller's  play, "The Archbishop Ceiling," highly critical of Czechoslovakia's Communist  rulers, is currently playing in Budapest. Noted Miller: "It's amazing. We live  in curious times." ALEENE MacMINN and JUDITH MICHAELSON  </P></p>

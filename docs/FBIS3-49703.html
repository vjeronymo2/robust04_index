The natural gas supply  from the Russian Federation to the Balkan countries, i.e.  Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey runs through separate pipelines.  The pipelines for Turkey and Bulgaria are connected to the  pumping station at Orlovska, on Ukraine's territory. There is  no outlet or other possibility to draw gas from these pipelines  all along their length that traverses Romania.    "The pipeline that supplies Romania has the junction in  Ukraine, upstream the Orlovska compressing station, i.e. on that  station's intake.    "Besides, a representative of Gazprom -- the Russian natural  gas exporter -- is permanently monitoring the gas amounts  supplied to the three countries at the Isaccea station where the  pipelines enter Romania's territory."</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VAGUE LAW PERMITS MISUSE OF CREDIT DATA, HOUSE PANEL IS TOLD  </P> <P> As special adviser for consumer affairs to President Bush, Bonnie Guiton is  well versed in complaints about the credit industry. But it didn't really hit  home until her request for extra credit was turned down because a charge card  had been issued in her name to someone else.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Guiton called the problem to the attention of Orange-based  TRW Credit Data, the firm that issued her credit report. TRW corrected the  error, and Guiton assumed the matter was settled. But she was wrong.  </P> <P> "Visiting a credit bureau just this week, I discovered that inaccurate,  negative information was still there," Guiton told the consumer affairs  subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee on  Wednesday. "Apparently the fact there was inaccurate information on my report  had not been disseminated to other bureaus."  </P> <P> Guiton said her experience was representative of the problems faced by millions  of American consumers as the increasing sophistication of the nation's credit  information industry eclipses the protections provided by the Federal Credit  Reporting Act of 1970.  </P> <P> Guiton, one of 15 witnesses to testify before the House panel, encouraged  lawmakers to mandate new consumer education measures and to place limitations  on the use of credit information to generate mailing lists and consumer  profiles -- a recent innovation that has caused a "proliferation of the  invasion of privacy," in the words of one witness.  </P> <P> In fact, representatives of other consumer protection groups testified, a  typical consumer may be the subject of files kept by each of the three major  credit bureaus: TRW in Orange County; Equifax Inc. of Atlanta, Ga., and Trans  Union Corp. of Chicago.  </P> <P> Among them, the three credit giants have 400 million records on 180 million  people. In addition, about 200 smaller, independent bureaus compile consumer  credit files. And even that is not the end of the credit trail.  </P> <P> "On a daily basis," said Elgie Holstein, executive director of the Bankcard  Holders of America, "the personal financial information stored in credit bureau  files is sliced, diced and sorted using a variety of sophisticated programs to  generate mailing lists and consumer profiles."  </P> <P> Those so-called pre-screening programs, several witnesses said, violate the  letter and law of the 19-year-old federal credit law, which was adopted to  protect personal privacy of credit information.  </P> <P> But the Federal Trade Commission, which is responsible for enforcing the Fair  Credit Reporting Act, has not halted the practice, mainly because of the vague  nature of the law.  </P> <P> The act forbids credit agencies from sharing credit data with anyone but an  authorized customer. The law grants consumers the right to review their credit  records and to receive notice of credit investigations. But it allows agencies  to authorize sales of credit information to any customer who has a "legitimate  business need" to review it.  </P> <P> Said Edmund Mierzwinski, a consumer lobbyist with the U.S. Public Interest  Research Group: "This opacity has resulted in a situation in which the industry  has dangerously expanded its sphere of influence over the control, use and sale  of personal information, while federal oversight has not kept pace with changes  in the marketplace."  </P> <P> Representatives of the credit industry argued, however, that only minor  revisions in the law are needed. "We believe that the Fair Credit Reporting Act  stands as one of Congress' most successful products," said Edward A. Barbieri,  vice president and general manager of TRW Credit Data. "It has worked  extraordinarily well in protecting the interests of the financial consumer and  of the credit grantor for some 20 years."  </P> <P> Added John Baker, senior vice president of Equifax: "It has stood the test of  time."  </P> <P> Consumer activists and credit agency officials agreed on one aspect of the  reform movement -- education.  </P> <P> "From our experiences, the vast majority of consumers are not aware of their  rights and do not concern themselves until they are confronted with a problem,"  said G. Douglas Edwards, president of Kentucky-based Credit Bureau Systems Inc.  "Most certainly, greater emphasis could be placed on education of consumers."  </P> <P> "Apparently, consumers rarely understand the implications of the blanket  authorizations they sign when they apply for credit, insurance or a job," said  Guiton, the presidential adviser. "Most consumers don't even understand a  credit reporting agency's function and, of those who do, most believe there is  a single (credit reporting agency) for their community, or even for the whole  country."  </P></p>

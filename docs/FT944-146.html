			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Blair allies fear Clause IV fight will harm image Allies of Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, are worried that the party's modernising image may be undermined by opposition to plans to scrap the party's Clause IV commitment to widespread nationalisation. Amid growing evidence of unease among constituency activists, Mr John Prescott, deputy leader, insisted yesterday that reform of Clause IV was an important symbol of changes in Labour's approach to the economy. He told BBC Radio: 'Whilst public ownership is a very important element of Labour's political thinking, that clause does seem to suggest that everything could be taken into public ownership.' Mr Prescott said the leadership was not contemplating defeat at a conference in April which will decide whether to replace the Clause IV commitment to 'common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange'. The prospect of a leadership defeat was reduced earlier this month when the party's National Executive Committee decided that the conference would vote on only one alternative to the clause, ruling out compromise amendments. However, Mr Blair is concerned that anything less than an emphatic victory will be interpreted as an indication of a split in the party and uncertainty over the direction of his leadership. In an attempt to head off the critics, Mr Blair's senior allies are supporting pro-reform groups, including the New Clause IV Campaign, set up to argue for change in the constituencies. Mr Kevin Barron, MP for Rother Valley and a leading member of the New Clause IV Campaign, said the group would seek to prevent constituency parties from mandating conference delegates to vote against change by passing resolutions without debate. However, in an indication of the strength of grassroots concern, 26 resolutions defending Clause IV have been tabled for the party's Scottish conference in March, when activists hope to win an important symbolic victory over the reformers.</p>

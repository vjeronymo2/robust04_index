			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: French bounty from Susa IN 324 BC Susa was the scene of what must be the mega-marriage of all time, when 80 of Alexander the Great's generals and 10,000 of his troops tied the knot with a veritable army of Iranian debutantes. Churchgoers may also remember Susa as the city of king Ahasuerus (Xerxes) and his seductive queen Esther. But Susa's place among the grand metropolises of antiquity has recently fared less well than its neighbour Babylon or even Persepolis, Susa's twin capital of the Achaemenid empire brought down by Alexander. The Royal City of Susa at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York should go some way to setting the record straight. A sampling of the finest works of art from the 4,000 years before Alexander paints a rich and varied picture of life and culture in ancient southwest Iran. From a child's model of a hedgehog riding a cart to statues of royalty, lavish jewellery and other paraphernalia of court and temple life this is an engagingly exotic offering which deserves an audience beyond hardened antiquarians. It comes to the US on loan from the Louvre, where the bounty from a century's enthusiastic if not always scientific digging by French archaeologists is housed. No other collection outside Iran could mount such a show and the Louvre is to be commended for taking the opportunity of a face-life to the galleries of the antiquites orientales to allow this material its first sojourn abroad. New York is the sole venue. Susa the capital of the Achaemenid Persians was the successor to Susa the sometime capital of Elam, Mesopotamia's powerful eastern neighbour and frequent adversary in battle. Most of the exhibition is rightly devoted to this less well known people whose place in the parade of civilisation is rarely done justice in encyclopaedias and school set texts. The Sumerians invented the first system of writing but who ran a close second? Probably not the Egyptians, but the Elamites. Among the most intriguing objects are the clay tablets from around 3000 BC inscribed in the Proto-Elamite script, accompanied by impressions of cylinder seals which acted as a signature when rolled on the damp clay. The Proto-Elamite code still awaits its Champollion but is assumed to record an early form of Elamite. This strange language, later written in scripts which can be read, is unrelated to any other known tongue. From the same period are two of the highlights of the exhibition, a pair of small but exquisitely wrought silver figures of an antelope and a seated, clothed bull holding a vase in its outstretched hoofs. ('Animal Farm' studies of animals carrying on like humans were a Proto-Elamite penchant.) No finer examples of the silversmiths' craft at this early date are known from anywhere in the world. A thousand years earlier Susian potters decorated their wares with inventive and sophisticated animal studies of dogs, snakes, ibexes and birds which have survived their 6,000 years of interment almost unscathed. This corpus is rightly celebrated as one of the apogees of the ancient ceramicist's art  -again there is nothing in Mesopotamia or elsewhere at the time to match it. Lying near the Mesopotamian border, Susa was often at loggerheads with the Sumerians, Babylonians and Assyrians. But the Elamites sometimes gave as good as they got and many of the most famous Mesopotamian monuments were in fact not found in Iraq at all but at Susa, whither they were triumphantly carted off by a 12th century BC Elamite king with a name that sounds like a Cherokee battle-cry - Shutruk-Nahunte. These Susian spoils - the richest cache of Mesopotamian loot ever found - include the famous law code of Hammurabi (the only significant piece not in the show) and sculptures and narrative reliefs set up by Naram-Sin and other Akkadian kings to celebrate their great buildings and battles. The Met has a tradition of producing splendid catalogues which skilfully meld sound scholarship to coffee-table design and the Susa offering is no exception. The Royal City of Susa ends this Sunday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York)</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [New Year's address by President Nursultan Nazarbayev; place </F> and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] I wish to use this opportunity provided by Ostankino  to address all the residents of the Commonwealth of Independent  States, all its citizens. I want to wish you all a happy New  Year. I would also like to say this to you: My dear  compatriots! No, its not a slip of the tongue. Indeed, we all  come from a common fatherland. Even though today we are  separated by the borders of independent states, we have been  brought up on the same land. A land bathed in our forefathers'  sweat and blood. They worked on this land, on this field. They  raised children, they believed in a better future. Special  relations, special ties were established between the peoples of  the former Soviet Union, binding together the hearts of all the  people, and it was this that helped our fathers, our peoples,  leaders of our states, to find the best solutions for the sake  of the common people.    Times are not easy for us now, but I am convinced that we  will find ways toward prosperity; we cannot fail to find them.  I believe in the wisdom of all the peoples of the former Soviet  Union; therefore I believe we will find them.    Now I want to address you all with just one thing. I want to  wish that we all retain the friendly ties we had and still have;  to retain them in the year 1994, to retain them in order to  quench the fire of fratricidal war in the former Soviet Union so  that 1994 becomes a year of mutual trust, a year of  rapprochement, not one of divergence. We have nothing to  quarrel about. I favor moving toward prosperity through  unification, through mutual help, through setting up a common  market space.    Happy New Year, dear compatriots.</p>

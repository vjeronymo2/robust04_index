			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Letter: Time to pay realistic price for non-executive directors Sir, The time has now come, following publication of the Cadbury committee report, to realise that there is no such thing as a non-executive director. The unified nature of the UK board was stressed in the report. The legal fact is that all directors owe essentially the same duties to a company. Given the additional responsibilities now heaped on NEDs, the commitment in time required from them will surely mean that NEDs are, at the very least, part-time directors. At the heart of this comment is the rather infra dig but rather important question of fees. These often vary with the size of an organisation but the workload does not. And it will be those companies with the greatest need for strong, experienced NEDs that are least likely to get them because of the time commitment required. I warmly endorse the committee's recommendation that a clear written statement of the responsibilities of an NED should be drawn up on appointment. I would further recommend a clear statement of the hours that the NED will commit to the company. There should also be a clear statement of the number of hours the NED will be required to commit to the training recommended by the report. Those statements can then form the basis upon which an adequate fee can be agreed. Asking a minimum of 180 hours a year with an extra 90 hours for the first year and 15 hours a year training, over a three-year contract a company should probably be budgeting for a fee of between Pounds 32,000 and Pounds 63,000 a year for each non-executive. The actual fee would, of course, depend on responsibilities assumed (for example, chairmanship of the audit committee), and the calibre of the prospective NED. A fee of less than the minimum suggested would not adequately compensate a top calibre professional business person for the hours committed (opportunity cost) and the risk taken. That said, it is a fact that the vast majority of NEDs are currently paid significantly less than the suggested minimum, probably Pounds 12,000 to Pounds 20,000. If, however, shareholders really want the protection afforded by implementing the code they should be prepared to pay the price.

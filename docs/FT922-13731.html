			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Yeltsin to pay a price for support of deputies MR BORIS Yeltsin, the Russian president, today faces a resolution in the Congress of People's Deputies condemning the economic policy of his government and demanding changes in the memorandum on reform it has already thrashed out with the International Monetary Fund. Mr Yeltsin, who has sat stony faced through a barrage of criticism bordering on insults for the past two days, said yesterday he may choose to speak today in reply - though he that added he may give his response 'after the Congress', implying he might, if he feels too hemmed in by the deputies, carry the fight outside and appeal to the population at large. However, the resolution which the parliament's editorial commission has wrangled over for a day-and-a-half now has no clause demanding Mr Yeltsin's surrender of his extraordinary powers, or of his position as head of the government. Mr Andrei Nechaev, the economics minister, said after the Congress session last night that 'this is the very most we could accept: any more and we would have to resign.' The price, however, of the government's staying in power - though it is not yet completely certain that it is safe - is high. The resolution calls for Mr Yeltsin to present a law on a new government to parliament in a month's time - a demand which allows the government room to manoeuvre. However, it foreshadows the eventual stripping from Mr Yeltsin of his special powers to bring in laws by decree and to monopolise the appointment of ministers. At the same time, further concessions will be made from an already grossly strained budget. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, gave a short and well received speech of controlled passion, in which he told the deputies that the government would delay the energy price rises (set for June) and instead raise prices by stages, would raise pension and social security benefits and lower taxes. He claimed that the budget deficit had been kept to 1.5 per cent of the gross domestic product in the first quarter of the year - a figure much lower than that calculated by foreign economists. 'If this is failure, I do not know what success is,' said Mr Gaidar. However, he added: 'Maybe the government made a mistake in creating an image of a technocratic government'. The final clause in the resolution says that 'the congress states to the world community its decisive and firm intention to continue the policy of economic reform'. But it adds that that specific corrections must be made in the programme submitted by the government to the IMF, and that a parliamentary delegation would meet IMF representatives to clarify their position on the economy.</p>

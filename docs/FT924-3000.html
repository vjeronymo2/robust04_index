			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Takeshi Noda confirms slowdown of Japanese economy THE likelihood of a prolonged slowdown of the Japanese economy was confirmed yesterday by Mr Takeshi Noda, director-general of the Economic Planning Agency, who said that Japan would have trouble reaching a 3.5 per cent growth target in the next fiscal year, starting in April, Steven Butler reports from Tokyo. This is the first indication from a senior government minister that Japan's economy, in the grip of the most severe downturn in nearly 20 years, would not see strong recovery just around the corner. Mr Noda is the cabinet minister responsible for monitoring performance of the economy and co-ordinating economic policy. Mr Noda said Japan needed to set its 1993 growth target at realistic levels that would be achieved through policy efforts. Otherwise the government's credibility would be undermined. Mr Noda's agency, in a monthly report, yesterday confirmed that the economy remained in the doldrums due to a slump in personal consumption and a decline in industrial outout. The government's official growth forecast, which is drawn up for purposes of fiscal planning, this year remains at 3.5 per cent, although this is expected to be revised downward in the near future. Many private economists expect growth to fall below 2 per cent. The Japanese Diet is expected this week to pass a supplementary budget that will provide legislative authority for the government's Y10,700bn emergency economic plan announced in August. A further supplementary budget in the spring is widely thought necessary in order to restore growth to the economy.</p>

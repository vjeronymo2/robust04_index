			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required under &sect;989.54(b) of the order, the Committee met on October 5, 1993, and computed and announced a preliminary crop estimate and preliminary free and reserve percentages for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins which released 85 percent of the trade demand since field prices had been established. The preliminary crop estimate and preliminary free and reserve percentages were as follows: 387,947 tons, and 62 percent free and 38 percent reserve. Also at that meeting, the Committee computed and announced preliminary crop estimates and preliminary free and reserve percentages for Dipped Seedless, Oleate and Related Seedless, Golden Seedless, Zante Currant, Sultana, Muscat, Monukka, and Other Seedless raisins. On November 15, 1993, the Committee decided that volume control percentages only were warranted for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins, which would remain at 62 percent free and 38 percent reserve. It determined that the supplies of the other varietal types would be less than or close enough to the computed trade demands for each of these varietals or could be substituted to relieve anticipated shortages in some size ranges of Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins used for baking. In view of these factors, volume control percentages would not be necessary to maintain market stability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to &sect;989.54(c), the Committee may adopt interim free and reserve percentages. Interim percentages may release less than the computed trade demand for each varietal type. Interim percentages for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins of 73.75 percent free and 26.25 percent reserve were computed and announced on January 13, 1994. That action released most, but not all the computed trade demand for Natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (sun-dried) Seedless raisins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under &sect;989.54(d) of the order, the Committee is required to recommend to the Secretary, no later than February 15 of each crop year, final free and reserve percentages which, when applied to the final production estimate of a varietal type, will tend to release the full trade demand for any varietal type.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee's final estimate of 1993&hyph;94 production of Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins is 384,501 tons. Dividing the computed trade demand of 282,909 tons by the final estimate of production results in a final free percentage of 74 percent and a final reserve percentage of 26 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant information presented, including the Committee's recommendations and other information, it is found that this regulation, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that upon good cause it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because: (1) The relevant provisions of this part require that the percentages designated herein for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year apply to all Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins acquired from the beginning of that crop year; (2) handlers are currently marketing 1993&hyph;94 crop raisins of the Natural (sun-dried) Seedless varietal type and this action should be taken promptly to achieve the intended purpose of making the full trade demand quantity computed by the Committee available to handlers; (3) handlers are aware of this action, which was recommended by the Committee at an open meeting, and need no additional time to comply with these percentages; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day period for written comments and all comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this interim final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 989  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grapes, Marketing agreements, Raisins, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 989 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 989_RAISINS PRODUCED FROM GRAPES GROWN IN CALIFORNIA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

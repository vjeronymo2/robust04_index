			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading Stock index futures were volatile in thin trading, opening with renewed weakness but rebounding sharply once the latest US inflation indicator had been released. The September contract on the FT-SE 100 index moved down through 3,100 at the opening but clawed back to close at 3,118, marginally below the 3,120 best of the day. The closing discount to the cash market narrowed to 4 with the fair value premium standing at around 3 points. Marketmakers said business was mostly thin and nervous with the September contract expiring on Friday. Trading volume totalled just over 22,000 but almost half of that figure was said to have been determined by roll-overs into the December contract. Trading was again dominated by locals - independent traders - with institutions for the most part keeping firmly to the sidelines. 'What we badly need is an injection of hedge-fund and institutional activity', said one dealer yesterday. In traded options, volume moved ahead strongly to 56,282 contracts from 42,477 on Monday. The main drive came from FT-SE volume which was some 10,000 contracts higher at 22,824. Between them FT-SE and Euro FT-SE options accounted for more than two-thirds of total turnover. The most active individual stock options were Glaxo and Tomkins.</p>

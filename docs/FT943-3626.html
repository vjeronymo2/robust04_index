			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Boxes coming to market this month Boxes, a cardboard packaging producer, is planning to come to market through a placing which is likely to value the company at more than Pounds 18m. The family-owned company is expecting to raise up to Pounds 5m in new money through the flotation at the end of this month, in order to fund acquisitions. Boxes is estimated to have about 200 competitors in the cardboard packaging market. The Watford-based manufacturer specialises in the production of printed folding cartons for the pharmaceutical, food and household markets. Mr Yalkin Tanyar, chief executive of Boxes, said: 'We believe that a listing on the London Stock Exchange will give Boxes greater flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to develop the group, both organically and through the selective acquisition of complementary businesses. 'The company also expects to benefit from a higher profile and greater acceptance by customers as a result of being a listed company.' Boxes, which also owns manufacturing operations in Great Harwood, near Manchester, and Burnley, Lancashire, increased its turnover from Pounds 15.7m to Pounds 17.2m between 1992 and 1994. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 0.7m to Pounds 1.3m in the same period, as the company increased its operating margin from 8.7 per cent to 12.8 per cent. The company, which also owns businesses making cake decorations and small rigid boxes, has a blue chip customer base including Smith &amp; Nephew, Reckitt &amp; Colman and SmithKline Beecham. The flotation will leave the bulk of the company in the hands of the family of Mr Derek Gee, president of Boxes which currently owns 95 per cent of the capital. The remainder is held by Mr Tanyar's family. The issue is sponsored by Samuel Montagu and the stockbroker is James Capel.</p>

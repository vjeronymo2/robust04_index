The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) adopted a  resolution Monday to refer Pyongyang's refusal of full  inspections of its nuclear facilities to the United Nations  Security Council.    Hosokawa said he was gravely concerned over the situation  and  was keeping it under close observation, the officials said.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said in a  separate  press meeting that government ministries and agencies have  started considering possible punitive measures against North  Korea in preparation for the possibility of the United Nations  Security Council adopting sanctions. Takemura also said it is  important to exchange information with the United States and  South Korea over the issue.    As for the large-scale transfer of goods and funds to North  Korea by pro-Pyongyang Korean residents in Japan, government  sources said it would be difficult to suspend such remittances  even if sanctions were imposed. The sources said, however, that  the government would consider the remittance issue.    The sources also said that Japan will have to take a harder  stand toward North Korea since it is likely Pyongyang would  target Japan if it develops nuclear bombs.</p>

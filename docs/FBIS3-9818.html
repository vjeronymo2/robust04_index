The reception was also  attended by Army General Rasim Delic, supreme commander of the  Chief of Staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Armed Forces, and Naib  Ul Reus Ismet Efendija Spahic.    During the long conversation, Reis Ul Ulema Mustafa Efendija  Ceric supported all the efforts aimed at a military and  political agreement between the Bosniak and Croatian peoples,  and stressed that these two peoples are not two sides as they  have only one homeland, Bosnia-Herzegovina. Their common fate  is to fight a war for peace and to fight in peace for the  defense of their own dignity. He stressed that the 1,000-year  fate of Bosnia was its multicultural character, and that this  feature was the only basis for the world and its existence. The  reis ul ulema confirmed that the Islamic community would do all  it could to help heal the wounds inflicted by the aggression  upon Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has caused grievous losses to the  Bosniak people.    Expressing his personal conviction as a believer that the  Islamic community in Bosnia-Herzegovina and its leaders would  offer help in the healing of the wounds caused by the war,  Lieutenant General Ante Roso particularly stressed that he had  come to Sarajevo because he was convinced that everything should  be done to achieve this end. Saying that the establishment of a  firm and lasting peace is a difficult task that is beyond the  powers of any one man, Roso stressed his conviction that this  could be done through joint efforts.</p>

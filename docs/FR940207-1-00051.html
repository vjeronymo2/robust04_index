			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 16, 1985, NRC promulgated rules at 10 CFR part 40, appendix A to conform NRC's regulations issued five years earlier to the provisions of EPA's general UMTRCA standards other than those affecting ground water protection at 40 CFR part 192. (50 FR 41852). NRC completed conforming amendments for groundwater protection in appendix A of part 40 in 1987.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neither the UMTRCA standards promulgated by EPA in 1983 nor the NRC standards promulgated in 1985, established compliance schedules to ensure that non-operational tailings piles would be closed, and that the 20 pCi/m2-s standard would be met, within a reasonable period of time. Moreover, the EPA standards and NRC criteria also did not require monitoring to ensure compliance with the flux standard. 50 FR 41852 (October 16, 1985). To rectify these shortcomings of the current EPA and NRC programs regulating uranium mill tailings, EPA promulgated standards under Section 112 of the CAA on October 31, 1989, to ensure that the piles would be closed in a timely manner with monitoring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 15, 1989, EPA promulgated national standards regulating radionuclide emissions to the ambient air from several source categories, including non-operational sites used for the disposal of uranium mill tailings. (54 FR 51654). These sites are either under the control of the DOE pursuant to Title I of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA) of 1978, 42 U.S.C. 7901  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et. seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., or are under the control of NRC or Agreement State-licensees pursuant to Title II of UMTRCA. These standards_subpart T of 40 CFR part 61 (subpart T)_were promulgated pursuant to the authority of Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) section 112 as it existed in 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart T of 40 CFR part 61, limits radon-222 emissions to the ambient air from non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites licensed by the NRC or an affected Agreement State. Subpart T requires that these sites, which consist of large (i.e., numerous acre) impoundments or piles, comply with a radon flux standard of 20 pCi/m2-s. 40 CFR 61.222(a). Moreover, compliance must be achieved within two years of when the site becomes non-operational, 40 CFR 61.222(b), which for piles which had ceased operation prior to the time of promulgation was no later than December 15, 1991. While at the time of promulgation EPA recognized that many sources might not be able to achieve this date, EPA was constrained by then existing CAA section 112(c)(1)(B)(ii) which allows a maximum of two years for facilities to come into compliance. EPA stated that for those sites which could not meet the two-year date, the Agency would negotiate expeditious compliance schedules pursuant to its enforcement authority under CAA section 113. See 54 FR 51683. Subpart T also calls for monitoring and recordkeeping to establish and demonstrate compliance. See 40 CFR 61.223 and 61.224.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart T was part of a larger promulgation of radionuclide NESHAPs that represent the Agency's application of the policy for regulating CAA section 112 pollutants which was first announced in the benzene NESHAP. 54 FR 38044 (September 14, 1989). The NESHAP policy utilized a two-step approach. In the first step, EPA considered the lifetime risk to the maximally exposed individual, and found that it is presumptively acceptable if it is no higher than approximately one in ten thousand. This presumptive level provides a benchmark for judging the acceptability of a category of emissions. This first step also considers other health and risk factors such as projected incidence of cancer, the estimated number of persons exposed within each individual lifetime risk range, the weight of evidence presented in the risk assessment, and the estimated incidence of non-fatal cancer and other health effects. After considering all of this information, a final decision on a safe level of acceptable risk is made. This becomes the starting point for the second step, determining the ample margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the second step, EPA strives to provide protection for the greatest number of persons possible to an individual lifetime risk level no higher than approximately one in one million. In this step, the Agency sets a standard which provides an ample margin of safety, again considering all of the health risk and other health information considered in the first step, as well as additional factors such as costs and economic impacts of controls, technological feasibility, uncertainties, and any other relevant factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA noted that standards it had already promulgated pursuant to the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA) of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 2022, 7901&hyph;7942) would eventually limit radon emissions from those sites to a flux of 20 pCi/m2-s (see 40 CFR part 192, subpart D), and thus EPA referred to that level as ``baseline.'' EPA's risk assessment revealed that compliance with the 20 pCi/m2-s baseline would result in an estimated lifetime risk to the maximally exposed individual of approximately 1 x 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4, a level EPA determined to be safe under the first step of the analysis. EPA further concluded in the second step, which considers additional factors such as cost and technological feasibility, that the baseline level also provided an ample margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

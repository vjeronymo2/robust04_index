			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Buy-out to cost Ina L580bn ASSITALIA, the Italian non-life insurance group, was suspended from trading on the Milan stock exchange yesterday after Friday's announcement that its majority shareholder intended to buy out the minority stake. Assitalia, one of Italy's biggest general insurers, is controlled by Ina, the state-owned life insurance group due to be privatised next year. The buy-out represents a cleaning-up operation by Ina, after advice by its bankers that privatisation would be easier if shareholders were offered stock in a full-range life and non-life group. Buying out the Assitalia minorities, which own 40.5 per cent of the company, is expected to cost Ina at least L580bn (Dollars 353m), based on Friday's pre-suspension share price of L9,538. Ina is expected to reveal its formal offer price later this week. However, the deal may also involve some mechanism allowing Assitalia shareholders to swap into Ina stock on privatisation. The Assitalia deal is the second big financial transaction launched by Ina in recent weeks.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGES, COURT WORKERS STRIKE OVER KILLINGS IN COLOMBIA  </P> <P> Judges and court workers began a series of nationwide strikes Thursday after a  judge and a congressman were murdered, apparently by drug traffickers.  </P> <P> In Medellin, where the judge was killed, federal justices walked off the job  indefinitely until they receive more protection. It is the third time that  judges have gone on strike in the last three months to protest assassinations.  </P> <P> In the latest slayings, federal Judge Mariela Espinoza was killed by submachine  gun fire from two speeding cars as she arrived at her Medellin home Wednesday  night with two guards. A guard and a bystander were wounded.  </P> <P> Espinoza, 43, was one of 42 federal appellate judges in Medellin, the cocaine  capital of Colombia. It was not immediately known if she had handled drug  cases.  </P> <P> In the capital of Bogota, federal Rep. Luis Francisco Madero, 62, was killed  with a pistol shot to the head Wednesday night by a man outside his apartment.  </P> <P> Madero, a 27-year veteran in Colombia's House of Representatives and a former  ambassador to the United Nations, had supported extradition of Colombians to  the United States to face drug-trafficking charges.  </P> <P> No one claimed responsibility for either slaying, but security forces blamed  drug traffickers.  </P></p>

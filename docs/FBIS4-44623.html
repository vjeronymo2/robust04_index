			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Peng Jiangde, Jiang Xin [1203 2450] et al. of </F> the Dept. of Electronic Engineering, Qinghua Univ., Beijing  100084: ``Utilitarian 1.47-gmm LD-Pumped Er[.sup]3+[/]-Doped  Fiber Optical Amplifier Module,'' supported by grant from 863  Program; MS received 18 Nov 93. Cf. early brief report in  JPRS-CST-94-001, 24 Jan 94 p 31]    [Abstract] The first domestic development of a utilitarian  EDFA module prototype using two domestically made 25-mW,  1480-nm-wavelength LDs as pump sources and  Er[.sup]3+[/]/Al[.sup]3+[/] co-doped optical fiber is  reported. This module has a net gain at 1550 nm of 27 dB, a  saturated output power of 0 dBm, a maximum output power of 7  dBm, an optical bandwidth greater than 20 nm, and a noise figure  less than 7 dB--values comparable to early-9Os international  standards as published in references 3-4. This module, jointly  developed by Qinghua University, the CAS Institute of  Semiconductors, the 863 Optoelectronics Fabrication Center,  Wuhan Institute of Posts &amp; Telecommunications Science, and  MEI's  Institute 46, is designed for 4 x 622 Mbps WDM or TDM  (time-division multiplexing) fiber optic transmission systems  and optical soliton transmission systems.    Figures 1-4, not reproduced, show the following: a schematic  of the EDFA module, consisting of a fiber coupler, an isolator,  the first pump LD, a WDM unit, a control circuit, a power  supply, the Er-doped fiber, the second pump LD, another WDM  coupler, another isolator, and another fiber coupler; graphs of  EDFA module gain characteristics (plots of gain vs signal input  for both forward pumping and bidirectional pumping); a graph of  EDFA module power characteristics (plot of output power vs input  power); and a graph of EDFA module bandwidth characteristics  (plot of net gain vs signal wavelength), respectively. There  are no tables.  <H5>  References: </H5>   1. Peng Jiangde et al., GAO JISHU TONGXUN [HIGH TECHNOLOGY  LETTERS], 1992, 2(12):10.    2.

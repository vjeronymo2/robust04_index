			<p>Way   <F P=102>   94FE0271C Tokyo GENSHIRYOKU SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 11  Nov 93 p 4--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0271C </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo GENSHIRYOKU SANGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text]  <H5>  Efforts To Reform the Nuclear Power Development Long Term </H5> Plan    Since 1956, the Atomic Energy Commission, in order to  proceed  with the use and development of nuclear power in a planned and  comprehensive manner with the understanding and cooperation of  the people, about once every five years, has published the  Nuclear Power Development Long Term Plan (hereafter called the  long term plan), in which is laid out general guidelines and  concrete policies regarding the development and utilization of  nuclear power.    The current long term plan was drawn up in June 1987,  however, mirroring the great changes in the domestic and  international situation with regard to nuclear power, such as  the steady progress of Japan's nuclear power development  (starting with the fuel cycle operations in Rokkasho-mura in  Aomori Prefecture), the end of the East-West Cold War, rising  fears over the proliferation of nuclear arms, and increased  awareness of the global environmental problem. In July 1992, the  Atomic Energy Commission decided to carry out a revision of the  long term plan, and established, under its own auspices, a Long  Term Plan Specialist Committee.    It was decided to establish five subcommittees under this  Specialist Committee, the General Subcommittee, the First  Subcommittee (light water reactor utilization), the Second  Subcommittee (nuclear fuel recycling), the Third Subcommittee  (nuclear non-proliferation and international aid), and the  Fourth Subcommittee (technology development), and to set up  various working groups within the subcommittees to consider the  following problems: the First and Second Subcommittees to  jointly look at radioactive waste countermeasures, the Third  Subcommittee to look at nuclear non-proliferation  countermeasures, and the Fourth Subcommittee to look at nuclear  ships, high-temperature engineering research and  experimentation, and the nuclear power workforce problem.  Currently, studies are being carried out in the various  subcommittees.    Furthermore, in view of the increased popular interest in  nuclear power policy, which has been caused by factors such as  the domestic and international situation with regard to nuclear  fuel recycling, a broad range of opinions is being sought on the  development of nuclear power from experienced scholars in areas  other than nuclear power as part of the long term plan  formulation process. It is thought to be significant that such  views are to be reflected in the long term plan. A Long Term  Plan Round-Table Group has been established in the Specialist  Committee that is composed of professionals in fields other than  nuclear power to discuss, in connection with this revision of  the long term plan, just how our country's nuclear power  development should take place.    The primary points to be discussed in connection with the  revision of the long term plan include:        -  looking forward to the 21st century, the formulation of  a long term and flexible nuclear power development system;    -  the  coexistence of the peaceful use of nuclear power and nuclear  non-proliferation under the new world order following an end to  the Cold War;    -  international aid as one of the advanced countries  which possess nuclear technology, the promotion of worthy  guiding projects and basic research in countries with emerging  technology, and the development of fundamental technology; and,    -  expanding the public's understanding of the necessity of  nuclear power from the point of view of the dealing with  international issues such as the energy problem and the  environmental problem.       These are issues that will be discussed from the point of  view of general topics connected to this revision of the long  term plan. However, it is possible that the following important  issues could be raised in connection with nuclear fuel recycling:        -  the necessity of nuclear fuel recycling and a  reconfirmation of its significance;    -  the revealing of a rational  nuclear fuel recycling plan, which has flexibility in its  entirety, starting with the plan to develop fast breeder  reactors; and,    -  the revealing of a nuclear fuel recycling plan  that clearly shows that it can receive acceptance both  domestically and internationally, based on factors such as the  global situation with regard to nuclear non-proliferation.       As stated in this article, within an international situation  that is undergoing radical change, this revision of the long  term plan is extremely important in order to, while following  the ideals laid down by the basic law on nuclear power, continue  to obtain the understanding of the citizens of Japan and the  international community, pursue the development of nuclear power  (starting with nuclear fuel recycling) and, at the same time,  plan for the securing of stable energy supplies and the  promotion of the development of advanced technology, bring forth  the renewal potential of nuclear power, and positively  contribute to international society as a peaceful user of  nuclear power.    The Atomic Energy Commission is in a position to, looking  forward to the 21st century and in conformity to the climate of  the times, listen to the views of various sectors with regard to  the formulation of a new long term plan which incorporates basic  guidelines on nuclear power development and specific policies on  its promotion which our country should adopt.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: CSI package expected Cannon Street Investments, the mini-conglomerate, is expected to announce next week details of a restructuring package and an acquisition. The package is aimed at cutting debt and will include the restructuring of Pounds 25.7m of convertible preference shares. The planned acquisition would strengthen the core electronics business. The shares fell 4p yesterday to 11 1/2 p. Earlier this month they declined 11p to 15 1/2 p in one day when the company failed to announce the expected package and reported lower sales and operating profit. Bank of Scotland holds 98 per cent of CSI's preference stock. Outstanding preference dividends amount to Pounds 4.48m. The company plans to focus on its electronics division, which contributed Pounds 2.75m to reduced trading profit from continuing operations of Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 2.88m) in the first half.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (7): The European anchor may give security  -Foreign Policy 'IF WE are not in Europe, we are in Russia' is how one Helsinki taxi driver justifies his support for Finnish membership of the European Community. The view may be a little extreme, but it helps to explain why Finns have proved to be more enthusiastic about joining the EC than either of their Nordic neighbours, Norway and Sweden. Western Europe is seen as an anchor for Finland at a time when the certainties of the cold war have been lost and traditional concepts of neutrality no longer carry their former weight. The feeling has been heightened by the upheaval which continues to afflict the country's giant eastern neighbour, Russia. In other words, security questions as well as economic issues are weighing on the minds of the Finns when they consider the EC. By contrast with Sweden and Norway, opinion polls have consistently shown a majority of the population to be in favour of EC membership, although sometimes the margin has been very narrow. An August poll, conducted by the Taloustutkimus organisation, indicated 49 per cent were pro-EC, compared with 35 per cent against. Negotiations on membership began in February, but the toughest phase of the talks will come this autumn when the most difficult questions are discussed. It is already clear that agricultural and regional matters will be the biggest stumbling blocks, although there is also concern about moves within the EC to limit the influence of smaller EC member states in decision-making. It may seem surprising that agriculture has become so sensitive an issue, as farming employs only 8 per cent of the Finnish population and contributes only 4-5 per cent to GDP. But farming's importance is psychological as well as economic in a land where the countryside is regarded as an essential part of the national identity and cultural heritage. As recently as 1960, 36 per cent of the workforce was employed on farms. The issue also has particular importance for Finland's Centre party, the dominant coalition partner, as it traditionally draws its support from rural areas. Opinion polls have shown that Finnish farmers are more implacably opposed to EC membership than any other section of society. The Centre itself is split, with its leaders in favour of the EC and the rank and file against it. The need to win over the party membership may explain why Mr Heikki Haavisto, president of the influential Central Union of Agricultural Producers and a renowned EC sceptic, was appointed as foreign minister in May when Mr Paavo Vayrynen stepped down from the position to promote his candidacy for the presidency. If nothing else, the appointment sent a clear signal to Brussels about the importance Finland attaches to the agricultural issue. In essence, Finland wants hefty EC subsidies - worth about FM3.5bn a year - in recognition of the special geographical and climatic conditions facing its farmers in such a northerly location. 'Our natural circumstances are very different to those of any country already in the EC,' states Mr Haavisto. In particular, he draws attention to Finland's short growing season - even in southern Finland it is only 170 days compared with 230 in northern Germany - as well as to the small average size of the country's farms and the distances to market, which are often huge. But he also makes it clear that agriculture has related regional and security aspects. The fear is that if farmers are put out of business, whole areas of the country will become depopulated, a particularly sensitive topic in the context of Finland's 1,300km long border with Russia. If Finland can get an agreement on agriculture, it looks very much as if all other aspects of its membership application will fall into place. The country has accepted the Maastricht treaty, and it has not made an issue out of neutrality. For the moment, it wants to remain militarily non-aligned, with an independent defence, but it has not ruled any options, including membership of the Western European Union, in the future. The country is also displaying a more relaxed attitude than either Norway or Sweden on some other controversial questions, such as alcohol policy. Mr Haavisto's appointment as foreign minister was certainly not universally welcomed, as he was thought to be too closely tied to the farming lobby. However, his critics say that on the evidence of his first five months in office he genuinely wants to achieve a negotiating result which will enable Finland to join. It is hard to predict what will happen if Mr Haavisto eventually decides he cannot recommend the membership package which Finland is offered. The likely answer is that it will provoke a government crisis, forcing the Centre party out of the coalition. In any case, it is difficult to see agriculture being the decisive issue. Dr Max Jacobson, a former diplomat, says it is 'inconceivable' that Finland will reject membership just because the farmers oppose it. 'A majority will still be in favour of joining,' he claims. A bigger danger could be developments in the Community itself if these create a negative impression in the minds of the Finnish electorate. The timetable is certainly tight. If Finland is to join the Community on schedule on January 1 1995, negotiations must be completed by next April. A non-binding referendum will then be held around next September. That is likely to make Finland the first of the three Nordic states to vote on the issue, so a Yes vote will be important not simply for Finland but for pro-EC campaigners in both Sweden and Norway, who believe it will provide a wider momentum for their own EC membership ambitions.</p>

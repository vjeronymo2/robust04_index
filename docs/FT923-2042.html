			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Fear and loathing on the loose: The task facing UN troops in Baranja, eastern Croatia War seems a long way off from the lush, sun-drenched cornfields of Slavonia, eastern Croatia. Yet this time last year, the Yugoslav army and Serb forces were fighting against Croat soldiers in these meadows from where mortar and artillery rockets were launched. Entire villages and towns were razed. Since April, UN troops deployed in three sectors of Croatia have steadily overseen the withdrawal of the Yugoslav army and the disarming of local Serb police forces, a process which is continuing. Despite these troops, the UN's protected area in 'sector east', eastern Croatia, is lapsing into lawlessness. The Serbs, who seized this and other parts of Croatia last year, are determined to hold onto their gains. Mr Boronje Zivanovic, president of the council of Beli Manistir, the main town in the Baranja, which comprises the entire northern part of sector east, said the region would never again become part of Croatia. 'This is our territory. This is part of the Serbian republic of Krajina,' he said. He called the Belgian UN battalion, deployed in this part of sector east, 'fascists'. Mr Zivanovic says Serb leaders want to set up their own state in the Baranja, even though it is Croatian territory. 'Those Belgians are preventing us from doing that,' he said. He added that the local Serbs authorities are applying laws passed in September 1991 by the self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina, which includes the Baranja. As part of the creation of a greater Serbia, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic had hoped to link the Krajina with Serbia proper. The recent upheavals have altered the ethnic composition of the Baranja. Forty-two per cent of Baranja's 54,000-strong population was Croat and 25 per cent was Serb. During the fighting, 25,000 Croats and Hungarians fled the region. Since the war, 10,000 Serb refugees have been resettled there. Today, Serbs make up more than 70 per cent of the population. The determination of the Serbs to hold onto the Baranja also accounts for Mr Zivanovic's insistence that it is 'ridiculous' to expect the Serbs to give up all their weapons under the UN peace plan for Croatia. 'We fear an attack from Croatia. Croatia has already expelled many Serbs from that republic. Serbs who remain there have no rights whatsoever,' he said. To compound matters, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman is demanding that, on September 30, the UN start allowing Croat refugees back to the Baranja. 'The conditions for their return, which include their safety, do not yet exist,' said Ms Blandina Francis Negga, the UN's civilian affairs co-ordinator in sector east. Another UN official said Mr Tudjman would try to send back 'refugees' who were 6ft 6in tall, young, fit, and well-trained. 'We would have a war on our hands,' he said. 'We are in a no-win situation. If we do not allow the Croat refugees back to the Baranja, we will be accused of exacerbating the refugee crisis in Croatia and facilitating ethnic cleansing of the Baranja.' Another senior UN military official added: 'We are hated by the Croats because they accuse us of consolidating Serbian gains in Croatia. We are hated by the Serbs because they accuse us of preventing them from setting up their own state in the Baranja.' The UN's mandate does not permit state structures being established in sector east. 'What we can do is report cases of intimidation against the ethnic communities to the local authorities,' said Ms Negga. UN officials say that killings, aimed at forcing out the non-Serb population are frequent, with between 10 and 15 incidents taking place each day. Since they arrived last April, they know of 40 ethnic murders, and 400 terrorist acts against the non-Serb population. 'We have documented proof, including identification by victims, that members of the (Serb) regional police forces have taken part in terrorist acts,' a UN military official said. Mr Zivanovic said he had heard about some of these cases, but denied any complicity by the regional police. Colonel Dragan Novakovic, chief of Baranja's regional police, also denied any involvement by the police in terrorism, or any organised policy of intimidation of non-Serbs. But Croat and Hungarian homes in the Baranja are easily identifiable (they have a white cloth or a red mark put on their houses by the authorities). Many live in fear. 'My friend was butchered last week,' said a 65-year-old Croat peasant woman. 'They killed two of my friends in front of my house.' The UN know about this, and other cases. 'Can we place a patrol outside every Croat and Hungarian house?' asked a UN military official. 'We have not got the resources.' He turned to the problems of neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina. 'Can you imagine the UN trying to set up protected areas there given our problems here? The Baranja is just a tiny, tiny, microcosm of Bosnia. This is a step-by-step process of restoring stability here, where the desire for revenge runs deep. It will take years before Serbs and Croats can live together again.'</p>

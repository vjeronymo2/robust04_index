			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUIT SETTLED IN INS SEIZURE OF DOCUMENTS;  </P> <P> AGENCY WILL REPLACE PAPERS, EXTEND DEADLINE FOR AMNESTY SEEKERS  </P> <P> The U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service agreed to a settlement Monday  in a lawsuit filed against border inspectors who illegally seized documents  from migrant farm workers who had applied for amnesty under a special provision  of the 1986 Immigration Reform Act.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the settlement, announced in federal court Monday, the INS  will provide replacement documents to the farm workers and will extend the  deadlines for completion of amnesty applications and appeals.  </P> <P> At issue in the case was whether immigration inspectors at border checkpoints  could confiscate documents from workers whom they believed, after quick  inspection, had committed fraud in their applications for amnesty, said Betty  Wheeler, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union in San Diego.  </P> <P> </P> <P> California and Texas  </P> <P> All of the more than 700 workers involved in the class action suit had applied  for amnesty under the farm workers program, Wheeler said. Their amnesty  documents were seized as they were preparing to cross the border into  California or Texas.  </P> <P> Under the special agricultural-worker provisions of the 1986 law, migrant  workers who could prove they had done at least 90 days of agricultural work in  the United States between May 1, 1985, and May 1, 1986, could apply to become  permanent residents and eventually U. S. citizens.  </P> <P> The case was filed on behalf of the workers by the ACLU in conjunction with  California Rural Legal Assistance and the California Rural Legal Assistance  Foundation, both advocacy groups. The suit alleged that the practices of  confiscating "amnesty" cards, "abusively interrogating" amnesty applicants and  deporting or threatening to deport the applicants were violations of due  process as well as the provisions of the 1986 legislation.  </P> <P> Under the consent decree announced Monday, the INS must identify all amnesty  applicants whose documents were confiscated and notify them of their right to a  replacement card, which gives them the right to work in the United States and  to travel abroad. Workers whose amnesty applications were denied by the INS in  administrative hearings after their cards were confiscated will be allowed to  file another appeal and will receive replacement cards.  </P> <P> Applicants who received 90-day permits allowing them to enter the United States  to gather documents to support their amnesty applications, but had their  permits confiscated at the border, will receive new permits and will be allowed  to complete their applications.  </P> <P> Several issues remain unresolved, including whether the INS must expunge from  its records the "confessions" made by applicants during questioning at the  border. The lawsuit alleges that those statements were coerced by border  inspectors.  </P> <P> A hearing on the remaining issues will be held next week before U. S. District  Judge J. Lawrence Irving.  </P></p>

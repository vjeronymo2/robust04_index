			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / European Court backs away from Sunday trade row PRESSURE on the government to introduce urgent reform of Sunday trading laws increased yesterday after the European Court of Justice suggested it was up to English courts to sort out the confusion surrounding the present legislation. Mr Walter Van Gerven, the advocate-general, said it was justifiable under Community law for countries to have national legislation which prohibited shops opening on Sundays. He was giving a preliminary opinion in three cases brought by local authorities in England and Wales against Payless DIY, B&amp;Q and Anders - all DIY chains. It was up to the English courts to decide whether the 1950 Shops Act was incompatible with EC law and to judge whether the effect of general Sunday closing on trade within the EC was disproportionate to the legitimate objectives of the legislation. The advocate-general's opinion is not binding on the full European Court, which will deliver its judgment in the autumn. It will then be left to the law lords, who referred the cases to Luxembourg, to decide the issue, taking the court's views into account. The government has been committed to reform of the Sunday trading laws since 1987 but has been reluctant to legislate after its last attempt was defeated by a Conservative backbench rebellion in 1986. Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the electrical retailer, said yesterday he had received a personal promise 'from a politician higher than Kenneth Clarke', the home secretary, that the government would introduce legislation immediately after the European Court ruling was published this autumn. Retailers who have been close to discussions with the government suggest any legislation is likely to enshrine three main principles: a commitment to keep Sunday trading different from Saturday, perhaps by specifying a maximum number of trading hours; a commitment to help protect small shops; and a provision to protect employee rights. The government is believed to be keen to prevent the passage of Labour MP Mr Ray Powell's private member's bill, which suggests reforms along the lines of proposals drawn up by the Keep Sunday Special Campaign. These seek an updating of the Sunday trading laws, with heavy regulation and greater clarification. The share prices of many of the leading retail companies involved in Sunday trading were hit yesterday but most recovered as the day progressed. Kingfisher, which owns the B&amp;Q chain, ended the day down 4p at 466p; J Sainsbury closed down 3p at 449p; Argyll Group, owner of Safeway, was down 5p at 343p; and Tesco was down 4p at 254p.

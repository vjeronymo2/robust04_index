			<p>BFN     [Text] In relations between Russia and Kazakhstan there is  a "gap" between the degree of mutual understanding on the  highest level and its practical implementation, said Russia's  Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev, at talks with his Kazakh  counterpart, Kanat Saudabayev, in Moscow on Friday.    He said "when practical work begins, even the existing  agreements, let alone the notion of a Eurasian union, fail to  work well."    "Back in January we submitted to Kazakhstan our ideas  concerning citizenship, but received a reply only yesterday,  that is six months later. The two presidents must evidently  punish us for this," Kozyrev said.    There are also other problems requiring solutions, such as  the issues of the Baykonur launch site and missile silos.  "Can't we resolve them without third parties?" he asked.    When the talks ended, Kozyrev's political adviser Galina  Sidorova told journalists that Kozyrev and Saudabayev had  focused on ways to bridge the "gap" mentioned by the Russian  foreign minister, and translate the existing agreements into  practical deeds.    Sidorova said the two sides had formed a joint working group  which will engage in drafting documents that would develop  bilateral agreements reached on the highest level.    During the recent visit to Moscow of President Nursultan  Nazarbayev the two sides signed on twenty agreements, including  a treaty on furthering economic cooperation, accords on military  cooperation, an agreement on the use and lease of the Baykonur  launch site, and a memorandum on the basic principles of  resolving problems connected with citizenship and with the legal  status of Russian and Kazakh citizens, she said.    On the eve of talks between Kozyrev and Saudabayev  Kazakhstan  submitted to Moscow a draft agreement on the legal status of  citizens, Sidorova pointed out. "Russia is particularly  concerned over this issue. It stands for a unified and  indivisible Kazakhstan, but it would like the Kazakh leaders to  find a common language with their Russian-speaking population  which numbers millions," she stressed.    Sidorova said Kazakhstan also submitted a draft agreement on  simplifying the procedure of acquiring citizenship, on the order  of military service and on cooperation in the field of labor  migration. "These agreements directly concern the problem of  human rights. We hope that they will help ease our mutual  concern and dissatisfaction caused by the fact that  understandings reached on the highest level are not carried out  quickly and effectively enough," she said.</p>

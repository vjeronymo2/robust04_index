			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Biggest aims for the best THE LARGE hoardings promoting Birmingham before a mass television audience last night gave a glimpse of election counts of the future when the results for 12 constituencies were assembled in the city's National Indoor Arena. A military-style operation went into action as soon as the polling booths closed at 10pm with the aim of ensuring that Britain's largest ballot count under one roof - handling more than half a million votes - went ahead without a hitch. With four key marginals contested in the city - Hall Green, Northfield, Yardley and Selly Oak - Birmingham was a prime focus of media attention and the city council lost no opportunity to promote the city as one of the nation's top sporting, cultural and exhibition centres. The 800 counting staff and scrutineers were herded into pens for each constituency, separated by eight-foot partitions. Wide-angle television cameras suspended above the hall were able to provide a panoramic view of the event. To avoid the crush of more than 600 cars and vans carrying ballot boxes into the city centre at one time - as happened in the last general election - security vans were loaded at collection points outside the centre and driven straight on to the arena floor. Mr Peter Hatch, Birmingham's elections officer, said: 'To make sure we had the arena we pre-booked Thursday night as early as last October through to July 9, the latest date for a general election.' The Midlands, where many of the crucial marginals that decided today's result were being fought, has a long tradition of historic election results. In 1900, when general elections were held over several days, Derby returned Britain's second Labour MP - Richard Bell - a day after Keir Hardie won his seat. Birmingham itself, however, maintained a Conservative tradition for many years because of the influence of Joseph Chamberlain and his two sons, Neville and Austen, who ensured that a Chamberlain was in the House of Commons representing some part of the city from 1876 to the Second World War. One of the city's closest results was in 1924, when Neville Chamberlain defeated Oswald Mosley by just 77 votes after two earlier counts which had given the seat to Mosley. After last night's count the arena, which opened last October and cost Pounds 51m to build, will return to staging more peaceful contests. Later this month it hosts the national karate championships. Before the general election count the venue's biggest event had been Disney on Ice.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 22 February carries in  its regular 30-minute newscast several reports on the fighting  in the republic. Reception is fair.    Describing the situation in Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that  "today, on the 17th day of the heaviest offensive by the Serb  aggressor, the town is under attack from all sides. Some 5,000  chetniks have been brought from other fronts in  Bosnia-Herzegovina to capture this area. They have been  bringing in new military equipment by road and by helicopter.  The heavy artillery from the surrounding Bihac hills has been  systematically destroying Bihac and Cazin. Heavy fighting has  again been under way on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau, and the  chetnik artillery guns have been pounding the defense lines  since this morning."    In his report from Maglaj, Smajl Terzic says that "there is  an abundance here of snow and Russian-made shells, though  fortunately only one in 10 explodes, fired at the suffering  people in Sije, Mrkotic, Kalosevic, Tesanj, Maglaj, and the free  Teslic and Doboj territories. During the 37th day of the  offensive, the [Serb] aggressor is bringing in new forces, and  conducting mobilization of Muslims under the age of 16. They  are being forced into the mine fields and if they resist, they  are shot on the spot."    Reporting from Gornji Vakuf, Akif Agic says that "Croatian  artillery has been pounding the villages near the town. Tanks  from (?Kupe) and (?Darovac) have been firing selectively at  civilian targets. The center of Gornji Vakuf has also been  shelled with howitzers, mortars, and tanks." He says that "the  HVO has been destroyed, and now the Croatian Army is assuming  the role of the attacker."    An unidentified correspondent reports from Kalesija that  "fierce artillery attacks on Donje Vukovije near Tuzla airport  have continued today. The [Serb] aggressor's artillery attacks  are under way as we report and the citizens of Vukovije are in  their cellars, where they have been for days. The enemy is  firing from Mt. Majevica with howitzers, and if these intense  attacks continue, Vukovije will be razed to the ground."    Mira Salihodzic reports from Olovo that "this afternoon the  [Serb] enemy artillery has been targeting civilian areas in the  Krivaja River valley in retaliation for the losses that the  chetniks suffered in successful commando operations over the  last few days." She says that "large convoys of enemy forces  from the direction of Han Pijesak and Sokolac have been moving  hurriedly. Enemy armored-mechanized and infantry forces have  been concentrating around Olovo."</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TUSTIN;  </P> <P> MARINE FLEES BASE, ELUDES AUTHORITIES  </P> <P> An all-points bulletin was issued Tuesday for a Marine, suspected of being  under the influence of drugs, who fled from the Marine Corps Air Station at  Tustin after a fellow Marine tried to escort him to a base medical facility.  </P> <P> The Marine, whose name was withheld by military authorities, fled the base in  his car after threatening to detonate its gas tank if the other Marine moved  any closer, Marine officials said in a brief statement. The Marine reportedly  claimed that his vehicle's gas tank was wired to explode.  </P> <P> Base military police notified the California Highway Patrol, which issued the  bulletin for the Marine's arrest. A short time later, CHP officers, assisted by  the Orange County Sheriff's Department, stopped a car in El Toro that matched  the description but it was the wrong car.  </P></p>

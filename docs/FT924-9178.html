			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Chubb Corp and Sun Alliance in mutual stake sale SUN ALLIANCE and Chubb Corporation, the UK and US composite insurers, yesterday sold the bulk of their stakes in each other. Sun Alliance said the move was aimed at reducing its exposure to equities, and insurance equities in particular. Sun Alliance sold 3.4m Chubb shares in a secondary placing in the US yesterday for roughly Pounds 180m, reducing its stake in the company to roughly 5 per cent from 9 per cent. Chubb sold 47.5m Sun Alliance shares for Dollars 225m (Pounds 145m) through SG Warburg Securities, Morgan Stanley Securities and Goldman Sachs Equity Securities (UK), lowering its 9 per cent stake to 3 per cent. As a result of the sale, Chubb will have an after-tax gain of Dollars 50m in its fourth quarter earnings. Ms Gail Devlin, senior vice president at Chubb, said that the company wished to reduce its exposure to sterling investments in line with its re-duced liabilities in the currency. Both companies, which have had cross-holdings in each other since the early 1980s, emphasised that the share sales reflected financial management decisions and would not affect business relationships between the two companies. Over the past few months, Sun Alliance has been shedding its stakes in other UK composite insurers. In September, it sold a 14 per cent stake in Commercial Union for Pounds 280m and last week sold an 8 per cent in London and Manchester for Pounds 24m, reducing its exposure to insurance shares by roughly Pounds 500m. Analysts noted that Sun Alliance's investment portfolio carries an unusually heavy ratio of equities and property relative to shareholders' funds. As of December 31 1991, Sun Alliance held equity and property investments equal to 181 per cent of shareholders' funds, with most other insurance composites having ratios of 120 to 140 per cent.</p>

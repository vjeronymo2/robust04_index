			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with FDP Chairman and Foreign Minister Klaus </F> Kinkel by Carlo Gerhardt in Berlin -- live]    [Text] [Gerhardt] Klaus Kinkel, Free Democratic Party  [FDP] chairman and foreign minister, is here with me. Your  candidate, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, did not make it.  Nevertheless, Mr. Kinkel, are you satisfied with the results?    [Kinkel] Yes. First of all, we are proud of Hildegard  Hamm-Bruecher. In two ballots, she achieved results that were  far beyond the number of votes that we had; this is a great  achievement. I advised her not to run in the third ballot.  This was also approved by the vote in the FDP group. We also  voted for Mr. Herzog and, thus, we made this decision possible  -- that is, the FDP was the linchpin.    [Gerhardt] Why did you vote for Roman Herzog? What were the  reasons?    [Kinkel] Personally, I told the FDP group that, following  the coalition statement, it was correct, in my view, to decide  as we did. We need a clear, reliable course. We want to  continue the coalition with the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union. I do not think the voters would  have understood a different decision, with all respect to the  other candidates -- especially Johannes Rau, whom I like  personally very much and appreciate greatly for his work.    [Gerhardt] Johannes Rau received a number of votes from the  FDP. Was the party facing an acid test?    [Kinkel] No, never. We had a very clear result of our vote  in the group. We always act in a very democratic way. I was  happy that the majority of the deputies voted in the way that I  had asked them to, which means that after the vote in the group,  they cast their votes for Mr. Herzog in the third ballot.    [Gerhardt] Thank you very much, Mr. Kinkel.</p>

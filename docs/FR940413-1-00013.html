			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 203(i)(2) of the HCDA of 1978, a subsidized mortgage is defined by this rule as a mortgage on a project which receives assistance under any of the following programs: (1) The section 221(d)(3) Below Market Interest Rate loan program; (2) the section 236 Interest Reduction Payment program, (3) a direct loan with below market interest rates made under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, section 401 and 404(b)(3) of the Housing Act of 1950, or section 312 of the Housing Act of 1964; (4) the section 101 Rent Supplement payments program; and (5) Housing assistance payments under section 23 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 in effect before January 1, 1975, or section 8 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. Housing assistance payments under the Section 8 Rental Certificate program (24 CFR part 882, subparts A, B, C and F), and the Section 8 Rental Voucher program (24 CFR part 887) are excluded in determining whether a project is a subsidized rental housing project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unsubsidized mortgages include mortgages on projects where rents are partially or wholly subject to market determination rather than regulation by HUD. Unsubsidized projects include those projects insured under: (a) Section 207, Multifamily Rental Housing; (b) Section 213, Cooperatives; (c) Section 220, Urban Renewal; (d) Section 221(d)(3), Market Rate with Limited Dividend Mortgagors and without Rent Supplement or project-based Section 8; (e) Section 221(d)(4), Market Rate, Moderate Income Families; (f) Section 231, Elderly Housing with Profit-motivated Mortgagors; (g) Section 232, Nursing Homes and Intermediate Care Facilities with Profit-Motivated Mortgagors; (h) Section 241, Supplemental Mortgages; (i) Section 242, Hospitals with any profit motivated mortgagors and all nonprofit mortgagors with mortgages for which an insurance commitment was issued on or after June 16, 1988; and (j) Section 608, Veteran Housing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, unsubsidized mortgages are not subject to prepayment restrictions. However, there are some unsubsidized mortgages which contain moderate prepayment restrictions. Some of these mortgages contained prepayment restrictions primarily because their original non-profit mortgagors received more favorable financing terms. HUD permitted prepayment only with permission of the FHA Commissioner in an effort to prevent for-profit mortgagors from using non-profit mortgagors as agents to secure the more favorable financing terms. HUD generally granted approval to prepay upon request if no fraud was evident. Since the potential for fraud occurred at the time of origination, by the time of assignment, the need for the prepayment restriction no longer exists. Having approved prepayment liberally while the mortgages were insured, HUD has no need to continue prepayment restrictions following assignment when the rationale for the restriction no longer applies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mortgages with moderate prepayment restrictions of this type were insured under: (a) Section 221(d)(3) Market Rate with non-profit mortgagors and with no Rent Supplement or Section 8 Assistance; (b) Section 231, Housing for the Elderly with Non-profit Mortgagors (Public and Private); (c) Section 232, Nursing Homes and Intermediate Care Facilities with Non-profit Mortgagors; (d) Section 242, Hospitals with Nonprofit Mortgagors, where a commitment was issued prior to June 16, 1988; and (e) Title XI, Group Practice Facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mortgages insured under section 207/223(f), Purchase/Refinancing of Existing Multifamily Projects, also contain moderate prepayment restrictions if the commitment was issued after October 8, 1980. For these mortgages, during the five years following final endorsement for insurance, prepayment is permitted only with permission of the FHA Commissioner. The Department has used and continues to use this prepayment restriction to prevent use of the FHA-insured mortgage as bridge financing to facilitate condominium conversion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because mortgages with moderate prepayment restrictions are not subsidized mortgages, this rule would authorize HUD to sell these mortgages without FHA mortgage insurance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this proposed rule, mortgages on formerly coinsured projects without project-based Section 8 assistance could be sold without insurance because the projects covered by the mortgages were not subsidized and did not have prepayment restrictions (except for lock-out periods permitted for certain bond-financed mortgages). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sale with FHA mortgage insurance is an uncomplicated way to return mortgage ownership and servicing to the private sector. HUD's policies regarding the regulation and monitoring of insured mortgages are well developed and well known in the housing industry. More importantly, however, section 203(h)(1) of the HCDA of 1978 prohibits the Secretary from selling any mortgage held by the Secretary on any subsidized project unless the project will continue to operate in a manner which provides rental housing on terms at least as advantageous to existing and future tenants as the terms of the program under which the mortgage was insured prior to the assignment of the mortgage to the Secretary. Selling mortgages with FHA mortgage insurance ensures that existing and future tenants will continue to enjoy the benefits of the original subsidized housing program, while avoiding the need to create alternative methods of providing the tenant protections that the original subsidized housing program provided. Such alternative methods would entail complicated financing and servicing mechanisms (as in the case of a bare legal title sale) or the cooperation of the mortgagor (as in the case of deed restrictions). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, FHA mortgage insurance facilitates provision of private capital. Private investors and servicers have expressed interest in acquiring mortgages in HUD's portfolio. With mortgage insurance to offset almost all of the risk, private lenders and investors would be willing to purchase multifamily housing mortgages at a higher price, while HUD collects mortgage insurance premiums to protect the Government in the event of loss. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to 1984, HUD enjoyed a low financial default rate on mortgages sold with insurance. HUD sold 236 mortgages, with mortgage balances totalling $409.6 million, with insurance under section 207 pursuant to section 223(c) in the period between 1967 and 1984. Of these mortgages, 95 (with UPBs of $233.3 million) continue to be insured, 128 are no longer insured as a consequence of repayments, prepayments, or voluntary terminations of insurance. Only 13 were ever re-assigned to HUD, triggering the payment of a claim, a default rate of six percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP), Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, confirmed in an interview on  Thursday that he would go to a 3-day visit to Turkey on February  18. According to him, he has been invited by some Turkish  business companies and the Turkish newspaper SABBATH.    The LDP leader also announced that he had quite a number of  invitations from abroad, for instance, from Czech Republic,  Slovakia and Poland. However, he planned to pay most of his  attention to visits to Russian constituencies.    Commenting on the refusal of the Spanish government to give  him the entry visa, the LDP leader pointed out that the  government had violated human rights. He repeated that he was  to go to Spain under an invitation from the Spanish TV which had  intended to interview him on television.    According to Zhirinovskiy, the move of the Spanish  government  was due to its "pro-American" position. Zhirinovskiy said that  U.S. President Bill Clinton had wanted to meet the LDP leader  during his visit to Moscow. However, the invitation was not in  conformity with the appropriate order and was sent not  personally to Zhirinovskiy but to the whole party. That is why  just a rank-and-file LDP member went to the reception.    Zhirinovskiy said that the information that the U.S.  President had expressed no desire to meet him was  "misinformation" and that he had been waited for in the U.S.  embassy. According to the LDP leader, the person who did not  register the invitation to the reception in the appropriate  order was punished.    Zhirinovskiy also announced that British Prime Minister John  Major had met one of the LDP leaders, the State Duma's Vice  Speaker, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, during his recent visit to  Moscow. Aleksandr Vengerovskiy added that he would meet U.S.  ambassador Thomas Pickering on the very day.</p>

For months, both  London and Dublin forbore to impose a deadline for Sinn Fein to  accept December's Downing Street Declaration. The two  governments put up with Sinn Fein's obvious prevarication, its  attempts to start negotiations without renouncing violence, and  the propaganda advantage which its leader, Gerry Adams, was able  to garner while the world awaited his response.    Repeatedly it was explained that, whatever the provocations  of Mr Adams, both the Prime Minister and the Irish Taoiseach, Mr  Reynolds, were prepared to go that extra mile for peace. Now,  after the Heathrow attacks, they are generally perceived to have  failed. Sinn Fein has issued a statement demanding talks,  without accepting the precondition that the IRA should first  abandon violence.    The Downing Street Declaration was accompanied by  unspecified  threats of a security clampdown if the IRA spurned its place at  the conference table. There seemed at least an implication  that, in such an event, the Irish Republic would at last throw  its full weight behind new security measures. Now that the IRA  has called its bluff, that prospect looks remote. The Irish  have promised to tighten up their extradition law, but little  else. Internment and the right of hot pursuit across the border  do not seem to figure even remotely on the Irish agenda,  although -- as John Keegan discusses on the facing page -- joint  internment would offer the brightest prospect of ending the  terrorist campaign. Nor, it seems, are the Irish much  interested in attempts to make political progress in the absence  of Sinn Fein.    There is little we can do about any of this; the Irish are  our neighbours and we must live with the limitations of their  polity. But next time the British Government contemplates a  joint initiative with its Irish counterpart, it should remember  that while Dublin is always interested in extracting  constitutional concessions, it remains unable to deliver its own  society -- above all its judiciary -- on the key issue of  security.    The only encouraging aspect of the present impasse is that,  events at Heathrow notwithstanding, Sinn Fein and the IRA also  look weak. They are clearly divided as to how to respond to the  Declaration and concerned that it has undermined the will of a  significant proportion of its supporters, both in the Republic  and Ulster. Their statement at the weekend contained little of  the usual bombast; indeed their plea for talks without  preconditions sounded almost plaintive. They may still mount  "spectaculars" but their capacity indefinitely to maintain their  campaign must be in doubt, when many in their ranks think that a  negotiated deal is available.    The terrorist campaign is likely to persist, however, as  long  as Sinn Fein believes that British will is uncertain, that  Dublin is disinclined to tighten the security squeeze, and that  the distant prospect exists of a better deal from a British  Labour government. The only course now is to leave the  Declaration on the table for Sinn Fein to ponder, and meanwhile  press on with the security struggle against the IRA -- with or  without increased help from Dublin.</p>

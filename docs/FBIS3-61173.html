In discussing the drafts of the citizenship law of the  Republic of Latvia and other related documents in the Supreme  Council, as a draft author and referee, I had to answer a  variety of questions and proposals -- both sensible, and  ridiculous.    This is how annexionist and racist citizenship acts were  adopted during the fascist "Third Reich". According to these,  non-Aryans could not obtain citizenship in the empire, and Jews  and Gypsies were later annihilated. After the fall of this  empire, the allies declared these fascist laws to be invalid,  and in the American and Russian occupied zones, they were  invalidated retrospectively -- up until the very point of  enactment [.sup]1[/]. Thus, it is possible to adopt very  strict citizenship laws, but only within defined,  internationally accepted boundaries, which should be know.    At least those deputies in Latvia who have been elected for  a  second term will have learned as much as to know that Western  governments and experts evaluate the level of democracy of a  post-communist country, including Latvia, according to four or  five major, i.e. constitutional, laws: the constitution, which  must include a section on human rights, the election law, the  citizenship law, and the law on the legal system.    The Satversme (constitution) is finally in effect. However,  without the incorporation of the December 19, 1991  constitutional law "The rights and obligations of humans and  citizens", it remains on the same level as the pre-war "Weimar"  type of constitution, without any regulation of human rights.  Regarding the proposals by the "radicals" to revoke all laws  passed by the Supreme Council or to immediately renew all  pre-war laws, I can only respond that carrying out such  proposals would create total legal chaos and anarchy in an  already poor situation with respect to rights protection, when  neither citizens nor the rights protecting institutions will  know what the laws in effect are, and will be unable to function.    Furthermore, in such a case, all of the pre-war property  denationalization and land reform laws that were passed by the  Supreme Council will also be revoked. The pre-war owners just  might start looking around the Saeima building for resolution  proponents with pitchforks. It seems that the recently elected  representatives to the Saeima from "Fatherland and Freedom" do  not know that scores of new laws passed by the Supreme Council,  such as the laws of "accounting procedures", "the return of  property to religious organizations", our current law package on  business activities, banks, author's rights, and others, were  adopted and are in conformity with a whole string of  international laws following strict recommendations by Western  governments and experts. Included among such conventions, for  instance, are the International Labor Organization Conventions,  the Hague Convention on the Matter of Civil Process, as well as  the 1949 Geneva Convention, which the self-same "Fatherland  representatives" refer to so often. I would also recommend  taking extreme caution when correcting the constitutional law  "Rights and obligations of humans and citizens", because it has  received high grades by the United Nations and the European  Council.    According to the expertise of European Human Rights Court  Judge J. de Meyer and European Human Rights Commission member,  C. Rozakis, the December 10, 1991 constitutional law, "with  respect to the determination and protection of rights and  freedom, as provided by this document, is comparable in rights  and freedom as guaranteed by constitutional documents of the  majority of member nations in the European Parliament, and what  is collectively guaranteed within the bounds of the European  Council, as well as the European Human Rights Convention" [.sup]2[/]  .    The repeal or correction, without careful consideration, of  this law, which has received the highest evaluation by high  ranking experts of European human rights institutions, could  give the wrong impression in the United Nations and European  Council of instability in the main political laws, especially at  a time when we must become accepted into the European Council,  and cause a new and unnecessary influx of international experts  into Latvia. Naturally, the human rights law can and should be  corrected, but only with very careful consideration, so that  some of the norms would be more in line with the 1950 Rome Human  Rights Convention and its appendices on the question of specific  rights restrictions, as well as to determine the minimal rights  standard, which can never be overstepped, not even under  emergency or war conditions. It is also necessary to refine this  law to totally eliminate the removal or restriction of a  person's main constitutional rights, specifically political and  due process, without a court decision, as occurs at present. In  such a case, this law will be even more democratic than the 1950  Rome Convention with all of its appendices.    In addition, there is no system to insure overall human  rights, and political rights, in particular, in Latvia through  the help of a state administrative institution, and especially  the courts. Likewise, there is also no system to fight against  organized crime and to provide people with personal safety. This  is also a further verification of the words of Thomas Jefferson [.sup]3[/]   , i.e. that "the longevity of a law is more  important that its creation" [.sup]4[/].    But these initiatives must be focused first on the reform of  the legal system, the institution of which in Latvia, the same  as with the 1950 Rome Convention in the participating nations,  must give every person the possibility to address the courts  with complaints about the violation of their human rights. In  this respect, it is also necessary to create a special  punishment system. The Satversme courts must be created and it  must be determined what type of court would handle human rights  matters. As per the Scandinavian model, so-called  ombudsmen must also be provided [.sup]5[/], or a  state-empowered human rights institution, which would  investigate all complaints regarding human rights violations on  the part of state employees or institutions and would be  involved with the reinstatement of these rights within the  context of the administrative process, or if the case should  require, to introduce the matter to the courts.    Therefore, the human rights law must be incorporated as a  permanent part of the Satversme, since the present-day  constitutions of all European countries include a section on  human rights, which is formulated on an overall principle level,  so that it does not have to be constantly changed, and thus  guarantees the stability of the constitution. The regulation of  each specific right is being detailed in non-constitutional  laws, such as for the freedom of the press, speech,  demonstrations, awareness, etc. The constitutions of developed  nations usually also include various basic principles of  citizenship. We should do likewise.    If the Saeima deputies do not declare all Supreme Council  laws to be ineffective, then we also cannot ignore the fact that  the Republic of Latvia Citizenship Law was adopted at the first  reading. The second reading was overturned at that time by the  combined votes of the Latvian National Independence Movement  (LNIM) and the Interfront deputies. The former felt  that the law was overly liberal towards immigrants, the latter  felt it was too restrictive. This law draft cannot be ignored  also because, at that time, a great deal of attention was paid  to its analysis by United Nations and well as European Council  human rights experts, evaluating it to be more favorable than  the October 15, 1991 Supreme Council resolution "On the renewal  of Republic of Latvia citizenship rights and naturalization  basic principles".    The United Nations Center for Human Rights Group Director I.  Fall, in the report by experts, directed attention, not to the  resolution, but to a detailed analysis of the citizenship law  draft, finding that "after examining the Latvian citizenship law  draft, the mission finds it to be suitable, recalling the  overall recognized international rights principles on the  question of granting citizenship, as reflected by the  International Court decision in the Noteboma case. In accordance  with the court decision, "each sovereign nation has the right  through its legislative process to define laws on granting its  citizenship, and on the naturalization process by which  citizenship is conferred, as performed by the state institution,  in according with legislation..."[.sup]6[/].    Further, the report by experts finds: "Therefore, it cannot  be stated that Latvia is violating international rights through  the fact that it is defining how it grants  citizenship"[.sup]7[/]. That is also the final evaluation of  the citizenship law draft adopted at the first reading. At the  same time, the report also criticizes various norms in the  October 15, 1991 Supreme Council resolution.    And thus, the Saeima deputies would be acting intelligently  if they would recognize the texts of the reports by experts of  the United Nations Human Rights Center Director Ibrahim  Fall[.sup]8[/], as well as of the European Human Rights Judge  J. de Meyer and European Human Rights Commission member C.  Rozakis[.sup]9[/].    Every citizenship law, provided that it is prepared by  qualified specialists, is technically similar, with the  exception of various norms, whose goal is to accommodate it to  the political and demographic situation of each specific nation.    The so-called immigrant nations of the new world, in their  initial attempts to colonize "native" territories, created  citizenship laws that would promote immigration and form  "national melting pots". On the other hand, the nations of  Europe, through their citizenship laws, attempted to maintain  their national identities (homogeneousness). For instance, the  Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany,  in its December 15, 1977 statute on naturalization guidelines,  clearly and plainly stated that "the Federal Republic of Germany  is in no manner a country of immigrants"[.sup]10[/].    The entire discussion could be covered by these few  paragraphs. But since the Saeima factions have decided to waste  time and present five law drafts, then we may as well compare  their good and bad points. Naturally, this complicate task  should be started with the law draft submitted by the ruling  coalition with "Latvian Way" as the flagman. And especially  because the wayfarers party leader, Prime Minister  Valdis Birkavs, in the October 27 interview, officially reminded  everyone that this coalition's pre-election slogan was "the  Latvian Way is the law and order way!"    We have all already started to notice what and who this  order  applies to. Naturally, political "chickens" are counted around  election time. However, from the law drafts already  published[.sup]12[/], we can already see that even though  this ministry faction has the greatest number of lawyers, even  some who have received their legal training abroad, the Latvian  Way law draft is the weakest in terms of an abundance of ideas  and norms. The wayfarers have not realized that it  would be desirable to define in the law (as was done in the law  draft adopted at the first reading) what Latvian citizenship is,  since the qualified lawyers are unable to explain this in an  understandable manner.    I do not know why the law draft developed by the working  groups of wayfarers (who were the members?) did not  contain any sections referring to the citizenship of children  from mixed marriages, which are the most complicated and  essential sections of any national citizenship law. It is not  clear whether the Latvian Way believes that Latvians will not  have any children in the future, or are attempting to prevent  mixed marriages with foreigners. That could be done, because  during the time of Stalin's rule, there was a period during  which marriages between soviet citizens and foreigners were  completely outlawed. And, in the USSR, up until the middle of  1990, there was an unlawful practice by which marriages with  foreigners were only possible by consent of the central  committee. At one time, this author prepared the legal  foundation on which such an idiotic practice at the end of the  soviet era was repealed. The Latvian Way does not realize that  adoption, whether a citizen adopts a foreigner, or a foreigner  adopts a Latvian citizen, also has an effect on citizenship,  which is why this matter should be regulated by the citizenship  law.    In comparison with United States legislation, the Latvian  Way  lawmakers have defined the group of people who are denied  naturalization very liberally. They have practically erased  these same very few norms for possible denial by the condition:  "if determined by a court ruling". This is not how it is done in  the world. Citizenship by court proceedings (actually official  ceremonies) is only obtained in the United States. Elsewhere,  the immigration institutions, which do not even have documents  available to them, but only compromising police investigative  materials, can irrevocably deny naturalization, because it is  almost impossible to demonstrate in court that, for example, "N"  is an Italian maffia "godfather" or a member of the terrorist  "red brigade".    The United States immigration and naturalization law section  313 defining the group of persons for whom citizenship is denied  is three pages long[.sup]13[/]. Germany considers as  non-intragratable and therefore non-naturalizable, those persons  who maintain contact with their emigrant  organization[.sup]14[/]. The majority of nations will not  naturalize persons who have no legal means of support.    I have always had an objection against the fact that ever  since the republic of May 4 Supreme Council came to  power, official state acts are no longer published, specifically  --international treaties, which, following their ratification,  become a component part of every state rights norm. During the  soviet era, all USSR international treaties were properly  published in Latvian. At present, almost no Latvian  international treaty, despite my repeated protests to the  Supreme Council, are not only not published, but are very often  not even submitted to the deputies before the vote for  ratification. Thus, for instance, prior to the vote for joining  the International Monetary Fund, the text of the treaty was not  presented, and the deputies were voting as if they were bidding  in a poker game. Could the wayfarers explain how the  Latvian state administrative and rights protection institutions  will insure that our international treaties are fulfilled when  they have no access to the texts of the treaties? In pre-war  Latvia, the texts of our international treaties were published  not only in Latvian and, for instance, Russian, if the treaty  was with Russia, but also in English and French, because the  texts in these languages were submitted for filing in the League  of Nations. Now, the texts of our treaties -- according to the  existing procedure --must be translated into English and sent to  the United Nations for publication in the "United Nations Treaty  Series". Is anyone doing this?    Regardless of all of the wayfarers promises about  organizing the laws and legal system, there is no order in  the publication of law and law drafts. Thus, for example, the  publication of the Latvian Way citizenship law draft in the  Diena supplement, without any sort of warning or  explanation, gets carried away with paragraph 14, section 2.  Along with this, according to the published text, everyone has  the right to believe that the Latvian Way bill allows Russian  Army Colonel Victors Alksnis to claim Latvian citizenship, but  that thw renouncing of citizenship or its revocation is not  possible -- as in czarist times. There is more in addition to  the Latvian Way law draft circulated in the Saeima. And that is  the mess in which we find the publication of the  state acts and their bills! If the Latvian Way "while in power"  cannot even bring about any order in the publication of its law  drafts, then how will they be able to do it with more difficult  matters?    The Latvian Way bill also contains some very strange  phrases,  as, for instance, in paragraph 12: "In granting citizenship  under naturalization procedures, the number of years of  residence in Latvia should be taken into consideration". How  should it be taken into consideration, and what number of years,  if in paragraph 10, a ten year criterion is already defined?  Just as strange is the condition described in paragraph 14,  section 2, that naturalization can be restricted in the case of  a person who, "due to the committing of a serious crime, has  been sentenced to removal of freedom for a period of not less  than one year"... If this refers to a heavy crime, then a one  year sentence is not typical. Only racketeers, when caught  red-handed, sometimes receive a "suspended" sentence.    Also ridiculous is Latvian Way bill paragraph 23, which  states that the only documents which can confirm citizenship are  the Republic of Latvia citizen's passport and a "notification"  issued by the Republic of Latvia diplomatic and consulate  representatives. First of all -- why a "notification" instead of  a citizenship certificate, as issued by other countries? Second,  what confirms the citizenship of a child born in Latvia,  especially one who has no parents in whose passports such  information could be confirmed? Obviously, a child's citizenship  must be confirmed either through a birth certificate, which  would not be desirable, or a certificate of citizenship, which  could be issued to the child as soon as his citizenship is  determined.    In other words, the Latvian Way law draft leaves a poor and  superficial impression as far as norms and concepts are  concerned. It is also no surprise that each leading  wayfarer is at least a minister at the same time as a  deputy. Serving in two parliaments in three years, I am  convinced that, in order to properly perform the duties of a  deputy, it is necessary to work from early morning until far  into the night, and then it is not possible to accomplish  everything to personal satisfaction. If we want to establish a  true democracy in Latvia, a seat as a deputy in the next Saeima  must be maintained strictly apart from other state official  positions, and according to the Swedish model, a replacement  deputy must be instituted, while the deputy holds a ministry  position.    The "Fatherland and Freedom" faction (henceforth, referred  to  as FF) has been more serious in developing its  bill[.sup]15[/], although, and I hope they forgive me,  because of the modest volume of the law draft submitted -- two  pages-- I am unable to confirm an abundance of ideas or  knowledge of the subject. Apparently, FF still maintains the  dogma that whatever is inherited from pre-war Latvia is a  priori good on its own. Wake up! Latvia is not Sleeping  Beauty's fairytale castle. Seventy-four years have passed since  the citizenship law was adopted. Such primitive citizenship laws  are no longer used nor revised anywhere in the world. In England  during this period of time, eight such laws have already been  adopted. Don't pace around in place.    I cannot deny that FF, in its opinions, is attempting to act  for the good of the Latvian people. Probably, some of their  norms should not be spurned, and could be utilized in the final  variation among the norms of a consolidated, detailed law.  However, Latvian lawmakers should realize that the European  Council is expecting as an entrance fee a legally qualitative,  new, modern citizenship law. If FF is determined that, in this  millennium, it will not allow the naturalization of any  immigrant, this is not wise, neither in the eyes of the world,  nor for practical reasons.    Don't think that I am for the indulgence of foreign (even  Western) people. Quite the opposite. My motto is: "Whatever the  foreign folks are saying, don't talk along with them!" We will  be able to survive as a people, if we are smarter, more cleaver,  or at least not as dumb as the surrounding major groups of  people. Take an example from the Jews! A small group of people  cannot punch a hole through the wall of a large group of people  by using its forehead. It can get ahead through wisdom or  wealth. And that is also all that has to be said about the FF  bill.  Footnotes    1. Mann F.A. The Present Validity of Nazi Nationality Laws.  --The Law Quarterly Review, Vol. 89, 1973. Apr. P. 199.    2.

Bad laws weaken good laws.(Montesquieu: "On the length  of laws".)    The Democratic (Center) Party (D(C)P), with its name, the  loudness of its propaganda, and large monetary resources from  undeclared sources, attracts genuine interest. According to the  party's last congress and new name, it turns out that it alone  is standing up for democracy, and no one else. In addition, the  punctuation of its name, with the parenthesis, is a warm  reminder of the AC(b)P (All Union Communist (bolshevik) Party)...    Of course, according to the September 15 statement on  citizenship by the party, renewal of the 1919 law is not  acceptable, due to the above-mentioned reasons. I also cannot  agree with the DP proposal that only Latvians and Livs be given  "preference" in receiving citizenship. They should not only be  given "preference", but an absolute right to automatically  receive citizenship upon their return to the fatherland (if the  specific repatriate is not affected by the regulations  restricting these rights, as for example, participation in mass  repression). In the same manner, the Jews have stated in  paragraph 1 of the Israeli Constitution: "Every Jew has the  right to immigrate to Israel and receive Israeli  citizenship"[.sup]16[/].    I should remind you that shortly before the election, I  submitted a law draft to the Supreme Council on the absolute  rights of Latvians to receive unconditional citizenship upon  their return to the fatherland. That was adopted at the first  reading. The Satversme bill was successfully blocked, although  there was success in obtaining the vote, unique in the Supreme  Council's experience, to send the bill to the United Nations and  the European Council's human rights commission for an expert  evaluation. From the United Nations, I. Fall sent a positive  evaluation of the law draft, indicating that, according to  international practice, this would be the widely used and  accepted so-called positive discrimination. The  Europeans replied that they would discuss these questions at  their September seminar in Riga, and sent some people to attend,  who have not written a word about citizenship.    The DP bill makes provisions for language "facilitation"  (only) for "the hearing and visually impaired". But are they  speech impaired, respectively, born that way, are have they lost  the ability to speak because of a trauma? Naturally, the DP  statement also contains some rational proposals.    The Latvian National Independence Movement (LNIM)  bill is incomparably more detailed and refined than the one  "churned out" by the wayfarers. Overall, it is based  on the structures and norms of the first reading of the  citizenship law, which suffered a long and hot fight, and  includes specific terms and also a proper definition of Latvian  citizenship.    Debatable could be norm 2.1., which has been adopted from  the  1919 citizenship law. With point c) being extended to all  descendants, it could involve an unexpectedly wide circle of  people related to those who left Latvia prior to World War One,  including the descendants of the Czar's governor generals,  secret police, beat patrolmen, imperial army officers. etc.  Thus, it will be obviously acceptable to the Russian-speakers,  and "Equal Rights" will vote for it.    Controversial is the LNIM bill's paragraph 10 on dual  citizenship of emigrants, which has already been accepted in the  first reading by the Supreme Council. As I have already said, it  is not true that the refugees were "forced" into naturalization  in their host countries. If this were true, then about 20  thousand of them would not have been able to maintain only  Latvian citizenship. Naturalization, naturally, has widened the  political and social scope of Western Latvians and increased the  career opportunities in their host countries. That is also the  major, and quite understandably human reason. However, I am  opposed to dual citizenship, as are various Saeima factions and  Latvian parties. By allowing dual citizenship "in the West" and  not in the East, we are making it possible to be sued not only  by persons of Eastern origin, but even for "discrimination" of  Latvians in Latvia. By accepting a one-sided "Western" dual  citizenship, we have created a category of privileged Latvians,  who can fully enjoy the political rights of citizens, but who do  not have to perform any of the obligations of the local Latvian  citizens. This category also enjoys an additional unanticipated  advantage. Any Western Latvian, as pure as a white archangel,  free of all dirt from the soviet occupation era, flies over to  our valley of sorrows, calmly runs as a candidate in the Saeima  and even presidential elections, and if he doesn't like  something, then he forgets all his patriotism and goes back  across the ocean "to the big salary or pension". He is quite  possibly a very pleasant person, but we don't have any prior  evidence of this! And overall, a system in which the Latvian  people wake up one morning and have a president about whom they  knew nothing yesterday, is not good for anything. Any sort of  phenomenon involving privileges and "political  voyagers" should be rejected. The merits earned by  exile organizations in promoting the Latvian cause in the West  are all recognized, but it should be resolved: either here or  there. This should be the main point in selecting a candidate  for a higher national position. After all, the local people were  the ones who suffered under the occupation and repressions, and  they also managed to hold on to the Latvian land with their  flesh and bones. And the local people will always be the first  to clean out the "stables of Augeus".    By allowing dual citizenship, we are hastily creating for  ourselves a whole group of problems, the first of which are the  so-called migrating politicians. To be quite honest, first of  all, this category is mainly made up of pensioners; from this,  certain conclusions about their energy reserves can be  automatically assumed. Second, as demonstrated by Mr. Ritenis,  they have difficulties coping with the local situation. Third,  there are no high level specialists among them. All emigrants of  Latvian origin who are high level specialists are either in  Western universities or hold responsible positions in their host  country. If I am wrong, then show me a professor who has  returned to live in Latvia permanently, and I will gladly invite  him to my institute to present lectures.    Naturally, because of our 30 to 50 times lower salaries and  our enormous local problems, only the fools among them of  working age would return to Latvia. The advisors who are coming  here are either adventurers, or those who have failed in the job  market of their host country. In the beginning, I was also  occasionally taken in by them, but I no longer allow them to  present lectures in the University of Latvia International  Affairs Institute. A few enthusiasts do come along, but there  are very few of them. For the most part, young Latvian wanderers  come here to work either in Western national diplomatic or  company agencies. And I heartily thank those Latvian professors  who come here from time to time to share their expertise.    But now we have a whole string of Saeima deputies, who are  serving as ministers at the same time, and hold dual  citizenship. From a national and international legal standpoint,  their status is quite controversial. For example, in the United  States Immigration and Citizenship Law, section 101 on  "Definitions", points (21) and (22), we read that the term  "citizen" means "a person whose obligation is to maintain a  permanent loyalty to the nation"[.sup]17[/]. Similar  regulations are found in the legislation of all nations. And now  answer the question of which nation are they loyal to and whose  -- Latvia's or that other nation's -- interests are Latvia's  deputies and ministers working for, those who have foreign  citizenship crossbred with Latvian citizenship?    Furthermore, in connection with the United States  Immigration  and Citizenship Law section 349, even a citizen born in the  United States, not only naturalized, will lose citizenship if:  1)he is willingly naturalized by another nation; 2) swears  loyalty to another nation; 3) joins the military service of  another nation, if prior to doing so, he has not received  permission from the United States Secretary of State or Defense  Minister; (Latvia's Minister of Defense is a citizen of the  United States). Further on in the American law, in the same  section, point 4, there is a more restrictive norm: a citizen of  the United States will lose his citizenship if he enters into  the service of any foreign nation, even if he is or has obtained  citizenship of this foreign nation.    If such a case, the American law does not allow any  exceptions or permission by the state. Therefore, from the  standpoint of the state and legal order that was promised by the  Latvian Way, anyone may express an interest in whether or not  the United States citizenship of the honorable Mr. Pavlovskis  has been revoked, in accordance with section 349, points 3 and  4, and if not, then what does the United States stand to gain,  especially since the United States law does not provide for any  exceptions?    International rights, through the International Court of  Arbitration (The Hague) 1912 decision in the Canavero matter,  gained the so-called active or effective citizenship concept.  The court concluded that Canavero, who, according to birth by  the blood relation principle (jus sanguinis), had received  Italian citizenship, but according to the place of birth  principle (jus soli) -- Peruvian citizenship, and was factually  a citizen of Peru, because he was in reality taking advantage of  these citizenship rights, being elected senator in Peru, and as  this nation's Consul General in Holland[.sup]18[/]. Taking  the above into consideration, anyone, who is not completely  naive to matters that influence international politics, may  start to ponder a major theoretical problem -- whether Mr.  Pavlovskis, against whom I have no personal complaints, is  providing us with defense that is needed specifically by Latvia;  or is it needed by the Americans, or by the Americans when they  join with the Russians, when we are not around?    Forgive the directness, but international politics is not  some fool's game, and we know quite well from history how many  times the major powers have joined in deciding the fate of the  Baltics behind our backs. With the show of a reduction of  Russian forces in the Baltics, there has been an immediate rush  of active competition attempting to fill this void on all  levels. Only a total fool could believe it was mere  coincidence that there were candidates for presidents and  ministers in the Baltics coming from the "West" (the former  Minister of Defense of Estonia was Hain Rebass -- a Swedish  citizen). Naturally, the still unresolved "KGB sack and deputies  sitting in the sack" problem clearly shows that not just the  truest Latvians, nor strictly Latvian citizenship can guarantee  against national betrayal. Nevertheless, for the good of  Latvia's security, it is necessary to carry out all necessary  precautions to insure that national policies are created only  and uniquely in our interests. Now, what kind of organization do  we have, when two major national security structures in Latvia  -- the Defense Ministry and Internal Affairs Ministry -- have  people working alongside them who are receiving money from one  major power, and yet others who receive money from another major  power?    Finally, I would like to remind you that Latvia is a  participant of the 1930 Hague Convention "On specific questions  that affect the confliction of citizenship laws". This League of  Nations document is now on file with the United Nations  Secretary General. The 1930 Hague Convention denied dual  citizenship and supported the principle, in accordance with  which each nation determines its circle of citizens, and other  nations must respect these rights[.sup]19[/]. It would be  more correct to resolve the question of dual citizenship, if we  were to allow it, through international treaties with each  country. It would also be essential to incorporate into the  election law a permanent residence census, similar to what is  done in the United States. For example, 10 years for the right  to be elected to the Saeima, but to run for President, it would  be necessary to have received citizenship through birth here,  and to have resided permanently in Latvia for the past five or  ten years. The loyalty oath should also be instituted for Saeima  deputies and ministers.    Up to paragraph 36, overall, the LNIM bill is in accordance  with the former bill voted on at the first reading and would be  acceptable. Nevertheless, I feel that: if the LNIM are such  patriots, then the law must incorporate the principle on the  absolute rights and citizenship of persons of Latvian and Liv  origins (maintaining certain exclusionary conditions), because  applying quotas to them is not sufficient. Likewise, quotas  should not be applied to Estonians, Lithuanians and Poles,  because, for example, many repressed Lithuanians, who were not  allowed to return to Lithuania settled on the Latvian side of  border with Lithuania and have lived there for all of the  post-war years. These persons should also be eligible for the  mentioned "positive discrimination" process, since they present  no threats to the sovereignty of Latvia.    The bill of the "Harmony for Latvia" faction does not  contain  anything particularly progressive and new from that of the  Supreme Council's first reading. The only thing they did was to  introduce similar numbering for the earlier Central Committee  and Council of Ministers decisions and many old norms have been  unnecessarily crossed out, ones which the faction authors had  not understood.    The "Equal Rights" faction bill contains some legally quite  illiterate "pearls", which it would be worth mentioning. The  preface to the bill starts off by outlining the goals of the  bill written in a rather soviet propaganda style, "to establish  harmony between the Latvian state and the  inhabitants"(!), which is completely ridiculous from a legal  point of view. First of all, the subjects of a citizenship law  are "citizens", not "inhabitants", who include citizens as one  part. Therefore, a citizenship law cannot establish "harmony"  with "inhabitants", because it does not regulate questions of  "harmony" among inhabitants (who would fall under the auspices  of the "Harmony" faction, not "Equal Rights"), but questions  about who is a citizen, how is citizenship obtained, lost, what  is the citizenship of a child or adoptee, if there is a  foreigner among the parents or adoptive parents.    Further, if this is not a typographical error in the  newspaper, the equal righters made some horrible  mistakes in the bill, referencing an entire group of  international treaties, without capitalizing any of the names  and even calling them by wrong names. In addition, they are  attempting to base their concept on documents that have nothing  to do with citizenship, as for example, the International Pact  on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. It is declared in the  draft that "no one in Latvia can be arbitrarily revoked of  citizenship, nor arbitrarily denied the possibility to change  citizenship". What does "arbitrarily" mean? If such a resolution  is passed by the competent state institution (since no one else  can revoke citizenship) according to the law, will this be  "arbitrarily"? Moreover, "Equal Rights" is not correct also  because Russia, according to its law, can basically revoke  citizenship from any one of its citizens who resides in Latvia.  I can't see that anyone here would attempt to prevent someone  from changing their citizenship.    A legally absurd statement in the bill is that "the Republic  of Latvia guarantees within its territory to each and every  citizen, foreigner, stateless person (...) human rights, the  rights of citizens, observance of freedom, as mentioned in the  Satversme and in this law".    First of all, as I already stated, the purpose of a  citizenship law in any country is to regulate only citizenship,  not the rights of humans and citizens, which are regulated by a  completely different law, and this is why all of the beautifully  packaged norms on the rights of humans and citizens do not  belong in the bill. Second, the Satversme, at this time, has no  section on human and citizen rights, and thus referring to it is  pointless.    Further in paragraph 4, the declaration of the "zero"  variation, naturally, is not supported by any other faction, and  therefore there is no reason to discuss it.    In paragraph 11, the norms referring to the status of  foreigners belong in a law on foreigners, not in the Republic of  Latvia citizenship law. Likewise, the idea of "Equal Rights"  that citizenship cannot be revoked also seems unfounded. Even in  such a democratic nation as Sweden, in accordance with their  citizenship law, paragraph 7 [.sup]20[/], citizenship can be  revoked.    The rest of the bill consists of the Supreme Council's first  reading, and a crossbreeding the Russia's citizenship law norms,  not all of which are absurd, but could be useful in Latvian  legislation.    In ending, while I do not have a close friendship with  either  the LNIM nor "Equal Rights", I am forced to conclude that both  of these factions have submitted the most detailed bills. The  rest of the factions will not be convinced to vote for the  latter's law draft. I am left to conclude that the closest to  the long discussed and completed first reading of the Supreme  Council citizenship law draft, which has gained acceptance by  international experts, is the LNIM version, which should also be  used as a basis for further work.    If only for a moment, the Saeima deputies should put aside  their attitudes, already formed in the Supreme Council, whereby  they are more concerned about drowning their opponents than  about Latvian national interests, and then we could gain the  possibilities to reach a legally correct, modern citizenship  law, one which would guarantee the future of the Latvian people.

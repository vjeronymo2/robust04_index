			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Letter: On the deeper causes of the pressure on Mr Kohl Sir, I read your editorial (October 1) with great interest and in complete agreement. It is entitled 'The pressures on Mr Kohl', but implicitly it also leads the reader to understand the hidden but compelling reasons for the recent currency turmoils. Yours is a voice of reason. I deeply regret the superfluous verbal exchanges between ministers in London and in Bonn, as well as between the spokesmen of the two central banks. If both sides had obeyed the rules of the European Monetary System, as they had been devised by Giscard d'Estaing and myself more than a decade ago, namely by a timely and adequate realignment of exchange rates, the turmoil and also the squabbling would not have occurred. Helmut Schmidt, 2000 Hamburg, 62-Langenhorn, Neubergerweg 80, Germany</p>

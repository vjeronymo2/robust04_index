			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Keating takes first step to republic MR PAUL KEATING, the Australian prime minister, yesterday appointed a committee of 10 eminent public figures to draw up options for Australia's proposed transition from constitutional monarchy to republican government, Kevin Brown writes from Sydney. The appointments fulfil an undertaking given during the campaign for last month's federal election, in which the pro-republican Labor party was unexpectedly re-elected. However, Mr Keating made clear that the committee's report would have to be followed by a lengthy public debate, and probably a constitutional conference, before the change. Opinion polls suggest that between 50 and 70 per cent of voters favour a change in the constitution, which prescribes that Australia's head of state is the king or queen of Britain, the former colonial power. However, constitutional amendments require approval at a referendum by a majority of states as well as a majority of voters. In practice, this means that amendments must have overwhelming support to succeed. With this in mind, Mr Keating admitted for the first time that his campaign to transform Australia into a republic would fail if sufficiently widespread agreement could not be reached. Australia's annualised rate of inflation increased from 0.3 per cent to 1.2 per cent in the three months to the end of March.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] We are continuing to follow events in Crimea with  great attention. The Crimean Supreme Soviet is continung its  work in Simferopol. Our correspondent Yevgeniy Novikov reports.    [Novikov] At the morning session the deputies were addressed  by Viktor Mirak, deputy chairman of the Crimean Supreme Soviet.  He said that during the night of 19-20 May there was a  telephone conversation between [Crimean President] Yuriy Meshkov  and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. Viktor Mirak said that  no mutual understanding was reached during the conversation.  Therefore, Yuriy Meshkov asked that the deputies be told that at  the session it would be expedient to continue discussion of the  question of restoring the 6 May 1992 Crimean Constitution.  Meshkov, himself, is not present at the session. According to  some reports the Crimean president is on a visit to the Kuban  [Russia's Krasnodar region].    After hearing Viktor Mirak's report, the deputies began  discussing the question of restoring the Crimean Constitution.  The Crimean Tatars group announced that it would not take part  in the voting on restoration of the Crimean Constitution, giving  as their reasons that this could exacerbate relations with  Ukraine. Nevertheless, the 1992 Crimean Constitution was  restored by a majority vote. This Constitution declares the  Republic of Crimea as an autonomous state constructing its  relations with Ukraine on the basis of treaties and agreements.  This decision by the deputies caused a storm of applause from a  well-attended rally taking place outside the Crimean Supreme  Soviet building.    After a break for dinner, the session will continue its  work.    [Announcer] I would add that a message from Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk was read at the session. In the  message the head of state demanded that the Crimean deputies  should unconditionally implement the provisions of the Ukrainian  law on delimitation of powers between the bodies of state power  of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic.</p>

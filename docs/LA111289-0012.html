			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLOODY SUNDAY  </P> <P> Gerald Petievich is a longtime Secret Service agent who has written about law  enforcement from the inside, perhaps most famously in "To Live and Die in L.A."  In his new book, Earth Angels (New American Library: $17.95; 248 pp.),  Petievich pits a kind of commando unit from the LAPD against an East L.A. gang.  </P> <P> The principal antagonists are Jose Stepanovich, a detective-sergeant who heads  the small squad, and Payaso Estrada, a member of the White Fence gang, wounded  in a drive-by shooting at a wedding.  </P> <P> You have the feeling that Petievich has it all absolutely right, including the  frustrations that lead good cops to step just outside the law to get results,  and on the other side, the frustrations and the feeling of isolation from the  larger community that sustain the gangs as a way of life.  </P> <P> There are elements as well of political cynicism and betrayal, and the torn  loyalties where the Anglo and Latino worlds rub together. It's a bloody book,  and a bloody good one, a holding narrative that also has the force of further  revelation about a milieu you'd have said you knew from the newscasts.  </P> <P> Robert Crais, a Los Angeles television story editor and writer, won several  honors with his first novel, "The Monkey's Raincoat," featuring private eye  Elvis Cole. (It will date us all to learn that Cole was named for his mother's  idol.)  </P> <P> In his second outing, Stalking the Angel (Bantam: $16.95; 240 pp.), Cole is  asked to find an ancient and valuable Japanese manuscript on the samurai code  of conduct. It has been stolen from a rich Los Angeles businessman who does a  lot of trade with the Orient.  </P> <P> Cole, who is doing headstands in his office when first observed, is positioned  almost midway between the wisecracking Spenser and the compassionate Lew Archer  on the patented Private Eye Scale.  </P> <P> Honoring tradition, Crais' first-person narrative moves quickly along mean  streets, some of which are in Little Tokyo and populated by visiting yakusa,  the well-known Japanese gangsters. The businessman's dazed and neglected  daughter is in this up to her tank top, and there is a climactic tableau of  carnage up at Arrowhead.  </P> <P> Craig breaks no new ground but he does the familiar very well.  </P> <P> Steven Solomita is a former New York cab driver, which is a perfect way to get  to know the mean streets, as he indicated in a first novel, "The Twist of the  Knife," featuring a world-worn Manhattan detective named Stanley Moodrow.  Moodrow is back in Force of Nature (G. P. Putnam's Sons: $17.95; 320 pp.),  another wonderfully atmospheric and characterful novel.  </P> <P> Moodrow and a new partner are after a multiple killer whose identity is only  too well known but who can't be found. He is a malevolently clever and  psychopathic crack addict and dealer who calls himself Kubla Khan but is known  to be Levander Greenwood.  </P> <P> Black villains are not common in crime fiction, and Solomita surrounds  Greenwood with a sympathetic wife and children (whom Moodrow befriends and  protects) to establish a balance. And, indeed, Solomita creates another  balancing character, a soiled white cop who is one of Moodrow's colleagues.  Killer and cop are products of circumstance, too hateful to be sympathetic but  too comprehensible to be evil incarnate. Solomita knows his city and his  people, and he writes with both muscle and sensitivity.  </P> <P> So does the veteran Lawrence Block, whose private eye Matthew Scudder last  appeared in "When the Sacred Ginmill Closes" a couple of years ago. Scudder is  back in Out on the Cutting Edge (William Morrow: $17.95; 260 pp.), trying to  find a young woman from the Midwest who'd come to New York with aspirations to  act and who has now disappeared from her rooming house.  </P> <P> What gives a particular savor to the new book is that Scudder, established in  early works as a two-fisted, hollow-legged drinker, has nearly drunk himself to  death and is now deeply involved in Alcoholics Anonymous.  </P> <P> So is Dave Robicheaux in James Lee Burke's books. It is a new sub-theme in  crime fiction and a welcome change from the mandatory bottle of rotgut in the  bottom drawer. As a fictional theme, the fight for sobriety creates an  additional suspense: Can Scudder handle the crisis without lapsing or caving  in?  </P> <P> An AA buddy seems to have hanged himself, thus propelling Scudder further into  a plot that has a genuinely surprising, and affecting, denouement. Scudder has  written about 37 novels and two short-story collections but shows no signs  whatever of going stale: exactly the reverse.  </P> <P> The no-less-staggeringly prolific Ruth Rendell -- about 33 novels under two  names plus five collections of short stories, all since 1964 -- is back again  with The Bridesmaid (Mysterious Press: $17.95; 259 pp.). It is another of her  studies, tense and dark, of aberrational psychology, with the last horror, the  terrible revelation, drawing nearer in a mixture of fear and fascination, like  footsteps in the night.  </P> <P> Rendell, who began as a journalist, seems to know every soiled antimacassar,  every unkempt garden, every curtained window of suburban English life. Her  detailing of household routines and family relationships is as convincing as  her summoning of internal thoughts and feelings, banal or bizarre.  </P> <P> Her oddly chaste young protagonist, Philip, with his aversion to death and his  near-obsessive liking for a back-yard statue of a nude woman, is ripe to be  taken over by a kinky young actress named Senta.  </P> <P> What is characteristic of Rendell is that the comical, or perhaps the  ludicrous, is never too distant from the horror. Philip's quest for the statue,  imprudently given away to his mother's suitor, is potentially farcical. But,  like all else in Rendell's shrewd plotting, it reverberates down the days and  weeks, helping to set up the events that are to be presumed beyond the last  page.  </P> <P> The late John D. MacDonald began his public life in pulp magazines, then  appeared in paperback originals before his fame and following helped him  graduate to hard cover. Now Otto Penzler's ever-thoughtful and useful  Mysterious Press plans to bring out some of MacDonald's early paperback  originals in hard cover.  </P> <P> Key to the Suite (Mysterious Press: $17.95; 140 pp.) is one of those  examinations of corporate life that MacDonald, who died in 1986, did so well.  It was first published in 1962.  </P> <P> Floyd Hubbard is arriving at a convention to file a report that will lead to  the firing of a senior executive who has not moved with the times. The mission  is hardly a secret, and the executive's friends stage an elaborate plot to  compromise Hubbard with a call girl. An ambitious, drunken young executive gets  out of hand, and the caper backfires disastrously.  </P> <P> In hardly more than novella length, MacDonald covered a lot of ground, sketched  some potent if not deeply dimensioned characters, provided some sexual heat,  commented satirically on the industrial convention as an American tribal rite  and provided a lickety-split entertainment. Reading him again is to regret  again that his typewriter has gone silent.  </P> <P> Mystery writing, says Marie Smith, "is one area of human endeavor where women  are not second-class citizens." She notes that the recent sale of rights to  Agatha Christie's works for $93 million as fair proof that women write good  mysteries.  </P> <P> Women, as I noted in a recent Endpapers, are more and more making their sleuths  women, not men as they most often did in the past. Smith now has edited an  anthology of mystery stories by women about women: Ms. Murder (Citadel Press:  $8.95, paper; 274 pp.).  </P> <P> The time-range is from a 1918 story, "The Lover of St Lys" by F. Tennyson  Jesse, featuring Solange Fontaine, to "Three-Dot Po," by Sara Paretsky,  featuring her Chicago private investigator, V. I. Warshawski. There is a  familiar Jane Marple story by Agatha Christie, "Tape-Measure Murder." Antonia  Fraser's Jemima Shore turns up in "The Case of the Parr Children," and Prof.  Kate Fansler, the creation of Amanda Cross, tells the curious story of an  infant who toddled out of some laurel bushes into the lives of a family, in a  mystery not solved for three decades.  </P> <P> The stories are a mixed bag, as collections always are, but they reveal what  seems to have given women such a facility with crime fiction: a responsiveness  to human emotions, a familiarity with the smallest details of daily living --  and sufficient frustrations to dream up wicked schemes of retribution.  </P></p>

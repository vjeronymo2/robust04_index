			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- At the Ukrainian  Supreme Council's afternoon plenary sitting yesterday, it was  decided that as deputies had not been sufficiently informed  about their powers they should settle the issue of their labor  relations with the Supreme Council and resign from any  previously held office by 1 July. A total of 22 people's  deputies, representing various political forces, suggested that  a resolution should be considered with regard to recognizing the  powers of People's Deputies Volodymyr Hrynyov and Pavlo  Kudyukin. The draft resolution made provision for "additionally  verifying the presence of grounds for the elections in their  constituencies to be deemed invalid, and only then passing a  decision on the interim credentials commission's submission."    This resolution was voted down by a majority, with as few as  100 of the 338 deputies present having voted for it.  Representatives of the Interregional Bloc of Reforms [MBR]  proposed that a special deputies' commission should be formed to  deal with this issue. That proposal, however, was rejected, too.    The sitting also examined the draft resolution "On deputies  groups (factions) in the Supreme Council of Ukraine." Most  criticized were the articles on the numerical strength of  groups, the provision of them with technical means [to organize]  their work, the institution of groups (factions) on a regional  or territorial basis, and the possibility for a deputy to work  in several groups (factions). This resolution is to be adopted  today after the proposals are generalized.    It has already been reported that MBR cochairmen Leonid  Kuchma and Volodymyr Hrynyov are to hold a news conference at  1400 today. The venue is the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists  and Entrepreneurs, 36 Khreshchatyk, Kiev.</p>

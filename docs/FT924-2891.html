			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Amstrad shareholders set to plump for an embattled future - Michiyo Nakamoto on prospects for the computer and electronics concern's depressed share price AS shareholders cast their votes today to determine whether Amstrad is to remain in the public domain, they will probably be asking themselves what improved prospects may be in store for them as part owners of an embattled computer and electronics concern. Events over the last few days have made it highly probably that Mr Alan Sugar's bid to take Amstrad private will fail. Institutional investors who vote against the buy-out may congratulate themselves in having made a point of principal - that management buy-outs, particularly of companies where there are no independent directors on the board to advise outside shareholders, are not desireable. Individual shareholders, who could not get over a suspicion that Mr Sugar, who holds a 35 per cent stake, was buying them out on the cheap, may enjoy a sense of victory that they did not let him get away with it. By rejecting the offer, shareholders are leaving Amstrad to trade itself out of its problems, says Mr Patrick Wellington at County NatWest. But what are the chances of Amstrad's share price recovering from the 24p it closed at yesterday on the basis of a recovery in its business? Can shareholders realistically hope to obtain more than the 30p they are about to turn down? The pessimistic view is that the chances of a recovery above 30p are slim. The need for the company to shrink substantially in size, as Mr Sugar has repeatedly pointed out and others have agreed with, means there is more bad news to come, which could depress the share price further. If that happens, it could be a long climb up to 30p, as one institutional investor noted yesterday. There is a strong case for Amstrad exiting the personal computer market, which would reduce the business to about half its present size. If that happens, the company will be left with a presence in satellites, where competition is increasing, in low-end audio, where returns are mediocre and where Amstrad's re-entry has not yet made much of an impact, and in fax machines and video cassette recorders, both crowded markets. On the other hand, there is a high probability that once it has shrunk to a more appropriate size, Amstrad will return to being a profitable company. It is still the market leader in satellite dishes, a profitable sector that is growing at a rate of 1m dishes each year. This market is expected to provide Amstrad's best chance of making reasonable profits. While Amstrad has been out of the audio market for three years, it still has a recognised brand name and with its experience and knowhow could do well in a market which has provided other small low-end suppliers with a handsome income even in a recession. 'There is always going to be a market at the low end for cheaply sourced audio products,' one analyst pointed out. 'It's bread and butter stuff. They are always going to be able to make money there.' Meanwhile, the personal computer market is beginning to show signs of turning the corner. While an upturn may not come in time to save smaller suppliers like Amstrad, it might help the company to exit the market without further write-downs. Nobody is saying that climbing the path to a firmer share price will be an easy task for Amstrad. But while Mr Sugar's reputation may have been tarnished by recent events, his reputation for being a fighter does not seem to have suffered much. Although many individual and institutional shareholders oppose Mr Sugar's offer, they nevertheless do not generally want the man whose initials gave the company its name to resign. Even his staunchest critics conceed that Amstrad without Sugar would face an even more uncertain future. The consensus among Amstrad watchers is that Alan Sugar is not going to walk away and that he will make a return on capital, no matter what it takes. If that reputation holds, Amstrad's share price could start to reflect its asset value of 46p per share, as well as budding recovery hopes, which could appear as early as next year. Meanwhile, if the company decides to withdraw from the personal computer business and to hand over its continental distribution to third parties, this could help to cut costs substantially, which would throw up more cash. Shrinking the company would also mean that Amstrad is substantially overcapitalised and share capital could be released to shareholders either in the form of a special dividend or a cash payment.</p>

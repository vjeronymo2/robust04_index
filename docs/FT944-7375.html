			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Iberia strike situation 'very grim': Things were starting to look up for the airline's Hispanic strategy A two-hour stoppage by ground crews has forced Iberia to cancel 20 per cent of its 125 domestic flights today as management and unions remained in a deadlock that could ground Spain's national carrier in the days ahead and, in the medium term, reduce the company to a fraction of its present size. The management said on Wednesday that unless unions accepted a viability plan involving average pay cuts of 15 per cent for the airline's 25,000 employees, it would press ahead at the begining of next week with a decision to axe 5,200 jobs and to sell off most of its business units. Unions will stage the first of several planned demonstrations against the threatened break-up of the company on Monday, with a march through central Madrid. Mass meetings held at domestic airports heard calls to close down air traffic in Spain, and there is growing concern that wildcat disruptive action could follow if the airline's main unions lost control of the protest to extremists. 'The situation is very grim indeed,' said a middle-management executive who asked not to be named. 'The labour force is extremely angry and it is in no mood to negotiate anything unless the top level of the company is sacked first.' As it lurches into the severest crisis in its 65 years, Iberia faces the prospect of bankruptcy by next March unless it gains a Pta130bn (Pounds 635m) injection of capital. The funds can only be obtained through public subsidies, which have to be authorised by the European Commission, or by raising the necessary cash through disposals. Part of Iberia's problem is its singular failure to increase its revenue. The carrier says that although its unit costs are comparable to those of Lufthansa, it raised its revenues between 1990 and 1993 by only 7.4 per cent from Pta277bn to Pta299bn, compared with a 22.2 per cent increase by the German carrier over the same period. The lowered revenue, Iberia claims, is chiefly caused by the competition that the company faces from charter carriers which account for 80 per cent of air traffic to Spain. This competition from cut-rate operators places a heavy cost-reducing onus on Iberia. The company's costs, measured in available seat kilometres (ask), stand at 11.5 US cents - a middle-ranking level among the big European airlines, where the best performer is British Airway's 8 US cents ask. Iberia needs to curb its expenditure to BA's level if it is to take business from the charter carriers. The additional burdens of a fleet renewal programme, which Iberia is already scaling down, and of a strong investment policy in Latin America have served to increase the company's losses, estimated to total Pta44bn this year, up on earlier estimates of Pta30bn. Even if the pay cuts had been agreed with the union, Iberia would still have encountered difficulties in gaining approval from Brussels for a government recapitalisation. There is an open rift in the Commission over new guidelines on state aid to troubled carriers and seven European airlines, led by British Airways, are contesting the Commission's recent approval of a state aid package worth Dollars 3.9bn (Pounds 2.4bn) to Air France. Iberia's accumulated losses by December will have in effect wiped out a Pta120bn capital injection authorised by Brussels in 1992 on condition that no more public money be made available to the airline until 1996. Breaking up the airline would involve raising around Pta130bn by selling the shareholdings built up in Latin American carriers since 1989 and hiving off units such as handling and maintenance. The proposed sale of Iberia's 85 per cent stake in Aerolineas Argentinas and of its lesser shareholdings in Chile's Ladeco and in Venezuela's Viasa signals the end of the airline's ambitions to link Europe and the southern hemisphere. Iberia will clip its wings further with the planned disposal of its domestic subsidiaries Aviaco, Binter Canarias and Binter Mediterraneo. It is ironic that Iberia should face the loss of its Hispanic empire just as Aerolineas Argentinas, by far its biggest investment, should be starting to post an operating profit. The Latin American strategy could turn out to be a money spinner but the management's inability to control costs and its industrial relations record may kill the potential golden goose just as it starts to lay eggs.</p>

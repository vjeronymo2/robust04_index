			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Menswear retailer for sale again COLES MENSWEAR, the London retailer, is for sale for the second time in little more than a year. It was put into administrative receivership last week. The retailer traded from nine leasehold shops but only five of them, all in central London, are now trading.

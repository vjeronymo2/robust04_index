			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- Relatives of unconverted  long-term prisoners in South Korea, Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan,  in the northern half of Korea sent letters to South Korean  organizations on June 8 calling upon them to actively cooperate  in the struggle for their early repatriation to the North. The  letters were addressed to the headquarters for the promotion of  the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, the Human Rights  Committee of the National Council of Christian Churches, the Bar  Association for a Democratic Society and the Council of the  Movement of Families for Democracy.    Kim Pong-son and Kim Pong-suk, younger sisters of Kim In-so,  in their letter said their brother, who was taken prisoner while  active as a guerrilla in the area of the South side during the  war, should have been returned to his hometown right after the  ceasefire under the international law.    They charged that the South Korean authorities kept their  brother in prison for more than 30 years for the mere reason  that he refused to recant his belief and, after his release from  prison, are refusing to send him home with the far-fetched  argument that he is not a prisoner of war.    They said they, old women now in the evening of their life,  earnestly request the organizations of the South side to make  their utmost efforts for the repatriation of their brother to  the North where his children, family and relatives are waiting  for him, while he can walk on his own feet.    Paek Chong-kwon, a nephew of Ham Se-hwan, in his letter said  the fact that his uncle requested various organizations to  cooperate in his repatriation, not yielding his will despite  harsh persecutions, tells that he does not want to live in South  Korea but earnestly hopes to return to his hometown where his  flesh and blood live.    Recalling that the South Korean Red Cross side took a  negative attitude by refusing the just demand of the DPRK Red  Cross society for his repatriation with the unreasonable  allegation that he could not be "regarded as a prisoner of war"  and he "has got citizenship", the letter says this runs counter  to the spirit of the Red Cross.    He expressed the belief that the organizations would make  positive efforts to realize the repatriation of his uncle  without fail.</p>

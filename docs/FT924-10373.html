			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Markets: Private lives and public money - London Markets 'As Noel Coward might have said, cheap money is not as potent as cheap music.' Norman Lamont, Mansion House speech The Scene is the terrace of a grand building in the City of London. It is evening. Tall French windows at the back open on to a hall where - from the sounds that drift out - a banquet is in progress. Elyot and Amanda enter from the rear; he is wearing tails, she an evening dress. Elyot: Something dreadfully depressing about bankers en masse, I always think. Amanda: Rather vulgar to be so openly unhappy. Elyot: One should keep one's sorrows to oneself. Unless one can find someone else to blame for them, of course. Amanda: That's what I said to Norman only the other day. You're not jealous that we're still chums, are you darling? Elyot: Baffled, rather. No one else admits to being a friend of his, except Robin. They bring out the worst in each other. Amanda: Well, I think it's a match made in heaven. Just think of all those billets-doux they'll be sending to each other now they've decided to come clean with the world. Elyot: Too common: 'Dearest heart, inflation's doing nicely, don't you think?' 'Yes, sweetheart, whatever you say.' Amanda: And: 'What a dear little forecast]' They laugh conspiratorially. From the orchestra in the hall behind, we hear the opening bars of 'M3 becomes you'. Amanda and Elyot hum along, before breaking off and looking guiltily at each other. Elyot: Extraordinary how potent cheap money is. Amanda: Not as potent as cheap music. They drift into each others' arms and start dancing slowly. The lights dim, but we can still see them dancing in the gloom. On the other side of the stage, the lights rise, revealing Greg, a chisel-featured man in his mid-40s wearing a silk dressing gown, with the word TOMKINS embroidered on the pocket. He is sitting in an armchair, talking on the telephone. Greg: Well, James, I think it's foolish of you to get so worked up about it. Ranks Hovis McDougall - what a pretentious name] It's only a little bread company, after all. (Pauses, to allow the other person to reply.) Oh, don't be like this, don't be like this. You never used to do this when we were together all those years ago. (Pause, during which Greg becomes visibly irritated.) No I don't think a one-for-two rights issue is 'going it'. Yes, I know our shares fell 19 per cent on the news. Well, if that's the way you feel, I'm not going to argue any more. But I'd advise you to think twice about upping the stakes. My offer's quite breathtaking enough - and I'm young enough to enjoy sorting out a bakery. (Pauses.) Yes, of course you taught me everything I know. But really, you're far too experienced and shrewd to be anything other than philosophical about it. Now, if I may make a suggestion, isn't it time you thought again about ICI? This week's results were simply ghastly, and I have a strange foreboding about the plan to split the company. If I were you . . . (His voice trails off as he disappears again into the gloom and the lights pick up Elyot and Amanda on the other side of the stage. The music stops and they drift apart, clapping soundlessly.) Elyot: There's something wild about you tonight, something strained. Amanda: Wild] Oh, Elyot, I've never felt less wild in my life. A little strained, I grant you, but that's the current atmosphere; you can't expect anything else. Devaluation is a very over-rated amusement. Elyot: You say that because you had a ghastly experience before. Amanda: There you go again. Elyot: It couldn't fail to embitter you a little. Amanda: The devaluation wasn't such a ghastly experience really; I hummed in my bath for days. It was afterwards that was so awful. Elyot: Well, I intend to make you forget about the economy altogether. Amanda: How can I when I keep reading all those headlines? (She picks up an imaginary newspaper and pretends to read from it.) 'British Steel to cut production 20 per cent. CBI reports further drop in business confidence. Manufacturing Industry to cut 25,000 jobs a month for rest of year. Lack of orders limits output.' Elyot: Very flat, demand. (A speech has started in the hall inside. We start to hear it more distinctly, and Elyot and Amanda pause to listen to it.) Speech: Economic confidence is an elusive quality; it cannot simply be drawn like a rabbit from a conjurer's hat. I may be dressed as a magician, but I am, in fact, just the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Amanda: Worse luck] Speech: In judging whether we are on track to meet our inflation objective, we will take account of the behaviour of the monetary aggregates, narrow and broad; of asset prices, particularly house prices; other indicators of inflationary pressure; and of course, the exchange rate. Prospective, not current, inflation will be our guide. We are moving from a largely rules-based system to one that is more discretionary. The need for judgment is obviously greater outside the ERM, which makes it all the more important that it is exercised in a consistent way. Elyot: Consistent? Or consistently political? Amanda: Monetary policy is no use unless it is wise, and stern, and undramatic. Something steady and stable, to smooth your nerves when you're over-excited. Something tremendously Germanic, unflurried by scenes and jealousies. That's what I want, what I've always wanted really. Oh my dear, I do hope it's not going to be dull for you. Elyot: After the last few weeks, dullness is all I crave. We'd better go back in, or we'll miss the Governor's speech. They leave through the windows. The orchestra strikes up 'Somewhere over the Rainbow'. THE CURTAIN FALLS</p>

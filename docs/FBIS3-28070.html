			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday, North Korea sent a statement to the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] saying it rejected  full-scope [chonmyon] inspections, as reported by Japan's NHK  Broadcast in a Berlin-datelined story.    By sending its 31 January statement to the IAEA saying that  it will withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty unless  the United States stops its scheme to crush the Pyongyang side,  North Korea stated that the fact that the United States and the  IAEA urge North Korea to receive full-scope inspections of its  nuclear facilities violates the spirit of the North Korea-U.S.  agreement, and revealed that it will not negotiate further with  the IAEA unless the agreement mapped out in New York is kept.    Responding to this, IAEA spokesman Meyer said the IAEA does  not regard a protest document sent by North Korea as an official  answer and that the IAEA is still waiting for North Korea's  official response to its specification inquiring about the place  and schedule for nuclear inspections.</p>

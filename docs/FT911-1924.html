			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Bush acts to beat N America trade pact opponents THE BUSH Administration yesterday sought to shatter opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) by sending to Congress a sweeping set of promises to satisfy concerns over US job losses and the environment. The Administration's 'action plan' was released one month before Congress must vote if it is to defeat President Bush's request for 'fast track' trade authority. The 'fast track' gives him a free hand to negotiate amendment-free treaties in the Uruguay Round, and with Mexico and Canada. 'Fast track lets us open up new markets and new opportunities,' President Bush told the Society of American Business Editors and Writers yesterday. 'Fast track is another term for good faith. It means we will not tinker with trade agreements worked out by our negotiators and their foreign counterparts.' Good faith is what the President is striving to win from a Congress that has often seen its tough trade laws ignored by the administration. Informal polls have shown widespread uncertainty in both houses on whether to trust the administration to negotiate a pact which would protect US workers, health and safety rules, and the environment. The AFL-CIO, the nation's biggest labour organisation and a leading Nafta opponent, yesterday released the first national poll on the proposed pact. It found 56 per cent of the American public believing that a US-Mexico pact would result in job losses and 72 per cent opposed to granting 'fast-track' authority. Until yesterday, the anti-'fast track' coalition - environmentalists, farm, labour and consumer groups, and textile and apparel makers, was thought to be gaining in the House but to be behind in the Senate. A majority in either house can deny the president 'fast-track' authority. The 'action plan' contains concessions which may well satisfy many of the undecided. It promises to consider long transitions before cutting tariffs on import-sensitive products and to negotiate mechanisms which would re-instate the tariffs if imports surge. It pledges strict, clear rules of origin, especially for assembled automotive products; an 'adequately funded' retraining programme for those that lose jobs because of Nafta; negotiation of joint action plans with Mexico on labour issues, including improved working conditions, child labour law enforcement, and health and safety measures, to be implemented in parallel with Nafta negotiations. Environmentalists are promised positions on trade policy advisory committees; a bi-national programme of co-operation on environmental issues; and a plan to address air and water pollution, hazardous wastes, chemical spills, pesticides and enforcement. Sen Max Baucus, Senate trade sub-committee chairman, yesterday said the plan went 'a long way' to address congressional concerns. But a system still had to be devised for monitoring and enforcing Mexico's environmental pledges.</p>

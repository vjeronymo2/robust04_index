			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> A SAVVY 'FREE AGENT FOR GOD';  </P> <P> THE REV. LOUIS SHELDON IS PART FIERY PREACHER, PART COOL-HEADED LOBBYIST.  OPPONENTS QUESTION HIS RELIGIOUS SUPPORT BUT DON'T DENY HIS POLITICAL CLOUT.  </P> <P> At stake was the way public schoolchildren would be taught the origins of life,  and lobbyist Louis P. Sheldon was playing the game of secular politics at the  furious pace that has made him both feared and revered.  </P> <P> With a dogged diligence, he grabbed a front-row seat at a recent State Board of  Education meeting and set out to work the crowd. State educators on a  first-name basis with "Reverend Lou" got a quick lesson on the "danger" of  teaching evolution as dogma. Newcomers to the debate got his Anaheim business  card. Media crews got quick and quotable "sound bites."  </P> <P> God got nary a mention.  </P> <P> But a few hours later, fresh off a chartered flight to Ventura, Sheldon the  lobbyist became Sheldon the visiting preacher. Gone was the cool Capitol tone  as Sheldon quoted the Book of Chronicles in fiery indignation, urging  churchgoers to stand up and shout against homosexuality, abortion and other  modern-day "evils."  </P> <P> At once preacher and political player, the scrappy, 55-year-old Anaheim  resident has parlayed this ability to adapt his message to fit his varying  audiences -- to temper tone and style at a hallelujah's notice -- into a  growing visibility around the state as a self-proclaimed spokesman for the  religious right.  </P> <P> Today, riding a crest of national publicity from three startling election  victories by opponents of gay rights in California, Sheldon is basking in a new  prominence that seems to assure that he can no longer be dismissed by his  detractors as merely an Orange County religious gadfly.  </P> <P> Sheldon's roles have been many over the last three decades: small-town Midwest  pastor; alienated rabble-rouser in the mainline Presbyterian church; North  Dakota congressional aide and Delaware gubernatorial campaign worker; Christian  educator and aide to televangelist Pat Robertson; would-be businessman, and  failed investor.  </P> <P> But Sheldon now seems to have found his most influential niche, much to the  chagrin of a growing chorus of critics who say that his power may be more  illusion than reality.  </P> <P> Sheldon's assertion of "representing" about 6,500 churches and thousands of  other individuals in the state's religious community may well be exaggerated,  according to interviews with both religious allies and opponents.  </P> <P> So, too, may be the role he contends he played in conservative-religious  victories, such as those over gay rights advocates at the polls on Nov. 7 in  Irvine, San Francisco and Concord.  </P> <P> Yet even his staunchest critics acknowledge that, if success as a lobbyist  means staking out a spot in the public eye, gaining access to people with power  and creating at least the appearance of influence, Sheldon is nothing if not  successful.  </P> <P> "This is a man who does a tremendous job of spreading hatred and fear to  further his own career," said Leonard Graff of the San Francisco-based National  Gay Rights Advocates. "He's very dangerous."  </P> <P> Sheldon says he has no aspirations to seeking elected office or even a formal  position in the religious Establishment, saying that such a career route would  be too stifling for the opinionated minister.  </P> <P> "It's not me, I don't think," Sheldon says. "I'd have to become more cautious,  more diplomatic." No, the role of free-agent lobbyist for God is "my calling,"  says the bespectacled man in the oft-rumpled suit who rushes through Sacramento  crosswalks with a loaded briefcase caddy in tow.  </P> <P> Among the targets of Sheldon's wrath are homosexuals, whom he contends are  attacking the "heterosexual ethic" by imposing their "chosen life style" on  others; "anti-religious" public educators, who he says corrupt young people,  contradict the Bible and promote promiscuity; pro-choice "murderers," and  "sleaze" pornographers and immoral gamblers who he says tear away at the fiber  of society.  </P> <P> Sporadic Success  </P> <P> In city halls and election campaigns from San Francisco to Santa Ana and from  Riverside to Irvine, Sheldon has lashed out with sporadic success against these  perceived threats and others, all in the name of God and in his own small,  7-year-old nonprofit organization.  </P> <P> But myriad critics, fearing the potential statewide clout of Sheldon and his  Traditional Values Coalition of Anaheim, question whether Sheldon represents  anything but himself.  </P> <P> "A media creation," some say of the man who just last week was described in a  USA Today profile as "a prophet" and a "California Falwell."  </P> <P> A savvy strategist, others suggest, with a sharp sense of timing and a mastery  of the media, but with no real constituency or broad financial backing.  </P> <P> Indeed, as the evangelist has reached new heights of exposure, opponents have  in turn stepped up their charges of deception, misrepresentation and bigotry  against him.  </P> <P> Said state school Supt. Bill Honig: "He takes the most volatile and extreme  issues and uses them to arouse people's emotions. And until very recently, I  think he's pulled the wool over a lot of people's eyes."  </P> <P> It is the public persona of Lou Sheldon that grates on critics such as Honig  and Graff, the singular and unwavering image of a fervent Bible-thumper, a  modern-day Billy Sunday.  </P> <P> But the private Sheldon offers a more enigmatic portrait.  </P> <P> He was born in 1934 in Washington, D.C., to a Protestant father and an Orthodox  Jewish mother. But he shunned religion until age 16, he says, when he became a  "born-again" Christian, persuaded to go to church by a local wino who told him:  " 'What you need is some old-fashioned religion.' "  </P> <P> He is an ordained minister trained at Princeton Theological Seminary. But he  has intermittently moved in and out of politics over the last three decades and  now, by his own choosing, has no congregation of his own.  </P> <P> Lives Modestly  </P> <P> He appears to wield power and prestige in Sacramento. But, in an age when some  high-profile religious figures have struck it rich and staked out empires, he  has a staff of just 10 paid and volunteer employees, including his 99-year-old  mother-in-law, his wife, Beverly, and one of his four children. And he lives  modestly in an older, two-story Anaheim house on a reported $21,000 annual  income, driving a 1984 Pontiac and staying with friends or relatives during his  frequent lobbying trips to the capital.  </P> <P> He professes "no interest in wins and losses." But he nonetheless claims credit  that even some allies say he doesn't fully deserve, and he readily lists his  "coalition's accomplishments" in his literature.  </P> <P> Among the legislation he says he has influenced: a measure clarifying child  abuse laws to say that parents can spank a child as a means of discipline;  another encouraging that sexual abstinence be included in school curricula; one  strengthening the criminal definitions of obscenity and pornography, and Gov.  Deukmejian's veto of a bill that would have provided school-based pregnancy  testing, abortion referrals and contraceptives to students.  </P> <P> Sheldon's scorn has been vented most fiercely of late against homosexuality, an  issue that he says will soon surpass abortion as the most pressing moral battle  for the religious community.  </P> <P> Declaring "open warfare," he says homosexuality is an immoral but chosen and  curable illness, like alcoholism or drug abuse. He accuses gays of trying to  subvert the "heterosexual ethic" by flaunting their "promiscuity," by promoting  homosexuality in the schools through gay counseling programs, and by seeking  "special rights" under the law. And he suggests that AIDS victims be segregated  in "cities of refuge" for the good of themselves and others.  </P> <P> "I'm not a gay basher," Sheldon insists. "I'm not homophobic. I feel sorry for  a guy who can't lay with a woman." And he answers the mocking charges from gay  activists who say his seeming obsession with their lives must mean that he is a  latent homosexual: "I know what gets my juices going. I know what turns me on.  I know my sexual identity."  </P> <P> Public Tactics  </P> <P> The public tactics Sheldon uses to make his points are often explosive.  </P> <P> He demanded that the city of Santa Ana withdraw permits for this fall's Gay  Pride Festival at a public park and, when they refused, published their home  addresses and helped mount an ongoing recall campaign against City Council  members who defied him.  </P> <P> And through his emotional newsletters, he has been able on occasion to muster  hundreds of outraged protesters at public meetings and avalanches of letters to  government officials -- enough a few years ago, for example, to help bury a  proposal by the state Fair Employment and Housing Commission making religious  institutions subject to certain anti-discrimination hiring measures.  </P> <P> "He made the commission very aware, very quickly, that a large number of people  were against (the proposal), and that certainly had something to do with it  being killed," recalled Steven Owyang, an aide to the commission.  </P> <P> The response from critics has been swift and similarly forceful.  </P> <P> Sheldon's Anaheim home has been picketed. He has been spat at, encircled by a  chain of counterprotesters at the Gay Pride Festival in Santa Ana, and burned  in effigy. He is Public Enemy No. 1 in California among a host of civil rights  and liberal-oriented interest groups that accuse him of religious hysteria.  </P> <P> But Sheldon appears unfazed, saying that even negative exposure is better than  none at all.  </P> <P> "I just make sure they spell my name right," he said. "I don't care what other  people say. I'm no paper tiger. . . . I am representing people who want to save  the Judeo-Christian ethic. It's a way of life that's at stake here."  </P> <P> Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), an ally, says that "Lou Sheldon is in  the forefront of a political struggle to say that the First Amendment does not  guarantee freedom from religion, but freedom of religion."  </P> <P> Sheldon's organization is small by Sacramento lobbying standards, but its  financial course parallels his recent growth in exposure: Donations to his  Anaheim coalition and his other nonprofit creation, the American Liberties  Institute, are up 154% since 1985 to about $286,000 last year, state records  show.  </P> <P> Early Support  </P> <P> Sheldon credits retired food company executive Herbert B. Leo, an Orange County  civic booster sometimes called "Mr. Anaheim," with early organizational and  financial support. Over the last five years, Leo has given Sheldon more than  $250,000.  </P> <P> Leo serves as chairman of the board of both the Traditional Values Coalition  and the American Liberties Institute, and says he stays in almost daily contact  with Sheldon.  </P> <P> "I stand upon the shoulders of Herb Leo," Sheldon said.  </P> <P> "If it wasn't for Herb Leo," Beverly Sheldon agrees, "God might have done it  another way."  </P> <P> Sheldon and Leo also sought to use their mutual interest in religious issues to  turn a profit in 1983, but that proved a flop. Both men invested in a a  "Christian" financial institution called the New City Bank of Orange, set up to  give loans to churches. But after some non-church loans went bad, the bank  failed. Leo says he lost about $750,000 and Sheldon lost $25,000.  </P> <P> Only a few years earlier, Sheldon had lost more than $40,000 on a failed  housing redevelopment and resale project in Watts.  </P> <P> His coalition, however, shows no signs of ill health. Beyond the recent  financial growth of his organization, further testimony to Sheldon's appearance  of influence is that several Southland politicians contacted for this article  declined to talk about him for fear of a political backlash.  </P> <P> "I've already survived this guy," said one elected official in Orange County  who tangled with Sheldon recently. "He's gone for now."  </P> <P> Said state Sen. Newton Russell (R-Glendale), a Sheldon ally who has worked with  him to pass a law encouraging student abstinence: "Sure, he's written off by  some people as a preachy, goody-two-shoes person, and he ruffles a lot of  feathers.  </P> <P> "But I think he represents a legitimate constituency. And he's a tireless  worker and gets the job done probably more effectively than anyone else on our  side of these traditional issues."  </P> <P> One key to Sheldon's success has been his mastery of a bit of advice given to  him in his days as a self-described political "greenhorn."  </P> <P> The year was 1985, the forum a state Assembly committee hearing on an  ultimately unsuccessful bill that would have outlawed workplace bias against  gays.  </P> <P> Sheldon had just finished testifying against the bill -- railing in fiery  rhetoric on the sin of homosexuality and the scourge of AIDS -- when he was  cornered by liberal panel member Rep. Dick Floyd (D-Carson).  </P> <P> "Don't tell us what the Bible says -- we don't want to hear about that," the  Democratic assemblyman told Sheldon sternly. "Tell us about public policy."  </P> <P> A Lesson Learned  </P> <P> The message hit home. By his own acknowledgement, Sheldon can still be as  abrasive and outspoken as ever -- the same person who caused a stir back in  high school when he tried to start a Bible class; who did the same in North  Dakota in the 1960s when he started a governor's prayer breakfast, and who left  the mainline United Presbyterian Church in 1980 over disagreement about his  outspoken style.  </P> <P> "I'm not the kind of person who can go into a room and sit quietly," Sheldon  said.  </P> <P> But increasingly over the years, Sheldon has learned to shape his pitch to fit  the audience, offering more subdued political input to legislators, quotable  commentary to the media and old-time preaching to his religious audiences.  </P> <P> "What makes him effective," suggests state Board of Education member Joe Stein,  a frequent target of Sheldon's lobbying, "is what makes any salesperson  effective -- he's keeping at you aggressively with a definite message, he seems  to have some backing, and he's very visible."  </P> <P> Opponents, however, assert that Sheldon's effectiveness is largely an illusion.  </P> <P> The criticism comes not just from such traditional opponents as pro-choice and  gay rights activists, but also from conservative religious figures.  </P> <P> Dwight Burchett, a Sacramento pastor and a leader of the California branch of  the National Assn. of Evangelicals, said: "You have to honor the guy for his  energy, but he just doesn't have the bona fide organization or the support that  he claims. He's ego-motivated -- it's a hype approach that he puts in high  gear."  </P> <P> Sheldon refuses to identify the 6,500 churches that he says his coalition  represents. But he acknowledged that many of those he counts as supporters may  only be receiving his newsletter free of cost, without giving money or taking  an active role in the Traditional Values Coalition.  </P> <P> "He makes it sound like he's speaking for all of us (on the  conservative-religious right)," said Leslie Dutton, head of the Santa  Monica-based California Pro-Family Coalition, a Santa Monica group that opposes  homosexuality and pornography, "and that's simply erroneous."  </P> <P> "The way he does business is to wait for a movement to get started, run along  with it and pop up and take credit," Dutton charged. "He's out for the  headlines."  </P> <P> Indeed, Sheldon's high visibility in part got him headlines around the country  earlier this month for having led pressure from the religious right against the  state Board of Education, prompting the board to tone down language in a  curriculum statement that was seen as hostile to the teaching of creationism.  </P> <P> "Censorship." "First Amendment rights." "Freedom and flexibility." Sheldon  pushed the phrases over and over before the television cameras, in lobbying  sessions and instant mailers during several days of debate over the state's  position on the teaching of evolution.  </P> <P> And he again demonstrated his media know-how when it came time to assess the  impact of this month's three electoral defeats of gay rights causes around  California.  </P> <P> After Irvine residents voted in November to repeal the city's 15-month-old ban  on discrimination against gays, Sheldon -- despite having no official role in  the campaign, moved quickly. He wanted to set up a press conference to hail the  victory over "special rights" for a "chosen life style." But local organizers  of the Irvine campaign wanted to wait a few days and and savor the win,  annoying Sheldon.  </P> <P> Sheldon met the press the day after the vote anyway -- without the Irvine  campaigners. And when his remarks showed up prominently in newspapers around  the state and country, it was the Irvine organizers' turn to be annoyed.  </P> <P> The gay rights vote came just two days before the Board of Education debate on  evolution, swamping Sheldon with more than two dozen phone calls from reporters  nationwide who wanted to know about both issues. Even the usually exuberant  Sheldon seemed dazed. "This is too much," he said at one point, shaking his  head between phone calls.  </P> <P> Yet, he says he has no interest in slowing down.  </P> <P> Sheldon says he wants to expand his lobbying and step up his attacks on the  "homosexual agenda," in part by organizing a national conference on  homosexuality next year in Washington.  </P> <P> He is also working on his first book, a look at the "ungagging" of churches  through political activism. His long-term goal is to expand his coalition to  half a million supporters and launch a statewide initiative to dramatically  reorganize the public schools, giving local districts more power to put into  practice their own educational values.  </P> <P> Such a campaign would likely put to the test Sheldon's assertion of deep  support among the religious right, a claim that Orange County political  consultant Harvey Englander likens to a poker game.  </P> <P> "He's been playing like he's got a strong hand," Englander said. "But at some  point, someone's going to call him, and he's either going to produce thousands  of people to walk the precincts and fill the voting booths, or he's going to  have to fold and walk away from the table. It'll be interesting to see."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Mark Pinsky, John Dart and Victor Zonana contributed to  this story. Staffer Dan Crump provided research.  </P></p>

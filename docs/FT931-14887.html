			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hampson edges ahead to Pounds 1.69m PROFITS before tax at Hampson Industries, the precision engineering, aluminium and home products group, edged up in the first half, but Mr John Wardle, the chairman, yesterday warned shareholders to expect low dividend payments. In the six months to end-September, pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.69m, compared with Pounds 1.62m, on turnover down from Pounds 37.1m to Pounds 35.4m. Fully diluted earnings per share came out at 1.5p (1.45p). However, apart from the 4 per cent profit increase, there is, Mr Wardle said, 'very little other good news to communicate.' As 'a precautionary measure', Hampson is cutting back its interim dividend from 0.6p to 0.4p. 'As the interim dividend is only slightly over a quarter of the total dividends paid for the last two years, this should be taken as an indication that a maintained final dividend can by no means be taken for granted,' Mr Wardle said. Last September, announcing a final 1991-92 dividend of 1.773p, Mr Wardle said that this year the dividend would not be cut. The change in policy stems from determination to build up retained profits. This is related to the need for more investment, especially in Hampson's precision engineering business. Precision engineering's contribution to group operating profits has climbed to 60 per cent from 46 per cent at the end of the 1990-91 financial year. The strength of the business, where there is a record order book for aircraft maintenance, has led to the need for improved production facilities. Hampson's problems, which have contributed to the caution on dividend policy, relate rather to the other parts of the business. The sterling devaluation gave margins in the furniture business a wounding blow because of the use of imported supplies: the pain will not be eased until the products have been redesigned and their materials re-sourced. Double-glazing activities, given the depression in the construction industry, are at best sluggish. Aluminium prices have been low, but they improved in the second half.</p>

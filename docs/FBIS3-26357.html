			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liu Hong (0491 4767)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 31 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- The reform  of the separate taxation system, which is to be implemented from  1 January this year, indicates that China's financial reform has  entered a new track of operation.    Undoubtedly, the purpose of introducing the separate  taxation  system is to establish a financial system suited to the market  economic system and to arouse the enthusiasm of both the center  and localities.    However, we cannot evade the reality that implementation of  the separate taxation system will have both positive and  negative effects. Bai Jingming, associate professor of the  Financial Science Research Institute under the Finance Ministry  and doctor of economics, said: The existing contract system  implemented by localities has proved in practice to have more  defects than advantages. It has resulted in departmentalism and  economic barriers erected between regions and has weakened the  unity and complementarity of macroeconomic policies between  central and local governments. But the separate taxation system  can bring about the following benefits to economic development.    First, the separate taxation system will enable central  revenue to become a steadily increasing mechanism and enhance  the capability of macroeconomic regulation and control of the  central government. Second, the separate taxation system will  enable the government at all levels to show more concern for  cultivating tax sources, consciously broaden sources of taxes  within the scope permitted by law and policies, and not rely on  tax exemptions to develop the economy. Third, the separate  taxation system will speed up the establishment and perfection  of China's financial budgetary system at all levels, enhance the  budgetary binding mechanism, and gradually increase the  efficiency of spending.    Dr Bai Jingming pointed out at the same time: Implementation  of the separate taxation system in the early period is likely to  yield the following negative effects:    First, the status quo of the interest structure remains  unchanged during the initial stage of financial reform and no  major changes will be effected in the behavior of local  governments. However, the center will take over duties imposed  on cigarette and liquor, which are high and profitable, a move  which will easily dampen the enthusiasm of localities.    Second, if 1993 is taken as the base period for central  finance to check and ratify local tax return, the sharp increase  in the previous year will relatively slow down this year's tax  revenue and increase pressure on the balance of this year's  finance. If deficits grow for this reason, it will inevitably  increase the issue of treasury bonds or even exert pressure on  inflation.    Third, following implementation of the separate taxation  system, local governments will vigorously work out measures to  increase revenue and bargain with the central government on the  establishment of the local taxation system. Meanwhile, as the  existing separate taxation system has not yet smashed the  structure which determines the distribution of income according  to the relationships of administrative subordination, local  governments will continue to adopt measures to protect local  interests.    Fourth, following the exercise of financial management at  different levels, the right to spending of local governments  will increase. As a result, local finance will allocate funds  to profitable trades and make less investment in infrastructure,  education, and science and technology.    Fifth, as the separate taxation system has not touched the  structure of regional distribution, the previous interests are  still taken as the base figure of tax return. This results in  uneven regional development. Hence, it will be difficult to  narrow the wide gap between the eastern and western regions  within a short period.    Financial experts hold that ultimate implementation of  financial reform will be an arduous course. To ensure that the  reform will be introduced smoothly and not go out of shape,  there are still great difficulties ahead. The separate taxation  system is in fact a division of interests, which will bring  about friction between the center and localities, if not  properly handled. Hence, it is a pressing task at the moment to  standardize and legalize the transfer payment system as quickly  as possible. Moreover, we should establish the separate  taxation system below the provincial level as early as possible  to ensure the integrity of the system.</p>

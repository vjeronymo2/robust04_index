			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Pentos sells Athena to management team for Pounds 1.9m Pentos, the specialist retailing group, has sold the publishing, manufacturing and wholesaling businesses of Athena International to a management team backed by Henderson Venture Managers for a maximum of Pounds 1.9m. The three-person management buy-in team is led by Mr David Clipsham who has had a career in marketing and creative-led businesses, including periods with both the Athena retail and publishing businesses as well as being a divisional director of WH Smith. Athena's operations involve the design, manufacture, sales and distribution of graphic arts printed products including greeting cards, postcards, posters and prints under the Athena brand name, together with frames and framed products under the KwikFrame and Montana brands. The company, which has turnover of about Pounds 12m and exports some 15 per cent of sales, will continue to supply the Athena retail chain which accounts for about one third of its business. It employs between 100 and 150 people. Mr Clipsham said the new management team intends to boost the group's overseas sales and take advantage of its new independence to develop domestic sales by broadening both the product range and the customer base. The other two members of the management buy-in team are Mr Paul Bendit, finance director, and Ms Linda Worsfold, publishing director.</p>

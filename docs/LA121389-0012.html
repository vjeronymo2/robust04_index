			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN OUTLINES PLAN TO PRESERVE SOUTH PACIFIC MARINE LIFE  </P> <P> Japan will temporarily halt its drift-net fishing in the South Pacific by 1992  if steps have not been taken by then to preserve marine life in the region, the  Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Environmentalists and South Pacific nations have criticized Japan and Taiwan  for using giant drift nets in the region. The nets sweep as much as 30 miles of  ocean, and critics say they kill virtually all fish and marine animals that  swim into them.  </P> <P> "In the South Pacific we will stop, at least temporarily, the catching of  albacore tuna by an agreed date, with the expectation that when  management-control measures for the preservation of marine resources are agreed  upon, it will be reopened," Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said.  </P> <P> Watanabe did not say when Japan would halt the practice, but another Foreign  Ministry official said it would be by 1992.  </P> <P> Kyodo News Service said Japanese and U.S. representatives at the United Nations  have agreed on a draft resolution calling for an end to drift-net fishing in  the region's international waters by June 30, 1992, except where protective  measures have been taken.  </P> <P> Officials said the decision would not apply to the North Pacific because  conservation measures are being taken in that region.  </P></p>

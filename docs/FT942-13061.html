			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Howard criticises Lords on police bill Mr Michael Howard,the home secretary, last night called on the Commons to overturn a key change made by the House of Lords to the controversial police and magistrates' courts bill. He accepted most of the amendments made when the government was defeated in the Lords during sustained attacks on the bill, but insisted that their refusal to accept new procedures for weeding out unsatisfactory police officers could not be allowed to stand. Mr Howard said the existing system did not allow police managers to review an officer's behaviour and performance as a whole and this was 'totally unacceptable'. He also gave notice that MPs would be asked to reverse an amendment made by the Lords which would prevent disciplinary proceedings being brought against officers in respect of matters for which they had been tried and acquitted in the criminal courts. In a concession to the Lords Mr Howard said that police would continue to have the right to be legally represented if they were at risk of dismissal, forced resignation or facing a reduction in rank. Mr Howard also bowed to the Lords in keeping the rank of chief inspector while abolishing that of chief superintendent. This change was aimed at securing a less top-heavy management structure. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's shadow home secretary, said the bill, although 'severely mauled' by the Lords, had not been changed nearly enough.</p>

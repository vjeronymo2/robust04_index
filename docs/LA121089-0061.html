			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISS MANNERS: TACT IS REQUIRED FOR HOLIDAY FAMILY GATHERINGS  </P> <P> Sometimes it seems to Miss Manners as if all that old-fashioned families worry  about at holiday time is how to avoid seeing one another. New-style families  worry about how to get to see everyone.  </P> <P> Perhaps this is not clear. Miss Manners will try again.  </P> <P> Let us say we have a conventional, or what used to be conventional,  three-generation family. Christmas dinner has always been at the grandparents'  house, with all the grown-up children and grandchildren of different ages  expected.  </P> <P> What do these people want to know from Miss Manners at this time of year? How  best to please their relatives? How to share the burden of entertaining while  according the elders their proper authority? How to delight the children while  instructing them in the spiritual nature of the holiday?  </P> <P> No. They want to know how they can get out of going. They want to be with their  friends. They are tired of hearing the same questions and comments about the  way they live. It's too much trouble to get there. They can get better food at  a restaurant.  </P> <P> But let us say that we have a family in which grandmother has cashiered  grandfather for someone else, and grandfather is being amply consoled  elsewhere. In the middle generation are not only the children and their current  spouses, but a few former spouses who have kept up the attachment or who must  be invited with their children, and assorted, ah, spouse equivalents, some with  their own children.  </P> <P> The youngest have been dividing their time all year between rival parental  households, without managing to get to the splintered households of the other  relatives, whom they now hardly know. In addition to all the other problems,  the families have scattered geographically.  </P> <P> Do these people share that yearning to have Christmas dinner by themselves, or  in compatible subgroups, or in a restaurant, or with people to whom they are  not related?  </P> <P> Oh, no. They cherish the notion of a big traditional family gathering, with all  the trimmings and everyone present -- except, of course, the particular former  relative or prospective relative whom they want everyone to leave out in the  cold.  </P> <P> Granny doesn't want anyone to go to Grandpa's. Papa doesn't want anyone to go  to Mama's. And everybody has called for barring at least one child's or  parent's current love interest. But otherwise, each wants an all-inclusive  family holiday.  </P> <P> Among those who want to keep the peace appropriate to the season, there has  therefore grown up the custom of having multiple celebrations. Instead of going  caroling from house to house, those who are on good terms with everyone go  feasting from house to house.  </P> <P> Perhaps Papa and his wife give Christmas Eve dinner, and Mama and her husband  give Christmas Day dinner. Or perhaps they have both decided that Christmas Day  is the only proper day to celebrate, so Mama gives a midday meal and Papa the  evening meal. Of course both give presents, and both may lead the same rituals,  such as tree-trimming.  </P> <P> This makes things hard on the double-duty relatives. Children who have no  trouble expressing delight at one round of festivities find themselves strained  at the second. There is such a phenomenon as too much of a good thing.  </P> <P> Miss Manners suggests a Christmas truce.  </P> <P> Christmas is not the time to start barring relatives' attachments, whether they  are romantic partners or stepchildren. The answer to "If she comes I won't" is,  except in extreme cases, "I hope you'll change your mind, because we would miss  you very much."  </P> <P> In irrevocably split families, there has to be some understanding about  dividing holiday rituals. Making the same people repeat rituals, other than  kisses and present exchanging, is using the holiday for a weapon, not a  celebration. And requiring anyone to eat two traditional Christmas meals is  dangerous cruelty.  </P> <P> Alternating holiday dinners, say with one person doing Thanksgiving and the  other Christmas, is one way; celebrating Twelfth Night as the second round is  another. If the households are near each other, a Christmas call on the one  that is not serving Christmas dinner should be made.  </P> <P> Such lessons in tact should not be lost on those who only have one such  celebration to get through.  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- Cousin Maurice and his wife, Lulu, sent invitations to the  family to celebrate "Dutch treat" the 50th anniversary of Aunt Cornelia and  Uncle Zachary at a local restaurant. At the affair, Cousin Maurice provided a  cake and paid the tip, while each guest paid for his or her own meal.  </P> <P> A few days after the party, the guests received thank-you notes from aunt and  uncle with the postscript, "We are sorry for the misunderstanding" and a check  for $15 per person.  </P> <P> As we have never encountered such a situation before, we would appreciate your  comments on the terms of the invitation and the subsequent reimbursement by  aunt and uncle. The names have been changed to protect the parties involved.  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- Miss Manners was so disappointed when she got to the end of  your story and found that these were not real names, that she can hardly bear  to answer your question. However, one must bear disappointments bravely.  </P> <P> Aunt Cornelia and Uncle Zachary, being well-bred people, were properly  horrified to hear of guests being charged to go to a party, and have chosen the  least awkward way they can imagine to erase such a blight from their  anniversary celebration. Miss Manners congratulates them on their taste, as  well as their anniversary.  </P></p>

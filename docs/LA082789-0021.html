			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'MOTOR-VOTER' REGISTRATION  </P> <P> This letter is written in response to the letter from Ruth Coffey (Aug. 8)  regarding the proposed "motor-voter" bill (S-874). Her description of voting as  "not only an honor but a sacred trust" is commendable and it is our goal to  inspire that sense of duty and participation in all citizens. It is also our  goal to ensure that the mechanics of registering and voting are designed to  make the process as simple as possible without jeopardizing the integrity of  the system. That is why the League of Women Voters is a sponsor of the  "motor-voter" bill.  </P> <P> Ms. Coffey expressed a deep concern about the possibility of fraud in  describing the legislation as "a plan to automatically register people to vote  when they renew their driver's license." The facts are that "motor voter" does  not automatically register people to vote; it automatically serves as an  application to register to vote. Safeguards are included to ensure that only  those eligible to vote will register to vote. The legislation also provides  penalties for those who fraudulently register.  </P> <P> In California, 39% of the population moves every two years and a large  percentage of registered movers forget to re-register at their new addresses.  In the process of establishing a new residence, movers are in touch with many  agencies . . . utilities, the post office and the Department of Motor Vehicles.  In addition to the DMV, the "motor-voter" bill permits expanded registration  opportunities at other state, local, and federal agencies, including public  high schools and colleges. The Los Angeles League of Women Voters is currently  working with the Los Angeles Unified School District in a school-based program  to register students and their parents.  </P> <P> Voter participation is the necessary foundation for a healthy and sound  democracy and yet of the world's major democratic systems, the United States is  dead last in voter participation.  </P> <P> Each state determines its own registration laws and procedures. As a result,  access to voting varies widely from state to state.  </P> <P> Voter registration must not be a barrier to voting; voting is a right, not a  privilege granted to those most tenacious in pursuing registration. The League  of Women Voters believes that S-874 is an excellent first step in providing a  national registration procedure that will help in getting voters back to the  polls.  </P> <P> LOIS SAFFIAN  </P> <P> President, LWV  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

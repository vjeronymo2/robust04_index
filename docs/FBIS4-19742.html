			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Deputy Chairwoman Heidemarie </F> Wieczorek-Zeul by Ingo Preissler; place and date not given: "No  Army for Intervention"]    [Text] [Preissler] The Social Democratic Party [SPD] has  welcomed the NATO air strike against the Bosnian Serbs, but it  rejects Bundeswehr participation in similar United Nations  operations. How do these two things go together?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] First of all: We all think that a  political solution must be found for former Yugoslavia. Second,  all parties in Germany, including those in government, think  that German troops have no business in former Yugoslavia.  Third, the SPD government program says: Providing the relevant  amendment to the constitution is made, we could participate in  UN peacekeeping missions. But we do not want the Bundeswehr to  be used as an army for military interventions worldwide.    [Preissler] Does this mean that the SPD rejects peacemaking  missions?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] These are combat missions. Neither the  United States, nor the United Nations -- as we learned during  Butrus-Ghali's visit this week -- expect Germany to take part in  such missions. Anyone in Germany referring to demands "from  outside," is using this as a pretext for a complete change in  Bundeswehr arms and equipment. This would cost billions that  are urgently needed for establishing German unity and supporting  East Europe.    [Preissler] NATO officials and politicians say that it is  unrealistic to draw a line between peacekeeping missions and  combat missions.    [Wieczorek-Zeul] Somalia has made the United Nations and the  U.S. Administration realize once again that unclear mandates are  dangerous, because they contain the threat of sliding into a  war. As to the Somalia mission, the Federal Government has told  the Bundestag and the population a lot of lies. None of the  originally envisaged aims and conditions have been met.    [Preissler] On Tuesday [19 April], the Federal  Constitutional Court will discuss Bundeswehr missions. You do  not see any reason to withdraw your complaint?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] No. By the way, the Free Democratic Party  [FDP] has also filed a complaint in Karlsruhe. But ours is  credible. Foreign Minister Kinkel will appear two-faced in  Karlsruhe, for, as foreign minister he will present the  government's position, and as FDP chairman he will argue against  himself. The SPD wants a clarification of whether the  interpretation of the constitution by all former federal  governments is continued, whereby the Bundeswehr's military  constitution only provides for the defense of its own country  and the alliance. Any other use would require a constitutional  amendment. Regardless of the decision the Karlsruhe court  takes, the SPD has made it clear that if it takes over the  government, the Bundeswehr will only be used in blue helmet  missions.    [Preissler] Your chairman has pointed out that there is no  doubt that the SPD will remain loyal to the alliance. The  Greens want to abolish NATO. Does this mean the death of a  red-green coalition?    [Wieczorek-Zeul] We are not speculating about possible  coalitions before the elections. We want the Social Democrats  to win as many votes as possible to enable a change of  government. I consider the position of the Greens to be wrong  and untrustworthy. They are ignoring the fact that the Central  and East European countries are very interested in joining NATO.</p>

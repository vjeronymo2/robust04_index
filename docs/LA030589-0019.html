			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMING SOON : SNEAK PREVIEWS OF FORTHCOMING BOOKS OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS;  </P> <P> GOING WEST  </P> <P> 'So Connie Chung disappeared to Los Angeles.' '  </P> <P> IN 1976, AFTER covering McGovern and Watergate for the CBS News Washington  bureau, Connie Chung decided that living and working in one city her entire  life (save for a two-year stint in Houston during junior high school while her  father was assigned there) was not a good thing. Coinciding with her thinking  was an offer from CBS-owned-and-operated station KNXT-TV.  </P> <P> "We talked about it," Chung says, "and I thought, 'Now, why would I want to do  that? Here I am at the creme-de-la-creme network, which it really was at that  time. Why in the world would I want to leave?' And then I thought, 'Well, you  know, I'm 29 years old -- maybe I should live in another city for a while.  Maybe it would be good for me.' I felt that I was still kind of suffering from  the post-Watergate syndrome. So I thought, 'Head west. Go to California.'  </P> <P> "I've never been the pick-up-and-leave sort of person," she says. "I can't  believe that I did it, actually. The funny thing is that what they offered me  to stay was anchoring the 'CBS Morning News.' At that time, I'd substituted a  lot at the 'Morning News,' but I didn't think that was a particularly great  place to go, because, at that time, when people anchored the 'CBS Morning News'  and then returned to regular reporting, their colleagues wondered where they'd  been. They thought they had disappeared off the face of the Earth."  </P> <P> So Chung disappeared to the West Coast, making what many in the television-news  industry would consider a backward career move, to anchor local news, albeit in  the No. 2 market in the country. She didn't want her friends in Washington to  think that she "went Hollywood," so she threw herself into her work. She  anchored the 11 o'clock news and the early 6 o'clock broadcast. Eventually she  added the 4:30 newscast, in addition to the Pacific Coast news digest for CBS.  She also reported, she says, because she "didn't want to be held hostage at the  anchor desk."  </P> <P> Before too long, though, Chung looked up from her grueling schedule and began  to feel she was missing something: "Somehow I felt that I was three hours  behind, even though it was local news and it was on time for Los Angeles. It's  just that things were happening around the country and I wouldn't know about  them. I was still asleep in the morning. Also, I was getting tired of the  murders, fires, floods -- that kind of thing," she says. "I wanted to cover big  fires, big floods."  </P> <P> The decision to move back East was motivated also by the chance at a lasting  relationship with the man to whom she is now married, Maury Povich, of "Current  Affair." Theirs had always been a commuter relationship. "We hadn't planned to  get married," Chung says, "but maybe we were thinking we would give it a chance  if we were at least on the same coast."  </P> <P> By the time her second three-year contract was due to expire, in 1983, Chung  had sent out feelers to all three networks. Among the people she talked to was  Bill Small, her former boss at the CBS News Washington bureau, who was then  with NBC News. He offered her a job anchoring the network's new early-morning  newscast, "NBC News at Sunrise." She cut short her commitments to CBS and  returned east to NBC in New York.  </P> <P> "I'm torn between anchoring and reporting," she says. Currently she anchors the  "NBC Nightly News" on Saturdays and serves as one of the two principal  substitutes for Tom Brokaw on the weeknight broadcasts. Two or three times a  week she anchors "NBC News Digest." And her week is filled with reporting  assignments for various NBC reports. "Right now," she says, "I have the best of  both worlds."  </P> <P> Copyright 1989 by Daniel Paisner.  </P> <P> </P></p>

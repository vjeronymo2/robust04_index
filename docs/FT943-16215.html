			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Absentees at Milan trial The biggest trial in Italy's long-running corruption scandal opened yesterday in Milan, in the absence of all the best known defendants, including Mr Bettino Craxi, former Socialist prime minister, and Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the federalist Northern League. The two men, along with 30 other political and business personalities from Italy's old regime, are charged with breaking the law on the financing of political parties. Most of the defendants were witnesses in the six-month trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, a financial consultant to Ferruzzi-Montedison, the industrial group, which was alleged to have paid a L150bn (Pounds 62m) bribe to political parties to ease its withdrawal from Enimont, an ill-fated chemicals joint venture with Eni, the state holding company. This second trial could last even longer and began slowly yesterday with procedural points. Much of the media interest is concentrated on Mr Craxi, who refuses to return from his villa in Tunisia, on the grounds that he is too ill.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Management: Top dogs bark up the wrong tree It is time top managers admitted the truth. Most of them are indulging in a convenient but simplistic fiction when they repeat the standard mantra that the biggest barrier to radical change in their organisations is front-line employees or, more often, middle management. The reality is frequently much more painful: that the most intransigent group is top management itself. In a few high-profile cases over the past couple of years, this has become so obvious that outside directors or institutional shareholders have been forced to have the top man removed. Notable examples include Digital, General Motors, IBM and Kodak in the US, and Midland Bank in the UK. But in almost all these instances action was taken long after the top man had caused serious damage in one of several ways: by allowing the first sparks of the company's strategic crisis to develop into what experts in change call a fully-fledged 'burning platform'; by failing to douse flames which were already burning when he took over; or by failing to change the team - whether literally or figuratively. It is far from unknown for recalcitrant members of a top team to be elbowed or frozen out by its leader, or by their peers. But, all too often, top-level resistance to radical change in strategy, organisation or culture is tolerated by executive colleagues reluctant to invite criticism of themselves, or by outside directors loath to rock the boat. Sometimes, as the top team directs all its attention to the minions below, it does not even recognise that it has a problem itself. In the past three weeks I have attended two discussion dinners of top managers trying to grapple with change. The first was billed by the organisers as focusing purely on the top team. The second was more wide-ranging, but promised to include some debate about the top. On each occasion, discussion slipped quickly away from 'us' on to much more comfortable ground: what 'we' can do to get 'them' to become more flexible, customer-responsive, open-minded, speedy, and so on. The same phenomenon was in evidence last week at a conference on radical change, when a string of top managers blamed their organisations' inflexibility and other inadequacies on what several called the 'mushy middle'. All of which makes very timely a research project which Don Laurie, a consultant, has undertaken into what he calls the changing 'work of a leader' in improving the customer-responsiveness of organisations. Unlike the usual sort of wide-eyed study of leaders' characteristics, Laurie concentrates on the actions they actually take. He focuses mainly on the top, although he also deals with the need for 'distributed leadership' at all levels of an organisation. His research, which he is turning into a book, has one obvious limitation. It relies heavily on one-to-one interviews with a blue-chip (all-male) list of two dozen high-profile US and European chairmen, chief executives, presidents and managing directors. They include Sir Colin Marshall of British Airways, Jan Timmer of Philips, the electronics group, Elserino Piol of Olivetti, John Duerden of Reebok International, and the heads of Goldman Sachs and Chemical Bank in Europe. So the study's findings are coloured heavily by the leaders' self-perception, although this is tempered by Laurie's own experienced judgment. But his focus on the top man and his team provides insights aplenty, especially into the prevalence at that level of deep-seated resistance to change. Effective modern leadership is very different from the traditional exercise of authority and power, and the handing-down of detailed, 'technical' solutions, Laurie concludes. 'An awful lot of leaders are authority figures, they're not performing the act of leadership,' he complains. That consists of mobilising the people in an organisation to confront difficult problems themselves, and helping them adapt to the challenges and uncertainty which arise as a result. Paradoxically, in addition to listening, 'coaching' and other supportive behaviour, this often involves maintaining a fair degree of instability in the organisation. One obvious source of resistance to change which Laurie identifies is the preponderance of control-types on most top teams, and the lack of creative minds. Another is the tendency of many top managers to behave, not as a cohesive team, but as warring barons, each defending their own departmental, divisional or personal constituency; Laurie quotes a colleague's view that 'a top team working together is an oxymoron'. A more surprising cause of resistance is the failure of many chairmen and chief executives to listen to their top colleagues, to understand them as individuals, to perceive clearly their strengths and weaknesses. Bernard Fournier, head of Rank Xerox, places particular emphasis on overcoming what he calls people's 'unconscious incompetence'. This can only be done by communal learning from mistakes, he says. That, in turn, requires real openness and considerable argument - the lack of which, says Laurie, is a further cause of resistance at the top. Without openness, recalcitrant team members will avoid commitment at meetings, and then reinterpret supposed agreements. Or they will sabotage a decision - usually by blackening a colleague's reputation. As Laurie argues, the instinct of many top managers is to continue furthering their own interests. They are loath to become team players - and then to challenge much of what they have stood for. But unless they do, neither will the people beneath them.</p>

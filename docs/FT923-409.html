			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / People: Gwyn Howells (m)eets the MLC Gwyn Howells, marketing director of Reebok UK, who helped make Reebok the best-selling sports shoe in Britain during his spell with the company, is joining the Meat and Livestock Commission in the same capacity. His is the first senior external appointment made by Colin Mclean, who took over as director general at the beginning of September. Howells' arrival signals an increased concentration on sophisticated selling on the part of the MLC, which promotes the red meat industry with an annual budget of around Pounds 50m. The (M)eat to Live campaign has a similar feel to the award-winning White Line TV ads for which Howells was responsible at Reebok last year, according to an MLC spokesman. 'We are pleased to have recruited a high-profile person from an up-beat company,' he adds. The previous marketing director, Garry Dobbin, died earlier this year. 'The food industry, and meat in particular, has taken a series of knocks to its image in the past few years,' the MLC goes on. 'While we have had a stable market in terms of meat consumption over the past twenty years, we cannot afford to be complacent.' Howells, 43, says he had achieved what he set out to do at Reebok, establishing it as the market leader in Britain, in terms of volume and value, 18 months ago. He sees the challenge at MLC as similar, in that it involves 'staying in tune with consumers' life-styles'. ***** Charles Novotny, 54, has been appointed chief executive of Tarmac's quarry products division. Novotny has been with the company for 18 years and was previously the division's assistant chief executive; he replaces Jack Mawdsley, who has already announced that he is leaving at the end of the year to pursue personal interests. ***** David Holden has been appointed finance director and company secretary of MARSHALLS following the retirement of George Taylor. ***** Gordon McKie, formerly general manager of John Menzies' financial services division, has been appointed finance director and company secretary of BRITISH THORNTON HOLDINGS. ***** Philip Gothard, group financial controller, has also been appointed company secretary of JAMES WILKES.</p>

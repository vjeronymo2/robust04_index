Officers  decided to arrest the two Tuesday after they spotted detectives in West Los  Angeles, Garcia said.  </P> <P> Pack was arrested when he returned home about noon. About 40 officers  surrounded the house where Hinton was, two blocks away. He surrendered at 3:20  p.m.  </P> <P> Pack and Hinton were being held at the Hawthorne Jail on $250,000 bail each.  </P></p>

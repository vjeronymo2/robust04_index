			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / UN in Dollars 540m Sarajevo project Despite the uncertain prospects for peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina, work is about to begin on a Dollars 540m (Pounds 343m) UN co-ordinated action plan for the restoration of essential services to Sarajevo, United Nations officials said yesterday. Nearly half the money is needed for projects described as 'urgent' and scheduled for completion by the end of this year. Immediate priorities include restoration of the city's gas supply, water chlorination, refuse removal, restoration of power lines and repairs to schools in time for the autumn term. Mr Edouard Rousselot, operations director for the action plan, said more than Dollars 68m had already been raised following a pledging conference in New York at the end of June, the three largest donors so far being the US, Britain and Japan. The action plan relates to 'greater' Sarajevo, including Bosnian Serb-controlled areas.</p>

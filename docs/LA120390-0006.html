			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCA BUYOUT BY JAPANESE  </P> <P> The allusion, in your editorial "There They Go Again, Blaming Foreigners" (Nov.  28), to Ronald Reagan's oft-spoken lament is all too appropriate. If, as you  suggest, Americans' credit binges and poor savings habits have fostered foreign  incursion into our economy, there are also several other contributory mistakes  we have made as well.  </P> <P> Two major ones have been the nation's past two presidential selections.  </P> <P> At a recent Town Hall Meeting in Los Angeles, T. Boone Pickens remarked, "Japan  must abandon its keiretsu business practices before it can become a welcome  participant in the global economy. Until that happens, these anti-competitive  cartels are a wedge threatening to drive the U.S. and Japanese people apart."  Pickens drew this conclusion after being insulted with epithetical references  to the attack upon Pearl Harbor and being shouted down during the shareholders  meeting of a Japanese manufacturing firm in which he holds a 26% interest. In  order for our nation to compete, equitable rules must be negotiated and  enforced by those "leaders" who shape our foreign and trade policies.  </P> <P> If we Americans should not like what we see in the mirror, we similarly should  be disgusted as we watch the former President accept millions as a mouthpiece  for Japanese interests, and the current Administration prostrates itself along  the Pacific Rim in order to keep the recession under wraps until after the next  election.  </P> <P> But far more unsettling is the specter of foreign dominance of one of our most  important outlets for sociocultural expression, the motion picture industry.  Perhaps it is not the film companies themselves over which control has been  ceded; it may well be part or all of the First Amendment.  </P> <P> RICHARD NEWTON MEYER, Los Angeles  </P></p>

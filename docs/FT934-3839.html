			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Reorganised Leigh 24% up at Pounds 5m Leigh Interests, the waste management company, said yesterday that a wide-ranging business reorganisation helped lift pre-tax profits by 24 per cent, from Pounds 4.08m to Pounds 5.06m, in the half year to September 30. Turnover was up from Pounds 52.3m to Pounds 56.4m, following the company's decision to reduce its dependence on waste disposal for the construction industry, especially in the south of England. Instead, it has targeted commercial waste - refuse from offices, shops and factories - to build up an alternative customer base. Mr Arthur Kent, finance director, said: 'We did rather badly because of the recession in construction, but we've now restructured our landfill sites to handle more commercial waste.' The results, however, were held back by operating losses of Pounds 700,000 at two new waste plants in the Midlands, which were unable to operate at full capacity because of manufacturers' faults. The faults are due to be repaired in the second half. Operating profits - up from Pounds 6.07m to Pounds 6.78m - were also affected by a 3 per cent fall in the volume of liquid wastes treated by the company. Mr Kent blamed the decline on the European Commission's decision to postpone a new directive requiring the disposal of such waste at new treatment plants. Earnings per share increased to 5.5p (4.4p), while the interim dividend is held at 2.46p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] As Malawians celebrate the birth of democracy, a  debate is raging about the constitution of the new president's  choice of ministers. It had been thought that President Bakili  Muluzi, who leads the United Democratic Front [UDF], would have  offered some important cabinet posts to Mr. Chakufwa Chihana's  Aford [Alliance for Democracy] party who did not do as well as  expected in the polls. But so far all the positions have gone  only to Mr. Muluzi's UDF party, but the UDF did not secure a  working majority in the elections. So, they will have to form a  coalition and it had been widely anticipated that this will be  with Aford. Mary Gregory asked Aford's secretary for legal and  constitutional affairs, Mr. Bazuka Muhango, how the party felt  about the cabinet appointments.    [Begin recording] [Muhango] It is very disappointing because  the question about the seats we are talking about was something  that was to arise after some negotiations for a coalition had  been struck. We made certain demands, that is, the team from  Aford made certain demands for a coalition participation. It  looks like the UDF government was not interested in a coalition  arrangement. They only wanted Aford to participate in  government.    [Gregory] What demands did you make?    [Muhango] Well, we did make a demand of eight ministerial  seats and we did make preferences taking into account, you know,  the real effectiveness of participation in the coalition.    [Gregory] Negotiations between Aford and the UDF broke down  on Tuesday [24 May]. So, what are you planning to do next?    [Muhango] We are assembling over the weekend -- I am talking  about Aford now -- in order to reflect on the aftermath of this  and a decision will be made when the assembly made up of elected  members and the council members of Aford will have to assemble  and deliberate on this matter.    [Gregory] There are still three seats vacant in the cabinet  that haven't been allocated to anybody. So, if you are offered  those three seats, will you accept them and will you be happy  with just those three?    [Muhango] Well, I cannot decide for the council meeting, but  obviously if you look at the ministries that are (?to be)  filled, they are [words indistinct] type of ministries with very  little consequences on governmental performance, and we think  that it's really a joke that [words indistinct] reserving them  in order to offer them to Aford. It can only show that they  were not seriously [words indistinct] in any coalition  arrangement with Aford. It would depend on what the council  decides, but my personal feeling is that perhaps Aford would not  really enter on an arrangement on the basis of that offer.    [Gregory] So, what solution do you see to this problem?    [Muhango] Well, our view was that given the results of the  election the matter would have been resolved by actually getting  consultations with all the parties that took part in the  election and had some positive results because the split in the  vote is such that you really can go across the country and see  that each of the major parties have won in one of the regions.  So, to avoid the fragmentation of the country, our view is that  maybe we should proceed on the basis that we are to reconcile  the different sections and regions of the country. Malawi  requires to have a kind of a government of national unity, at  least for some period. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 17 May (NOTIMEX) -- Social democratic  presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez today demanded  that the OAS investigate his allegations of fraud in the  Dominican elections.    Pena Gomez, who was nominated by the Dominican Revolutionary  Party [PRD], demanded that the elections be annulled in several  provinces, claiming that some 200,000 voters were unable to vote  because their names did not appear at the voting tables. Pena  Gomez added that such irregularities constitute "major fraud"  and asked his followers to remain alert because he believes "a  serious attempt against democracy is under way." "These  incidents are very serious, and the elections should be held  again in those cities and provinces where the irregularities  took place," Pena Gomez indicated.    Pena Gomez accused the Central Electoral Board [JCE] of  excluding some 200,000 opposition supporters from the voter  registration list to guarantee the reelection of President  Joaquin Balaguer, candidate for the Social Christian Reformist  Party. He stated that he will challenge the electoral results  before the relevant authorities and demand new elections and the  presence of international observers during the vote count. "We  will also ask the OAS to investigate the event," he added.    PRD sources agreed that if Pena's request is admitted,  elections will be held again in nearly 40 percent of Dominican  territory.    This morning the JCE revealed that after counting 34.92  percent of the votes, Balaguer had obtained 43.64 percent and  Pena Gomez 41.03.    Pena Gomez claimed that Balaguer's followers decided to  suspend the vote count in Santo Domingo -- where nearly 30  percent of all voters live -- "because they know they are losing  here." The PRD candidate said there was fraud in Santo Domingo  and some provinces in the country's interior, particularly in an  area inhabited by black Dominicans who work in some 20 sugar  mills.    President Balaguer downplayed an eventual challenge of the  election results, saying that "everyone will be satisfied with  the way in which this electoral process has unfolded."    According to foreign journalists, the situation in the  country is unstable. Three trucks carrying armed policemen have  been deployed around PRD headquarters.    Dominicans went to the polls yesterday to elect a new  president, vice president, 120 deputies, 30 senators, and 105  mayors.</p>

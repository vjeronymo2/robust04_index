			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] An article in the 26 April issue of the  Warsaw daily POLSKA ZBROJNA comments on the impact the  increasing rate of unemployment is having on Polish society and  criticizes the government's approach to dealing with this  problem. Referring to an accompanying map of Poland that  indicates those districts (mostly in northern Poland) suffering  from the highest levels of unemployment with black shading,  journalist Elzbieta Szmigielska-Jezierska writes that  "unemployment is growing in Poland, and the black stain is  getting larger. In some regions, the rate is over 20 percent,  and this is alarming." Szmigielska-Jezierska finds disturbing  the fact that the 30-to-44-year-old age group has been the most  severely affected by unemployment: "The tragic aspect of our  condition is underlined by the fact that this age group is being  hit the hardest. These are people in the prime of their  lives.... If all of these people are useless to the country, a  country that must intensively modernize its economy, are we a  lost nation?"    Szmigielska-Jezierska notes that, in addition to the  2,900,000 registered unemployed (15.7 percent of the  population), an even larger number pf "hidden" unemployed are on  the payroll of factories where they have nothing productive to  do. The extent of this overmanning, which is made possible by  large government subsidies, is estimated at approximately 5.5  million.    Szmigielska-Jezierska finds fault with the government and,  in  particular, with Leszek Miller, minister of labor and social  policy, for relying on large welfare appropriations to alleviate  the results of unemployment rather than coming to grips with its  root causes. She describes the relief payments as "manna from  heaven," which will not provide a lasting solution to Poland's  unemployment problem.</p>

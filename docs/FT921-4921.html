			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Miyazawa sidelined by scandals: The waning popularity of Japan's prime minister THE POPULARITY of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, has sunk so low that officials running an important by-election campaign for his ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) have asked him to stay away. The prime minister, who came to office just five months ago with an ambitious domestic and international agenda, has been reduced to near-impotence by political scandal and the agonisingly long argument over whether Japan's rice market should be opened up. Mr Miyazawa had hoped to make his mark as a leader who dealt successfully with the challenge of enhancing Japan's contribution to world affairs. Instead, he is most likely to be remembered for his inability to defuse three separate scandals: the aftermath of the Recruit stocks-for-favours affair, the Kyowa bribery case, and the unfolding drama of Sagawa Kyubin, a transport company with links to gangsters. The scandals, according to opinion polls, are uppermost in the minds of the electorate in Miyagi, a farming district in northern Japan, who vote on Sunday in a by-election for the lower house of the Diet (parliament). Rural constituents are also angry with the LDP for hinting that Japan might open its rice market to imports. Mr Nobuo Onodera, the LDP candidate, and his campaign managers have asked Mr Miyazawa and Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, to stay away from the hustings. 'The bottom line is that they are just not wanted here. We told them not to come,' said Mr Takayoshi Kono, a campaign manager. The seat was left vacant by the death of the incumbent, an Social Democrat. The opposition won the seat only in 1989, at the height of the Recruit affair; Miyagi had been an LDP stronghold, and the party had hoped to win it back. Given the passions aroused in rural Japan by the rice issue, the campaign would never have been easy for the LDP. But Mr Onodera, a popular local politician and a former head of the prefectural assembly, hoped to succeed by proclaiming his opposition to liberalising the market. However, the scandals seem to have cut much of the ground from under his feet. According to opinion polls, even LDP supporters plan to register their anger by voting for a candidate sponsored by Rengo, the Japanese trade union organisation. Even though many Japanese have got bored with the endless flow of allegations of political corruption, recent events seem to have inflamed their anger once more. Interest was focused this week on a case dating back to 1982. The Tokyo High Court, a court of appeal, acquitted Mr Fumio Yokote, a former Diet member, of taking bribes from the National Federation of Thread-Plying Industry Co-operatives Associations, a textiles grouping. He had been convicted of taking Y2m (Pounds 8,780) from the association in 1982 in return for using his influence with government officials to secure subsidies for the industry. The high court overturned the conviction on the grounds that the only evidence against Mr Yokote was the testimony of two alleged bribers. The judge said their evidence was suspect because they had themselves been charged with bribery in connection with other incidents and therefore may have altered their evidence in the hope of securing lighter sentences. The judgment and reasoning has provoked criticism. Daily Gendai, the tabloid newspaper, said in a report yesterday that 'the judgment makes clear that without a reform in the law, political reform is impossible'. An Asahi newspaper editorial urged the public prosecutor's office not to be discouraged by the verdict from pursuing future scandals with the greatest vigour. The scandal which has most directly hurt Mr Miyazawa is the affair in which Recruit, a publishing company, tried to curry favour by handing out cut-price stock. Mr Miyazawa was finance minister when the scandal broke in 1988 and resigned for his (minor) involvement. He admitted his secretary had accepted cut-price shares. But now he is prime minister, opposition parties want to re-examine his role in the affair by questioning one of his aides in the Diet. Mr Miyazawa has also been tarnished by the affair involving Kyowa, a steel frame maker and property developer, which allegedly bribed Mr Fumio Abe, a former minister and close associate of the prime minister. Mr Abe has been charged with accepting about Y90m in bribes in return for disclosing planning information. In investigating links between Sagawa Kyubin and Inagawakai, a leading criminal organisation, the public prosecutor's office has found evidence of large flows of money to politicians. However, it has yet to find any hard evidence of wrongdoing on the politicians' part. If the LDP loses in Miyagi, its hold on the Diet's lower house will remain unaffected. But a loss will do nothing to improve its prospects in the July elections to the upper house, where the LDP lost its majority in 1989. Under Diet rules, the party with a lower house majority can force many kinds of legislation through the upper house. But bulldozer tactics run counter to Japanese custom and practice. Rather, the ruling party is expected to take account of public opinion as expressed in elections, including by-elections, and adjust its policies accordingly. Since 1989, this has produced a virtual impasse on important legislation in the Diet, particularly in the field of political reform. The LDP has discussed numerous plans, but Diet members have, not surprisingly, found it impossible to agree on measures which would hurt their finances.</p>

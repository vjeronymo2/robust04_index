			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Survey of Latin American Mining (3): State giant fights a losing battle - Bolivia BOLIVIAN mining has two faces. There is the public face which is crumbling, and the private face which looks better with each passing day. Unfortunately for cash starved Bolivia, potential private investors take one look at the state mining corporation, Comibol, and get the jitters about the industry as a whole. They should not do so because Bolivia has many thriving private mining enterprises, which are the key to the country's long-term prospects. In the public sector, the present government has introduced a new mining code and opened up Comibol to joint ventures with private corporations. Unfortunately no amount of legislation will reform this loss-making, bloated and inefficient organisation. Relatively strong mining unions realise joint ventures mean the end of their political clout and are fighting them all the way. In contrast, the government is weak, disorientated and coming up for re-election. Comibol's entrenched middle management and technicians, knowing that joint ventures will cost them their jobs, seems to be doing their utmost to delay and dismiss such deals. Since the concept of joint ventures was first touted as the way ahead for Comibol in 1991, only two deals have been signed, though leasing contracts are fairly common. So far, three companies: Minproc, Cominesa, and a subsidiary of Brazil's Paranapanema, are still unable to start up operations due to industrial action. Comibol recently acquired a new president, Mr Marcelo Perez, a committed free marketeer with no mining experience, and the much criticised Comibol board is strongly rumoured to be about to undergo a major shake-up. But while the government continues to refuse to tackle middle management and unions, potential joint venture partners with Comibol can expect much frustration and disappointment. Nevertheless, there is an incentive for change in the form of the World Bank, which has been withholding a Dollars 35m mining credit originally approved in 1989, Dollars 22m of which is earmarked for the restructuring of Comibol. A team from the World Bank has visited Bolivia to evaluate recent rearrangements within the corporation, which, apart from a new president, include a major redundancy programme. The team may release the credit, but is likely to insist on Comibol jettisoning its mining interests and concentrating solely on administering joint venture contracts. There is a view, however, that it would perhaps be better if Comibol was starved of funds and left to die a natural death. Alternatively, under a new government, Comibol might be disposed of altogether. This is the preference of planning minister Samuel Doria Medina, who is convinced that the country's constitution will be altered to allow the full-scale privatisation of the corporation some time next year. In contrast, the Medium Mines Association, an umbrella organisation of medium-sized private mining concerns, continues to go from strength to strength, thanks to its ability to adapt far faster than Comibol to changing market conditions. Rolando Jordan, the Association's general secretary, explains: 'The 1985 crash in tin prices showed us that our industry was built on the basis of continuing high prices. We have learnt our lesson. New mining operations we subsequently embarked on used modern mining techniques and philosophies.' Overall investment in mining continues to rise, from Dollars 53.1m in 1989 to Dollars 80.7m in 1990 and Dollars 96.1m in 1991. Although growth last year was a disappointing 2 per cent, the dynamic period from 1987 to 1990 saw significant increases of between 14 and 53 per cent. Growth in the Medium Mines was around 3.6 per cent for the first half of this year. However, the ground is being prepared for an early revival. Inli Raymi, a subsidiary of Battle Mountain Gold, is investing some Dollars 170m in its existing gold and silver operations and investigating a promising copper and gold deposit. RTZ has uncovered a gold deposit in Puquio Norte, which is to be exploited by Comsur - one example of a successful private joint venture partnership. Cyprus Minerals is confident of finalising a joint venture exploration deal with Comibol covering 100,000 hectares in the Los Lipez region. However, Bolivia's traditional production - tin, tungsten, wolfram and antimony - is geared to survival rather than profit at present. Mr Jordan of Medium Mines acknowledges that five of his current 22 members may be forced to drop out of the organisation by the year's end as a result. In contrast, zinc and silver continue to break production records. Copper and gold are also showing some promise. But it is polymetallic seams - containing silver, zinc, tin and lead - which excite the most interest. The problem in this field is that concentrations tend to be small and transport costs will be crucial to determine viability. Indeed, infrastructure in general is perhaps the greatest physical problem facing mining companies in Bolivia. This is a country roughly twice the size of Spain. Yet much of it is without roads, electricity or communications links. Mr Marcial Garcia, exploration manager with Cyprus Minerals in Bolivia, says: 'The government needs to invest in infrastructure before many mining projects can become feasible.' This year's public investment programme is worth just Dollars 470m, although the figure is up on last year and will continue to rise in 1993, according to finance minister Jorge Quiroga. One project which may help is a proposed road which would link Bolivia to the Pacific Coast. And Peru recently granted Bolivia access to the sea through the as yet undeveloped port of Ilo. While labour problems significantly affect Comibol and its joint venture partners, the situation could change as private ownership of mines becomes more established. Unions are utterly opposed to what they call 'privatisation through the back door.' However, individual miners are aware that profitable private companies provide better pay and conditions. Miners in existing private operations are far less prone to industrial action than their public sector counterparts. The message for potential investors in Bolivia is that mining is composed of two separate entities: public and private. Those brave souls ready to tackle the public sector will need ample reserves of patience, perseverance and political skill. In contrast, many private sector ventures in Bolivia do work, and work well.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $31-MILLION RENOVATION PROJECT;  </P> <P> STORM-RAVAGED KING HARBOR BEGINS RECOVERY  </P> <P> A year after the start of a series of storm and fire disasters, King Harbor in  Redondo Beach is on the way to recovery, city officials and harbor business  people say.  </P> <P> More than $31 million in private and public improvement projects are either  completed, in progress or being planned in the effort to restore the harbor as  a major recreational area before the city's centennial observance in 1992,  Harbor Director Sheila Schoettger said.  </P> <P> "When all the scars are gone, King Harbor will be even more beautiful," she  said.  </P> <P> Schoettger acknowledged, however, that the city has some major financial  hurdles to overcome. The biggest is raising the $6 million needed to  reconstruct the 60-year-old Horseshoe Pier, most of which was destroyed by fire  last May.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Guarantees'  </P> <P> "I'm confident we can do it all," she said, "But there are no guarantees."  </P> <P> The City Council voted in September, after a community debate, to restore the  pier. Some contended that the pier attracted gangs and caused traffic  congestion, while others maintained that it was an essential feature of the  beach community.  </P> <P> Thirty-two of the original 48 shops and restaurants are still in business on  the south portion of Horseshoe Pier and the adjacent Monstad Pier. Merchants  say the number of visitors has dropped 30% to 45%, partly because many people  think the pier area was totally wiped out by the fire and three major storms  last year. It is estimated that about 8 million people visited the harbor and  4.5 million visited the pier in 1987.  </P> <P> "There are people living within six or eight blocks who have not checked yet to  see whether anybody's left here," said Chuck Milner, owner of the Pier Import  Shop on the south leg of Horseshoe Pier, which angles off from the base of  Monstad Pier.  </P> <P> Milner and his wife, Judy, lost a cluster of four other shops in the Edge  Restaurant building when the north and ocean sides of the pier were damaged in  the January and April storms and then finished off by the fire and more high  waves in late May.  </P> <P> Milner said he and most other merchants plan to restore their businesses after  the city reconstructs the pier.  </P> <P> Another pier business owner, Tony Trutanich, said his two restaurants -- one on  Monstad Pier and the other on the south end of Horseshoe Pier -- incurred only  minor damage and his business remains fairly stable.  </P> <P> But less fortunate shop owners have lost more than half of their customers as a  result of the 1988 disasters, he said, partly because there are fewer places to  attract visitors to the pier area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Restaurants to Reopen  </P> <P> The January storm, believed to be a once-in-every-75-years phenomenon, also  demolished the Blue Moon Saloon and heavily damaged Reuben's Restaurant and the  Portofino Inn, all on the harbor shore north of the pier.  </P> <P> Restoration of those restaurants is in the planning or construction stages.  Reuben's and the Portofino Inn are planning to reopen in June.  </P> <P> To secure King Harbor against future onslaughts from the sea, the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers plans to raise the south portion of the harbor's northern  breakwater about five feet to the 20-foot-plus level of the rest of the  barrier. The shorter southern breakwater will be doubled in length to 600 feet  to head off waves at the harbor entrance.  </P> <P> The $5.9-million breakwater project, now in the design and testing phase, is  expected to be completed in early 1991, with the city paying 35% of the cost  and the federal government financing for the rest.  </P> <P> Schoettger said the city has applied for a loan from the state Department of  Boating and Waterways to cover its share of the breakwater project, which was  planned before the January storms.  </P> <P> Financing for the new pier, however, "is much less clear," Schoettger said.  "We're hoping the state will provide about $2.5 million and we're still looking  for the rest."  </P> <P> </P> <P> $30,000 Contributed  </P> <P> Possible avenues, she said, include a bond issue, a bank loan and contributions  from businesses and individuals. She said those contributions have reached  $30,000 without a major fund-raising effort.  </P> <P> A design committee is scheduled to select a firm by early February to draft  initial proposals. If all goes well, construction on the pier, possibly using  steel or concrete pilings instead of wood, could start late this year or in  early 1990, Schoettger said.  </P> <P> "When we have the whole package put together, including designs and the  financing we'll need, I think the project will become much more real to  people," she said.  </P> <P> Schoettger said there is broad community support for rebuilding the pier, but  residents differ on how large it should be and how much of it should be devoted  to businesses. The city will ask the design firm for three options:  </P> <P> One would provide less than the 21,500 square feet of commercial space lost in  1988.  </P> <P> The second would provide the same amount of commercial space available at the  old pier.  </P> <P> The third would have the same amount of business space, plus about 6,000 square  feet for some type of public building.  </P> <P> Ideas for the building so far include an art gallery, theater, meeting or  multipurpose room, marine study quarters and a museum, Schoettger said.  </P> <P> To make reconstruction of the pier a community project, the city invited  residents to submit design ideas. More than 200 were received and they will be  reviewed by the city's designer, Schoettger said.  </P> <P> The 132-room Portofino Inn, which was heavily damaged when 20-foot waves surged  into the harbor in January, plans to reopen this summer after completion of an  $8-million reconstruction and expansion project, said Peter Snowden, a general  partner in the firm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 31-Suite Addition  </P> <P> He said renovation of the existing rooms, a new waterfront lobby and a 31-suite  addition "will transform what was a motor hotel into a first-class resort  hotel." The renovated hotel will reopen June 1 and the new suites will be ready  in August, he said.  </P> <P> Dan Conway, Reuben's project manager, said the firm expects to receive its  final building permits and then immediately start reconstruction of the  restaurant to meet a reopening date of June 1. Demolition of the damaged  portion of the building and construction of new foundations began shortly after  the storm last January, he said.  </P> <P> Reuben's also owned the Breakers restaurant that was destroyed in the pier fire  in May. Conway said a decision on rebuilding it will be made after the new pier  is constructed and "we have a chance to see whether the customer base is still  there."  </P></p>

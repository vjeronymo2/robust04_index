			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / World Trade News: EU tariff plan worries Ecuador Ecuador will be hit if the European Union decides to remove flowers, tuna fish, and shrimp from the general system of preferences granted to Andean countries, according to the government. Support for the Andean countries' export industries through tariff concessions has been part of a EU policy that recognises efforts by Andean Pact governments in the fight against narcotics trafficking. A few weeks ago EU delegates to the Andean-European Commission recommended to the EU Council a 10-year renewal of the existing trade preference list. A preliminary decision, to be confirmed or rejected by the Council of Ministers on December 19, would remove these agricultural products from the preference list. For Ecuador, which is pursuing free-trade policies and seeking entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, this comes as yet another blow, after the US earlier this year imposed anti-dumping tariffs on its flower exports.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Abbeycrest Pounds 739,000 in loss THE PROBLEMS of the UK retail jewellery trade hit Abbeycrest, the UK's leading jewellery maker, which reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 739,000 in the first half of the year compared with a Pounds 32,000 profit. The interim dividend was maintained at 1.2p. The shares shares fell 5p to 33p. However, Mr Michael Lever, chairman, said that the group was now trading profitably. He said retailers were cautious about the all-important Christmas period with orders later than usual. 'It will be a wait-and-see Christmas,' he said. Abbeycrest, which refuses to comment on its customers' business, is a leading supplier to Ratners, the troubled jewellery retailer. In 1989 nearly 60 per cent of Abbeycrest's turnover went to Ratners, but the group has built up its sales to other customers. 'Abbeycrest's largest customer will account for only around 15 per cent of this year's turnover', Mr Lever said. He would not confirm if this was Ratners. Abbeycrest has also arranged credit insurance to protect all its turnover against customer default. In the first half sales fell 9.9 per cent to Pounds 14.5m and there was an operating loss of Pounds 630,000 (profit Pounds 341,000). Net interest costs fell from Pounds 309,000 to Pounds 109,000. Mr Lever said gearing had fallen to less than 40 per cent at the half year end, down from twice that a year earlier. A loss per share of 2.1p (earnings of 0.1p) was recorded.</p>

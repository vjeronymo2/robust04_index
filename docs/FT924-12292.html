			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru tees off privatisation with iron shot - Next week's sale will set the tone for mine sector denationalisation THE MOST likely new owner of Peru's state iron monopoly after bid envelopes are opened on 30 October is a multinational consortium headed by Chilean-based Compania de Aceros del Pacifico (CAP) along with Japan's Mitsubishi Corporation and a Mexican steel company owned by the Indian group Ispat. CAP, a public company quoted on the Santiago stock exchange, is 30 per cent owned by the Swiss-based Stephan Schmidheiny group. Mitsubishi is a minority shareholder. Next week's Hierro Peru sale marks the kick-off for privatisation of Peru's major mining concerns. The result will be seen as a barometer for coming sell-offs. The Chilean-Japanese-Mexican consortium has been put together by Mr Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski, a former Peruvian mines minister and more recently a senior manager and privatisation specialist at First Boston. He is now chief executive officer at Nueva Management, the Miami-based subsidiary that will tend Schmid- heiny's construction-related interests in Latin America. According to Hierro Peru officials, half-a-dozen foreign consortia have expressed serious interest in bidding for the ailing iron concern which this year will produce some 2.6m tonnes of blast furnace pellets and sinter, about a third of its theoretical operative capacity. Sale conditions require bidders, who have all gone through a prior vetting process, to come up with a cash minimum of Dollars 22m and commit themselves to investing Dollars 60m in sorely-needed updating of mine, plant and equipment. The eventual buyer must also assume undisclosed Hierro Peru debts, said to be in the region of Dollars 30m. In its present state, Hierro Peru does not appear a particularly desirable prospect. The operation, operated by US interests under the name of Marcona Mining Corporation from first shipment in 1953 until the 1975 nationalisation by General Juan Velasco's government, was once a flourishing concern. In the early 1970s output peaked at almost 10m tonnes a year. Since nationalisation, however, the installations have been allowed to deteriorate and output has slumped. The mine is now all but idle with most of its 2,000-strong workforce (reduced by 1,400 in the past year) on strike in protest at lay-offs and, unions claim, non-payment by employers of redundancy benefits. Mr Emilio Zuniga, head of the small committee charged with selling Hierro Peru off to the private sector, says the company chalked up a book loss of Dollars 60m last year alone - almost the equivalent of this year's projected Dollars 67m sales. However, as with most of the country's badly decapitalised mining sector, Hierro Peru's scrap heap appearance masks potentially rich pickings. The Marcona mine has some 600m tonnes of proven reserves. 'Probable' reserves take the total to around 1.5bn tonnes with average grades of 54 per cent iron. Marcona iron pellets and sinter are internationally known and have well-established markets in the Far East, Mexico and the US. Much of Marcona's attraction lies in its favourable geographical location. Some 265 miles (425 km) south of Lima, the mine is only eight miles from the deep water, Pacific coast port of San Nicolas, which, with minor improvements, is capable of handling 250,000-tonne cargo ships. No mine in the world is closer to a port, Hierro Peru officials claim. The climate too is favourable. Marcona's open pit mine can and does work 365 days a year. Unlike the world's major iron deposits, Marcona ore is primarily magnetite rather than hematite. The high sulphur content associated with magnetite demands costly processing and plenty of fresh water - a scarce commodity in Marcona's desert setting. Investment in drilling wells and installing pumps to improve product quality is essential, say Hierro Peru officials, since Marcona pellets currently carry hefty penalties on the international market. Earlier this year, Hierro Peru signed two long-term contracts with Kobe Steel of Japan and Imexsa of Mexico - the first for Dollars 90m over seven years, the second for Dollars 70m over three years. Almost half of this year's output will go to Korea, with 20 per cent to Japan and the remainder to the US and Argentina. It is not clear whether the CAP-Schmidheiny-Mitsubishi bid will include a debt-swap element. Mr Kuczynski is a debt-paper specialist and Mitsubishi has an undisclosed amount of Peruvian debt-paper pending from construction of the northern oil pipeline. In an interview with a Lima economic review, published yesterday, Mr Kuczynski underlined CAP's eagerness to expand its international interests in a field that it, along with its Mexican partners and Mitsubishi, knows well. He admitted that the investment climate in Peru was still uncertain but noted that 'assets are cheap, reflecting the very high risk that exists.' If, as a highly experienced former Marcona manager predicts, production can swiftly be doubled with profits of 'at least 30 per cent of sales', Hierro Peru begins to look an attractive option for the bolder investor.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / International Company News: FT-SE 100 Index and Irish companies THE FT-SE 100 Index Steering Committee has issued the following statement: An Irish company has complained to the EC Commission about the rules that exclude non-UK companies from the FT-SE 100 index, arguing that these discriminate against Irish companies. Though the complaint names the London Stock Exchange, the ground rules for the FT-SE index are set and interpreted by a committee of independent representatives of users of the market, and not by the London Stock Exchange. Mr Peter Jones, chairman of the steering committee, replying to the Irish company and to newspaper articles discussing its request for inclusion in the index, has previously stated: 'The FT-SE 100 was specifically, and very deliberately, designed to be an indicator of the performance of the UK market. 'The change of rules needed to allow non-UK companies to enter the index - whether Irish, American or Japanese - would be a fundamental change to the design of the index.' The London Stock Exchange has replied to the commission's preliminary inquiry, making it clear that in its view the complaint is misconceived in fact and law. The steering committee endorses the London Stock Exchange's response.</p>

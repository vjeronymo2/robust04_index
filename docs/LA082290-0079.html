			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS' DEMPSEY FINED, SUSPENDED FOR HIS PUNCH  </P> <P> Dodger catcher Rick Dempsey was fined $1,000 and given a one-day suspension,  and the Philadelphia Phillies' Lenny Dykstra was fined $500 Tuesday for their  roles in Monday's bench-clearing incident at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> Dempsey, who hit Dykstra at home plate in the seventh inning of the Dodgers 2-1  victory, has appealed the fine and suspension.  </P> <P> If it is upheld, the penalty will amount to $3,777.78, with the loss of one  day's pay for Dempsey.  </P> <P> "I had no interest in fighting, I did not provoke the fight," said Dempsey, who  hit Dykstra with his gloved left hand after Dykstra dropped his bat and took a  step toward Dempsey during an argument with umpire Ron Barnes.  </P> <P> "If a man is coming at you, are you going to let him hit you first?" Dempsey  said. "He was definitely coming at me. This is not fair."  </P> <P> Tom Lasorda, Dodger manager, said he thought Dykstra should have been  suspended.  </P> <P> "Yes, he provoked it, didn't he?" Lasorda said. "If you are hitting a pack of  dogs in a kennel and one of them comes out and bites you, who is at fault?"  </P> <P> Lasorda, however, said he supported National League President Bill White, who  issued the penalty.  </P> <P> "What (White) is saying is, in essence, is that he will not tolerate fighting  on the field, and I don't like to see it either," Lasorda said. "Here we are in  a pennant race . . . I don't want to lose a player to injury because of a fight  on the field."  </P></p>

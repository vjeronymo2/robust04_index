			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Comment): Modestly in the wrong direction When I hear Norman Lamont's very close supporters streaming out of the galleries, saying what a politically clever Budget it was, my natural suspicions are aroused. When I hear a more Thatcherite ex-minister saying it was not too big a give-away, I flee to have another look at the arithmetic. And when I hear a former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, now the chancellor's personal adviser, admit that the new Pounds 2,000 20 per cent band of income tax is just the proposal that the IFS had always denounced when it came from the Labour Party as an ineffective way of helping the poor, compared with increasing the thresholds, I suspect it is not my sort of Budget. One of Sir Geoffrey Howe's early acts as chancellor was to get rid of Labour's lower rate band. 'Only modestly in the wrong direction' is the norm for democratic politicians and is likely to be the shape of policy in the 1990s in most countries. The political cleverness presumably lies in the challenge to Labour to repeal a measure very much in its own image. Promising to enact the whole Labour manifesto would have been cleverer still. The Budget is much more likely to be remembered by the undertaking to replace the whole strange British Budget ritual by a proper Budget in December, announcing public expenditure and tax decisions together. The reform programme previously on the table - that of the Armstrong Committee which reported in 1980 - had in mind a Green Budget in the autumn followed by the normal Budget in March. The danger was that the period in between would be open season for every pressure group to push for more spending or special interest tax concessions. That may have been eliminated by retaining a single Budget day. The main drawback is that the chancellor would have to finalise his tax decisions more than three months before the beginning of the financial year. Finance ministers in other countries survive with a greater gap than that. Now for the Budget numbers. The biggest shock horror figure is not the chancellor's reliefs which amount to 'only' Pounds 2.6bn in a full year, less than half a per cent of GDP. What is that between friends? It is rather the total public sector borrowing requirement. Here again the figure to look at is not the headline Pounds 28bn for the coming financial year, but the Pounds 32bn (4 3/4 per cent of GDP) projected for 1993-94, when - if the Budget Red Book is to be believed - the economy will be two years into recovery. The accompanying chart shows that the envisaged deficits are higher, even as a percentage of GDP, than they were in the Thatcher recession, even though the Budget Red Book chart expects the present recession to be shallower and shorter. As far as it has gone, the deterioration in the public finances has not been disastrous. The Red Book shows the public sector debt ratio levelling off in the mid-1990s at just under 35 per cent, which would be well short of a debt trap in which the government had to borrow more and more simply to pay the interest on past deficits. But the reassurance does depend on public spending moving back to a modest path and real GDP going back to the trend of the 1980s. The trouble is that the route to an Italian-type fiscal problem is not through one large doctrinal misjudgment, but through a series of modest lapses, guided by wishful thinking. What can happen is illustrated in a very honest table (2B. 2) in the Red Book, which shows a deterioration of Pounds 25bn in the PSBR for both 1993-94 and 1994-95, compared with the projections made as recently as one year ago. As more than half the deterioration is on the expenditure side, it is difficult to attribute it all to recession. The Budget speech seemed to contain vestigial remnants of two alternative treatments which had been rejected. One was a throw-away reference to public sector investment of Pounds 30bn, the largest of the many possible definitions canvassed recently in the Treasury Bulletin. But if the Chancellor wants to unpack the expenditure side, he has also to unpack the revenue side and deal with capital receipts from privatisation, council house sales and even inheritance tax. We are a long way from a proper public sector capital account. The other rejected alternative came much earlier in the speech when Mr Lamont emphasised how useful the Maastricht framework was, irrespective of whether the UK adopted a single currency or not. It seemed for a moment that he would switch to the Maastricht budget deficit limit of 3 per cent of GDP. But in the end he veered back to the established objective of 'a balanced Budget over the economic cycle' - on the achievement of which I would not stake my life's savings. The fiscal risks are a European-wide phenomenon. The existence of a single liberalised capital market and much diminished currency risk means that any one government will find that it can borrow quite a lot without pushing up rates of interest against itself. But the totality of European-wide borrowing could increase the burdens on the planned European Central Bank, raise European real interest rates, and make for instability against currencies such as the dollar and the yen. No wonder the Bundesbank wants to see the fiscal side tied up before it comes on side. But if the fiscal prospect errs towards excessive borrowing, the monetary position risks being too tight. There is another very striking chart showing both broad money growth and bank and building society lending diving to a growth rate of little more than 5 per cent, compared with around 15 per cent in the mid-1980s. This is far from 'deflation', but still worrying. I take a middle view between the technical monetarists, who shout 'woe, woe, woe' and mainstream forecasters who carry on predicting recovery, which they simply project forward when it fails to occur. For despite all disappointments, the Treasury sees growth resuming at around 1 per cent in the first half of 1992, and gathering pace to reach 3 per cent in a year's time. The monetary numbers are a warning that the official forecasters could go wrong yet again, not a sure-fire prediction. If consumer and business borrowers decide that they have reduced their debts enough, and there were a return of animal spirits, the economy would pick up and the monetary numbers with it. One of Friedrich Hayek's seminal papers was entitled 'The Pretence of Knowledge'; and this is what both mainstream forecasters and their ferocious monetarist critics find difficult to avoid. The Red Book comes close to admitting it when its authors write: 'The rise in the debt-income ratio in the late-1982 was unprecedented, and past relationships provide little guide to how far consumers might now want to retrench.' Why not then publish a report on what is happening with an analysis of risks instead of a conventional forecast? What I always find most interesting about the Budget documents is not the crystal gazing, but the analysis of recent history. In chart after chart, the UK's remarkable success in reducing inflation to the German level emerges, coupled with the narrowing of the UK-German interest rate differential. Another success sign is the unmistakable way in which the British share of world trade in manufacturing, after decades of falling, has levelled off, or even slightly risen, in the last nine years or so. Meanwhile UK price and cost competitiveness, after a couple of years of deterioration, have now recovered to the mid-1980s level. The ERM link was not logically the only way of bringing down UK inflation and keeping it there. But it is one that seems to be working. It would be foolish to cast it aside because of a fatalistic belief that German interest rates will never come down, and that the UK cannot recover without a unilateral slashing of rates. It is surely better to hold on to, and lock in, the anti-inflationary gains, as Mrs Thatcher did not do in the mid-1980s, than to throw them away because of a horrified refusal to see western Europe as a single monetary zone, or to frighten oneself with projected balance of payments deficits just at a time when the Central Statistical Office has slashed the actual recorded deficit for last year by a quarter.</p>

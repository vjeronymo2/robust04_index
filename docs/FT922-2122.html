			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Court clears trustees to cut Maxwell pensions THE TRUSTEES of the Maxwell Communications works pension scheme were yesterday given High Court permission to 'eke out' their available funds by reducing the pensions of 3,640 pensioners to 31 per cent for the next five years. About 1,600 of the pensioners who are former employees of Mirror Group Newspapers will have their pensions topped up by MGN - although no guarantee has been given about how long that will continue. The remaining pensions will be topped up, for an unspecified period, out of the government's Pounds 2.5m stop-gap fund. The court was told that it would take Pounds 1.8m of the fund to top up all the works scheme pensions for a year. Continuation of the payment by the trustees of 31 per cent of pensions could be affected if the scheme were found to be in deficit to the common investment fund - the pot into which Maxwell pension funds were put for investment. The deficit might be as much as Pounds 11m. The court also said that the trustees could cease paying the annual 3 per cent pension increase required by the works scheme rules. Miss Sarah Asplin, for the trustees, told Sir Donald Nicholls, the Vice-Chancellor - senior Chancery Division judge - that it was discovered at the end of last year that about Pounds 109m was missing from the works scheme's funds. Describing the trustees' proposal as a fair, reasonable and sensible interim measure, Sir Donald said they should keep the situation under close review and return to court if it changed.</p>

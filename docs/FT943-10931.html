			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: Paper-makers feel the heat of a wild fire - Pulp and paper prices in North America are soaring This summer is turning out to be most unusual for North American pulp and paper producers and their customers. Instead of the traditionally quiet period when markets doze and prices drift, the industry is being swept by an edginess normally reserved at this time of year for raging forest fires. One segment of the paper market after another has caught alight. The upward pressure on prices, which began late last year with wood pulp and packaging materials such as linerboard and corrugated boxes, has gradually spread to newsprint and coated papers. Pulp prices have soared from a low of Dollars 390 a ton a year ago to Dollars 620. Newsprint mills have successfully pushed through one 7 per cent price increase, and are about to try another. Producers of uncoated freesheet (otherwise known as plain white paper) earlier this month announced their third - and biggest - price increase of the year. Signs of panic have appeared in some markets. Some pulp and containerboard suppliers have been forced to ration customers. Containerboard inventories are close to their lowest level in eight years. The most recent - and most dramatic - price jump has been for old cardboard boxes and newspapers, which are required for the rising recycled content of many grades of paper. Used newspapers fetch about Dollars 120 a ton on the US east coast, up from Dollars 70 per ton in May. While collectors of low-grade 'mixed paper' until recently paid recyclers up to Dollars 20 a ton to take the stuff away, they can now sell this material for Dollars 50 a ton or more. Newsprint producers which depend heavily on recycled material, such as Missouri-based Jefferson Smurfit, have found that the added cost of their raw materials has virtually wiped out the price increases announced so far this year. A recovery in paper prices comes as no surprise given the rebound in the North American economy. Improved business conditions have pushed up newspaper and magazine advertising lineage, as well as use of packaging materials and some business paper grades. US daily newspapers' consumption of newsprint was 6.1 per cent higher in June than a year earlier. 'The industry goes that way - from feast to famine,' says Mr Doug Young, a US paper consultant. But a number of special factors are also at work in this upswing. Paper prices sank to their lowest levels in decades during the 1991-93 recession, forcing several dozen mills to shut. 'Prices haven't been high enough to justify capacity expansions in many cases,' says Mr John Maine, analyst with Resource Information Systems, a Virginia consultancy. Canada's chemical pulp mills were operating full tilt at 107 per cent of capacity last month, up from 89 per cent in May. Furthermore, many customers are nervous that labour-contract talks under way at British Columbia's pulp and paper mills will break down later this summer, leading to a strike. Mr Wayne Mangels, director of market research at Bowater's US subsidiary, says the newsprint market, which is roughly in balance, would be deprived of about 35,000 tonnes of newsprint a week in the event of a strike there. The weak US and Canadian dollars, coupled with strong overseas demand, has further tightened domestic markets by encouraging exports. According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, Canadian mills shipped 364,700 tonnes of newsprint to Asian countries in the first five months of 1994, 29 per cent more than last year. Pulp exports to Japan surged by 46 per cent in the first half of the year. Japan is also one of the countries whose appetite for wastepaper has helped create the shortage in North America. In spite of the price increases and supply shortages, few companies are thinking of installing new capacity. 'Nobody has made enough money,' says Mr Bruce Kirk, analyst at SG Warburg in New York. Most companies are expected to wait until the recovery is on a more solid footing. Several deals in the pipeline could provide a glimpse of the investment outlook. The industry will take a close interest in the price Scott Paper is able to negotiate for SD Warren, the world's largest maker of coated free-sheet paper, which Scott has put up for sale. A number of prospective buyers are also hovering around a newsprint mill at Bear Island, Virginia. On the other hand, investment in recycling plants is booming as environmental laws require paper-makers to raise the recycled content of their products. According to the American Forest and Paper Association, US paper producers have 56 new recycling projects on the drawing boards. The industry's consumption of recovered paper has jumped by about a third in the past four years to 29.2m tons in 1993. The commissioning of so much recycling capacity raises fears, however, that the present shortage of old paper will seem insignificant compared with the scramble in a few years' time. Bowater's Mr Mangel estimates that about 65 per cent of used papers will need to be recovered within the next five years to meet demand, compared with around 50 per cent now. 'It could become a disaster,' he says. As a result, access to old newspapers, cardboard boxes and other wastepaper has become one of the North American industry's most pressing commercial and political concerns.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Politics accused of 'crippling' the NHS POLITICAL interference is crippling the National Health Service, its former personnel director said yesterday. Mr Eric Caines, head of the Centre for Health Service Mangement, described politics, in a study published yesterday, as the 'great inhibitor' in the running of the NHS. Mr Caines suggested that political considerations were breeding undue caution among personnel officers who had become more concerned with shielding and sheltering managers than with helping them take new directions. 'When the politics factor is combined with the vast degree of centralisation which is the general pattern in the public sector, and certainly within the NHS, the effect at field level is crippling,' he said. The health service would remain 'low-key and cautious' in its approach to new developments which might raise the political temperature. 'It is difficult to see how, all else being equal, it is going to change in the foreseeable future.' Mr Caines also attacked centralised pay structures: 'Can any system ever have been better devised to stifle initiative and imagination and to breed frustration?' View From The Bridge.

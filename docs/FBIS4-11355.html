			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with President-elect Armando Calderon </F> Sol in San Salvador by Guillermo Rodriguez in Santa Fe de Bogota  on 25 April; from the "Caracol's 0600-0900" newscast -- live or  recorded]    [Text] [Rodriguez] Good morning, Dr. Calderon.  Congratulations on your victory.    [Calderon] Thank you very much. Thank you also for Radio  Caracol's coverage of these elections and for being present in  our country, your efforts to unite the America's, and our  brother nations of Colombia and El Salvador. I would like to  say that I have become and will continue to be a servant of the  Salvadoran people. In addition, I am at the disposal of the  Colombian people.    [Rodriguez] Dr. Calderon, are you now extending an olive  branch to those who not so long ago were your political rivals?    [Calderon] Yes, I am extending my hand to all the Salvadoran  people. I am no longer the presidential candidate but the  president of all Salvadorans; those who voted and those who did  not vote for me. I have become the president and head of state  of El Salvador who is going to work for all Salvadorans,  regardless of their political affiliation or ideology. I plan  to work for all Salvadorans. In this respect, I also extend my  hand and call on all the political sectors that in spite of  their positions of genuine and conscientious opposition, to  grant me the opportunity to govern El Salvador.    [Rodriguez] Dr. Calderon, since we Colombians are not  fortunate enough to know you that well, and we expect to see you  shortly in Colombia, briefly tell us something about Armando  Calderon Sol.    [Calderon] Armando Calderon Sol is a fighter. A fighter for  peace, progress, and liberty in El Salvador. Armando Calderon  Sol is a relatively young politician who entered the political  scene at an early age as a result of the chaos and anarchy that  prevailed in El Salvador. I have been the mayor of San Salvador  for two consecutive terms. I was deputy to the National  Assembly. I have been a fighter for the defense of liberty in  our country. I am a conservative, and I believe that populism  and demagoguery have done too much harm to our country as well  as to Latin America. Those past populist and demagogue leaders  who interfered on so many occasions and believed in socialist  solutions only encouraged corruption and discredit to the  countries. I believe there is a new ideological rebirth taking  place. It is a rebirth of conservative ideas, and it is a  rebirth for everyone where liberty prevails. Pragmatism and  ideologies have been discarded.    [Rodriguez] There is no doubt Dr. Armando Calderon, that  that  is how it is. Now we will speak to Armando Calderon Sol, the  statesman. What will your first government task be? What does  El Salvador most urgently need?    [Calderon] I believe my first task should be to consolidate  the state of law, peace, and social harmony. We must ensure  social peace. We have been able to silence the weapons; we have  accomplished peace in the country, now we need a genuine social  peace. To ensure this, we have to assert the state of law in  this country and we have to consolidate it. Actions should be  directed to this purpose. We must validate our goodwill. We  must also improve police performance, and create the conditions  of citizens safety all Salvadorans are demanding. We must  provide all Salvadorans safety for their lives and property. It  is unacceptable for us to come out of political violence and  then fall prey to common violence.    [Rodriguez] What is pending in the peace process that your  government must meet so the process can have credibility in the  eyes of your nation and the international community.    [Calderon Sol] I believe, on our part, there is a great deal  of willingness to fulfill the peace agreements. I believe these  agreements are [word indistinct]; they are agreements belonging  to the whole nation and they must be faithfully kept. The only  issue left unresolved is the total and absolute dissolution of  the National Police and for the National Civilian Police to be  deployed throughout the territory. This is our recently  organized constitutional institution that will give security to  the citizens nationwide.    We, in our future government, have made a commitment to  totally support the National Civilian Police, support its new  Police Academy, and as soon as possible dissolve the National  Police and have the National Civilian Police operating at full  strength.    The other pending issues are some recommendations by the  Truth Commission, such as the improvement in Salvadoran justice  and the improvement in the administration of justice. We all  agree on this, there is national consensus that for Salvador's  social peace, for the consolidation of the process, it needs  speedy and efficient justice; Salvadoran justice must be  improved. In terms of this we have the political willingness to  implement constitutional reforms that will bring better and more  efficient justice to the Salvadoran people.    [Rodriguez] What type of economic, political, diplomatic,  and  integration relations are you going to maintain with nations  such as the Andean Group?    [Calderon Sol] We want to have very close trade relations  with Colombia and the Andean Group. What is more, we would like  a true integration of America as a whole. We have this very  clear idea in our mind, this very clear idea that you have  upheld; that is the Bolivarian idea. We believe that NAFTA has  to spread to all the Americas, and we should struggle for a true  economic integration to enter the world's largest world market  which is and will be the United States with Canada and Mexico.  All the Americas should form a true integration. In this way,  all the nations of the Americas, this immortal America, will  have true integration, the overcoming of difficulties, and  sustained development.    [Rodriguez] The opposition points to you as a right-wing man  linked to processes already overcome in El Salvador. What can  be done for El Salvador to recover that lost unity so that  yesterday's opposition can work, if not in the government, at  least to the benefit of El Salvador as a whole.    [Calderon Sol] I believe we have made a great deal of  progress. Peace is gaining more ground each day. It is being  consolidated; it is being strengthened. Currently, with the  political participation in this 20 March historical event, the  radical left wing, the left wing that destroyed infrastructure,  that caused destruction during the war, finally participated in  this political event. It has been able to open the road for its  political participation. They won 21 deputy seats in a  parliament of 84 deputies. Former commanders, the majority,  former commanders of the Salvadoran guerrillas are in our  Legislative Assembly.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Kohl's ally wins Bavarian poll: Victory for CSU boosts German leader's re-election chances Bavaria's ruling Christian Social Union (CSU), Chancellor Helmut Kohl's closest ally in the German coalition government, last night won an absolute majority in the last state election before the federal poll on October 16. The unexpectedly good CSU result will give a boost to Mr Kohl's re-election chances. However, the Free Democratic party (FDP), the junior partner in Mr Kohl's government, suffered another setback; preliminary official results showed the party failing to gain the 5 per cent needed for a place in the state parliament. The CSU, the more conservative sister party of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), scored 52.8 per cent, according to the preliminary results. Mr Theo Waigel, CSU leader and Bonn finance minister, said: 'I am very satisfied. We can be very pleased with this result.' Mr Edmund Stoiber, the Bavarian premier, said: 'This is good support for Kohl and Waigel.' The opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) failed to make the breakthrough it hoped for, winning 30.1 per cent, but this was a substantial recovery from the 26 per cent it polled at the last state elections four years ago. The leftwing Green party will return to the state legislature with 6.1 per cent, while the FDP fell from 5.2 per cent last time to 2.8 per cent. The far-right Republican party, which had hoped to get at least 10 per cent, scored 3.9 per cent, down from 4.9 per cent four years ago. The result is an endorsement of Mr Stoiber, the Bavarian state premier, who has had to work hard to breathe life into a party battered by corruption scandals in the past 18 months. The result is the worst showing for the CSU in 20 years, but it has nonetheless won an absolute majority in the state legislature for the ninth time running. The SPD has improved its position, but will be disappointed at failing to deny the CSU its absolute majority. The SPD has never won more than 36 per cent in Bavaria, the most conservative of Germany's 16 Lander. Although the party began the year with promising results in opinion polls and Mrs Renate Schmidt, its leader in Bavaria, fought a spirited campaign, voters returned to old allegiances in a relatively high turnout. Around 68 per cent of the 8.7m eligible Bavarians voted, about 2 percentage points more than four years ago, contradicting suggestions that voters had become apathetic. The outcome for the Republicans in the German state in which their support has traditionally been strongest is a severe reverse, and confirms that they are unlikely to get into the German Bundestag at the forthcoming general election. Mr Stoiber said last night the sharp drop in support for the Republicans was 'the second best result of the evening'. The FDP said the election result had no bearing on its likely performance in the federal poll, arguing that it had often failed in state elections but had never lost its Bundestag seats.

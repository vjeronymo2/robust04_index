			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NTC News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Within the next few months the Army will change all  of its weapons. The decision is part of a technological  updating process that will provide the Armed Forces with more  weapons to fight the guerrillas.    Among the weapons that will be changed are the estimated  100,000 rifles currently owned by the military; the same amount  of rifles will be purchased. The new 5.56 mm rifles will be of  the same brand and will have the same characteristics as the  U.S.-made M-16 and Israeli-made Galil rifles currently used in  Colombia. Each weapon will cost between $1,500 and $3,000.  This means that the investment being considered could cost 200  billion pesos.    INDUMIL [State Military Industry Enterprise], which produces  ammunition and weapons in Colombia, is conducting the technical  and economic evaluation. Although the study is well under way,  it may still last several months. In the United States, it took  a year to make a similar decision.    The new Armed Forces rifles have been characterized as  merciful. They were invented to wound instead of kill in combat.  According to experts, they are more detrimental to the enemy,  because they immobilize not only the wounded soldier but also  those who come to his aid. These weapons are also lighter,  which makes them more maneuverable, and they allow quicker troop  deployment and facilitate the transportation of larger amounts  of ammunition. They also reduce risks when there are incidents  at checkpoints and during urban patrols.</p>

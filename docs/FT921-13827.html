			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Bank criticised by DTI report STANDARD CHARTERED Bank has been strongly criticised in a Department of Trade and Industry report into events at Milford Docks Company between 1983 and 1987 for the 'astonishing ease' with which the company was able to borrow a total of Pounds 2.3m from the bank in 1985 and 1986. Government inspectors reported on Thursday that much of the money loaned by Standard Chartered had gone towards servicing the company's losses. They also criticised a number of directors of Milford Docks of the period, saying there had been breaches of Stock Exchange rules and fiduciary duty.</p>

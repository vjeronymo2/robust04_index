			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ENCINA SEWAGE PLANT TESTS CLEAN, BUT FISH CONTINUE TO DIE IN ITS OUTPUT  </P> <P> No doubt about it -- far too many fathead minnows are floating belly up.  </P> <P> It may not sound like a terribly pressing problem, but the deaths of these tiny  fish have officials at the Encina sewage plant in Carlsbad mystified.  </P> <P> Like other facilities throughout the region, Encina periodically dumps the  minnows into special tanks to test the toxicity of the 20 million gallons of  treated sewage it pumps into the ocean each day.  </P> <P> Of late, the fish haven't been doing so famously.  </P> <P> Eager to find out why, operators of the sprawling sewage plant, which serves  about half of North County, agreed Wednesday to spend up to $74,000 for a  private consultant to investigate what may be causing the toxicity problem at  the plant.  </P> <P> Although plant officials insist that the higher-than-normal toxic readings do  not pose a health threat or environmental danger in the ocean, they remain  concerned, noting that Encina is now exceeding state limits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Help From Tests  </P> <P> Indeed, the Regional Water Quality Control Board when it meets on Monday is  expected to slap the facility with an order requiring that the problem be  corrected within a year.  </P> <P> Encina officials have been particularly puzzled because tests for more than 150  types of toxics and hazardous chemicals ranging from DDT to PCBs and heavy  metals have come up below detectable limits, both for the raw sewage coming  into the plant and for the treated effluent that flows into the ocean.  </P> <P> But minnows have all too often been dying off and turning keel up.  </P> <P> Rick Graff, Encina general manager, said, "It could be that some normal  chemical, something that's typically OK in the environment, is combining with  something at the plant, and it's reached a level that these little minnows  can't accept."  </P> <P> The minnow test has been a staple at sewage plants for years. Researchers dump  the minnows into test tanks filled with concentrations of effluent drawn from  Encina. The 2 1/2-inch fresh-water fish are allowed to swim in the stuff --  about 10 per tank -- over a four-day period, then officials count the number  that have survived.  </P> <P> A mathematical formula is used to determine the survival rate. Over a month, a  limit of 1.5 is deemed acceptable under state standards, but Encina has  exceeded that limit during seven of the last eight months, with a high of 2.16  in October. The lowest monthly reading, a 1.49 in November, just squeaked under  the barrier.  </P> <P> Graff said the numbers are not particularly lofty, but he remains resolved to  find out just what's causing the plant to so regularly exceed the allowed  limits. In the meantime, he argues, the ocean is not suffering.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Problem Believed in Plant  </P> <P> "In discussing this with the regional board and operators of other treatment  plants, we don't see any environmental problems at all," Graff said.  </P> <P> If the regional board goes forward on Monday with an order for the plant to  clean up the toxicity problem, Encina officials will be required to submit a  report by mid-August recommending how the situation can be rectified. The plant  must comply with the limits by the beginning of March, 1990, or it could face  penalties.  </P> <P> Graff remains confident that the problem is inside the plant, and is not being  caused by some business or private entity illegally dumping toxics that find a  way to Encina.  </P> <P> For starters, there have been the negative readings on tests for heavy metals  and other dangerous elements. Moreover, such hazardous materials typically  wreak havoc with the normal treatment processes at a plant, an event that has  not occurred at Encina.  </P> <P> "We've checked what comes in our front door and what goes out our back door,  and there's nothing there. We've also got a good handle on what industry is out  there, and that doesn't appear to be a problem," Graff said. "There just may be  some oddball chemical that we've not yet identified that's causing the  problem."  </P> <P> After the high readings began to appear, Graff and other Encina officials  expressed hope that a switch to a more intensive treatment process at the plant  late last year would clean up the toxicity problem.  </P> <P> But instituting the treatment, which involves sending every gallon of sewage  through a bubbling basin where a biological chain-reaction chews up germs, has  had no effect on the toxicity.  </P></p>

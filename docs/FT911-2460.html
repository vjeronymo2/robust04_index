			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Firm advance as new account opens LONDON STOCKS had a firm start yesterday to a long three-week account which is likely to be dominated by the results of Thursday's UK local government elections. However, trading was thinand much of the improvement was the result of technical and currency factors. The performance of the dollar, after the weekend's G7 meeting in Washington, dominated early trading. The Tokyo stock market was closed for a national holiday. The dollar's initial strength led to a hesitant start to London equity trading and the FT-SE 100 index opened slightly lower. Traders had taken theview, however, that uncertainty ahead of the polls would hit shares harder. A modest 2.6-point fall in the Footsie led them to cover their bear positions in the futures market. As the premium on the Footsie future increased, the dollar steadied and sterling rose against the D-Mark. The market recovered its nerve, taking account of weekend opinion polls, which seemed to indicate that the Conservative party might be able to avoid electoral humiliation on Thursday. Equity strategists underlined at least the short-term significance of such a possibility. 'The poll is pivotal for the market,' said Mr John Reynolds of County NatWest. If this happened, sterling would strengthen and there would be morescope for interest rate cuts. The cash futures market seemed to respond to similar thoughts, taking its view of three-month interest rates from a cut of 1/2 per cent to one of  3/4 per cent. Gilts were more equivocal, with shorts barely changed and medium and long-dated issues slightly lower. Mr Paul Waltonat James Capel said there was a case for the government to cut rates before thenext set of UK inflation figures, due on May 17th. The headline rate of inflation for the year to April is likely to show a sharp fall to little more than 6 per cent; this would underpin confidence and minimise the effect of any rate reduction on sterling. Mr Walton said that some in the market felt a cut before Thursday's polls was a possibility, although most traders thought this unlikely. The net effect of short covering in the futures and talk of interest rate reductions and the opinion polls was to push the Footsie index to 0.1 points short of regaining the 2,500 mark. An erratic opening from Wall Street pulled the index back briefly before it edged higher once again to close at 2498.6, up 26.9 points on the day. Trading volume was low by the standards of the last few weeks at 366.1m shares. This backed up strategists' views that there would be little concerted buying or selling by institutions before Thursday. Individual share price movements yesterday were few, although internationally quoted shares showed good rises almost across the board as the dollar rose. In the absence of any further large rights issues, most other big capitalisation stocks firmed in line with the market. Talk of more job losses at Marks and Spencer were confirmed, as were some of the more pessimistic forecasts on how strict are to be the controls on British Gas pricing by the UK government regulatory body, Ofgas. Bid activity was limited to a tender offer for 18 1/2 per cent of retail chain Etam from South African group Oceana, and a Pounds 3.2m offer for 35 per cent of football club Tottenham Hotspur led by Mr Terry Venables, the team manager. Shares in Tottenham have been suspended since October 1990.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Enlarged Babcock 7% ahead BABCOCK International, the engineering contractor, cushioned itself against the effects of the UK recession by spreading its activities across a wider range of industries and expanding its business on the Continent. Pre-tax profit advanced by 7 per cent to Pounds 50.1m (Pounds 46.7m) on turnover of Pounds 830m (Pounds 761m) last year. Operating profit went up 12 per cent to Pounds 43.1m (Pounds 38.5m), but net interest income fell to Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 8.2m) because of falling rates. At the March 31 year-end, net cash stood at just over Pounds 100m, compared with Pounds 69.3m. Mr Erik Porter, finance director, said this was 'a bit of a freak' following a rush of advance payments. The normal level was about Pounds 60m, of which about half was Babcock's. The group issued shares during the year to buy a Swedish company and to strengthen the balance sheet. With the help of Pounds 23m retained profit, net assets advanced from Pounds 70m to Pounds 102m. Three of the five divisions improved profitability, including the new materials handling division formed from Claudius Peters in Germany, Consilium, the Pounds 21.4m Swedish acquisition, and a UK subsidiary. Materials handling profit rose 44 per cent to Pounds 7.2m. including a big flue-gas desulphurisation contract at Drax power station, improved to Pounds 17.5m (Pounds 15.7m). Construction and process plant contributed Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 10.5m) after securing more overseas work and increasing its penetration of the oil, steel and pharmaceuticals industries. Facilities management - the Rosyth Royal Dockyard - slipped to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 10.7m) because of delays in a submarine refit programme. The only serious setback came in South Africa, which was Pounds 3m down at Pounds 7.1m following a slump in platinum mining. The Pounds 14m settlement of a dispute arising from the liquidation of IBH Holding in Germany, was about Pounds 6m less than Babcock had provided for, leading to an extraordinary gain of that amount. After a reduced minority charge of Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 3.2m), but a higher tax rate, earnings per share rose to 6.94p (6.56p). A proposed final dividend of 1.9p makes a total of 3.15p (3p). COMMENT Babcock's share price, which sunk to 52p before the general election, has outperformed the FT-A All-Share index by 18 per cent since then and the re-rating is well deserved. Although it is still suspected of being a late-cycle group because of some long-term contracts, it has become adept at casting its net widely for smaller, quicker orders. It says it is not unhappy that the year-end order book was about Pounds 40m down at Pounds 580m, especially as about Pounds 100m has been added since. Some analysts, however, remain unconvinced and point to limited recovery potential. It is true that earnings growth will be restricted this year by falling interest income, a higher tax charge and increased equity. However, the potential contributions from Consilium, which made Pounds 500,000 profit in six weeks last year and from a joint venture with Yorkshire Water bode well, as do the reasonable prices paid for these businesses. Pre-tax profit is forecast to reach about Pounds 57m this year, giving an undemanding prospective p/e of less than 10 on yesterday's close of 69p, supported by a yield of more than 6 per cent.</p>

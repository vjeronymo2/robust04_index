			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Management: Calling the NHS to account - Alan Pike asks if health authority reforms have reduced or increased the potential for mismanagement There are no sessions entitled 'Mismanagement, Negligence and Waste' on the agenda for this week's annual conference of the managers who run the National Health Service. But these topics will dominate much of the informal discussion. When Sir Duncan Nichol, NHS chief executive, addressed the Institute of Health Services Management conference last year he warned his staff away from introducing 'macho management' personnel styles to the service. It would not be surprising if this time he delivered a far sterner lecture on public-sector probity and ethics. Sir Duncan has been compelled recently to make some uncomfortable appearances before the Commons public accounts committee, trying to explain the waste of at least Pounds 20m in the Wessex Regional Health Authority and Pounds 10m in the West Midlands. The committee has heard tales of conflicts of interest, irregularities in the awarding of contracts and repeated failures of managerial and financial controls. Behind the specifics, a series of still bigger questions await answering. These relate to the quality of accountability procedures in the NHS and whether lay members of health authorities and trust hospital boards, appointed to represent the public interest, are exerting sufficient check on full-time managers. Both the West Midlands and Wessex affairs originated before the 1991 NHS reforms, which were designed to make the service more market-based. They have provoked a debate over whether the new structure has reduced the potential for undetected mismanagement, or increased it. Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, has set up a review of NHS management structure which is due to report next month. She is under pressure to make the service more flexible through further decentralisation. But both the health secretary and her review group recognise that - welcome as relaxation of central controls might be in terms of releasing managerial talent and making the NHS more market-driven - any changes will have to stand the test of public accountability. District auditors' inquiries in the West Midlands and Wessex have generated some headline-making reports, such as the expenses of management consultants in the West Midlands - employed to recommend ways of saving public money - which included hired aircraft and lavish entertainment. More mundanely, but in many ways more seriously, the reports contain examples of scrutiny and accountability procedures that did not work. Take the West Midlands' separate, regionally managed services division and the panel set up to form a link between its director and the health authority board. According to the auditor: 'The board relied on the panel to control the director. The chairman of the panel regarded its role merely as a sounding-board for the director. 'The director ignored the panel and did not report to the regional health authority board. The regional health authority chairman and members of the board said they did not know what was going on in respect of the supplies contract. The director continually asserted that his action had regional health authority support.' Another auditor's report describes a meeting at which the Wessex Information Group awarded a computer systems contract to an Andersen Consulting/IBM consortium. The meeting was inquorate - only one member of the group, plus the then chairman of the health authority in an ex officio capacity, was present, but it nonetheless resolved to award the contract. Two versions of the minutes were prepared. One, distributed only to those who had attended the meeting, recorded the decision to award the contract to Andersen Consulting/IBM. The second version, circulated to absent members, did not. It was the second version that formed the basis of the agenda for the next health authority meeting: the authority was not formally informed that the contract had been awarded until after it had been signed. A similar failure of lay members to regulate the activities and enthusiasms of individual senior managers also played a part in the problems leading to the collapse of the London Ambulance Service's computerised despatch system. An official inquiry in February concluded that, while lines of accountability looked secure on paper, the ambulance service board 'was not given, nor did it seek' sufficient information to exercise its responsibilities for managing the service. After publication of the highly critical report, board members blamed the unco-operative attitude of a particularly determined chief executive. The government's 1991 reforms of the NHS have made health authorities smaller and more businesslike. Sir Robin Buchanan, the present chairman of Wessex, has said that members of his old-style authority treated it like a committee, while the new non-executive members felt firmly part of the management process. This was certainly the intention of the reforms. 'Working for Patients', the government white paper that introduced them, set out to end a system in which 'many members, such as those appointed directly by local authorities or on the advice of trade unions and professional bodies, usually regard themselves as representatives'. Today's non-executive members of health authorities and trusts are appointed for their skills and experience, with some regions advertising for trust board members to attract the widest range of applicants. Critics of the changes fear, however, that individual appointees risk finding themselves in a weak and lonely position if they try to challenge senior managers who are excessively secretive, domineering or idiosyncratic in style. Although the presence of nominees from local authorities and other bodies sometimes politicised old-style health authorities, the nominees could at least call for the backing of their sponsoring organisations in an argument. New procedures are in place in the West Midlands and Wessex aimed at preventing future problems and the Department of Health is trying to apply stronger national guidelines. Sir Duncan has asked the Audit Commission to give increased attention to probity issues when auditing health service accounts; the commission has also launched its own investigation into corruption in local government and the NHS. Accountability issues have been included on the agenda of the review of NHS structure currently taking place, Both the department and the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts are examining ways of enhancing the development and training of non-executive members of health authorities and trust boards. The association has told the structure review that it supports further decentralisation of decision-making, but accepts that more must be done to ensure non-executive board members discharge their duties in a way that 'commands high confidence with the public'. The association is urging all authorities to state publicly which areas of decision-making must be taken by the full board and publish standing orders and financial instructions. It also believes boards should have audit and remuneration sub-committees chaired by non-executive members and is working with Manchester University's health services management unit on the development of a 'company secretary' role in health authorities and trusts. 'It is essential that the board as a whole, rather than just the chairman and the chief executive, is held and seen to be held to account for the authority or trust's activities and performance,' concludes the association's evidence. Getting to this point is a priority for the NHS as pressure grows to increase the day-to-day freedoms of district health authorities and trusts. Even the most ardent advocates of devolution know that it will not work if, whenever there is a serious problem, the people down the line say no one told them what was going on.</p>

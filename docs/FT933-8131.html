			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Nigeria's government proscribes newspapers NIGERIA'S military government yesterday proscribed newspapers shut last month, including one owned by Chief Moshood Abiola, victorious candidate in the June presidential poll which was subsequently annulled by General Ibrahim Babangida. Mr Abiola, interviewed in London, condemned the action, saying: 'This is just the beginning of a new darknes of a type Nigerians never believed they deserved. Babangida has signalled to the world that consent no longer forms any part of the code of government.' The decree outlaws newspapers published by the Concord group, owned by Mr Abiola, as well as those of Punch, the Daily Sketch and Bendel Newspaper Corporation. The government closed the publications on July 22 in the biggest press clampdown since independence in 1960, accusing the papers of bias. General Babangida postponed a speech to the National Assembly yesterday, and is expected to give details of his proposed interim government today, his 52nd birthday. Yesterday's clampdown on the press reinforced widespread doubts that he will hand effective power to the new administration. Lagos re-opened for business yesterday after a three-day mass stay-at-home protest, which left the city deserted from Thursday to Saturday. The Campaign for Democracy, which organised the protest, promised more action, saying that 'the struggle to terminate military dictatorship from our land has just begun and to that extent no amount of intimidation  ..victimisation and oppression can stop the on-going people's march towards democracy.' Thousands of people are fleeing the cities, particularly in the south-west, Mr Abiola's political strongold. 'As we get nearer the fateful 27th of August, the spate of flight has escalated,' the Lagos Guardian newspaper said in an editorial. 'The climate of fear is exacerbated by widespread rumours of large caches of arms discovered in different parts of the country, of communities determinedly arming themselves,' it added.</p>

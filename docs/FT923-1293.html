			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Germany unites with France to defend the franc: Banks intervene amid hectic trading GERMANY AND France yester-day forged a united front to defend the French franc and the remains of the European Monetary System from renewed speculative attack but were still unsure of victory after a day of intense currency trading. As the European exchange rate mechanism experienced another day of crisis, France pushed its short term interest rates sharply higher and both the German Bundesbank and Bank of France intervened heavily in support of the franc. For the first time, the Bundesbank intervened within the official margins of the ERM in support of another currency. Strains were apparent elsewhere in the ERM as Spain reintroduced capital controls to protect the peseta less than eight months after lifting them and within a week of devaluing the Spanish currency by 5 per cent. The Irish punt remained under intense selling pressure, while the Portuguese escudo closed weak. In London, it is expected that in today's emergency Commons debate on the economy, Mr John Major, the prime minister, will step us his demands for ERM reform. The large-scale selling of the franc produced a bitter - even bloodthirsty - response from Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister. 'During the (French) revolution, such people were known as speculators and they were beheaded,' he said. 'We must make the speculators pay . . . hit them where it hurts - in their wallets.' Several analysts suggested last night that France's foreign exchange reserves were exhausted, but there was no official information to back these claims. Currency dealers in London estimated that the Bank of France could have spent more than FFr50bn worth of foreign currency, or more than half its reserves, in recent days to defend the franc. Estimates of Bundesbank intervention over the past two days ranged between DM10bn and 064DM30bn. The Franco-German attempt to crush the speculation started at dawn yesterday. As currency trading began in Paris, the Bank of France raised its five to 10 day repurchase rate from 10.5 per cent to 13 per cent, triggering a sharp rise in money market rates. It was the first increase since last December in the repurchase rate, at which commercial banks borrow short-term money from the French central bank, often to fund currency dealings. The central banks and finance ministries of France and Germany also issued a rare joint statement stressing there was no justification for an EMS parity change between the franc and the D-Mark. 'France and Germany will fight this speculation, which is based on no economic fundamentals,' Mr Sapin said. This verbal support was followed by more heavy intervention by both central banks. The Bundesbank openly intervened to support the franc at levels above its mandatory intervention point against the D-Mark for the first since the ERM was founded. By last night, the battle between the markets and the central banks seemed evenly matched. The franc closed in London at FFr3.4120 to the D-Mark, slightly stronger than on Tuesday but still close to its lower limit of FFr3.4305. In early Far East trading it was quoted at FFr3.4065. However, several analysts believe another Frenchinterest rate rise could be on the way, perhaps in the central bank's intervention rate. This rate, which was left unchanged yesterday, is the one that determines French base rates which currently stand at 9.85 per cent. The Spanish decision effectively to re-introduce exchange controls was to avoid another interest rate rise. Spain decided to force domestic banks to match loans to foreign investors by depositing an equal sum, interest free with the Bank of Spain. The move represented a humiliating climbdown for Spain which had hailed the removal of controls earlier this year as an important step in its economic integration with the rest of the European Community. Yesterday it was reported that the European Commission in Brussels had contacted the Spanish authorities to establish whether these capital controls were compatible with EC single market laws. The currency crisis has prompted Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, to call on leading nations to examine global capital flows. His comments came as the dollar opened at Y119.90 in Tokyo, a record Tokyo intraday low.

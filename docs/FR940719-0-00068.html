The amendments revise the limits established for maximum patient entrance exposure rates for fluoroscopic x-ray systems during high-level control and other modes of operation. The revisions are being made due to concerns regarding excessively large radiation exposure rates on some fluoroscopic x-ray systems. In addition, an inadvertent error is being corrected to improve the accuracy of the regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> May 19, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Patricia M.

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .) as amended, FDA is amending the performance standard for diagnostic x-ray systems and their major components in &sect;1020.32 (21 CFR 1020.32) by revising the limits established for maximum patient entrance exposure rates for fluoroscopic x-ray systems during high-level control and other modes of operation. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of August 15, 1972 (37 FR 16461), the performance standard was published as a final rule which became effective on August 1, 1974. Since that time, there have been several amendments to the performance standard. These amendments take into account new technology, clarify misinterpreted provisions, or incorporate additional requirements determined to be necessary to provide for adequate radiation safety of diagnostic x-ray systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA determined that further changes to the standard were necessary, in view of concerns regarding the potential for unnecessary radiation exposures to patients from some current fluoroscopic x-ray system designs. Therefore, FDA developed proposed draft amendments to the performance standard, which were discussed during a public meeting of the Technical Electronic Product Radiation Safety Standards Committee (TEPRSSC) on November 14, 1990. The proposed amendments that were discussed included the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Replacement of the current two-tier system of entrance exposure rate limits applicable during normal fluoroscopy on systems with automatic exposure rate control (AERC) with a single upper limit of 2.58x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  coulomb per kilogram (C/kg) per minute (10 roentgens per minute (R/min)), regardless of mode of operation; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Establishment of an upper limit of 5.16x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  C/kg per minute (20 R/min) on entrance exposure rate during high-level control mode of fluoroscopy; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Establishment of a requirement for an AERC mode of operation for any fluoroscopic x-ray system capable of operating at an entrance exposure rate greater than 1.29x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  C/kg per minute (5 R/min); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Application of the entrance exposure rate limits discussed in paragraphs (1) and (2) above during continuous recording of dynamic fluoroscopic images with a videotape recorder or similar device. The application of the entrance exposure rate limit during continuous recording requires a distinction between the continuous mode of operation and various modes of operation in which the x-ray exposure is pulsed. Therefore, a definition of pulsed mode of operation is being added. This is necessary because a consensus as to appropriate limits for the various pulsed recording modes does not exist and further study is needed before such a limit is imposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TEPRSSC approved the content of the proposed amendments and concurred with publication of them for public comment. FDA proposed the amendments to the performance standard in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of May 3, 1993 (58 FR 26407). Interested persons were given until August 2, 1993, to comment on the proposal. FDA received and considered one comment each from a radiological physicist and a professional organization representing radiologists and physicists. Both comments supported the proposed changes and suggested several additional amendments to the standard. These comments also addressed fluoroscopy-related issues on which FDA specifically solicited comments in the preamble to the proposed rule. FDA appreciates having received these comments and will consider them in the context of possible future rulemaking activities related to fluoroscopic x-ray systems. A summary of the comments pertaining to the proposal of May 3, 1993, and FDA's responses are discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In addition, in the final rule that published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of May 3, 1993 (58 FR 26386 at 26398), in &sect;1020.30(b) (21 CFR 1020.30(b), the acronym ``SID'' for source-image receptor distance was inadvertently omitted. This document is also correcting that error. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary and Analysis of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Both of the comments received concurred with all of the proposed amendments to the performance standard, except that one of the comments suggested changing the proposed upper limit on entrance exposure rate during the high-level control mode of operation. That comment advocated a limit of 3.87x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  C/kg per minute (15 R/min), rather than the proposed limit of 5.16x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  C/kg per minute (20 R/min), but noted a lack of objective data to support the recommendation. The other comment concurred with the proposed limit of 5.16x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  C/kg per minute (20 R/min) and noted that a number of manufacturers provide equipment which does not exceed 2.58x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  C/kg per minute (10 R/min) during fluoroscopy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment advocating a lower limit did not submit specific data supporting that position. The second comment on the appropriate upper limit to be imposed on entrance exposure rate during high-level control mode of operation noted that a lower limit was consistent with certain existing equipment, but nonetheless supported the limit proposed by FDA. After reviewing these comments, FDA concludes that its choice of an upper limit is a reasonable one. The objective in establishing such a limit is to provide a mode of operation that will reasonably accommodate unusual imaging requirements, but also will prevent unnecessarily high exposure rates. The limit proposed was based on the observation that the majority of fluoroscopic x-ray systems equipped with high-level control, which were evaluated in conjunction with FDA testing for compliance with the performance standard, are limited to maximum entrance exposure rates of less than 5.16x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  C/kg per minute (20 R/min). The proposed limit was also based on discussions with medical physicists regarding their experience in limiting entrance exposure rates, which indicated that a limit of 5.16x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  C/kg per minute (20 R/min) eliminates unnecessarily high exposure rates without compromising the use of the equipment. FDA interprets the lack of significant adverse comment on this proposal as an indication of general agreement with the proposed limit. Therefore, FDA rejects the suggestion that a limit of 3.87x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  C/kg per minute (15 R/min) be established for the maximum entrance exposure rate, and is establishing the upper limit of 5.16x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  C/kg per minute (20 R/min) as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA notes that recommendations related to limits on entrance exposure rate resulted from a workshop on fluoroscopy cosponsored by FDA and the American College of Radiology (ACR) in October of 1992 (Ref. 2). These recommendations generally favored limiting exposure rates from fluoroscopic x-ray systems in some manner and included suggestions for limiting the maximum exposure rate to the input surface of the image intensifier tube. FDA has chosen not to include these suggestions in this final rule because they were beyond the scope of the proposal. FDA will carefully consider the recommendations from the workshop related to limiting exposure rates in conjunction with future amendments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. One of the comments suggested that the requirement for a continuous audible signal during the high-level control mode of operation be modified to specify that the signal be emitted at the fluoroscopic imaging assembly (at an FDA-specified volume level), to ensure that the signal is audible to the fluoroscopist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current requirement for a continuous audible signal is that the signal must be audible to the fluoroscopist, which would seem to meet the intent of the comment. As with any medical device alarm or signal, the volume level of the signal should be designed to be sufficiently loud to alert the operator to the status of the device, taking into account any background noise likely to be present during use. In addition, the effect of an overly loud signal on the patient should be considered in the signal design. FDA disagrees that the agency should specify an emission location or a particular volume level for the signal, but encourages manufacturers, in the design of their systems, to consult available human factors guidelines for audio (and visual) characteristics of medical device alarms and signals (e.g., Ref. 1), and to test and evaluate their systems under representative operational conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. One of the comments referred to the workshop on fluoroscopy discussed in comment 1 above, and noted a number of additional suggestions for changes to fluoroscopic x-ray system performance that were advocated by attendees at that workshop (Ref. 2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those additional suggestions for changes are beyond the scope of the current proposal and would require a separate proposal and opportunity for comment. FDA agrees that the recommendations from the workshop should be considered as the basis for possible future amendments to the standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Environmental Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(e)(3) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Analysis of Impacts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An analysis of the costs and benefits of this regulation, conducted under Executive Order 12291, was discussed in the proposed rule and the substance of that analysis has not changed. Executive Order 12291 has been superseded by Executive Order 12866. FDA has examined the impacts of this final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). The agency believes that this rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant impact of a rule on small entities. This amendment to the performance standard will affect the small fraction of fluoroscopic systems which are currently provided with high-level controls or which do not provide AERC, and have radiation outputs exceeding 1.29x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  C/kg per minute (5 R/min). Further, the additional testing performed by x-ray manufacturers and government regulatory progams to ensure compliance with the performance standard, and the quality assurance testing performed by facilities can easily be included in current testing programs with minimal additional costs. The agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  A copy of the threshold assessment supporting this determination is on file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above) and may be seen in that office between 9 a.m.and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.

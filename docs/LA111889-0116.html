			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSING STARTS REBOUND 12% IN BIGGEST JUMP SINCE 1986  </P> <P> Housing starts bounced back 12% in October from September's seven-year low, the  Commerce Department reported Friday, and analysts said they expect the  construction rate to remain stable through the first quarter of 1990.  </P> <P> New home construction rebounded to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.42 million  units for the biggest gain in three years, following September's extremely weak  1.27-million rate.  </P> <P> The October jump, the biggest since a 13% rise in December, 1986, left housing  starts far above economists' expectations of a 1.30-million-unit rate.  </P> <P> "It's a very welcome number and brings us back to July levels," said economist  Dave Seiders of the National Assn. of Home Builders. "I was really getting  worried about where housing was headed."  </P> <P> Housing starts react quickly to changes in interest rates and are a leading  indicator of activity in the real estate industry.  </P> <P> Economists said the October rise left housing starts near a healthy average of  1.40 million units this year, offering reassurance that September's steep fall  was nothing more than an aberration.  </P> <P> "The September figure led you to believe the housing industry was going down  the tubes, but that's simply not the case," said economist Richard Peach of the  Mortgage Bankers Assn.  </P> <P> Building permits in October rose nearly 1% to 1.33 million, indicating that  home building activity will likely be sustained in the coming months.  </P> <P> Economists said the rebound in housing from the depressed levels of August and  September could help keep the economy on a slow-growth course and away from  recession, when other sectors such as autos and basic industry are suffering.  </P> <P> "New residential home investment will provide stimulus to the economy in the  fourth quarter," Peach said.  </P> <P> Economists expect the economy to slow in the months ahead, leading to a gradual  easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve. But continued growth in some  sectors, such as housing, will prevent a dramatic shift in Fed policy.  </P> <P> Housing construction weakened last spring because of high interest rates, but  the industry showed signs of strength in June and July. The summer gains  dwindled in August and the decline accelerated in September.  </P> <P> Long-term mortgage rates are now around 9.79%, compared to a high of around  10.22% in September, but consumers have still shied away from making major  purchases of homes and cars.  </P> <P> Sales of new homes plunged 14% in September, while October retail sales  contracted by 1% -- the result of a drop in auto sales.  </P> <P> But lower interest rates are spurring the construction industry to build more  homes, economists said. Single-family housing starts rose 6.9%, while new  apartment building construction increased 28%.  </P> <P> Housing starts were strong in all regions of the country, rising 6% in the  Northeast, 16.5% in the Midwest, 17.1% in the South and 5.1% in the West.  </P></p>

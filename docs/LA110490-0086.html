			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE RECORD: WHY SUCH A DEARTH OF DVORAK?  </P> <P> Among the abiding musical mysteries of our time is the lack of appreciation of  one of the most accessible, likable and consistently inspired of Romantic  composers: Antonin Dvorak. The biggest-name conductors resolutely refuse to  explore the prolific Czech's output beyond the barest handful of works. The  enterprising musicians who do bother are infrequent visitors to our part of the  world and when they do come, Dvorak isn't part of their baggage. Not even the  touring Czech chamber groups, hardly strangers to our stages, offer much  Dvorak, perhaps under the impression that we get as much of it as the folks  back home do.  </P> <P> Yet audience reaction to the odd gem that does slip through is never less than  hugely enthusiastic, as it must be for any supreme inventor of melody, master  orchestrator and the sort of canny showman who virtually builds ovations into  his scores. It's almost comical then that when JoAnn Falletta programs Dvorak's  marvelous Sixth Symphony with her Long Beach Symphony it assumes the  proportions of an act of faith rather than being merely a wise and logical  move.  </P> <P> It was once the case that popular taste was reflected in what was recorded and,  later, that recordings made a profound impression on live programming. In the  case of Dvorak neither seems to be true since recordings of his music are  numerous beyond what anyone could have imagined a quarter-century ago, when  only a small minority of listeners was aware of the fact that Dvorak composed  nine rather than five symphonies and as many string quartets as Beethoven.  </P> <P> All this by way of introduction to yet another batch of Dvorak recordings  offering the listener opportunity to experience melodic revelations and for  impresarios to bemoan the dearth of such unhackneyed, ear-catchingly glorious  music on their programs.  </P> <P> Conductor Libor Pesek, who paid a brief (Dvorak-less) visit to the Los Angeles  Philharmonic last season, is working his way through a cycle of his  countryman's symphonies for Virgin Classics.  </P> <P> The latest installments are the youthfully overreaching, Wagner-impregnated  Third Symphony, in E-flat, Opus 10, coupled with the mature and pure-Slavonic  "Scherzo capriccioso" and "Carnival" Overture (90797), and the Fifth Symphony,  in F, Opus 76, one of those rowdy, dance-filled Czech marvels over which  audiences, were they given the opportunity, would go wild with delight. Its  companion piece is the more subdued but hardly less attractively folksy "Czech"  Suite, Opus 39 (90769).  </P> <P> Pesek leads with terrific brio as well as a loving ear for instrumental detail.  His two orchestras, the Czech Philharmonic and Royal Liverpool Philharmonic,  respond vigorously, with a becoming touch of bucolic roughness in each  instance.  </P> <P> Mariss Jansons, who has also put in appearances with the Los Angeles  Philharmonic and is shortly to lead the Leningrad Philharmonic here, offers the  Fifth Symphony as well, with the "Scherzo capriccioso" and the darkly dramatic  "Othello" Overture, another of the composer's powerful, all-but-ignored late  works. All are zestfully, idiomatically directed and alertly executed by the  Oslo Philharmonic (EMI/Angel 499995).  </P> <P> By way of contrast, Andre Previn seems a disinterested outsider looking in on  the "New World" Symphony and "Carnival" in his latest recording with the Los  Angeles Philharmonic (Telarc 80238).  </P> <P> While there may not be much to seek out in this hyper-familiar material, it  remains difficult to recall a conductor who brings less enthusiasm, less  rhythmic definition to these scores than Previn does.  </P> <P> Telarc's uncharacteristically tubby sonics (the recording was made in Royce  Hall last April) fail to capture the distinctive sound of the Philharmonic,  excepting perhaps the dark sheen of its cellos.  </P> <P> The London-based Chilingirian Quartet, recent visitors to the Southland, is --  one hopes -- working its way through a Dvorak quartet cycle for the Chandos  label. Its latest release pairs the lush, endlessly tuneful and harmonically  imaginative Quartets in E-flat, Opus 51, and in C, Opus 61 (8837) -- music that  once experienced in such vivacious, polished and idiomatic performances as  these should remain in the head and heart forever.  </P> <P> A word, too, for the latest reissue of the celebrated interpretation of  Dvorak's Cello Concerto by Pablo Casals and the Czech Philharmonic under George  Szell, recorded in Prague in 1937 (EMI/References 63498). The transfers from 78  r.p.m. project Casals' sumptuous tone and the incisive attack -- notably in  regard to the solo wind playing -- of Szell's orchestra with a clarity and  presence barely suggested in prior remasterings.  </P> <P> The 75-minute-long, mid-priced CD further contains Casals' 1945 Elgar Cello  Concerto and Bruch's "Kol Nidrei," recorded in 1936.  </P></p>

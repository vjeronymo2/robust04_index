			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / This Week: Film/Video It is Halloween, and the deadly double genitives are back. Tearing off syntactical bandaging, the movies and their titles rise from the laboratory table. Two years ago we had to grapple with 'Francis Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula'. Now it is 'Kenneth Branagh's Mary Shelley's Frankenstein'. The new movie opens the London Film Festival this Thursday and crashes on to public screens the next day. Since Universal Pictures still owns the one-word titles for the two great Gothic classics, everyone else has to think up these rolling-stock monikers. But the Columbia-Branagh Frankenstein, we hear, is fiercer and pithier than its title. And there is much to look forward to in an acting showdown between our classical Ken, playing Frankenstein, and America's method master, Robert De Niro, playing the creature. I shall review the film (still under wraps from critics) next Thursday. London's movie epicentre is the Barbican. Their season, just beginning, boasts everything from Orson Welles' Macbeth to Peter Greenaway's Prospero's Books via James Cagney in A Midsummer Night's Dream, Grigori Kosintsev's Hamlet, and - strangest and rarest of all - a 1920s German 'trousers role' version of Hamlet, starring Asta Nielsen. On the video trail this week: a second chance to be carried away by transvestism. In Mrs Doubtfire, Home Alone director Chris Columbus teams up with American motormouth Robin Williams in the funny tale of a cross-dressing nanny. For more traditional tastes there is what the double-possessive movie-title trend would call 'Alan J Pakula's John Grisham's The Pelican Brief'. The director of Klute meets the best-selling thriller novelist, guaranteeing frissons in this Florida-set conspiracy tale, starring Julia Roberts. Best of all on video is The Piano. What do we call this if we want to give it double proprietorship? It would have to be Jane Campion's Jane Campion's The Piano. She wrote and she directed. And she turns the mid-19th century New Zealand bush into a violently beautiful setting for a mute heroine (Oscar-winning Holly Hunter) and her baptism in a new emotional world. Marvellous.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE OFFICIALS FEEL VINDICATED AFTER NEW STUDY ARGUES AGAINST ASBESTOS REMOVAL  </P> <P> State officials, criticized in the past for moving too slowly with asbestos  removal, welcomed a new scientific study Friday that concludes asbestos cleanup  is often more dangerous than simply ignoring the problem.  </P> <P> Faced with estimates that asbestos abatement in public schools could cost  billions of dollars, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig said  the new findings call for a more cautious -- and less costly -- approach to  dealing with the hazardous fibers.  </P> <P> "By going and trying to do something about it, you may make it more dangerous,"  said Honig. "You may have to take a re-look at what has to be done, and  sometimes the best thing to do is nothing."  </P> <P> Similarly, the office of the state architect, which oversees most state  structures, said the study published in the journal Science corresponds with  the agency's program of locating asbestos in state buildings and then, in most  cases, leaving it alone.  </P> <P> "I'm pleased to see the report appears to coincide with the method of operation  of this office," said Kenneth McClellan, chief of special programs for the  state architect's office. "We don't want to do any abatement that could expose  people to fibers."  </P> <P> But some critics say the state has been motivated less by health concerns than  money and has been lax in carrying out its asbestos program.  </P> <P> The comprehensive study concluded that leaving asbestos in place often poses  less of a hazard than removing it, particularly to workers who take part in the  cleanup. The report also found that the type of asbestos most commonly used in  building materials, chrysotile asbestos, poses fewer health risks than other  forms of the mineral.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, officials of the Los Angeles Unified School District were  optimistic that the latest findings would relieve pressure to remove asbestos  at all costs.  </P> <P> "We have done things where we really feel there's an overkill," said Margaret  Scholl, maintenance director for the district. "It's become a motherhood issue,  and how can anyone be for asbestos? It's become a political issue rather than a  health issue."  </P> <P> Under federal law, school districts nationwide have been required to spend  millions of dollars on asbestos abatement even in cases where local officials  believed there was no health threat.  </P> <P> In California, districts have been left to find their own funding, often  diverting money from instructional programs. But many parents, concerned that  their children were being exposed to life-threatening fibers, have criticized  schools and the state for neglecting asbestos hazards.  </P> <P> "Every school district is in a panic because they don't have the money to do  the work the law is requiring," said Richard Henry, asbestos technical  supervisor for the Los Angeles district. "Perhaps it's money that doesn't need  to be spent and can be spent on education."  </P> <P> So far, the Los Angeles school district has spent nearly $20 million on its  asbestos program.  </P> <P> The state Department of Education said there is no tally of how much money has  been spent on asbestos abatement by the state's school districts. Estimates for  asbestos inspection and cleanup in the public schools range from $1 billion to  $3 billion.  </P> <P> "School districts spent a lot of money to take care of this problem and now it  turns out some of that money has been unwisely spent," said Honig.  </P> <P> Before recommending that schools curtail their asbestos programs, Honig said he  will call on his staff to examine the study conducted by researchers at Yale,  Johns Hopkins and several other universities. "We're not yet advising schools  to hold up," he said.  </P> <P> The state architect's office surveyed 12,000 state structures and found  asbestos in 50,000 locations, McClellan said. Cleanup work was carried out in  63 of the buildings.  </P> <P> In most of the 12,000 buildings, he said, the fibers were not in a hazardous  condition and were dealt with simply by warning maintenance workers of the  problem and carrying out regular inspections.  </P> <P> Richard Steffen, a former analyst with the Assembly Office of Research, said  that under Gov. George Deukmejian, the state has done little to deal with the  problem of asbestos in its buildings ever since officials discovered it would  cost $1 billion or more.  </P> <P> Now, he added, the latest study appears to be a sort of vindication for the  Administration's inaction. "They're being rewarded for being lax on the job,"  said Steffen, chief of staff for Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-South S.F.).  </P></p>

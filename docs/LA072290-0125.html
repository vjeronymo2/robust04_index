			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> EMBASSIES IN CUBA SEALED OFF AS 9 MORE SEEK REFUGE  </P> <P> Cuban police sealed off the Canadian and West German embassies in Havana on  Saturday and tightened a security cordon around the Spanish Embassy after nine  more Cubans slipped through during the night and broke in.  </P> <P> The latest arrivals brought to 18 the number of Cubans sheltering at the  Spanish Embassy, further complicating a bitter diplomatic quarrel over the  refugees that has seriously strained relations between Madrid and Havana.  </P> <P> Another four Cubans are at the residence of the Italian ambassador.  </P> <P> Fidel Castro's Communist government has been insisting that all asylum-seekers  surrender to Cuban authorities without condition. The government has called all  those who have gone into the Spanish, Czechoslovak and Italian embassies and  diplomatic residences in recent days "scum" and habitual vagrants.  </P></p>

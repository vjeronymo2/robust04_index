			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Crown Agents welcome an independent role: The future of the procurement organisation THE GOVERNMENT last week made a significant compromise in its privatisation strategy for the Crown Agents, which provides financial, professional and procurement services across the developing world. After eight months of deliberation it retreated from its early preference of outright privatisation, opting instead to make it an independent foundation, limited by guarantee. While there are likely to be arrangements for the Crown Agents to repay Pounds 2m in outstanding debts to the government, that seems likely to be the only cash raised. The privatisation will create a structure similar to the Wellcome Foundation, the health insurance groups PPP and Bupa, the motoring organisations the AA and the RAC and the British Standards Institute. An official at the Overseas Development Administration, to which the Crown Agents answer, said it would be 'entirely commercial in its approach, and will be expected to make a return', but profits will be ploughed back into the agency. It will answer to a board of directors, which will be selected from a cross-section of its users - including foreign aid agencies and exporters. 'By not exposing it to the pressures of shareholder interests, it will be able to act more easily in its own interests and in the interests of its clients in the developing world,' said the official. For Mr Peter Berry, managing director of the Crown Agents, escape from bureaucratic government procedures will come as a relief. 'When you need ministerial consent to do anything materially different from the act that governs us, then there is 'a stop in the mind' against doing it,' he says. 'It will be very different going back to a board. There will be no disincentive to be pro-active. Accountability will be closer to home.' It will also be easier to demonstrate to doubters that it is independent of government pressure to 'buy British'. Foreign aid agencies - in particular Japan's national aid agency, which has recently used the Crown Agents extensively to handle its procurement - lobbied the government against outright privatisation, arguing that this would imperil the 'honest broker' status of the organisation. The Crown Agents, founded in the 1830s to procure supplies for far-flung colonies and pay the wages and pensions of colonial servants, now works in 130 countries, generating just 27 per cent of its Pounds 37m income last year from the UK. Its leading clients are the World Bank, the European Community, the United Nations and Japan's national aid agency. It is at the heart of organising aid convoys to besieged towns across Bosnia and is playing a central role training professionals in the fast-opening economies of east and central Europe. The agency has seen dramatic development of its role in the recent past, particularly in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. It is training staff in seven Russian procurement agencies across the agriculture, energy, health and transport sectors as part of a Dollars 600m World Bank initiative. As well as aid convoys in Bosnia, its emergency logistics management teams have supplied medical supplies to Albania, and procured and distributed emergency pharmaceuticals to Romania. This increasingly multinational spread of activities played a large part in the decision to hive the agents off to the private sector. But the pressure against privatisation was not unanimous. Mr Rajhavan Srinivasan, head of the World Bank's procurement division in Washington, said some of the bank's staff would like to see both the Crown Agents and Germany's GDZ, its main 'competitor', privatised, to make independence transparent and to boost competition. 'I don't have strong feelings over their being privatised,' he says. 'I have been dealing with them for 20 years, and I know they are highly professional, and their integrity is beyond question.' He hopes independence from government will lead to 'a less bureaucratic and clerical way' of operating. Mr Berry warns the Crown Agents' new independence - which is unlikely to be finalised through parliament until the end of next year - will not lead to radical change. 'It would be very foolish to rush off in untested directions.' As an independent foundation, the Crown Agents will no longer be limited to serving aid agencies and other public bodies, as its present constitution dictates. Mr Berry says: 'Newly established private corporations in the developing world, which used to be our clients when they were government-owned, are coming back to us and asking if we can continue to supply them. Under our present constitution, we have to say no.' Forgotten now are the dark days of the 1970s when own-account trading at the agents led to financial collapse and a government inquiry, and the jolt in 1983 when the Sultan of Brunei severed links, withdrawing investment funds and savaging income from financial services. What will be most important for the restructured agency is its reputation for impartiality in advising on the cheapest and most efficient way of supplying projects. As Mr Berry says: 'If we couldn't hold our heads up and prove our independence, we would not be the large procurement agency we are today.'</p>

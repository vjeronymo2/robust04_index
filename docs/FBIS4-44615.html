JPRS-CST-93-018, 16  Nov 93 p 20]    [Summary] The JHW-I concealed laser [active] IR  night-vision system, with applications in public security,  defense, banking, and industry, was developed by the CAS  Institute of Semiconductors' State Optoelectronic Devices  Engineering Research Center. It consists of the center's own  high-power laser diode light source, an IR camera, a  remote-controlled power supply, and B&amp;W monitoring equipment.  This system, which eliminates red exposure, has a light-source  power consumption of 3 W and an effective range of over 100  meters. For firms wishing to begin production of this system,  equipment investment costs are 200,000 yuan, annual output is  100 units, annual output value is 3 million yuan, and annual  profit should be between 500,000 and 1 million yuan.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Approval for Wellcome's Zovirax WELLCOME, the UK drugs group, yesterday announced the UK health authorities had approved its Zovirax herpes treatment for sale over the counter (OTC) with a prescription at pharmacies. The approval is for the cream rather than intravenous or oral formulations. The cream formulation represents about 30 per cent of sales of Zovirax, Wellcome's best-selling medicine which generated sales of Pounds 586m last year. The product should be launched in mid-July, although a Parliamentary order is required to complete the change in status from prescription-only to OTC. The group has substantial ambitions for selling Zovirax OTC. In New Zealand, sales rose 31 per cent during the 12 months after its became available OTC. For the previous 18 months sales had been static. Wellcome continues to search for a partner to strengthen its OTC operations which Mr John Robb, chief executive, believes do not have critical mass. He argues the business is too dependent upon cough and cold remedies, and does not have enough presence in continental Europe, north America and Australasia. The danger, he warns, is that Wellcome could miss out on the big OTC opportunity presented by Zovirax. Mr Robb has ruled out OTC acquisitions which are too expensive, but says he is considering the possibility of a separate joint-venture company, in which Wellcome could be the junior rather than senior partner. The group has recently signed a co-promotion agreement with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer in France. Mr Robb says a collaborative venture for co-development in Japan remained a high priority. Wellcome launched Zovirax OTC in Germany last September and this month began a large television advertising campaign.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFORMS AND REAPPORTIONMENT  </P> <P> Steven Schier's Sept. 26 commentary "Reforms That Aren't" is patronizing and  contradictory. Schier asserts that "elite interest groups and politicians  dominating the debate on campaign reform have forgotten the circumstances of  the average voter."  </P> <P> While purporting to understand the lives and political behavior of every  American, Schier falls into his own trap. In his view, Americans are  simple-minded idiots who will abandon the voting booth unless politics are  packaged and fed to them as television entertainment. Who is elitist?  </P> <P> On the one hand, Schier says "prim reformers" are attempting to make politics  boring by calling for a "serious discussion of the issues." On the other, he  suggests that campaigns should address the reality of people's lives. Call me  prim, but any discussion of real problems as well as the complexities of  solving them has to get serious.  </P> <P> Schier further contradicted himself by calling for reform, while trashing  proposals that are designed to address the very problems he identifies. I would  suggest he walk his ideas through the legislative process. His views might be  more credible were they subjected to the sharply partisan environment and  debate that is inherent in creating any kind of change, regardless of its  merits, in the conduct and financing of political campaigns.  </P> <P> NANCY M.

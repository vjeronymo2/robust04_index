			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVEN IN VICTORY, SOME FIND REASONS TO COMPLAIN  </P> <P> After the Raider coaching change and the resurgence of Raider football, I  couldn't understand why only 40,000 fans would attend the next several games.  </P> <P> I found out why last Sunday, as I was one of the 90,000 fans who attended the  Denver game.  </P> <P> Either the Raider coaching staff is stupid or they are quitters. When you are  behind, 10-6, and you have a first-and-10 on your 30-yard line with 30 seconds  remaining, it is permissible to attempt to advance the ball!  </P> <P> Whadaya know? The Raiders won anyway. I saw fans leaving in the fourth quarter  while the game was tied. Some fans are quitters, too.  </P> <P> STAN GORDON, Encino  </P></p>

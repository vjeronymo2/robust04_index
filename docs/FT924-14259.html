			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Property: Mayfair - simply the best address in town - Offices are giving way to top-drawer flats and houses THERE ARE builders at work all over Mayfair these days. Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian houses used since the second world war as 'temporary' offices are being converted back to residential use. This will, once again, make Mayfair the best address in London - as it is on the Monopoly board. Richard Crosthwaite, of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, has identified 42 development schemes with planning permission from the City of Westminster to create 199 houses and flats in Mayfair. The Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor Estate alone has 84 buildings that were used as offices; most of them will become 15 houses and 139 flats. The first to be tackled was 6 Aldford Street, an Edwardian building that was switched from offices to five flats in 1988. The first house on the estate to be restored for family occupation was 7 Upper Brook Street. Because of structural defects, part of this Grade II-listed building had to be rebuilt to make it a gracious, six-bedroom, Georgian town house on six floors. It was sold through Savills last year for more than Pounds 1m with a new 65-year lease, and is now back on the market for sale through Egerton (071-493-0676) at Pounds 1.4m. But the estate took four years to reach agreement with Westminster's planners on the future of 57 of its properties where it argued that conversion was either unsuitable or not economic. In the end, the council agreed that permanent office use should be allowed for 161,395 sq ft of floor space, but the remaining buildings would have to be restored or redeveloped to create five houses and 92 flats. One of the largest schemes will be converting Taylor Woodrow's former offices of 29,000 sq ft at 8-12a Park Street and 1-5 Rex Place, which the estate sold this summer through Wetherell and Savills for more than Pounds 3m to an overseas client of Citibank. The buildings will become three houses and 11 flats with garaging for 14 cars. The estate has just completed Avery Court, a block of six new flats in the newly pedestrianised Avery Row, which runs between Brook and Grosvenor streets. Five one-bedroom flats are for sale through Debenham Tewson Residential (071-408-1161) at prices from Pounds 160,000 to Pounds 200,000 on new 75-year leases, and the sixth is a two-bedroom flat at Pounds 285,000. The estate also is near to completing the conversion of 106-114 Park Street into 11 flats, with prices expected to range between Pounds 225,000 to Pounds 350,000 through WA Ellis (071-581-7654). One of the most celebrated cases of a 'temporary' office permission is Brook House in Park Lane, which was built in 1930 as a block of luxury flats. The 40-room penthouse on the top two floors was the London home of the Earl and Countess Mountbatten. Brook House was converted into offices soon after the blitz of 1940, and from 1964 was the headquarters of Britain's second-largest property company, MEPC. Having failed in 1988 to win consent for continued office use, MEPC and Grosvenor Estate Holdings sold Brook House in April this year for Pounds 9.1m to a consortium of overseas investors. The buyers have been given a new 105-year lease by the Grosvenor Estate, but are required by December 1995 either to refurbish the building as flats or to redevelop it as 17 new luxury flats, with 15,000 sq ft of banking and ancillary offices on the ground and first floors and underground parking for 39 cars (for which planning permission has been obtained). Another large block of properties in Mayfair forms the Ropemaker Estate, owned by British Petroleum's pension fund. Agreement has been reached with Westminster to restore 12 buildings as 37 houses or flats, the first of which - at 33-35 Hill Street and 27-30 Hays Mews - are being refurbished or reconstructed to create 12 flats and six mews houses. These will be released for sale later this year through Debenham Tewson Residential. Offices once occupied by the Randsworth Trust, at 78 Mount Street, have been restored as a six-bedroom house for which offers of Pounds 4.6m are being invited through Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171) and Wetherell (071-493-6935). The former London home of the Duchess of Argyll at 48 Upper Grosvenor Street is for sale at Pounds 2m through Chesterfield (071-5781-4234) and Egerton. Another Pounds 2m is being sought by Chesterfield for the modern house immediately behind it in Reeves Mews. This residence recently has been rebuilt completely. On the opposite side of the road, 8 Upper Grosvenor Street is about to be redeveloped by Goshawk Developments to designs by Michael Blampied &amp; Partners. These will create 5,000 sq ft of offices behind its listed Lutyens facade, and seven new flats with underground parking for eight cars in Blackburne's Mews, at the back of the American Embassy. A recently reconstructed house in Farm Street is for sale at Pounds 1.7m with a 95-year lease through Lassmans (071-499-3434) and Henry Pryor's newly formed agency, the London Office (071-439-3900). This four-bedroom house has the advantage of a double garage - rare in Mayfair. Several well-known businessmen are trying to sell their Mayfair homes. Asil Nadir paid about Pounds 1.25m for his house in Aldford Street, which his bankers now are offering for sale with a 65-year lease at Pounds 850,000 through Debenham Tewson Residential. Gerald Ratner's house in Balfour Mews, which he bought three years ago for Pounds 2.3m, is for sale at Pounds 1.5m on a 38-year lease through Knight Frank &amp; Rutley and Beauchamp Estates (071-629-1077). Meanwhile, advertising tycoon Maurice Saatchi has had to reduce the price of his 7,500 sq ft Lees House to Pounds 3m through Lassmans. It was on offer for more than Pounds 5m two years ago. Ancaster House, in Chesterfield Gardens, was sold this summer for close to Pounds 20m to an overseas buyer who will convert it into a 12-bedroom mansion. But the deal has revived hopes that another great Mayfair mansion will be restored to residential use: Aberconway House at 38 South Street, built in 1920-22 as the London residence of the second Lord Aberconway but used as the headquarters of the Rank Organisation until 1985. The Grosvenor Estate is looking for a buyer to use its 25,000 sq ft as a private house or an ambassadorial residence (for which its magnificent entrance hall, ballroom and 30-seat dining room are appropriate). Offers of Pounds 6.5m are being sought for a new 75-year lease through Knight Frank &amp; Rutley and Wetherell.</p>

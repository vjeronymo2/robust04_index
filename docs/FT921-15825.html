			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Conrad Ritblat restructure Conrad Ritblat, the property surveying partnership headed by Mr John Ritblat, has announced plans to incorporate into a limited partnership at the start of February. The move is intended to give the company a more streamlined management structure and help it grow through acquisitions. Mr David Pickard, chief executive, said there would be an internal market for the shares which would allow senior staff to take money out of the business when they retired. The shares would be distributed among the 33 partners. Chesterton, one of the UK's largest surveyors, has merged with De Groot Collis, a long-established London surveying firm. Chesterton has issued De Groot Collis with 3.78m new ordinary shares, representing 10 per cent of its increased share capital.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Mikhail Kalmykov </F> and Vilor Niyazmatov]    [Text] Tashkent, 27 April (TASS) -- "The ultimatum against  Bosnian Serbs is a forced measure authorised by the  international community. I shall only welcome if its conditions  are observed," French President Francois Mitterrand told a news  conference in Tashkent on Tuesday where he is on a state visit.    France prefers a peaceful solution of the problem, the  president continued. Therefore, "we support the initiative to  call an international conference with the participation of  Russia, the United States and the European Union under the U.N.  aegis.    "Russia and the U.S. are now discussing this proposal. To  all appearances, its convocation can take one month. Therefore,  I conveyed my opinion to Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton that  such a conference should be called at the earliest. If possible  -- immediately.    "All initial data for settling the problem are known. They  were discussed for many months. It is necessary, at long last,  for the great powers, in contact with the warring sides, to find  a solution meeting their interests."    Replying to ITAR-TASS, Mitterrand stressed that, following  the collapse of the Soviet Union, some concern developed in  Europe over a future military and political situation.    "To maintain political stability and security," he said, "we  have several mechanisms at our disposal. These are the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the  U.S.-brokered `Partnership for Peace' programme.    "Last but not least, this is an idea put forth by France to  call an international conference at which we suggest that a pact  on stability in Europe be concluded and that obligations of all  countries be defined on preventing and settling conflicts at the  earliest possible stage."    Mitterrand also noted that he understands Russia's  hesitations concerning its accession to NATO's "Partnership for  Peace" programme. "Russia is a great country, and it remains a  nuclear power. It led the system opposing NATO.    "Such a confrontation was fraught with war but at the same  time, it served as a balance of forces." The president did not  want to give advice to Russia how to get out of this situation.  "It should make its own choice," he stressed.</p>

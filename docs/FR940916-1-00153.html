When a device is used to comply with any test requirement in this section, the phrase ``brake pipe pressure of the train is being reduced'' means a pressure reduction of at least 5 psi, and the phrase ``brake pipe pressure of the train is being restored'' means a pressure increase of at least 5 psi.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The train shall not proceed until communication of brake pipe pressure changes at the rear of the train is verified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Class 2 tests of new brake system technology shall be conducted in accordance with the Class 2 test procedures developed for that technology in accordance with the procedures described in subpart J of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;232.415  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Running test for conventional passenger trains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) A running test of train air brakes on a conventional passenger train shall be made as soon as the speed of the train permits (by use of an automatic brake if operating in automatic brake operation) when any of the following events occurs:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) When motive power is changed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When an engine crew or train crew is changed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) When an angle cock is closed, except in the process of cutting off one or more cars from the rear end of train.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A running test shall be made by applying the train air brakes with sufficient force to ascertain whether or not the brakes are operating properly. Power must not be shut off unless required. If the air brakes do not properly operate, the train must be stopped, the cause of failure ascertained and corrected, and the running test repeated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) When motive power or engine crew is changed, a running test on each locomotive equipped with dynamic brakes shall be made to determine the condition of the dynamic brake, as soon as the operating speed of the train permits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;232.417  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Conventional passenger car single car or single passenger train set test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) A Conventional Passenger Car Single Car Test, as defined in &sect;232.5, shall be conducted on each passenger car with conventional air brakes as required in subpart G of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If a railroad operates a passenger train set, the railroad may develop and implement an equivalent Single Passenger Train Set Test in lieu of the Single Car Test. The test shall be submitted to FRA upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;232.419  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Conventional passenger train brake system test conducted using yard air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) After January 1, 1996, all equipment used to produce yard air shall be equipped with an air dryer capable of producing a 30-degree F dew point depression at a flow rate of 100 cfm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) When a train air brake system is tested from a yard test plant, an engineer's brake valve or an equivalent suitable test device must be used to provide any increase or reduction of the brake pipe air pressure at the same, or slower, rate as with an engineer's brake valve and the yard test plant must be connected to the end of the train or cut of cars which will be nearest to the hauling road locomotive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) When a yard test plant is used, the train air brake system must be charged and tested as prescribed by &sect;232.407, and when practicable should be kept charged until road motive power is coupled to train, after which, an automatic brake application and release test of air brakes on the rear car shall be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If the cars are disconnected from a supply of compressed air for more than four hours, before these cars may be added to a train they shall be retested in accordance with &sect;232.407.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Yard test plant air pressure shall be 100 psi.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Yard test devices and gauges shall be calibrated annually.

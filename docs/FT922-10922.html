			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Leading Lisbon business family suffers new blow THE MURDER yesterday of Mr Joao Champalimaud, son of one of Portugal's most prominent entrepreneurs, is the latest act in a drama that goes back to the seizure of the family's business assets in 1975 when Portugal's revolution took a sharp turn to the left. Mr Champalimaud, 41, was shot and stabbed in his Lisbon office just before 9am. The killing is thought to be the consequence of a private grievance. Before the revolution, the group headed by Mr Antonio Champalimaud, Joao's father, controlled a bank, two large insurance companies, and many other industrial assets. Since then the family, operating from exile in Brazil where it owns a large cement factory, has fought successive Portuguese governments for the return of its assets and compensation. Mr Joao Champalimaud played a leading role in the negotiations. Two weeks ago the group won back control of Mundial Confianca, one of Portugal's top three insurance companies which it formerly owned,when it was privatised. Mr Champalimaud's father celebrated the group's return to Portugal after 16 years, by warning that he would clean the company of the vestiges of socialism and of all personnel 'appointed by socialism'.</p>

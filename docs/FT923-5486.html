			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Industry chief resigns after rift with Kohl MR HEINRICH Weiss, president of the Federation of German Industry, the BDI, resigned in a storm of controversy yesterday after less than two years in office. Mr Weiss, 50, had been under fire for some months because of his abrasive manner and go-it-alone leadership style. However, opponents said his fatal offence was to damage industry's relationship with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other leading politicians. He made little attempt to hide his feelings about Mr Kohl's lack of interest in economics and business affairs - a characteristic which also irritated Mr Karl Otto Pohl, former president of the Bundesbank. The federation's leader is the main spokesman for 80,000 companies from all sectors, grouped in 34 different industry associations. His departure, at a time of rising economic gloom, marks an attempt by the leadership of German industry to rebuild intra-industry consensus and restore relations with Bonn. He will be replaced temporarily by Mr Tyll Necker, currently one of eight BDI vice-presidents, who preceded Mr Weiss in the top job. Grass-roots members have complained that its interests have been neglected while those of industrial giants such as Daimler-Benz have taken precedence. Pay policy has become a particularly sore point. Smaller companies complain that large groups have signed generous pay deals and then passed on their increased wage costs to their suppliers. Mr Weiss, who is also chairman of SMS Schloemann-Siemag, a Dusseldorf engineering group, said yesterday that he was 'disappointed'. He had tried to build the BDI into an effective service organisation to help German industry with new challenges in the European Community, the former German Democratic Republic and world markets. But he had found little support, and members had been unwilling to pay higher contributions, he complained. Mr Weiss's resignation followed his vain attempt just over a week ago to persuade his vice-presidential colleagues to sack Mr Ludolf-Georg von Wartenberg, the BDI's managing director. Opponents said Mr Weiss's constant attacks on government economic policy, and particularly on the chancellor, had 'blocked the approaches to Bonn'. The BDI was no longer welcome in Mr Kohl's office, they added, while the federation had a long tradition of close and comfortable relations with previous governments, including the Social Democrats.</p>

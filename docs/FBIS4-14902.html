			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" Program] </F>   [Text] Elections were held in Magadan Oblast yesterday.  This is what our correspondent Gennadiy Ovchinnikov reports:  According to the latest information, 27.2 percent of registered  voters in Magadan Oblast took part in the voting, though  elections were held in only 10 of the 17 electoral districts.  Thus, only one more deputy is required to make up the minimum  necessary for the Oblast Duma to commence work.    Presently, the Oblast Electoral Commission is preparing a  recommendation for the oblast administration of what to do in  such a situation. Whether to conduct additional elections or to  seek a solution in the Central Electoral Commission's  contradictory and rather hazy edicts, statutes, directives, and  interpretations, which allows a broad reading of the election  results. The final decision is expected to be adopted within  five days.</p>

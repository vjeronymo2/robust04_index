			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by State Committee of the Russian Federation for </F> the Defense Sectors of Industry [Goskomoboronprom] Chairman  Viktor Konstantinovich Glukhikh under the rubric "Politics,  Economics": "The Development of Reforms and the Stabilization of  the Activity of the Defense Sectors of Industry"]    [Text] The defense complex of Russia today is more than  2,000 enterprises and organizations at which more than 4.5  million people work.    What typifies the current state of the defense complex?  First  and foremost, powerful shifts in the structure of production and  conversion.    The share of civilian products produced by defense  enterprises has doubled over the last two or three years, and is  almost 80 percent of their production today.    The amounts of financing of orders for the delivery of arms  have meanwhile decreased by almost nine times over 1992-93, and  for military NIOKR [scientific research and experimental design]  by more than eight times. Defense orders are today providing for  the utilization of only 10--15 percent of specialized production  capacity as a result.    The small quantities of arms and military hardware being  ordered are making their production economically  disadvantageous. A real threat has arisen of the impossibility  of the renewal, where necessary, of the production of some  models of arms and military hardware, as well as the loss of a  number of promising technologies.    An outflow of skilled personnel (about two million people)  from the defense sectors is underway owing to the sharp cutbacks  in military orders, worsened financial state of the enterprises  and the low wage levels (they are roughly 1.6 times lower than  for the national economy as a whole), and enterprises are  beginning to refuse defense production.    A critical situation has taken shape where not only the  defense security of the country, but its economic security as  well, are threatened.    Goskomoboronprom, taking this situation into account, has  developed a conceptual framework for an industrial policy in the  defense complex, and is implementing a program of actions to  stabilize the situation in the defense sectors of industry. The  following priorities have been delineated:    --the creation of unsurpassable scientific work in progress,  and the development and production of technically advanced and  highly efficient systems and models of arms and military  hardware;    --the integration of military and civilian production, with  an orientation toward the widespread utilization of dual-use  technologies;    --the formation of mobilization capacity and reserves based  on contemporary principles;    --the restoration and expansion of cooperative ties with the  defense complexes of the CIS member nations, and improvement of  interaction with the regions of Russia.    The realization of 14 dedicated conversion programs has  begun  in accordance with the State Program of Conversion for 1993-95  that was adopted by the government.    The work, including major NIOKR projects, is focused on such  priority areas as transport and communications, the  fuel-and-power complex, agriculture and the consumer market,  medicine and ecology.    The first results have been achieved in the reconfiguration  of defense product lines for the output of civilian products.  The defense complex demonstrated new types of such products at  fairs at Nizhnyy Novgorod, Vladimir, Irkutsk and at an  exhibition in Tula. Production volumes are also being increased.  Tens of thousands of new jobs have been created.    The impact could have been far more substantial if credits  for conversion had been issued in the needed amounts and in a  timely manner. The minimally necessary financing for the most  important civilian types of NIOKR was able to be arranged after  a long delay.    An opportunity has appeared today of planning the innovation  process with great confidence--first and foremost research and  development on priority civilian topics, which was disastrously  lacking in 1991-92.    Goskomoboronprom is counting on the fact that industrial  policy in the defense sectors will be pursued with the proper  state support and budgetary financing for the research and  development of dual-use (multisector) applications, as well as  those types of NIOKR that are "breakthrough" types against the  background of world scientific and technical development or are  "critical" from the point of view of ensuring the defensive  capabilities and economic security of the country.  Goskomoboronprom is working today to clarify these key areas so  as to provide for the most efficient utilization of the NIIs  [scientific-research institutes] and KBs [design bureaus], as  well as to manage the scientific and technical potential that is  available in the defense sectors as efficiently as possible.    One main area of economic reform is institutional  transformation, which includes the conversion of ownership,  privatization, the reform of state enterprises and  organizations, support for entrepreneurship and the development  of a market infrastructure, the demonopolization of the economy  and the formation of a competitive environment, the development  of a financial market, and the improvement of legislation. These  transformations also fully affect the defense sectors of  industry as well.    Goskomoboronprom consistently carried out the state  privatization program in 1992-92.    Shares of stock in more than 500 state enterprises were  planned to be sold by the end of 1993. The conversion of more  than 1,000 enterprises in the defense complex--that is, more  than 60 percent of the overall number of enterprises in the  defense sectors of industry--was predicted in 1994.    The State Privatization Program envisages the existence of a  "core," consisting of 449 enterprises in the defense complex,  where changes in the form of ownership would not be expedient.    The specific sector features of the privatization of  enterprises and organizations in the defense complex and the  basic directions for improving the methods of privatizing them  are reflected in the Edict of the President of Russia "Specific  Features of Privatization and Additional Measures of State  Regulation of the Activity of Enterprises in the Defense Sectors  of Industry" (No. 1267, 19 August 1993).    Goskomoboronprom, in accordance with a decree of the Russian  government on a plan of actions for the realization of economic  reform, is assisting the organization of joint-stock companies  and financial-industrial groups in the defense sectors. The  Vympel international joint-stock company, the Energiya NPO  [Scientific-Production Association] imeni Academician S.P.  Korolev Russian holding company and the Arsenal holding company  (St. Petersburg), among a number of others, have already been  created.    A new form of interaction of Goskomoboronprom with the  joint-stock companies being created, in the form of equal  agreements between it and those companies regardless of their  organizational and legal forms, has been devised in the process  of issuing shares of stock in the enterprises and organizations  of the defense sectors of industry.    The enterprises of Goskomoboronprom can independently make  far from all items without cooperative deliveries from the CIS  countries, even though 80 percent of the capacity for the output  of the most important types of products (first and foremost arms  and military hardware) remained on the territory of Russia. The  range of borrowed constituent items exceeds many thousands  therein.    It would seem preferable not to waste trillions of rubles on  the sweeping transfer of the production of those items to  Russia, but rather to restore the necessary ties with the CIS  enterprises. Goskomoboronprom is devoting the most steadfast  attention to this.    Sixteen agreements and a resolution for cooperation with the  corresponding bodies of those states were signed in 1993, and  twelve intergovernmental agreements were prepared.  Intergovernmental agreements are being prepared for signing on  cooperation, the specialization of the defense enterprises and  the list of mutual deliveries of constituent items.    There is another acute problem as well--the mobilization  preparation of enterprises and organizations in the defense  sectors is still conducted according to outmoded targets. The  necessity of cutting back the number of customer requisitions  that tie up significant production floor space and equipment for  the volumes of deliveries of arms and military hardware during  emergency periods has become acute with the adoption of the  military doctrine. All of this has naturally had an effect on  the work results for 1993, when defense enterprises continued to  work under conditions of the complex and multilevel process that  is the sweeping conversion of military production. The  unsurmounted consequences of the deep cutbacks in the production  of arms that was undertaken in 1992 also had an effect. This  largely explains the decline of 17.2 percent in the volume of  industrial production in November of 1993 compared to the  corresponding period for 1992, and of 18.3 percent from the  start of 1993 through November compared to the same period for  1992.    The defense enterprises that possess unique personnel and  production potential, essentially a national treasure of the  country, are actively seeking their place in the market economy.    Goskomoboronprom is striving persistently in this regard to  achieve an expansion of the capabilities of the enterprises and  organizations in the realm of the export of products and  services, as a condition for ensuring market competitiveness and  obtaining additional funds for the structural restructuring of  industrial enterprises and science.    A conceptual framework for the development of the armed  forces and a program for equipping them for the future--an arms  program that is balanced with regard to the economic  capabilities of the country and ensures its defensive capability  and security--will have to be developed and approved with a  regard for the provisions of the country's military doctrine.  Clarity must be achieved in defense orders, along with their  financing for at least two or three years ahead. A stable  defense budget and indexing of defense appropriations suitable  to the increase in expenditures are needed.    A legislative basis in the realm of military-economic  planning, along with the legislative codification of the status  of the defense order and the status and rights of enterprises  taking part in the fulfillment of the state order for the needs  of defense, are necessary. The placement of defense orders  should be by contract (aside from those cases stipulated by  anti-monopoly legislation), which will rule out the forcing of  an unprofitable order on an enterprise.    The contract for the fulfillment of the defense order should  unconditionally be advantageous for the enterprise, both through  the establishment of a contract price and through the granting  of certain tax, export-import or other concessions, which should  also be legislatively codified. Any discrimination according to  the forms of ownership should be impermissible with regard to  the status of the enterprises taking part in the fulfillment of  the defense order.    The Law on Conversion--adopted but effectively not in  force--is in need of a profound reworking in this regard, and it  should envisage real compensatory guarantees for the  cancellation or withdrawal of a defense order, including  compensation for spending to refit production, the creation of  jobs in the civilian sphere, the retraining of personnel, social  assistance for laid-off workers and support for the regions most  affected by conversion.    A state program adopted at the federal level is necessary to  support the structural re-orientation of the defense industry,  to include direct financing for the creation of new jobs,  assistance to regions, targeted subsidies for specific  conversion programs, tax concessions for the enterprises being  converted and social assistance.    The enterprises in the defense complex have experienced a  very difficult two years of very rapid conversion against a  background of economic crisis and political instability. They  have every opportunity not only to survive, but also to develop  under market conditions. Assistance for that is therefore a most  important task facing federal bodies and the new parliament.    The state of the greater portion of the enterprises and  organizations in the defense complex remains a difficult one, of  course, and much could be said about that for a long time.    Only one thing must be emphasized. The enterprises of the  defense complex, albeit with great difficulty, are adapting to  the new conditions nonetheless. This is finding support on the  part of the government and other state administrative structures.    The assurance of the steady operation of the defense complex  under today's difficult conditions is considered to be one of  the defining tasks in the cause of the country's security and  the effectiveness of the functioning of the economy as a whole.    The consideration of this issue by the Security Council of  the Russian Federation testifies to the particular attention  toward the situation.    The President has issued edicts on the specific features of  the privatization of enterprises in the defense sectors and the  stabilization of the situation of enterprises and organizations  in the defense complex along with measures to provide for state  orders. These edicts envisage, in particular, changes in the  fixed levels of profitability of various types of products and a  doubling of the threshold level of expenses for wages, and  regulate advance payments for work under state orders.    A session of the presidium of the government was also held,  and introduced clarity into the defense orders for 1994.    The conversion programs, in light of the requirements of  Edict No. 1850 of the President of the Russian Federation of 6  November 1993, should be reviewed in the near future proceeding  from their economic efficiency. The shutdown of programs that  have not justified themselves, the finding of additional  opportunities for the financing of programs through local  sources, the funds of enterprises and commercial structures and  the provision of more profound substantiation of sales markets  and the market competitiveness of products being created are  what they have in mind therein.    The defense enterprises, with their specific nature, are an  inseparable part of the overall industrial complex of the  regions. It is namely for that reason that Goskomoboronprom  proceeds in its industrial policy from the unity of its sector  and regional aspects, and from the necessity of ensuring full  accounting and balance of both federal and regional or local  goals and interests.    The realization of these edicts of the President of the  Russian Federation and the governmental decrees, along with the  implementation of the basic guidelines that have been set forth  and the provisions of the conceptual framework for industrial  policy in the defense complex that have been devised, should  facilitate the curtailment of crisis development, an increase in  the controllability of this sector of the economy and the  stabilization of its production activity.

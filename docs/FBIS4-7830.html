			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from the Gorazde Press Center for </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio-Television]    [Text] Chetniks today continued their bloody offensive  against Gorazde unhindered and with their ferocity unabated.  They are getting closer and closer to the center of the town.  The chetniks are destroying and torching everything in their  path along the road which they had previously showered with  shells. They are destroying house after house in Vitkovici,  Baljci, and Zupnici. A stream of refugees is pouring in the town  itself and its residents do not know where to go or what to do.  Many people, mostly women, children, and the elderly have  remained among the ruins, on the charred remains of their homes  under the chetnik boot, which is blind to everything but a  desire to kill and conquer.    They launched their most ferocious offensive using tanks and  other weapons against (?Bilin). From one of their notorious  strongholds -- Cajnice Kozara -- they are trying to organize a  tank and infantry breakthrough toward Donja Potkozara and  Zupcici in order to further tighten the ring around the town  center.    Members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, under the command of  the eastern Bosnian operational zone and units of the Gorazde  MUP [Ministry of Interior], are putting up a remarkable  resistance to the aggressor. Even those with light injuries --  having received first aid -- are returning of their own free  will to help their fellow fighters in order to save the free  Gorazde territory.    Mature and younger women are willingly joining our army  units. Their message is that they will defend this free  territory to the last. The latest reports, which we received  just before this bulletin from the furthest locations on the  front -- Dobrijevici, Cador, and (?Vrazalici) -- say that the  situation here has been infernal both in early evening and  throughout the day. On several occasions the chetniks launched  combined artillery-infantry attacks in an attempt to break  through the defense line, but Gorazde's courageous defenders  repelled all attacks inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.    Heavy fighting was today also reported on the front between  Kopaci and Ustipraca, where Bosnia-Herzegovina Army fighters  repelled the aggressor's attacks in an efficient action.    This afternoon, chetniks attempted an infantry breakthrough  toward Uhotici Brdo, but were taught a real lesson when our  defenders responded with efficiency, putting 16 chetniks out of  action and wounding a large number of them.    Gorazde citizens were today awaiting General Rose's arrival  as a ray of hope and salvation, but the conscience of mankind  has once again failed the test and Gorazde is once again dying  alone.    Rijad Rasic, the president of the region's assembly, and  Gorazde Mayor Ismet Briga, today sent an open letter to the U.S.  President, NATO, the chairman of the UN Security Council, the UN  secretary general, the president of the ICO [Islamic Conference  Organization], the EU [European Union], the president of France,  the prime minister of Great Britain, and all world media.    The letter reads: Dear gentlemen, you who know about the  difficult and dramatic situation in Gorazde caused by the  several- day-long offensive against the town by the Serb and  Montenegrin aggressors, you have allowed a high-ranking UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] officer, General Michael Rose, and the  aggressor's side to play with the fate of thousands of people.  You denied us the right to self-defense two years ago when you  introduced the arms embargo, and your officers -- in open  cooperation with the aggressor's side -- are now denying us the  right to live.    While the (?surroundings) and the valley of Gorazde are in  flames, and shells are destroying the town, high-ranking  UNPROFOR officer, Gen. Michael Rose, is using cheap tricks to  avoid visiting Gorazde, thereby deliberately making it possible  for the aggressor to destroy what has not been destroyed yet and  to kill who has not been killed. Gen. Michael Rose's failure to  come here has not come as a great surprise to the Gorazde  residents. We are now certain about something we guessed at  before: The international community has taken part in the plot  against this nation only because it has its own culture, its own  past, and its own religion different from the religion of those  who are killing us and those who have the moral and legal  obligation -- assumed by international conventions --- to help  us.    You, who promised a just peace to the protected zone of  Gorazde, are now enabling the aggressor to kill innocent  civilians every day, to destroy the town, the industrial  infrastructure, and the homes of those who have survived the two  years of trauma caused by the aggressor's shells.    The Gorazde residents have sent appeals to the international  community on several occasions, asking it to halt (?repeated)  massacres in the valley of the Drina River. Now we can see and  feel that it was all in vain. This is why we are addressing you  for the last time, warning you that our suffering will lie on  your conscience. Dear gentlemen, we will no longer remind you  of your resolutions referring to the UN Protected Area of  Gorazde. Let the future generations judge your attitude, and  everything you had to do but failed to do for this nation.    This is stated in an open letter by Gorazde Assembly  President Rijad Rasic and Gorazde Mayor Ismet Briga.</p>

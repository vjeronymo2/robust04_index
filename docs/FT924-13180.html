			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Letter (1): Coal seen as victim of muddled economic thinking and lack of long-term strategy Sir, Your editorial comments ('Coal takes the unkindest cut', October 14) properly set out the powerful economic arguments in favour of maintaining a strong domestic coal industry, and lay the blame for the present crisis where it really belongs. The previous government privatised the electricity industry in a way which creates a rigged market and permits the power generators to build gas-fired power stations to produce more expensive electricity than existing coal-fired stations and then pass on the extra costs to electricity consumers. At the same time nuclear power is subsidised by every electricity consumer having 11 per cent added to his bill. This government is forever preaching about subjecting the energy industry to market forces. Let no one doubt that my members have no fear of market forces; what they demand is a level playing field so that the lowest cost fuel available for electricity generation - coal produced in Britain - gets its rightful share of the market. R Lynk, president/general secretary, Union of Democratic Mineworkers, Berry Hill Lane, Mansfield, Notts NG18 4JU</p>

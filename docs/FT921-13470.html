			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): TGWU and GMB initiative fuels talk of merger A MERGER between the TGWU and GMB general worker unions was the subject of heightened speculation yesterday as the two unions, Britain's largest, launched an initiative to improve employer training for their members. The campaign, to secure the right of their 2m members to at least five days' training a year, is the first significant initiative in recent years between the two unions alone. Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary and Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary-elect, would not be drawn yesterday about prospects for a merger but nor did they rule it out. Just a few months ago it would have seemed virtually impossible that the two unions, traditional rivals for recruits throughout industry, would contemplate amalgamation. However, a growing number of officials and activists are considering the possibilities. Mr Edmonds said yesterday that he and Mr Morris were aware of the symbolism of the joint initiative. 'We cover a lot of the same areas; where we see areas for potential joint co-operation we will work together. If anything comes of that in the longer term we will deal with that then.' The possibility of a merger has gained credence in recent months as the two leaders have established a strong working relationship and a decline in membership, common to all unions in the recession, has strengthened arguments for economies of scale. The likely mergers of Nupe, Nalgo and Cohse public-service unions and of the EETPU and AEU manufacturing industry unions mean that the GMB and TGWU's positions as the largest unions are threatened. Mr Morris said the unions needed to push training towards the top of the bargaining agenda. 'While unions negotiate about pay in nine out of 10 workplaces where they have members, they only negotiate about training in two out of every 10.' Mr Edmonds said the aim was to ensure training as a right for every employee and 'not just a raffle prize in a lottery'. It should be an benefit alongside pay, pensions and holidays, he said. 'For too long training has been left to the discretion of employers and the result has been a disaster. Only one in three companie have training budgets and only one in four have training plans.' Training For Britain's Economic Success, the unions' document, has been sent to their negotiators, education institutes, MPs, and more than 2,200 personnel managers.</p>

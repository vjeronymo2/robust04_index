			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico, 6 Jan (PL) -- Jose Fernandez de Cossio,  Cuban ambassador to Mexico, spoke with local media about the  ongoing events in Chiapas State, saying that a strong, stable,  and prosperous Mexico is important to Cubans.    The Cuban diplomat said the matter is an internal affair and  that his government agrees with the Mexican Government's efforts  to find a peaceful solution in the region along the Guatemalan  border.    Commenting on the 1 January operations of the Zapatist  National Liberation Army (EZLN), Fernandez de Cossio said armed  conflict and many other means used to solve problems are not the  ultimate solution. He said the factors that necessitate such  actions do not seem to be present in Mexico, where there is open  dialogue.    Regarding certain accusations made by interested parties  stating that Cuba was supplying weapons to the Chiapas rebels,  the ambassador said they were mere fabrications of  ill-intentioned people.    "They want to create turbulence in relations between Mexico  and Cuba," Fernandez de Cossio said. "For a long time now,  those relations have been founded on total respect for the  principle of nonintervention."    Speaking of the meeting between President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari, the head of the local diplomatic community said that  the president "seemed to be in control of the situation,  well-informed, calm, and determined that negotiations and  dialogue will lead the way to a solution."    The Cuban ambassador added that his country is highly  concerned about the problem in southeastern Mexico. "We are  reassured in knowing that the Mexican Government has taken steps  to find a peaceful solution to this internal conflict. Mexico's  friends must leave Mexicans to solve their own problems within a  framework of peace and lawfulness," he stated.</p>

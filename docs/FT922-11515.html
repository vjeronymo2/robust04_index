			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Delta Air posts another large loss DELTA Air Lines, the large US carrier which acquired Pan Am's European and US east coast shuttle operations last year, yesterday posted a Dollars 151.6m loss after tax for the three months to end-March. Delta's deficit outstrips the Dollars 84.1m deficit which the company posted in the same period a year earlier - when the Gulf war depressed traffic volumes and led to losses in the airline industry worldwide. It is the second of the US carriers to report results for the first three months of 1992, and its large loss contrasts with the modest Dollars 20m profit which American Airlines, one of its big rivals, managed to accrue. At the operating level, the 1992 deficit is significantly larger than the after-tax loss - amounting to Dollars 199.3m. This compares with a Dollars 115.1m loss in the 1991 first quarter. Operating revenues increased from Dollars 2.29bn to Dollars 2.81bn, partly reflecting the inclusion of the Pan Am routes. However, operating costs jumped more sharply, from Dollars 2.41bn to Dollars 3.01bn. This was in spite of a slightly lower fuel bill, at Dollars 350.8m, against Dollars 376.3m. A notable 39 per cent increase came in the miscellaneous cost item, up from Dollars 322m to Dollars 434.7m - with the explanation lying partly in 'costs related to bringing the operation of acquired international routes up to Delta's standard'. Delta also blamed the large quarterly loss on 'relatively weak domestic traffic', and the increased costs associated with the acquisition of the transatlantic and intra-European routes. Throughout its history, Delta has been primarily a domestic carrier, well-respected for its conservative style. The Pan Am deal, however, took the company into Europe in a big way for the first time, and laid down Delta's marker as a third international US carrier, to compete with American and United Airlines. Underlining the continued undercutting by ailing airlines in the US, Trans World Airlines said yesterday that it planned to establish an Atlanta 'hub'. TWA, which is in bankruptcy, said it also would operate services to nine other US cities, with introductory one-way fares of Dollars 69 to Dollars 89.</p>

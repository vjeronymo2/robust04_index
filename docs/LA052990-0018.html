			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PADRES OPEN DOOR FOR PHILLIES, BUT SLAM IT SHUT  </P> <P> Tony Gwynn singled home the go-ahead run in a four-run ninth inning as the San  Diego Padres blew a five-run lead but beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 9-5,  Monday night at Philadelphia.  </P> <P> The Phillies, held hitless by Bruce Hurst for six innings and trailing, 5-0,  scored five runs on five hits in the seventh, tying the game on Len Dykstra's  single.  </P> <P> But pinch-hitter Fred Lynn drew a leadoff walk from Jeff Parrett (2-3) to open  the ninth. Joey Cora ran for Lynn and Roger McDowell relieved Parrett.  </P> <P> Bip Roberts sacrificed Cora to second and Roberto Alomar beat out an infield  hit before Gwynn singled to right for his third hit of the game, driving in  Cora.  </P> <P> Joe Carter singled home Alomar and, after a double steal, Benito Santiago hit a  sacrifice fly and Mike Pagliarulo singled in Carter.  </P> <P> Mark Grant (1-0) pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings after relieving Hurst  following Dykstra's single. Craig Lefferts pitched the ninth.  </P> <P> Montreal 4, Atlanta 1 -- Kevin Gross pitched six strong innings of relief when  Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd came up lame, and Mike Fitzgerald hit a two-run homer as  the Expos defeated the Braves at Atlanta.  </P> <P> Gross (6-3) allowed five hits in six innings after a 2-hour 9-minute rain delay  at the end of the third inning. He struck out seven and walked one.  </P> <P> Boyd, who yielded a third-inning single to Ernie Whitt, was lifted because he  strained his left hip while batting in that inning.  </P> <P> Derek Lilliquist (2-6) retired the first nine Expos, but lost his stuff during  the rain delay. Delino DeShields singled to right to open the fourth inning,  stole his 13th and 14th bases and scored on a sacrifice fly by Tim Raines.  </P> <P> Fitzgerald homered off Lilliquist in the fifth, and Andres Galarraga hit his  fifth homer in the ninth.  </P> <P> Houston 5, St. Louis 1 -- At Houston, Bill Gullickson got his 100th National  League victory, and the Astros stretched the Cardinals' losing streak to four  games.  </P> <P> Vince Coleman singled home the St. Louis run off Gullickson (3-3), who has won  six of his last seven starts against the Cardinals, in the second. Gullickson,  who pitched in Japan the last two seasons, allowed six hits, struck out four  and walked three in 6 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> Ken Caminiti hit a two-run homer in the eighth and singled with two out to  spark Houston's two-run fourth. Glenn Wilson and Alex Trevino followed with  singles to score one run, and an error by third baseman Terry Pendleton sent  home the other run.  </P> <P> Wilson doubled and scored on Trevino's single in the sixth as the Astros sent  Greg Mathews (0-5) to his sixth consecutive loss.  </P> <P> Chicago 5, San Francisco 1 -- Jerome Walton drove in three runs and rookie Mike  Harkey got his fourth consecutive victory as the Cubs beat the Giants at  Chicago.  </P> <P> The Cubs broke a 1-1 tie on Walton's two-run triple after two were out in the  fourth inning against Bob Knepper (3-3).  </P> <P> Harkey (5-1) pitched five innings before his right shoulder stiffened. He  allowed seven hits, walked none and struck out four. Chicago Manager Don Zimmer  was ejected in the fourth inning after Ryne Sandberg hit what was called a  two-run homer by third base umpire Bill Hohn. When Giant Manager Roger Craig  objected, the umpires changed the call.  </P></p>

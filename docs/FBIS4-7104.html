			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] The breakaway of the Social Democratic Party of  Japan (SDPJ] from the coalition is very likely to make it  difficult to resume the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks. With no way found to raise the consumption tax in an  effort to secure financial resources to make up for a fiscal  shortfall resulting from the income tax reduction, it has become  difficult for the Japanese Government to announce plans for a  full-fledged income tax reduction which the U.S. Government has  sought prior to Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled for July. The  Japanese Government is committed to mapping out another set of  measures to open up the Japanese market in June, but it will  have nothing to present to the U.S. Government unless it decides  how to reform the current tax system. The Japanese Government  plans to hold informal consultations with the U.S. Government to  discuss ways to resume the stalled framework talks right after  the May holidays, but some government officials are speaking of  difficulty in holding the informal consultations.    At his recent meeting with Prime Minister Hata (then deputy  prime minister and foreign minister), U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor set three conditions for resuming the stalled  framework talks which include: 1) macroeconomic policy; 2)  agreement between the two countries on holding talks to discuss  ways to expand Japan's imports; and 3) establishment of  objective criteria.    The backbone of the macroeconomic policy is the continued  income tax reduction, and at a 24 April meeting between the  Japanese and U.S. finance ministers, Japan explained to the  United States that Japan would continue the income tax reduction  after 1995.    The Japanese Government is examining a sweeping reform of  the  current tax system to cut the income tax by lowering the maximum  tax rate and to raise the consumption tax in order to secure  financial resources to make up for a fiscal shortfall from cuts  in the income tax. Many government officials take the view that  the SDPJ will oppose any attempt to raise the consumption tax  since it broke away from the coalition (according to the Finance  Ministry). This development will make it hard for the Japanese  Government to explain to the U.S. Government in June that it  intends to seek long-term cuts in the income tax.    The government made clear that it would decide how to reform  the current tax system in June when it announced a package of  external economic measures in late March, but there is a high  possibility that if the Hata government remains a minority in  the Diet, it will be unable to decide on the second package of  external economic measures.    The Hata government would find it difficult to announce any  new policies concerning deregulation and the expansion of  government procurement. The Ministry of International Trade and  Industry points out that "it would be difficult to resume the  stalled framework talks unless Japan presents the United States  with its macroeconomic policy."    The Japanese Government has studied the possibility of  sending a vice minister to Washington to present Japan's  responses to the three conditions laid down by U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor. The Japanese Government, however,  would be unable to present the U.S. Government with concrete  plans for tax cuts and the study of how the Japanese Government  should respond to the two remaining conditions, including the  establishment of objective criteria, has been delayed, clouding  prospects for sending the vice minister to Washington.    The Finance Ministry takes the view that the "U.S.  Government  will not make rash moves to resume the stalled framework talks  because of its need to watch how Japan's political situation  will develop." Things are not likely to go according to the  Japanese Government's scenario, which aims to reach an agreement  with the U.S. Government on the resumption of the stalled  framework talks prior to the July Japan-U.S. summit talks.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Lloyd's professionals welcome reports: Inquiry seen as vindication of market views PROFESSIONALS in the Lloyd's insurance market yesterday welcomed the findings of the Walker and Morse inquiries and endorsed their recommendations for reform. Many were still digesting the contents of the reports which were released in the morning after newspaper leaks over the previous two days. Most concentrated on the report by Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investment Board, which concluded that there was no evidence of fraud in the operation of the market. They saw it as a vindication of their own views. Those working in the market conceded that the standards of some individuals and companies had fallen below acceptable levels. Mr Stephen Merrett, chairman of Merrett Holdings, the underwriter, said: 'It has been more apparent how much the market is damaged by the actions of a few.' Mr Robin Warrender, managing director of London Wall Holdings, an agency group, said: 'Manifestly some agents' standards of competence have been woefully inadequate.' Mr Terry Hayday, chief executive of Sturge Holdings, the managing agency, said: 'We are pleased there was no evidence of fraud. It's a relief to all of us. The conclusions drawn are the right ones.' He supported the recommendations. 'They will be welcome,' he said. 'They can do little else than improve the professionalism in the market. I fully expect the pendulum of regulation to swing from a relatively relaxed regime to a much tighter one.' But he added: 'We have to ensure that the commercial and entrepreneurial skills of the market are not killed.' Mr Paul Archard, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriting Agents Association, said the allegations of fraud 'were always a nonsense'. He criticised the reaction of some groups of Names - individuals whose assets underwrite the market - which had called the Walker report a whitewash. 'That really is a joke,' he said. 'Sir David has the utmost integrity.' Mr Archard said he strongly supported the calls in the report for peer review and echoed Walker's conclusions that the standards of some professionals were too low. 'It would be ludicrous after the 1989 results to say otherwise than that some people fell below the highest standards,' he said. Mr David Rowland, who chaired the task force into the governance of Lloyd's which reported earlier this year, said: 'I make no secret of the fact that the best (professionals) are very good and the bad ones are bloody awful. Walker's conclusions come as no surprise.' Of the Morse report, he said it was 'inconceivable that a sensible man could think otherwise' than to separate governance of the market from its management. At Westminster, where MPs had the opportunity of questioning Sir David in a 45-minute meeting, there was a mixed reaction to the reports. Mr Richard Page, a member of the Conservative backbench trade and industry committee, said it was important that all proposals could be implemented without the need for new legislation which would not have been enacted until 1995. The approval in principle of the Lloyd's Council - the market's ruling body - was 'a marvellous step forward'. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's voice on City affairs, criticised Sir David for accepting a brief that did not address the most serious problems, but said the report's conclusions indicated the failure of the present regulatory structure.</p>

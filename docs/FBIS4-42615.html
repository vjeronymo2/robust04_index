			<p>BFN     [Text] Schwerin (DDP/ADN) -- In the view of Chancellor  Helmut Kohl, "stability criteria are more important than the  calendar" for European currency union. Kohl said in Schwerin  today, during German-Spanish government consultations, that the  national economies must "reach maturity" as a precondition for  the planned currency union of the European states. The  "calendar" for currency union could be postponed, but cannot be  abandoned, Kohl stressed.    Kohl and Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez are to talk  further today about the topic of the European currency union.  Gonzalez pointed out that his two days of talks in Schwerin are  his first visit to one of the new federal German states.</p>

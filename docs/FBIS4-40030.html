			<p>BFN     [Text] A 507-strong constituent convention, held Sunday in  Moscow on the initiative of the Russia's Choice faction in the  State Duma, declared the creation of "Russia's Democratic Choice  Party."    Co-chairman of the Ukrainian inter-regional bloc  Grinev-Kuchma and the former deputy-speaker of the Ukrainian  Supreme Soviet Vladimir Grinev greeted the convention. On  behalf of the delegates, Anatoliy Chubays, who chaired the  convention, wished the inter-regional bloc success in the June  26 presidential elections.    President Yeltsin's press secretary Viacheslav Kostikov  refuses to recognize the new party as "presidential". But in  terms of politics, he told newsmen, the new party shared much  with the president and was a product of what Yeltsin started  back in 1991.    According to Kostikov, the Choice's leaders had made no  false  moves to make Yeltsin join them. In response to a question from  Interfax, Kostikov said the convention could yet receive a  message of greeting from Yeltsin.    In Kostikov's view, the new party and Yeltsin ought to keep  a  reasonable distance between them.    Kostikov would not want to join the party in his capacity of  a public servant. That would make it more difficult for Yeltsin  to work, he said.</p>

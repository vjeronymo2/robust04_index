			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROCKIN' RICHMAN RIDES THE TIDE OF LIFE -- WITH A PASSION;  </P> <P> POP: THE LEADER OF THE MODERN LOVERS HAS TURNED HIS REMARKABLE ENTHUSIASM TO  SURF MUSIC, BUT THAT WON'T BE THE ONLY KIND OF MUSIC HE PLAYS TONIGHT AT THE  COACH HOUSE IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, WHERE HE SHARES THE BILL WITH DICK DALE.  </P> <P> Guitarist Brennan Totten, who toured for a few years with Jonathan Richman's  Modern Lovers, can recall an occasion when he was pulled over by a state  trooper while driving the band through Texas.  </P> <P> What began as a routine traffic citation wound up with the officer giving them  the third degree, having been discomfited by the sight of Richman, star of the  international stage and recording world, perched barefoot and birdlike on the  rear seat, all-but heedless of the police presence as he shoveled down a quart  of Haagen-Dazs with an unnerving abandon.  </P> <P> Richman really likes to eat. Driving to Orange County from his Northern  California home, he will pick up a Harris Ranch pie and eat it by the handful,  along with yogurt, Cornnuts, malteds and the standard road food cornucopia. At  2 a.m. in a coffee shop, he'll have the chili, the banana pancakes and the  onion rings.  </P> <P> His current "Jonathan Richman" album contains a bit of oratory that addresses  this subject, "I Eat With Gusto, Damn! You Bet." And therein lies one of the  constants of Richman's work: He sings about the things he has a passion for.  </P> <P> That he -- given his caloric intake -- doesn't possess the approximate bulk of  a water bed says something about the nature of Richman's passions: He tends to  do most things with gusto, so energetically tackling every moment that one  suspects he even slumbers with a taxing enthusiasm. If a phone conversation  with him sounds just a bit disjointed, it's probably because he's  simultaneously flipping on his backyard trampoline.  </P> <P> In 1973, when he was a self-described "brooding Angst-ridden adolescent,"  Richman recorded "The Modern Lovers," an album sufficiently dark and uptight to  influence the Sex Pistols and a host of other glum chums, and to be regarded  more recently by Rolling Stone magazine as No. 52 in its list of the "100 Best  Albums of the Last 20 Years."  </P> <P> Since that time, though, Richman's songs instead have evoked a world that's  loose and limber, where, when "your friends are dancing on the lawn, no one  acts like something's wrong"; where love and romance win out over fear; and  where one can be snared passionately by the life reaching out from Van Gogh  paintings, a sleeping wife, old corner stores, a hot summer night, or even  discarded chewing gum wrappers.  </P> <P> One of the 38-year-old's present enthusiasms is surf music; a desire to play  some twang-oriented bills led to his shows with "King of the Surf Guitar" Dick  Dale tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano and Saturday at Bogart's  in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Visiting Orange County two weeks ago, Richman claimed: "The fixation with surf  guitar isn't recent. It's something people were comparing my guitar style to  even when I was starting out. It's part of my guitar playing.  </P> <P> "The new fixation is wanting to be part of the Southern California music scene  because I'm lonely up there in Northern Cal right now. The closest music scene  I can think of to what I'm doing is surf music, at least of the music that's  still being played now in California."  </P> <P> Richman won't be particularly more surf-bent at these shows than he's ever been  -- indeed, he's recently taken to accompanying himself with only a  nylon-stringed classical guitar. But he sees several connections between the  two types of music.  </P> <P> "For one thing, there's a strong love of nature in both styles -- it's  physical. And second, there's also a kind of dreaminess in surf music that is  also in mine. The way they describe a scene with guitars, I tend to describe it  more with words, but with both you're supposed to feel it rather than  understand it.  </P> <P> "Another reason why I like playing with surf acts is both styles are party  music, as far as I'm concerned. I don't want it to be a concert. I want it to  be like a party, which to me is where you feel loose enough to dance, without  anybody making a big deal out of it, and where you have a lot of fun. I think  once rock 'n' roll got taken seriously, it ruined everything."  </P> <P> Although Richman rhapsodizes about the surf scene and wanting to take part in  the sort of 12-act rock-and-roll cavalcades that rumbled through the states in  the '50s, he insists he's not living in the past but rather hoping for a future  when our pop culture may get back that early warmth and innocence.  </P> <P> "I want to be part of something new," he said. "I've been lonely for stuff  before, but now is the time when I sense something different could happen. And  I also think that these '80s were lonely enough where I just want to reach out  more.  </P> <P> "That's also why I'm doing my country record (due out on Rounder later this  year). I want to be a part of there being more communication between different  kinds of musicians." (Victor Borge is Richman's favorite stage performer. He  also has a warm regard for the early Iggy Pop.)  </P> <P> And what makes him think the '90s can be different from the '80s?  </P> <P> "I don't even have a clue. I just want it to be. I'm ready for the '90s. I  didn't like the '80s. It was just so distant. Great things happened to me  personally in the '80s, but overall it was just a decade where more people  drove by, and less where they got out of the car and shook hands."  </P> <P> Although some of his harsher critics seem to presume that Richman gets his  hopeful view of the world from the Care Bears, he is distressingly well-read on  the sorry ecological, political and cultural state of things. But he chooses to  think some good eventually may come from our overstressed times.  </P> <P> "For example," he said, "I think L.A. may be one of the first cities to get a  really terrific public transportation system because the pollution is getting  so bad, I think it's going to push it in that good direction. And overall, I  think when things get isolated so much, like they did in the '80s, people will  get tired of it and want to get closer."  </P> <P> While the song "Closer" on the "Jonathan Richman" album is about his wife,  Gail, closer also describes Richman's professional direction. The ideal  performance to him is one where the audience shows "lots of emotion: I want to  see lots of gnashing of teeth and beating on chests, weeping and wailing. I  want to see crying and dancing in the streets."  </P> <P> To that end he employs the nylon-string guitar and performs solo because the  nakedness of thesound makes for a more intimate show -- "I was pretty  spontaneous anyway with a band; now I'm unstoppable." He thinks volume has its  place in teen-age music but likens his over-amped contemporaries to "seeing  your dad at the intersection revving the engine of his sports car. It's  embarrassing." In a bio sent to fans last year, he described high-volume as  "not a necessity but a hindrance to communication and intimacy."  </P> <P> He's not one to go for technological blockades on his records either. Most of  the "Jonathan Richman" album was first-take material, with only his stamping  feet accompanying his guitar and vocals on several tracks. (Two instrumentals,  "Blue Moon" and "Sleepwalk," feature longtime bass associate Curly Keranen and  the late Ron Wilson, creator of what is undoubtedly the world's most copied  drum solo, the original "Wipeout.")  </P> <P> The record not only contains mistakes, but also has a song extolling them, "A  Mistake Today for Me." There is the French-language "Que Reste-T-ll de Nos  Amours?" from French balladeer Charles Trenet, while "Fender Stratocaster"  paints a rocking, shimmering impressionistic vision of that O.C.-born electric  guitar:  </P> <P>  Like the wind in your hair when the top is down,  </P> <P>  Like taillights headed for another town,  </P> <P>  Fender Stratocaster, there's something about that sound.  </P> <P>  "Before I started playing music when I was 17, I wanted to be a painter,"  Richman recalls. "Then I realized I could make stuff happen right in front of  people, not just do it at home and have them see it later. Once I saw that, I  said, 'Whooa! That's what I want to do.' "  </P> <P> That's still the case. "I promised myself then that I'd quit if it ever became  work instead of fun. It would really take some searching to find something I'd  enjoy nearly as much as this."  </P> <P>  Jonathan Richman and the Dick Dale Power Trio play tonight at 9 at the Coach  House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $15. Information:  (714) 496-8930.  </P> <P> </P></p>

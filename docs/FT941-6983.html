			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions As the reporting season gets under way, there has been a pick-up in directors' activity. Kleen-e-Ze has appeared several times in this column. In December 1992, directors picked up a considerable amount of stock around the 20p mark. Now, after a period of outperformance, more stock has been sold by RM Klein, the chairman and chief executive, - bringing his total disposals since the share price started rising to more than 820,000. But the sale was specifically to satisfy a family trust purchase of the outstanding equity in a company called Exclu. He retains more than 1.2m shares in Kleen-e-Ze. London &amp; Clydeside Holdings has been affected (like other property companies) by the recession. But directors have been particularly good at selling at the optimum moment. The last record of their activity was when three sold at prices around 145p in spring 1991. In March 1993, we noted one director buying at 55p; now, a year later, we see one selling at 145p. Vardon, the leisure company, appears in both the buy and sell section. The sale was made by two directors in order to satisfy capital gains allowances following the acquisition of their family firm by Vardon last year. The purchases were made by the chairman and chief executive and increased their holdings considerably.

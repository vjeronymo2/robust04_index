			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Big cuts in grants and tuition fees - Universities Higher education is to be subjected to a severe regime of funding cuts. Both grants paid to students for living costs and tuition fees paid to universities will be cut heavily. The decisions follow a sharp rise in student numbers. Since 1987 the proportion of 18-year-olds entering university has more than doubled, from 15 per cent to 32 per cent. The news is a deep disappointment for universities, which had campaigned for the government to raise extra revenue by introducing loans to pay for tuition which would be repaid by graduates via the income tax system. Now, the chances that universities will have to introduce 'top-up' tuition fees, payable by students before they start on courses, appear to have been greatly increased. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, claimed that there would be a reduction of nearly 3.5 per cent in the numbers entering higher education next year 'because of demographic trends'. He predicted as well 'a further small tightening in standards of entry'. But the Universities' Central Admissions Service said that applications for next year, at 180,000, were already 5 per cent higher than at the same point last year, showing that demand was buoyant. It predicted universities would have to raise the standards of their offers. Tuition fees paid to higher education institutions by the government have been cut by 45 per cent for all courses. These fees were adopted to encourage universities to expand, gaining extra funding by recruiting extra students. Fees for clinical medicine, laboratory-based, and classroom-based (arts) courses have now been cut to Pounds 750 for arts courses, Pounds 1,600 for sciences, and Pounds 2,800 for clinical courses. Student grants, to help with living costs, will be cut by 10 per cent. That will be offset by a rise in the money available through the government's Student Loans Company. The total funds available to students will rise by 4 per cent. Similar cuts will be made in the next two years, so that in the academic year beginning in September 1996, grants and loans will be roughly equal.  --------------------------------------------- FUNDING OF HIGHER EDUCATION  ---------------------------------------------                            In Pounds m                    1994/5     1995/6   1996/7  --------------------------------------------- Recurrent grant     3,096      3,350    3,342 Capital grant         322        381      424  --------------------------------------------- Source: Department for Education  ---------------------------------------------</p>

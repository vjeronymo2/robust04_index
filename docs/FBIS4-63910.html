			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 25 May -- A decision to set up a Television  and Radio League [Liga televideniya I radio] was taken today by  representatives of over 100 all-Russian and regional state and  independent radio and TV companies. Anatoliy Lysenko, general  director of the All-Russia Radio and TV Company, was elected  chairman of the body while it is being established.    The league will be a body of the Union of Journalists of  Russia. In an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Union  Chairman Vsevolod Bogdanov voiced the hope that the league will  be able to exert considerable influence on the framing of  legislation in the TV and radio broadcasting field, will become  a collective body defending the interests of the "electronic"  press, and will enable a number of topical professional issues  to be resolved. At the first organizational meeting, Grigoriy  Shevelev, Ostankino's first deputy chairman, was instructed to  take charge of the work of setting up an academy of radio and  television. Other areas of the league's activities were also  outlined.</p>

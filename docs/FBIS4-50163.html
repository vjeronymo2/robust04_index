			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special reporter Mai Ying (7796 5391) from </F> Guangzhou: "Zhao Ziyang and Yang Shangkun Meet and Have a Long  Talk at Xijiaoshan in Guangdong"]    [Text] According to a well-informed source here, Zhao  Ziyang, former CPC Central Committee general secretary, and Yang  Shangkun, former Central Military Commission vice chairman, met  at Guangdong Nanhai City's Xijiaoshan, a scenic spot, and had a  long talk free of any external interference.    It has been learned that Yang Shangkun earlier came to  Xijiaoshan from Zhuhai for the summer and recently has been  staying in Guangdong. Zhao Ziyang went to Sichuan "to set his  mind at ease [san xin 2414 1800]," but he did not return  directly to Beijing and went to Guangdong instead.    According to the source, Zhao Ziyang was accompanied by an  entourage of a dozen or so attendants, but Guangdong's major  officials did not show up to welcome him or see him off, they  only arranged some security measures. Yang Shangkun also  politely declined the company of local officials because he  wanted to ensure a good rest.    Nobody knows what these two political figures, who at one  time were the men of the day but subsequently lost power,  discussed during their meeting.    Zhao Ziyang and Yang Shangkun have a very special  relationship in the mainland China political arena. Both of  them were pushed to the top of the power ladder by Deng Xiaoping  in the late 1970's and rendered meritorious service in  consolidating Deng Xiaoping's power base and promoting reform  and opening up. As power was redistributed, however, they were  both consigned to a state of limbo.    Both Zhao Ziyang and Yang Shangkun had at one time been in  charge of Guangdong and were appointed to the office of  Guangdong Provincial Party Committee secretary, one succeeding  the other. When they were promoted to the central authorities,  they often returned to Guangdong for brief stays.    Following the 4 June incident, Zhao Ziyang has been  basically  held under house arrest, but he has gradually been given a  certain degree of freedom since 1993 and has secretly visited  Hunan, Heilongjiang, and Sichuan to "set his mind at ease." It  is believed that Zhao Ziyang's recent trip to Guangdong was his  first since 4 June 1989.    Yang Shangkun and Zhao Ziyang have consistently maintained a  good relationship. Deng Xiaoping, however, stripped military  power from Yang Baibing, Yang Shangkun's blood brother, with a  view to protecting and promoting Jiang Zemin in 1992, without  dropping any hints to the elder beforehand, which made Yang  Shangkun very unhappy. Consequently, the two families of Deng  Xiaoping and Yang Shangkun broke off a tradition of close ties  which had lasted dozens of years. When Yang Shangkun broke his  leg last summer, Deng Xiaoping sent his wife Zhuo Lin to pay him  a visit and extend his regards, but that did not result in the  reconciliation of the two families.    Since the 1994 spring festival, Yang Shangkun has had more  occasions to make public appearances, has publicly made a speech  in Shenzhen, has summoned responsible persons from the Guangdong  party committee to hold a meeting, and has aired his views on  reform in a speech for internal circulation. On the eve of the  opening of the National People's Congress this year, the XINHUA  NEWS AGENCY quite extraordinarily reported the speech Yang  Shangkun had given two weeks earlier. It is generally believed  that, because Yang Shangkun tactfully turned down Zhao Ziyang's  request to mediate between Deng Xiaoping and Zhao himself in the  days prior to the 4 June incident, and due to the role Yang  Shangkun played in the 4 June incident itself, there must be  still some ill feeling between the two men.    Some scholars, however, believe that Yang Shangkun and Zhao  Ziyang have each maintained their influence in the military,  economic and political circles, and the power they would have  behind the scenes in the post-Deng era should not be  underestimated.    Judged against this background, the recent Xijiaoshan  meeting  between Yang Shangkun and Zhao Ziyang has profound significance,  particularly when one considers the rumors that are circulating  regarding Deng Xiaoping's poor health and the extreme  instability of Mainland China's political and economic situation  on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the 4 June incident.</p>

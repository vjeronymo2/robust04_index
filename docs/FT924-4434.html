			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Tomkins cash call attracts 90.42% acceptance TOMKINS, the industrial conglomerate, received acceptances in respect of 90.42 per cent of the 335.78m shares on offer through its rights issue to help acquire Ranks Hovis McDougall. The remaining 32.15m shares not taken up have been placed with shareholders. The first payment under the rights became payable on Monday with the last date for acceptance of the rights issue. Tomkins Pounds 653m cash call is the third largest fully underwritten rights issue in the London market, behind BT and Blue Arrow. Tomkins shares edged 3 1/2 p higher yesterday to 232p - above the see-through price at which its cash and paper offer for RHM is worth more than its 260p cash alternative. Mr Greg Hutchings, Tomkins chief executive, said he was 'delighted with the level of support from shareholders'. The first closing on its bid for RHM is on December 7 ahead of which the company needs approval for the deal at an EGM on Friday. The recent rise on the Tomkins share price means the share and cash offer may be better value than the cash alternative and could leave the company with low gearing, after payment of the second tranche of the rights issue.</p>

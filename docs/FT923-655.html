			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Rolls-Royce drops plans for new model ROLLS-ROYCE Motor Cars, the loss-making subsidiary of Vickers, has been forced to postpone indefinitely the costly development of a generation of new models in the face of mounting financial problems and Vickers' failure to find a 'strategic partnership' for the troubled business. According to Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers' chief executive, the company had made 'intensive efforts' to find a partner for the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars operations. It had failed to make any deal, however, most importantly because of the 'continuing uncertainty' of the business. Sir Colin said that Rolls-Royce Motor Cars would be unable to press ahead with development of a new model generation in the present business climate, but would seek to 'evolve' its present cars. The latest round of 950 job cuts announced this week for its Crewe plant are aimed at reducing the company's break-even level to around 1,400 cars a year from 2,800 in 1990. Sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars have plunged from a peak total of 3,300 in 1990 to 1,723 last year, and are forecast to total between 1,250 and 1,350 for the whole of this year. 'Our policy for this business is to continue to make use of the brand name and trade from this new break-even level,' said Sir Colin. 'We will try to sell profitably from that level for the next two to three years. We will continue product development on an evolutionary basis. We think that will work. There is an awful lot of customer loyalty.' He said that Vickers had reached 'a fair bit of depth' in negotiations with 'one or two partners', but there had never been 'a concrete figure offered'. The most serious discussions have been with BMW of Germany. Postponement of the development of a new product generation is a serious setback for the company. The company had expected that the present Rolls-Royce/Bentley chassis platform would be replaced early in the second half of the 1990s. That would have maintained its present 15-to-17-year model life cycle, which is two to three times the industry norm. Sir Colin said would-be partners also faced problems in their own luxury car businesses. 'It is the wrong time to be trying to negotiate a partnership,' he said. He expected further negotiations, however. 'It has not gone away. When markets come back, I am sure that negotiations will resume.' Vicker was no longer 'actively trying to sell' the Rolls-Royce business, however. Sir Colin said: 'We think we can run it profitably.'</p>

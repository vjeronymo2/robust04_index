			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / US-Arab deals will be kept secret MANY important features of the general understandings reached between the US and Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states about maintaining an American military presence in the region will be kept secret because of Arab sensitivity about too close an identification with Washington. As he returned to the US yesterday from a visit to the Gulf states, Mr Richard Cheney, the US defence secretary, said there was now 'broad agreement on a regional basis for co-operation between the US and the governments in the area on security matters. There is a significantly enhanced willingness on the part of many of the governments in the region to co-operate on security arrangements.' Many issues have still to be decided in further negotiations, such as the frequency of joint exercises between the US and Gulf states, the size of forces involved, the nature of contingency planning, and arrangements for storing equipment in the region. The US opposes having permanent bases but wants forces to be involved in big sea, land and air exercises, with troops rotated regularly. Even after these matters are resolved, many will remain secret. 'It's still the Middle East and therefore a certain amount of discretion is required in terms of what you say publicly,' Mr Cheney said. Mr Cheney also discussed sales of US conventional arms to Gulf states to improve their ability to defend themselves. The US aim is to strengthen local forces and pre-position supplies. The number of US troops in the region has dropped from a peak of 540,000 in late February to about 160,000.</p>

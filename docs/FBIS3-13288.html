Certainly, the Hebron massacre,  which drew reactions from and shocked the entire world, has not  made Bill Clinton or his staff bat an eyelash. Nor has this  prompted them to change, even slightly, their country's policy  from that of Israel.    The latest reports on this subject indicates Washington told  the Palestinian leadership that it should resolve its problems  with Israel directly and without any intervention from any other  party, that the discussion of the issue of sending international  protection forces to Gaza and Jericho--and only to Gaza and  Jericho--will be held only within the Israeli-Palestinian  meetings and within the framework of the Oslo agreement.    Thus, the United States proves once again that it is blindly  taking sides with Israeli governments hawks, that it does not  care for Arab and Islamic sentiments that appeared as reactions  to the Hebron massacre, that it insists on hurting the feelings  of Arabs and Muslims and imposes itself by force on Israel's  side as an antagonist of all peoples in the region.    Immediately following the massacre, President Bill Clinton  addressed an appeal to transfer the Israeli-Palestinian talks to  Washington. The PLO immediately accepted the invitation. Now  the U.S. Administration is taking issues back to square one. It  is insisting that the issue of international protection for the  inhabitants of the occupied territory can only be solved between  the PLO and Israel and within the Oslo agreement.    In view of the blood shed by Israeli terrorism at the  Ibrahimi Mosque, the world is now convinced that real protection  for the Palestinian people under occupation must be provided.  However, the United States continues to turn a cold shoulder to  logic and to insist that every Arab and Muslim everywhere must  continue to feel that his actual and definite enemy is the  United States and not the Israeli state.    Why does the United States reject effective protection for  the Palestinian people under occupation and insist on spiking  the wheels, when even some Israeli cabinet members support  providing such protection and for removing settlements from the  West Bank and Gaza?    When it takes a hostile stand that rejects the facts of  history and reality, the United States should not be surprised  if the current that opposes it and its interests intensifies in  the region and throughout the Arab and Islamic worlds as well.  It should not be surprised at what will happen in the future.  People are collections of feelings and sentiments. When their  feelings are hurt their reaction will, by and large, be  spontaneous and without thought or discretion.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> WE SHOULD BE FIRST  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission said we're one of three routes  being considered for (rapid-transit) funding, but they put us third on the  list! Because of the population and problems in the Valley, we should be first.  They're putting Pasadena and the South Bay ahead of us.  </P> <P> We think there's more population and more of a problem in the Valley than in  those areas. The proposal to extend Metro Rail into the Valley is a question of  how much money and political clout we can generate in Los Angeles and  Washington.  </P> <P> Instead of building cute trolley-car lines, we've got to focus on where the  problem is the most severe -- in the San Fernando Valley. $877 million dollars  would have been better spent building a line in the Valley rather than between  downtown and Long Beach. They laughed at (former county Supervisor) Baxter  Ward's proposal (in the early '70s to implement citywide rail transit). If they  had implemented it, it would have been much cheaper and would have alleviated  the mess we have now.  </P></p>

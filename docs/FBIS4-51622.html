			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- Former U.S. President  George Bush said Monday at the opening ceremony of the  Pacific-Asia Travel Association (PATA) annual conference that  tourism is a high-growth industry which contributes greatly to  global economic development and peace. Bush said the tourism  industry is vital because it can play a leading role in  resolving regional conflicts. He also mentioned the importance  of PATA, which admitted Vietnam and South Africa as new members  this year, saying the body provides a new communication channel  for countries across the world.    Touching on the North Korean nuclear dispute, he said China  will play an important role in solving the problem and thus  should not be driven into a corner.    Bush was invited to the conference after appearing in a  television commercial inviting foreigners to visit the United  States. He arrived on Saturday and met with President Kim  Yong-sam and former President No Tae-u later in the day.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 18 (CNS) -- Member of the CPPCC and  associate researcher of the Chinese Academy of Geological  Sciences Mr. Wang Mili said today that a grim situation was  facing the Chinese geological sector as a result of a shortage  of geological resources and investment as well as a draining of  talented people from this field.    Mr. Wang said that the serious shortage of investment in  geological prospecting had resulted in known mineral deposits  not being able to meet the country's needs. Of 45 proven main  mineral resources, 12 will be in short supply within this  century and half of the 45 mineral deposits will not keep pace  with the demands of economic development in the 21st century.    Meanwhile, investment in mineral production was falling,  taking inflation into account, by 10.3 percent annually,  resulting in a half-closure of one-third of geological  prospecting teams, with their salaries and living standard  falling to below the average level in the country. Four such  teams in Guangdong which had made a great contribution to  geological work were living in poverty, and similar workers in  Qinghai Province working on the plateau area for dozens of years  where oxygen is thin continued to live in bad housing  conditions, with their children unable to find work and 175  households, of whom had a per capita income for their daily  expenses of less than RMB 35 [renminbi] monthly. [sentence as  received] Such situations had caused many talented people to  move out of the sector.    The mismanagement of mineral deposits was serious resulting  in environmental pollution, and the safety of workers and public  order had also been affected.    Mr. Wang called for more attention to be given to geological  work to meet the needs of China's economic development. The  caring for the country's natural resources should, like the  control of population and protection of the ecology, be seen as  a fundamental national policy.</p>

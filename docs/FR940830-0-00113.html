			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two comments asked if the references in paragraph (d) to a ``certified statement'' means the statement is required to be notarized. The answer is no, and the phrase ``certified statement'' has been changed to ``statement'' or ``waiver certification,'' as appropriate to the context, in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment said that paragraph (d) should require evidence of actual work on a claim such as proof of a Notice or Plan of Operations as was required under the old rental fee statute. The requirement for a Plan or Notice was statutory under the rental fee regulations, while the maintenance fee statute only calls for submission of proof of annual assessment. Therefore, the Plan of Operations or Notice requirement was not included in this rule. The BLM will perform periodic inspections of mining claims in order to make certain that work is being performed on mining claims for which fees are waived.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment asked whether, pursuant to paragraph (d), a claimant who has one claim, and who is a member of a corporation that has nine claims, other members of which have other claims, can receive the small miner waiver. The answer depends upon whether the claimant is a ``related party'' to the corporation and other members of the corporation. A ``related party'' is defined in the Act as one who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, another. The Act goes on to provide that control includes actual control, legal control, and the power to exercise control, through or by common directors, officers, stockholders, a voting trust, or a holding company or investment company, or any other means. Whether a claimant is a related party for purposes of qualifying as a small miner will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Because this question has been raised in a public comment, BLM will consider a subsequent proposed rulemaking to provide interpretation of this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment correctly observed that, under paragraph (d)(2), a claimant could file for the small miner waiver before August 31, and then relinquish any excess claims so as to have 10 or fewer claims by August 31, thereby meeting that requirement for the waiver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment said that paragraph (d)(5) should require notarization of signatures on the small miner waiver statement. The reason given was that some claimants use fictitious names to increase acreage in association placer claims. Requiring notarization would cause far more difficulty for all concerned, with little or no benefit. Meeting the notarization requirement is especially inconvenient for multiple co-owners. In the event a claimant fraudulently inserts fictitious names as in the example above, the claim would be open to attack from rival claimants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two comments requested a clarification of paragraph (e)(2). The Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act allows mining claims held by persons on active military duty, or within 6 months of their release from active duty, or during or within 6 months after their release from any period of hospitalization due to military injuries, to be exempt from the assessment work requirement. Likewise, such claims will be exempt from the maintenance fee requirement. The official notice filed by a person that he or she has entered active duty in the military service should also include the scheduled date of discharge. Military personnel would be subject to all assessment work or fee requirements 6 months following discharge, unless proof of re-enlistment is submitted that includes a new discharge date. A person who has been on active duty since before August 30, 1994, is required to file notice of such active duty status in the assessment year he or she wishes the exemption to begin. Beginning September 1, 1994, any decision voiding a claim to which this exemption applies, for nonpayment of the maintenance fee, will be vacated. This provision has been added to paragraph (e)(2) in the final rule. Filing a notice of intention to hold is not necessary, because fee payments for mill and tunnel sites, for instance, would merely be exempted in this case. As long as a qualified claimant follows the requirements of this paragraph, the claim cannot be considered abandoned for failure to pay the maintenance fee. Section (e) has also been amended to make it clear that, for a claimant to qualify under this section, he or she must own the claim without any unqualified co-owners, and cannot be controlled by anyone who is unqualified under this section. Finally, for the purpose of clarity, the order of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) in the proposed rule has been reversed in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment stated that paragraph (f) should be removed because it would allow claimants who cannot perform assessment work in National Parks, for example, also to avoid paying the maintenance fee. Because the assessment work restriction within National Parks does not automatically signify that a claimant has been denied all access to his or her mining claim(s), BLM has accepted this comment and paragraph (f) has been removed in the final rule. Claimants who hold mining claims within National Parks and who would otherwise file a notice of intention to hold must pay the maintenance fee to hold their claims unless they are denied all access to their mining claims by the National Park Service or they are qualified as a small miner. Claimants who have been denied all access to their mining claims by the National Park Service or other governmental agencies may seek relief from the maintenance fee under &sect;3833.1&hyph;6(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 43 CFR 3833.1&hyph;8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section is redesignated in this final rule as section 3833.1&hyph;1. The old &sect;3833.1&hyph;1 is being removed administratively as a part of this rule, as explained above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

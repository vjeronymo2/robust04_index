BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TAIWAN TARIFF CUT ON 1,900 ITEMS  </P> <P> Tariffs will be reduced on 1,900 goods in a market-widening move designed to  support Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the  Finance Ministry said today.  </P> <P> A ministry section chief said the government is drafting a list of about 1,900  imported products, including passenger cars, automobile components, farm goods  and precision instruments, that could have their import tariffs cut early next  year.  </P> <P> "The purpose of our tariff cut is to encourage imports and liberalize our  market," the official said in a telephone interview. "It is also in line with  our plans to join GATT."  </P> <P> Taiwan had a trade surplus of $12 billion with the United States in 1989,  although the figure is expected to drop below $10 billion this year, Taiwan  trade officials said.  </P></p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Rollercoaster computer failure to be probed A US electronics expert is due in Blackpool today to investigate why two computerised safety features on the world's highest rollercoaster apparently failed on Thursday, resulting in 26 passengers requiring hospital treat-ment after two trains collided. Blackpool Pleasure Beach, the privately held company which owns the rollercoaster, said it had told Arrow Dynamics, the US company which designed the ride, that it needed assurances that no further accidents could occur. The rollercoaster, which officially opened last week, will remain closed until assurances have been given. The company said the accident occurred when two trains collided at the end of the ride. One train stopped shortly before it reached the end instead of gliding into the disembarkation point. The rollercoaster's computer system should have prevented this from happening, the company said. The computer system should then have stopped the train behind. It did not do so, however, and the second train ran into the first at 7mph, about 15 feet above the ground. The company accepted that as the ride is 235 feet high, with a top speed of 85 mph, the accident could have been far worse. The collision is a serious embarrassment to Blackpool Pleasure Beach, which is Britain's biggest free tourist attraction and drew 6.75m visitors last year. This year Blackpool is celebrating the centenary of its tower. The rollercoaster, which is so high that it has aircraft warning beacons and required the approval of the Civil Aviation Authority, was intended to be the resort's biggest attraction. The English Tourist Board designated 1994 the Year of the Rollercoaster in its honour. First Leisure, the company which owns Blackpool tower, said it hoped the accident would not cast a pall over the centenary celebrations. It added, however, that it did not think it would result in fewer people visiting Blackpool this summer. The rollercoaster is called the Pepsi Max Big One and is sponsored by the US soft drinks company. Pepsi said yesterday: 'We are concerned to learn of the accident. We are in contact with the directors of Blackpool Pleasure Beach and are awaiting the results of the investigation.' Blackpool Pleasure Beach said two passengers on the ride were still in hospital yesterday. Officials from the Health and Safety Executive had begun interviewing staff about the incident.</p>

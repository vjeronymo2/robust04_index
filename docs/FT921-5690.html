			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Low steel prices cut ASW to Pounds 2.3m FALLS IN steel prices of between 10 and 20 per cent hit profits at ASW Holdings, the Cardiff-based steel and wire group. It made only Pounds 2.3m before tax last year, compared with Pounds 40.3m in 1990. ASW cut its final dividend from 8p to 4.5p, making a total of 9p (12.5p). The share price fell 7p to a new low of 131p. Mr Alan Cox, chief executive, said that in 1990 prices in Europe had been the same as in 1985. 'From that point, they came down by at least 10 per cent and in some cases by 15 to 20 per cent.' This accounted for the bulk of the Pounds 31.6m decline in operating profit to Pounds 9m. Exceptional charges for a further round of cost-cutting amounted to Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 1m). Mr Cox said there had been no closures, but 200 jobs had been shed and more were to come. 'We are one of the lowest cost producers in Europe and we are competing in an arena where the whole industry is losing a lot of cash.' There have been complaints from some producers about state subsidies sustaining the low prices. Mr Cox said it was not only state-owned companies that were 'losing cash in a way that we would find difficult', but also parts of large groups. Differing financial systems also played a part. Group turnover fell 14 per cent to Pounds 390.7m (Pounds 454.3m). An increase in sales outside Europe from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds 37m could not offset the near Pounds 86.7m fall within it. However, Mr Cox pointed out that this was partly because the group no longer needed to buy in billet to satisfy UK demand. Little profit had been made on that transaction. ASW held cash of about Pounds 1m compared with Pounds 24.4m in December 1990. This was after paying nearly Pounds 18m for Bird Fragmentation, the scrap metal group, plus tax and dividends. Capital spending had been kept at nearly Pounds 10m. Losses per share were 1.9p (earnings 37.1p). The retained loss was Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 16.1m profit), reducing 1990 shareholders' funds of Pounds 152m. COMMENT ASW gained some credit for staying in the black at the operating level and for conserving cash, while many of its competitors lost out on both counts. The exceptional charges look high, but at least the decks should have been cleared for this year. The group clings tenaciously to its reputation as one of Europe's lowest cost producers, which should bode well when the long-awaited upturn in European prices arrives. The big question is when will it arrive? And the answer is a lottery. One analyst is forecasting Pounds 10m pre-tax if prices for some products, such as wire rod, start to rise in the second quarter. Another is going for Pounds 5m on the assumption there will be no improvement until the third quarter. While prices have stopped falling, there has so far been little action, such as a wave of closures, to effect a rationalisation of capacity. The prospective p/e is 13 even on the more optimistic figure. However, the yield of just over 9 per cent looks fairly secure (even though the interim may be cut) and should support the price.</p>

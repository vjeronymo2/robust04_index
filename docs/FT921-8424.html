			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Waldegrave announces HIV compensation GOVERNMENT compensation for people infected with HIV, the virus that can lead to Aids, during National Health Service blood transfusions and tissue transfers, was announced yesterday by Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary. The package, which will cost about Pounds 12m, follows a Pounds 42m scheme announced in November 1990 to help haemophiliacs who suffered in the same way. There were 74 reports at the end of December of HIV infection in people who had blood transfusions or tissue transfers. The maximum payment will be Pounds 80,500. The circumstances of each infected transfusion or tissue recipient will be considered individually to establish that the treatment was the source of their infection. A panel of experts, chaired by Mr Benet Hytner QC, will be set up to consider cases where necessary. Payments will be made as soon as possible. Mr Waldegrave said the government did not accept the argument for a general scheme of 'no fault' compensation for medical accidents, but ministers had decided to treat patients infected with HIV as a special case. Labour welcomed the change in the government's position, although it criticised the delay in reaching the decision. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, suggested the shift 'may well have more to do with the approaching election than with the existing injustice to people tragically and accidentally infected with HIV'. The amounts of payments to be made are Pounds 41,500 for each infant, Pounds 43,500 each for single adults, Pounds 52,000 for each married adult without dependent children and Pounds 80,500 each for infected people with dependent children. These sums comprise the variable amounts paid to HIV infected haemophiliacs following the settlement of litigation, and the payments of Pounds 20,000 to each HIV infected haemophiliac which were announced on November 23 1989. Mrs Margaret Jay, director of the National Aids Trust, said: 'The government's decision is welcome, but late. It could have saved long months of unnecessary hardship by making this announcement earlier.'</p>

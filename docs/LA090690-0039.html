			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TUCSON POWER SUES EDISON FOR LOSSES IN DERAILED MERGER  </P> <P> Financially ailing Tucson Electric Power filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit  Wednesday against Southern California Edison in connection with Edison's 1988  proposed merger with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, a move that eventually  derailed Tucson Electric's previously proposed merger with SDG&amp;E.  </P> <P> The suit seeks damages, interest payments and attorneys' fees that could total  "hundreds of millions of dollars," Tucson Electric spokesman Roger Yohem said.  Although Tucson Electric is seeking mone tary damages, the suit that was filed  in San Diego Superior Court does not attempt to block Edison's pending merger  with SDG&amp;E, Yohem said.  </P> <P> "The suit is totally groundless and without merit," Edison spokesman Lew Phelps  said. "Tucson Electric Power at the time that it agreed to terminate its merger  agreement with SDG&amp;E indicated that it wasn't damaged as a consequence of  the termination of the (Tucson-San Diego) merger."  </P> <P> "TEP by its own admission is in dire financial health, and they're apparently  grasping at straws" with the lawsuit, Phelps said.  </P> <P> However, utility-industry observers said the unexpected suit could further  complicate the already complex and controversial $2.4-billion stock swap merger  between SDG&amp;E and Edison that is being reviewed by federal and state  regulators. If completed, the Edison-SDG&amp;E merger would create the nation's  largest investor-owned utility, with 4.8 million customers.  </P> <P> The lawsuit alleges that the Tucson utility was weakened financially after  SCEcorp, Edison's Rosemead-based parent company, proposed merging Edison with  SDG&amp;E. Edison's intervention dashed Tucson Electric's hope of spreading its  excess power generation among the broadened customer base that a merger with  SDG&amp;E would have created.  </P> <P> "The plot thickens with this lawsuit," said Michael Shames, executive director  of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group that is  opposing Edison's proposed merger with SDG&amp;E. "If the (Tucson  Electric-SDG&amp;E) merger had gone through, Tucson would be in a lot better  position than it is now. . . . The damages could be substantial. The 'hundreds  of millions' figure is probably not an exaggeration."  </P> <P> As part of its initial merger agreement with Tucson Electric, SDG&amp;E agreed  to pay the Arizona utility $25 million if the merger were not completed. Tucson  Electric still expects to collect that $25 million, which is not connected to  the Wednesday lawsuit.  </P> <P> Tucson Electric's claim that Edison's uninvited bid for SDG&amp;E weakened the  Arizona utility financially "is accurate to a degree," according to Doug  Brooks, director of the Arizona Corporate Commission's Residential Utility  Consumers Office, which represents Arizonans in utility matters before the  commission.  </P> <P> However, "a lot has gone on with Tucson Electric Power other than the failure  of the merger agreement," Brooks said.  </P> <P> The Tucson-based utility "took some significant hits last October" when the  Arizona Corporations Commission ordered the utility's shareholders to absorb a  significant portion of costs associated with new coal-fired electrical  generating units, Brooks said. With the new units now on line, Tucson Electric  has a surplus of relatively high-priced electricity.  </P> <P> Largely because of those expensive and under-utilized power plants, Tucson  Electric reported a $87.4-million net loss and $233 million in revenue for the  six-month period that ended June 30. The utility reported a $41.4-million net  profit and $260 million in revenue for the corresponding period the previous  year.  </P> <P> Tucson Electric's stock, which closed at $53 a share July 26, 1988, the day  that Edison unveiled its uninvited stock swap merger with SDG&amp;E, has traded  in recent weeks at about $10 a share, Yohem said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The suit "seeks . . . (damages) for what's been lost to the company and its  shareholders," since Edison made its bid for SDG&amp;E, Yohem said. "If the  merger had been completed as originally planned, there would have been initial  benefits to shareholders, but the company's ratepayers would also have  benefitted down the line" through economies of scale that would have produced  lower-priced electricity, Yohem said.  </P> <P> The suit filed in San Diego Wednesday afternoon charges that Edison and SCE  engaged in "malicious, outrageous and oppressive" conduct and "willful, wanton,  reckless and conscious disregard of the rights and interests of TEP" when it  interfered with Tucson Electric's now-abandoned merger bid with SDG&amp;E.  </P> <P> Edison's intervention caused TEP to suffer a "loss of substantial economic  benefits and other damages," Yohem said.  </P> <P> Wednesday's lawsuit was the latest chapter in an already lengthy story  involving Tucson Electric, SDG&amp;E and Edison.  </P> <P> The saga began on June 13, 1988, when SDG&amp;E and Tucson Electric announced a  planned merger valued at $1.9 billion that would have produced a utility  company with excess electrical generating capacity and an extensive electrical  transmission grid. The utility, which was to have been headquartered in San  Diego, would have had $5.6 billion in assets, 3.8 million customers and 5,681  employees.  </P> <P> But that merger fell apart on Nov. 3, 1988, just months after Edison made its  uninvited bid for SDG&amp;E. Tucson Electricd's board of directors abandoned  the merger rather than join SDG&amp;E in what the Tucson company believed would  be a lengthy, costly and unsuccessful attempt to fight off Edison's merger  offer.  </P></p>

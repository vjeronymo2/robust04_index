			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial report] In a 3,000-word article entitled "A  Bundle of Lessons From Algeria" on page 9 of Cairo AL-AHRAM in  Arabic on 4 January, writer Fahmi Huwaydi views the events in  Algeria in 1993. He notes that the 1993 "bitter harvest" in  Algeria is full of "precious lessons that we must examine one  after the other" to learn the "lessons and examples that are of  interest to us all, without exception."    The first lesson to be learned from the Algerian crisis, the  writer notes, is that "violence generates violence and blind  repression serves as a fuel for terrorism." After reviewing the  events that triggered the crisis in Algeria, Huwaydi adds:  "When the authority realized rather belatedly--20 months after  the start of the bloody confrontations--that it was necessary to  reopen the door of dialogue with the moderates in the Islamic  Salvation Front, the front's leaders detained in prisons since  the beginning of 1992 had almost lost control of their elements  abroad, who were scattered and distributed among various groups.  Worse still, the armed group rejected the dialogue and vowed to  continue the fighting until the end." Now, he adds, secret  contacts are under way to find moderates within the Islamic  Front to find a way out of the crisis.    The second lesson, he adds, is that "Arabism and Islam are  the core of the conflict." He points out that the Algerian  government crackdown on the Islamic Front was not in defense of  democracy but rather against the front's affiliation with  Arabism, Islam, and independence from French hegemony. He notes  that "in the name of defending the republic and a secular  society, a motley of intellectuals and politicians has given  their full backing to the policy of repression and elimination  by depicting whoever is affiliated with Islam as a terrorist."    Continuing his article, Huwaydi points out that the third  lesson is that the "blackout has unleashed the forces of evil  and provided a chance for penetration." He notes that the ban  on political activity has made "clandestine activity" the only  alternative, thus giving various elements the chance to move in  the dark knowing for certain that the fingers of accusation will  point to the obvious "defendant, in this case the Salvation  Front. He refers to a theory in Algeria arguing that  "suspicious quarters" are working hard to create chaos in the  country.    The fourth lesson advanced by Huwaydi is that the "crisis  has  weakened the state and forced it to bow." Noting that the  crisis has paralyzed the Algerian economy and forced the prime  minister to announce that the country is unable to service its  foreign debts, the government had no alternative but to sign an  "unfavorable" agreement to reschedule its debts and acquiesce to  the "harsh" terms imposed by the IMF to finalize the  rescheduling.    The fifth lesson to be learned from the crisis, Huwaydi  adds,  is that it has resulted in a "decline in Western support." He  cites a French paper as saying that the Western governments  backed the current regime in Algeria as the "lesser of two  evils" compared to the fundamentalists, but now the West is  wondering if its policy was correct.</p>

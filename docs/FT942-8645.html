			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Investors back change of control at Brandon Hire Brandon Hire, the USM-traded tool, catering and furniture hirer which last month announced an acquisition that could lead to a mandatory offer being made for the company, yesterday won the necessary approvals at an EGM for the transaction to proceed. Under the terms of the deal Brandon is to acquire - for 3.75m new ordinary shares - JSL Fasteners, a company formed last year by Mr John Laycock. At the same time Mr Laycock has agreed to acquire 2.25m Brandon shares at 55p apiece from Mr Colin Stone, Brandon's joint managing director, finance director and co-founder, who will resign with compensation for loss of office. Following the passing of the resolutions Mr Stone has resigned as a director of Brandon and Mr Laycock has been appointed as chief executive. Mr Laycock now owns or controls 6m Brandon shares - 42.5 per cent of the enlarged share capital - and is, under the terms of the Takeover Code, required to make a mandatory offer for the remainder of the equity. The offer, which is priced at 55p, will close on June 8 unless declared unconditional as to acceptances, in which case it will remain open until June 22. Irrevocable undertakings not to accept the offer have been received from directors speaking for 4.95m shares - 35.04 per cent of the enlarged equity. Imperial Pension Nominees, Brandon's largest outside shareholder, has also undertaken not to accept in respect of its holding of 785,000 shares - 5.5 per cent. Brandon's shares closed up 3p at 71p.</p>

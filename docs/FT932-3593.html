			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / US, Japan still split on trade TWO days of talks between the US and Japan, which ended in Washington on Saturday, failed to narrow the gap between the two sides on a framework for bilateral trade negotiations and in particular on how Japan's huge trade surplus might be reduced. The talks were the first round of formal exchanges between US and Japanese officials aimed at formulating a framework for negotiating economic and trade issues, which was agreed between President Bill Clinton and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, in April. The inconclusive nature of the talks leaves the possibility of further uncertainty on the foreign exchange market where US unhappiness with Japan's surplus and the lack of a clear Japanese strategy for reducing it have led to the rapid appreciation of the yen against the dollar. Although details have not been revealed, on the first day of talks the US is believed to have urged Japan to accept its proposal to set a target of reducing its current account surplus to within 1-2 per cent of GDP development and increase the ratio of imports to GDP. Japanese officials, however, are expected to have rejected that on the grounds that the surplus and its import ratio are both the result of economic activity over which they do not, as members of a free market economy, have control. The US and Japan are committed to agreeing ground rules and procedures for the talks before the Group of Seven summit early next month. However, the two sides are still far apart on their views of what lies behind Japan's high trade surplus. The US believes the closed nature of Japan's markets is a main reason for the surplus and would like to set measurable indicators of progress to ensure that Japan opens its markets to imports. Japan, on the other hand, insists that it has one of the most open markets in the world and emphasises the imbalances of investment and savings in the two countries as being a big factor behind its surplus. It believes more long-term measures are needed on both sides to reduce its surplus with the rest of the world. On the second day of the talks, the US and Japan were, however, able to agree on global co-operation in issues such as environmental protection and technology transfer. The talks are expected to resume in Tokyo in the last week of this month.</p>

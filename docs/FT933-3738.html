			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Appetisers: Price falls A SHARE reduction in the price of grapes for the coming vintage, agreed by Champagne merchants and growers, reflects their continuing stock and sales problems. Prices are from Ffr24 (Pounds 2.73) a kilo for the top districts on the Montagne de Reims and the Cote des Blancs, to Ffr20.5 and from Ffr20 to Ffr16.4 in the lesser districts in the Marn and Aube. Moreover the maximum permitted yield of grapes per hectare for appellation champagne has been cut to 10.400 kilos, with 2,000 kilos of these blocked as still wine until lowered stock levels permit their second, sparkling fermentation. Over-stocked merchants were hoping for a significantly lower maximum yield per ha, so the agreed figure favours growers who make their own champagne. But the lower price will make possible lower-cost wines. Following in the footsteps of rivals Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose and Sainsbury's, Tesco is now offering wine by mail order, at prices that represent a discount of at least five per cent on shelf prices. Nine sensible cases have been put together, at Pounds 33 to Pounds 54 a dozen. Delivery of one case costs Pounds 3.50, but is free for two cases to one address. More information, not from Tesco stores but on 091-416-5138 weekdays 9am to 9pm. It is also well worth ordering two cases from the Bin End Sale of Justerini &amp; Brooks (071-493 8721 in London and 031-226 4202 in Edinburgh). They charge Pounds 9 delivery of a single case but nothing at all for delivering two, and the sale, which closes on October 15, is of unsplit cases only. By no means everything is a bargain, but there are useful halves. Anyone who was interested in buying bonds in the new Arran distillers, as reported in the last Weekend FT, might be interested to learn that the quantities of whisky offered for Pounds 450 are 10 cases of Lochranza blended whisky in 1998 and 10 cases of the real thing - Arran malt - in 2001. My apologies for suggesting that only one case of each was offered. Also British Telecom has changed the company's telephone and fax numbers. These are now 0290-552282 and 0290-550177 respectively.</p>

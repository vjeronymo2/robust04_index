			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OIL PRICES FLIRT WITH $40 MARK ON NEW ANXIETY  </P> <P> Oil prices advanced today, moving briefly past the $40-a-barrel mark, as  another round of antagonistic statements from Iraq overshadowed President  Bush's decision to sell a small part of the government's oil reserves.  </P> <P> The November contract for light, sweet crude was up 68 cents at $39.35 per  42-gallon barrel at midday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> Earlier in the session, the contract rose to $40.10, the first time the price  of oil has traded above $40.  </P> <P> An Iraqi threat to execute U.S. and other diplomats unless they hand over  Westerners they are sheltering revived trader fears that a possible military  conflict could disrupt oil supplies from Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> The threat punctured the brief stability Bush's announcement had given the  market. The November contract for crude fell to $37.67 in early trading before  reversing course.  </P></p>

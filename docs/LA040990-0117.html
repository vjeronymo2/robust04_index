			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GRUMMAN, TOKYO TALK COMPUTERS  </P> <P> Grumman, the U.S. aerospace company that is a leader in the business of linking  supercomputers in large-scale networks, said today that it has started talks  with Japanese supercomputer makers to bring the powerful Japanese machines to  America.  </P> <P> "We see Japanese machines successfully entering the U.S. market in the next few  years," said Curtis Orchard, vice president of Grumman International.  </P> <P> Political opposition previously blocked nearly all sales in the United States  of Japanese supercomputers, the powerful computers used mainly in large-scale  research projects to design weapons, aircraft, cars and other products and to  predict weather patterns, among other things.  </P> <P> The supercomputers, the largest of which cost $30 million, are at least 3,500  times faster than the mainframe computers used by most businesses. The machines  are considered vital for keeping a competitive edge.  </P> <P> Under intense pressure from Washington, Tokyo agreed late in March to open its  public market to American-made supercomputers as part of talks aimed at easing  trade tensions between the two economic superpowers.  </P></p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Uncertainty disturbs the financial markets JAPAN'S financial markets were hit yesterday by mounting uncertainty over the country's political outlook. Stocks, bonds and the yen tumbled as investors braced themselves for weakness before parliamentary elections called for July 18. The Nikkei index of 225 leading stocks lost 592.11 points or 3 per cent to a four-month low of 19,212.43, the 10-year benchmark bond fell 0.38 points to 106.91, and the yen declined 2.9 per cent from Friday's Tokyo close to Y110.48. Business leaders expressed concern over the split in the ruling Liberal Democratic party. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the influential business leaders' federation, blamed political uncertainty for the fall in stocks and the yen, and pledged continued support for the LDP. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota Motor, urged early political stability. While some analysts argued that Japan's surging trade surplus remained a case for another strengthening of the Japanese currency, Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, said waning hopes of early economic recovery meant the yen might not rally soon. The weakening of the yen comes as a relief for many exporters, and may alleviate pressure on Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, to ease monetary policy further by cutting the official discount rate. Equity investors blamed the Nikkei fall on a technical correction triggered by the political news. The Nikkei rose 24 per cent in the first four months this year, but has stalled over the past month amid uncertainty over the direction of the economy. Many investors felt prices had become overvalued and the Nikkei price/earnings ratio of 80 at the start of this month did not correctly reflect gloomy prospects for corporate earnings.</p>

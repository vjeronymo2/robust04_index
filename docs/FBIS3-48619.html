			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] MNLF [Moro National Liberation Front] Chairman Nur  Misuari finally signs the proposed guidelines and ground rules  for the implementation of the cease-fire agreement. The  government chief negotiator Manuel Yan describes the signing of  the document as an encouraging development for the peace process.    Under the guidelines of the cease-fire accord, the  government  and the MNLF must identify the location and unit commanders of  the respective forces. It has been agreed that the forces of  both sides shall remain in their respective places and refrain  from any provocative action.    The cease-fire document will be sent to Jakarta for the  signature of the OIC [ICO -- Islamic Conference Organization]  chairman, Ministerial Committee of Six. It will then go to  Jeddah, where the OIC secretary general will sign the document.    Despite the cease-fire, however, government forces still  have  to cope with the presence of so-called MNLF "Lost Command"  rebels. The other day, five police troopers were wounded in a  series of clashes with renegade MNLF rebels in Basilan. The  encounter occurred as DILG [Department of Interior and Local  Government] Secretary Rafael Alunan III stressed that the  operations in Basilan are purely police movements and not  military offensives. The [word indistinct] military and police  forces, Alunan says, are going after criminal elements engaged  in piracy, murder, and kidnapping. The secretary also says the  operations should not be viewed as a violation of the cease-fire  agreement.</p>

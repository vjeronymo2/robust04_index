			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: LDV talks on east European link - Significant expansion potential for largest UK-owned vehicle maker LDV, the Birmingham-based van maker rescued from last year's crash of the Anglo-Dutch DAF commercial vehic-les group, is in advanced negotiations for its vans to be assembled in eastern Europe and for the resumption of exp-orts to west European markets. A successful outcome for both sets of talks would provide significant expansion potential for LDV, which has become the biggest UK-owned vehicle maker as a result of the sale to BMW of Rover Group. As Freight Rover, LDV was itself part of the formerly UK state-owned Rover Group until being hived off to DAF in 1987. LDV yesterday disclosed a further rise in profits and production levels, having already added 200 jobs since a management-led buy-out from the receivers in April last year. The near 1,200 employees at the Washwood Heath plant were told that LDV made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.3m on a Pounds 72m turnover in the six months to June, compared with Pounds 8.6m on Pounds 80m in the company's first eight months of operations last year. With the UK's light commercial vehicles market continuing on a firm recovery course - sales are up 16 per cent so far this year - predictions made by LDV that it would achieve a Pounds 150m turnover this year are already appearing conservative. The company, whose Pounds 40m buy-out was backed by the 3i venture capital group, Royal Bank of Scotland and United Dominions Trust, is investing Pounds 30m in improving manufacturing facilities and developing the Bulldog, a replacement for its existing van ranges which will appear in about 18 months' time. LDV's own UK sales were up 25 per cent in the first eight months of the year and it has twice increased output rates. The plant is currently producing 300 vans a week, compared with 200 in March, and total production this year is expected to reach 12,500 compared with a claimed break-even level of 9,000. LDV's UK current market share of around 12 per cent compares with just over 6 per cent at the time of the buy-out. Agreement with LDV's as yet unnamed east European partner could be finalised within three or four months, after nearly a year of negotiating, Mr Allan Amey, LDV's chief executive, said yesterday. The intended production site is understood to be in one of the former eastern block countries like Hungary or Czechoslovakia rather than Russia itself. LDV is also negotiating with three prospective distributors of its vehicles in western Europe, including DAF Trucks, the Dutch commercial vehicle operations rescued by the Dutch and Belgium governments from the original DAF group's wreckage. Before DAF collapsed in January last year, up to 7,000 of the Birmingham-built vans were being sold each year through its continental European dealerships. LDV's intention is to conclude a west European distribution deal within six months, said Mr Amey, who in February was voted Midlands 'businessman of the year'. Continental Western Europe should be able to provide LDV with at least another 4,000 to 5,000 sales a year, according to Mr Amey. He refused to disclose the potential size of the east European venture but said: 'We're getting pretty excited about it.' About 5 per cent of LDV's output is already exported, mainly outside Europe, and an assembly venture in South Africa is currently being explored.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General description. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission is reproposing a substantially revised Form 13H, Schedules, and Instructions. The revisions to proposed Form 13H reflect the modifications to the definition of a large trader and LTID disclosure requirements and incorporate other recommendations made in the comments. As discussed in the Proposing Release, the information disclosed on Form 13H would be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA'') pursuant to Section 13(h)(7) of the Exchange Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters questioned the apparent lack of a similar exemption for the transaction information reported under the proposed rule. Section 13(h)(7) provides that ``any information required to be kept or reported'' is exempt from disclosure under FOIA. Therefore, transaction information reported under the reproposed rule also would be exempt from disclosure under FOIA. The Commission believes that the non-disclosure of such information also may be covered by other existing Commission rules. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 37 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78m(h)(7) (1990). See Proposing Release, 56 FR 42554 at text accompanying nn. 50&hyph;52.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 37 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , 17 CFR 200.80(b)(3), (4)(iii), (5), (7), and (8).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The cover page to reproposed Form 13H would remain substantially unchanged except for the exclusion of the amended filing requirement, the addition of an inactive filing status, and the capture of applicable LTID or ID System numbers. Item 1 to Form 13H also would be unchanged, except for minor changes that conform with the reproposed definition of a person. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 38 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The remaining Items and Schedules of the proposed form have been substantially revised in the reproposed Form 13H.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 38 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Section II.A.1.a., for a discussion of the addition of persons or entities acting as a trustee to the definition of a person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reproposed Item 2 to Form 13H would implement a new exemption from the filing requirements of reproposed Item 4 for persons and entities regulated by the Commission by allowing the incorporation by reference of information already on file with the Commission. The Commission anticipates that some of the most common registrations or filings that large traders may list in reproposed Item 2 would include: Form BD; Form ADV; Forms 3, 4, or 5; Form 10&hyph;K or 10&hyph;Q; and Form U&hyph;4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Instructions to reproposed Item 2 also would inform large traders that the listed registrations and filings should reflect the registrations of all other large traders and persons whose accounts the large trader has decided to aggregate into its Form 13H. Finally, the reproposed Instructions would inform large traders that Item 4 and the appropriate Schedule must be filed for those persons who are not registered with the Commission and whose accounts have been aggregated with a ``registered person.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Schedules to reproposed Item 4 also have been refined to capture only minimal descriptive information about the persons who own or control a large trader corporation, partnership, limited partnership, or trust. For the most part, the collection of addresses, telephone and facsimile numbers, and regulatory information has been eliminated. The terms ``officer and partner'' also have been changed in the reproposed Schedules 4b and 4c to ``executive officer'' and ``limited partner that is the owner of more than a 10 percent financial interest in the accounts of the large trader.'' The term ``executive officer'' would be deemed to mean ``policy-making officer'' and otherwise would be interpreted in accordance with Rule 16a&hyph;1(f) under the Exchange Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 39 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As suggested in the comments, these changes should substantially reduce the number of persons for whom such Schedules must be prepared and filed under the reproposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 39 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.16a&hyph;1(f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reproposed Item 5 to Form 13H would facilitate the new flexible rules for aggregation. Item 5(a) would require the large trader to list all commonly owned or commonly controlled persons whose accounts are aggregated into the particular Form 13H that independently would be a large trader ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , aggregated accounts). Conversely, Item 5(b) would require the large trader to list all other commonly owned or controlled large traders that independently filed Form 13H and that could have been, but were not, aggregated into the particular large trader's Form 13H ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , disaggregated accounts). Again, the reproposed Instructions would caution large traders that the information supplied in Item 5 must accurately reflect their choice for aggregation or disaggregation of accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reproposed Schedules to new Items 6 through 8, which gather account information, address the concerns expressed in the comments and reorganize, substantially reduce, or eliminate much of the information regarding a large trader's accounts that may have been captured by the proposed Schedules. These reproposed Schedules have been completely redesigned to require the identification of only one contact person for each Schedule and establish a ``single-line-item'' type of account listing. The reproposed Instructions indicate that the proposed qualifications for designated contact persons would be retained without meaningful changes. The reproposed Instructions also advise large traders that they may submit internally produced lists of accounts, provided that such lists contain all required information in a format substantially similar to the applicable Schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new account Schedules also have been reorganized to track the three capacities in which a large trader may act with respect to a given account ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , owner, controller, or custodian/nominee). The reproposed Schedules would capture different combinations of large trader capacities, based upon the large trader's knowledge of accounts and the extent of beneficial ownership disclosure made to the carrying broker-dealer. Reproposed Schedules 6a and 6b would be used by those market participants who own accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reproposed Schedules 7a and 7b would be used by market participants who control accounts owned by others. These Schedules have been redesigned to indicate that accounts controlled by the large trader that are owned by small or otherwise infrequent traders would not be required to be specifically listed on these Schedules. Instead, reproposed Item 2 of Schedule 7a would capture general information about fully disclosed ``non-large trader'' accounts controlled by the large trader ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the total number of such accounts and broker-dealers carrying them). If applicable, information regarding other large traders whose activity may be controlled by the large trader through one of the listed accounts would be provided in reproposed Item 3 of Schedule 7a and Item 2 of Schedule 7b.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

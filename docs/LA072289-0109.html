			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALFED'S CHIEF QUITS AT REQUEST OF THE DIRECTORS  </P> <P> John R. Torell III quit Friday as chairman, president and chief executive of  CalFed Inc., the parent of California Federal Bank, two days after the Los  Angeles thrift's board of directors asked for his resignation.  </P> <P> Torell headed CalFed just short of one year, joining the company last Aug. 1  after 27 years as an executive with Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in New York.  Torell effectively will be replaced by Jerry St. Dennis, most recently the  company's chief financial officer and chief economist. St. Dennis' title will  be president and chief operating officer.  </P> <P> In addition, director Arthur W. Schmutz was named chairman and a three-member  "Office of the Chairman" was formed that includes Schmutz and directors Howard  P. Allen and Richard C. Lawton. With $28.3 billion in total assets, CalFed is  the nation's fourth-largest thrift.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview Friday, Torell, who said the board asked for his  resignation Wednesday, said his differences with CalFed directors did not stem  from disagreements over his policies, which included an overhaul of much of  CalFed's operations. Rather, he said, the differences were that CalFed's  directors believed "that West Coast thrift culture is different than the  culture that I brought."  </P> <P> Torell declined to specify those differences. But thrift executives and  industry analysts said CalFed had trouble adapting to Torell, an intense, often  impatient man.  </P> <P> "There's a tough-guy way about him," said Peter Treadway, an analyst who  follows the company for the investment firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham.  </P> <P> As a former New York banker, Torell came from a much more formal corporate  environment than is found at CalFed. Torell, for example, asked executives to  wear their suit jackets when walking around the company building and office. He  also made it known that he wanted to end CalFed's annual meeting with  shareholders quickly this year. The meeting took less than 20 minutes, compared  to more than an hour in past years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Like Each Other  </P> <P> CalFed directors and St. Dennis did not return a reporter's calls Friday.  Despite being fired by CalFed's directors, Torell praised them as a "neat  board" that he respects.  </P> <P> "We like each other just fine," Torell said.  </P> <P> Torell joined CalFed soon after quitting as president of Manufacturers Hanover,  where he had been viewed as the eventual successor to John McGillicuddy as  chief executive. Torell said then that he left because of a growing frustration  that he would not lead a big bank soon.  </P> <P> Indeed, that drive to run things was a factor earlier this year when CalFed was  in merger talks with GlenFed, the parent of Glendale Federal Bank -- a  combination that would have created the nation's largest thrift.  </P> <P> But the talks broke off, in part because of disagreements between Torell and  GlenFed Chairman Norman M. Coulson over who would be head of the merged  institution. Some analysts speculated Friday that Torell's leaving may result  in the renewal of those talks, although executives familiar with the  discussions said they believe that they are off for now.  </P> <P> Torell came to CalFed looking for a turnaround situation and got one in a  company whose earnings had lagged and that had diversified into far-flung  areas. Among his actions were to dispose of some insurance businesses and part  of its trust operation and to sell a $500-million loan portfolio. He also set  CalFed on a course of expanding its branch system and buying other savings and  loans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Squeeze on Capital  </P> <P> Despite the changes that Torell made, CalFed has problems. It has some $566  million in intangible assets called goodwill that it will not be able to  consider as capital under new, tougher standards about to be approved as part  of the nation's savings and loan bailout package.  </P> <P> Although no one expects CalFed to have difficulty meeting the minimum  requirements that will be set, some industry analysts and thrift executives  believe that it may not have adequate capital to grow and buy choice thrifts  that come up for sale.  </P> <P> The news of Torell's resignation came one day after CalFed reported a 50% drop  in earnings to $19 million in the second quarter. The decline was due largely  to lower profit in its financial services segment, caused by higher short-term  borrowing costs.  </P></p>

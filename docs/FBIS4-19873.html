			<p>BFN     [Text] The Navy's search for foreign submarines in the  waters off Norrkoeping has not led to any results, but according  to the defense staff there are several indications of alien  underwater activity. The military have not completed their  analyses yet, but according to some reports, the analyses  concern mainly propeller noise. The submarine search force,  which has been practicing in the archipelago off Norrkoeping for  some time, will remain in the area for a few more days.</p>

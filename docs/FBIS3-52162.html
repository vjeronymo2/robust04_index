			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hayim Hecht] </F>   [Excerpt] The cabinet meeting, which has just ended,  centered on sharp and firm remarks by Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin. It is not at all clear that the Taba talks will resume  tomorrow, but it is clear that an Israeli team will depart for  Paris tomorrow. Yitzhaq Rabin said that before clarifications  are received on what and with whom we are negotiating, we will  not resume any talks. He added Israel can resume routine  economic and security related contacts; for example, it is  possible to continue talks on fugitives. Rabin pointed out,  however, that we will not return to Taba before it is clear on  what basis the talks will be held. Rabin left some room open  for a low-level delegation going to Taba for dealing with the  problem of the fugitives. The heads of the delegations,  however, will not go.    Rabin said he has received the impression that the  territories do not interest 'Arafat and that he is using this  fact against us. Rabin stressed that the controversy centers on  the political issue rather than on 'Arafat's honor. Rabin added  that from 'Arafat's point of view the main problem is whether he  has control over an international border or not.    At this point Rabin provided some details regarding  'Arafat's  new demands as conveyed via the weekend fax messages: They are  demanding the presence of policemen near the bridges, which in  fact implies a physical PLO control over the border crossings.  The Palestinians also demand not to see any Israelis at the  crossing points. The solution they propose is the use of  cameras. They are also demanding to receive total control over  al-Nabi Musa in the Jericho area. The Palestinians also demand  full control over the Muratas baptism site on the Jordan River.  They also demand control over the Lido beach on the Dead Sea  and to maintain an international presence in the enclaves.    There seems to be a problem regarding the Musa 'Alami  agricultural farm, because some of the land registered to that  farm is located east of the Jordan Valley, therefore Israel's  proposal to hand over this farm to the PLO is problematical.    Minister Shim'on Shetrit asked Rabin for clarifications  regarding Israel's security areas in Gaza and Jericho. Rabin  said that Israel demands to retain between three to five  kilometers between the Jericho enclave and the Jordan Valley.  In Gaza, Israel is demanding less than that.    Minister Ya'aqov Tzur said that apparently the maneuvering  room is narrowing down:    [Begin recording] The PLO must drop its demand for control  over the external borders. This is not merely a tactical issue.  It is a most significant issue and the government will see to  it that its principles are implemented. Israel will not  compromise over retaining control of the external borders and  will not accept 'Arafat's demands, which in fact amount to the  essence of a state. If the PLO returns to the spirit of the  declaration of principles the way will remain open. We know  that we are paying a price for the delay, but we reached point  where we must insist on the implementation of the agreement we  reached. [end recording]    I asked Minister Yosi Sarid whether the Taba talks will  resume tomorrow:    [Begin recording] This is entirely unclear. If the talks  will be based on the understandings reached in Cairo, we will be  able to resume the talks tomorrow or even tonight. If, however,  the basis will be Yasir 'Arafat's new demands then at this point  there is no room for continuing the talks. At this point I do  not know when they will continue. [end recording]    Prime Minister Rabin also said that if the Palestinians will  change the agreements this will be reciprocal, and Israel will  also demand to introduce changes.

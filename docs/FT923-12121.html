			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report LEAD prices climbed to 12-month peaks at the London Metal Exchange yesterday and, despite running into profit-taking and currency related selling, the cash quotation closed Pounds 13.50 higher at Pounds 338 a tonne. Dealers noted that short-covering had earlier been prompted by the development of a small cash premium around the end of September, the time of a labour contract expiry at Cominco's Trail smelter. This was making sellers nervous, they added. Three months COPPER resumed its interrupted rise, gaining Pounds 17.25 to close at Pounds 1,355.75 a tonne, but that was still a few pounds below last week's 18-month high. The start of the Polish copper miners' strike (see story above) appeared to make little impact on market sentiment. TIN prices continued to backtrack and the cash position closed another Dollars 107.50 down at Dollars 6,710 a tonne. Sentiment may have been affected by reports from the Kuala Lumpur market that the Chinese had recently sold 5,000 tonnes of the metal, taking advantage of the surge that peaked nearly two weeks ago. London COCOA futures lost further ground in thin volume, the September price falling Pounds 16 to Pounds 560 a tonne.</p>

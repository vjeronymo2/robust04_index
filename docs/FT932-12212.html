			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Observer: Voice off Whence comes the new pep in John Major's speeches? Even the weary ears of Westminster have perked up at the tighter style, the steadier tone. Some of his jokes are now even vaguely amusing. Part of the reason, of course, is that his confidence is recovering along with the economy and the approaching ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Another, according to Downing Street officials, is that the PM is putting more time into drafting his texts, though still not as much as the 50 or more hours per spiel typically invested by his predecessor. What the officials don't say, however, is that a helping hand is being lent by sharp-witted civil servant Dominic Morris, now come from the Trade and Industry Department to No 10, where he has joined Sarah Hogg's policy unit. Just 39, and said to be a natural wordsmith, he has wrought his craft on each of the premier's recent speeches. He is no stranger to No 10, having worked there for four years under Lady Thatcher. But the credit for spotting his talent belongs to the present incumbent.</p>

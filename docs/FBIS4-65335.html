			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 16 (CTK) -- Austrian President  Thomas Klestil says in today's NARODNA OBRODA that Austria  supports the efforts of Slovakia and other Central European  states to join the European Union (EU).    In an interview prior to Slovak President Michal Kovac's  visit to Austria today, Klestil says that for Central European  states Austria can be the "Trojan horse (of integration),  because if it joins the EU, the Slovaks, Czechs, Hungarians...  will join it as well," Klestil is quoted by the paper as saying.  Germany supported full Austrian membership in the final stage  not because it would create a sort of German bloc, but because  Germany realized that without Austria it was impossible to get  other states involved in the integration process into the EU,  Klestil says.    "It is absolutely clear that we will back our neighbors'  efforts at EU membership," he says, pointing out that in the  event of a positive result to Austria's referendum (on joining  the EU) Slovakia will become a direct neighbor to the EU.    On economic cooperation, Klestil says that his country's  investments in Slovakia are quite high and that the number of  joint ventures is also quite big, which he describes as a  positive development. "However, it is also true that sometimes  Austrian firms complained about the slow pace of privatization  and unresolved property and other issues," Klestil says.    Asked by the paper whether Austria could be a mediator in  overcoming tension between Slovakia and Hungary, Klestil replies  that this can happen only if both sides so request. In his  opinion, it is better for Austria to meet the two countries'  representatives and discuss issues informally. "And this is  what we are doing," Klestil says.</p>

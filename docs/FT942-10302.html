			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Brewer attacks 'scandal' of cross-Channel bootleg beer The head of one of Britain's biggest regional brewers attacked the government yesterday over the 'scandal' of bootleg imports of beer from mainland Europe. Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman of Vaux Group of Sunderland, said there was a 'strong criminal element' in the cross-Channel beer trade. 'It's easy money  -easier than drugs,' he said. Cross-Channel shipments were now running at over 2m barrels a year, he claimed. This was equivalent to four times the production of Vaux itself, which last year sold beer worth over Pounds 100m. 'We have evidence of vans crossing the Channel and transferring to 40ft wagons,' he said. Much of the trade is thought to be illegal, since Customs and Excise require that duty-free beer should be brought in only for personal consumption. However, Sir Paul said, it was unclear whether this was enforceable under EC rules. 'The customs are showing a remarkable reluctance to do anything about it,' he said. 'I suspect that's because they're afraid that if they brought a case they'd lose it.' Sir Paul's strictures, coming as Vaux began the brewers' reporting season, may be followed by other brewery chiefs, who have been lobbying the government to reduce the duty on beer to bring it closer to French levels. However, most accept privately that they are unlikely to succeed in the near term, since the initial drop in revenue would put further pressure on the government's shaky finances. Sir Paul strongly criticised the paymaster general, Sir John Cope, who recently defended the government's position on the grounds that revenue from drinks duty was up this year. 'I don't think the government really understands how much duty they're losing,' he said. 'If they let it go on, they will destroy a huge swath of British brewing and pubs. Then they will lose revenue, panic, reduce duty, and allow a further wave of French beer in.' Calling for an immediate halving of beer duty to 15p a pint, Sir Paul recalled that the last cut in duty in 1959, had presaged a period of increased consumption. 'The first pub we opened (after the 1959 cut) we called the Jolly Minister,' he said. 'I'm quite prepared to repaint the sign with a portrait of the present chancellor if he listens to our suggestions.' Vaux's half-year figures, announced yesterday, showed a 10 per cent rise in brewing profits to Pounds 8.7m. Results, Page 28</p>

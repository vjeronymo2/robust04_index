			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / France forces Brussels retreat on fish prices A late-night French threat to block Norway's entry into the European Union produced a rapid pay-off for Paris early yesterday with Brussels announcing a two-month extension of minimum prices for fish imported into the EU. France's strongarm tactics forced a U-turn by the European Commission which 24 hours earlier had refused to extend crisis measures to prop up fish prices. The Commission's retreat will upset fish exporters in the US and eastern Europe but offers a breathing space to the French government, which has struggled to contain violent protests by its fishermen against cheap imports. Mr Alain Lamassoure, French minister for European affairs, said he had intervened with Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, during a marathon negotiating session on Norwegian accession to the EU which ended early yesterday. 'I made it quite clear this was a condition for our agreement to Norwegian membership, and especially on the fish arrangements with Norway.' The French threat was successful, and shortly before midnight Norway and the EU reached agreement on fishing rights. But a final accord on the terms of entry for Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway remains elusive because of Anglo-Spanish objections to power-sharing arrangements in an expanded Union. Minimum import prices will apply to imports of cod, haddock, hake, angler, coley, Alaskan pollack and salmon. The crisis measures are identical to those imposed a year ago when Breton fishermen ransacked warehouses and orchestrated a shutdown of French ports. Two months ago, minimum prices were restored after Breton fishermen burned down their historic parliament building in Rennes. A Commission official said the discussions had also considered British and Dutch concerns about cheap imports from eastern Europe which were entering the EU via Sweden. Also, fresh data showed EU fish prices for cod, one of the most important fish species, continued to fall in 10 member states last month. The decision to extend minimum import prices will come into effect this week and apply until May 17. The move will be reviewed at a meeting of EU fisheries ministers on April 12. Separately, the French government has introduced delayed inspection of US fish exports, prompting protests from Washington. It has also launched a FFr10m (Dollars 1.7m) advertising campaign to persuade consumers to eat more fish, a promotion funded partly by the EU.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / High time for plastics surgery: Europe's petrochemicals industry is under threat Four years ago Shell's petrochemicals division made profits of more than Pounds 1bn. Last year it made Pounds 23m. This year it is in loss. Shell is the world's biggest petrochemicals producer, and the rest of the industry is suffering along with it. The sector is used to cycles of boom and bust, but this time the damage may be more lasting. The immediate cause of the industry's plight is familiar. Petrochemicals manufacturers - which transform oil and gas into chemicals used principally to make plastics - are reeling under the twin burdens of recession and overcapacity. This last happened a decade ago, when losses were much heavier than any sustained before. But a new threat has emerged. Capacity planned or installed by Asian manufacturers between 1988 and 1995 is equal to more than half of Europe's total production. This expansion threatens an imbalance of world supply and demand, weakening prices and margins possibly until the end of the decade. The question is whether this leaves Europe with a long-term future in petrochemicals manufacture. This same question arose in the early 1980s when overcapacity and recession sent the industry into loss. But an extraordinary surge in demand near the end of the decade enabled the industry to recover. The final reckoning, however, may simply have been postponed. In the late 1980s, petrochemicals producers were generating profits verging on the 'pornographic', according to Mr Bob Lee, director of marketing of light hydrocarbons at Dow Europe, the subsidiary of the US chemical giant. The industry reacted by reducing bottlenecks in existing plants in an effort to expand production, sometimes by as much as 20 per cent. Europe's output of ethylene - the basic building block of the petrochemicals industry - grew from 16m tonnes in 1990 to 18m in 1992. Now, Mr Lee says: 'No one is making money in European petrochemicals.' Prices and margins have been driven to an untenable low, according to Mr Roger Longley, a director at Chem Systems, the consultants. 'Return on investment - presently at minus 2 per cent - looks foul,' he says. The collapse in profitability is only partly the result of weak demand. European demand for ethylene actually rose by about 7 per cent between 1990 and 1992, partly the result of increased demand for plastics from the automobile and building industries. But this rise was less than expected. It is overcapacity that is inflicting the most serious damage. Not all of this is due to Asian competition. The European industry has been expanding production as well. Over the next two years four new ethylene plants, built by BP Chemicals, Enichem of Italy, and the German groups Veba and BASF, will begin production. Altogether, a further 2m tonnes will be added to an already oversupplied market by 1994. None of the new plants, costing some Dollars 3bn in total, is likely to recover the cost of construction before the end of the century. Mr Peter Vogtlander, chemicals co-ordinator at Shell Chemicals, admits: 'We became over-excited by the results around 1988 and 1989. With margins so high, we could pay a new plant off within a year. We forgot the lessons of the early 1980s. Some at the top of the industry should have known better.' Dr Gary Dirks, manager of international marketing of nitrogen at BP says: 'My economist friends call this the downside of the capital cycle. My less erudite colleagues refer to it as the march of the lemmings.' Mr Lee of Dow estimates that within two years the European industry will be supplying 20m tonnes of ethylene a year at a time when demand will be only 15m tonnes to 16m tonnes. It is unlikely that balance will be restored as quickly as it was in the mid-1980s. Then, a combination of falling fuel prices, rapid economic recovery and a 2m-tonne cut in European ethylene capacity helped the industry reverse its plight. This time, the avenues of escape appear blocked. Demand is likely to remain disappointing at least until the middle of the decade as the principal international economies remain sluggish. Any increase in demand is unlikely to lead immediately to higher prices. There is oversupply in the US as well. Mr Longley of Chem Systems says: 'If prices in Europe pick up American imports will flood in.' Nor can the European industry export its way out of trouble. Even during the best of times, European manufacturers are at a cost disadvantage to US and Middle East suppliers because they have limited access to cheap gas feedstocks. The fall in the dollar has made Europe even more uncompetitive than usual, according to Mr Longley. The worst case is the basic plastic PVC, widely used in the construction and packaging industries. The most competitive European plant produces PVC at Dollars 563 a tonne. A US plant, using cheap gas rather than oil-derived feedstock, can sell PVC in Europe for Dollars 505, including tariffs and transport costs. This imbalance has prompted a shift in the balance of trade. In 1987 Europe was a net PVC exporter of 200,000 tonnes. By last year it was a net importer of 260,000 tonnes. Such difficulties are prompting calls for action. 'We just can't afford to grit our teeth and sit it out waiting for demand to pick up. That would take until the late 1990s. The industry has to rationalise,' says Mr Lee at Dow. In a perfect market, the squeeze on margins should mean the least efficient producers close their plants. But before the sector can rationalise it needs to overcome some significant barriers to exit. These include: Cost considerations. The cost of closure, including redundancies and environmental clean-up, is expensive in the short term. And even if plants are not producing profits, they may well be generating cash. The most inefficient plants were closed in the early 1980s. The difference between the most and least efficient of Europe's 53 ethylene cracking plants remains considerable. But the number at either extreme is limited - there are few laggards left. A lack of urgency. Many petrochemical operations are part of larger organisations, often state-owned, that do not have proper financial discipline, says Mr Vogtlander. He says many companies are not aware of their competitive position and blame their present predicament on the market rather than their inefficiency. The tendency is to do nothing and hope the problem goes away, agrees Mr Eric Edwards, a BP manager. The difficulty of closing ethylene plants which supply derivative plants producing plastics such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and PVC. Closure of the ethylene plant may mean that derivative sites also have to be closed. Political factors. Some plants may no longer be financially viable, but the economic impact of closure on local communities is, in some countries, regarded as unacceptable. One manufacturer comments: 'The Italians have cornered the market in laggard plants, but closing them is politically impossible.' The attitude of the European Commission. The industry fears restructuring could be blocked or delayed by the Commission which is fearful of cartels emerging. In spite of these barriers, one leading company in the industry claims there are as many as 14 deals in the offing across Europe aimed at rationalisation and reducing capacity. These range from disposals to joint ventures, mergers, asset swaps and plant sharing agreements. Most companies have drawn up lists of European plants that should be closed. They include those which are too small or too old to be economic. Few companies include their own plants. Some steps have already been taken. Internal memos at BP Chemicals talk of a choice between 'rapid, decisive measures or slow death'. Last week the company revealed it was selling a polyethylene plant at Antwerp to Neste of Finland. ICI has announced it is looking to swap assets or set up joint ventures with other companies in the industry. But in spite of such moves, the rationalisation process across the industry is likely to be slow. It needs guts and determination says Mr Vogtlander. 'I would be amazed if it took sooner rather than longer, but I hope I will be wrong,' he adds. Even if the European industry does succeed in restructuring, its future is likely to remain uncertain. 'The industry believes that when demand eventually picks up so will prices and margins. They won't,' says Mr Stuart Wamsley, editor of Focus on Chemicals, an industry newsletter. The main reason will be the ambitious expansion of supply in Asia. In 1988, South Korean ethylene capacity was only 500,000 tonnes a year. Next year it will 3.2m tonnes. China intends to double ethylene output from 1.8m tonnes a year in 1990 to 3.7m tonnes by 1995. Together with China, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan and Malaysia are expected to add a combined 2.45m tonnes in new ethylene capacity by the middle of the decade. 'As the Asian plants come on stream, European companies will find it increasingly difficult to export to Asia, exacerbating the oversupply problems in Europe,' says Mr Wamsley. Moreover, as European exports decline, so imports are set to increase. Low-cost Middle East suppliers, increasingly squeezed by the new Asian manufacturers, will be forced to divert product to Europe. Further, although Asian manufacturers may have no obvious cost advantage over the Europeans, Mr Wamsley believes they too will increasingly export to Europe and will sharply cut prices in an effort to generate cash. Backed by large conglomerates, the Asian producers, such as Korea's Hyundai Petrochemicals and Formosa Plastics of Taiwan, appear willing to endure losses to win market share. 'There is no room for European manufacturers of commodity chemicals,' warns Mr Wamsley. 'Once the far eastern plants come on stream, the Europeans don't have a hope in hell.' The European shipbuilding and man-made fibres industries - both virtually destroyed by Asian competition - provide potent warnings for Europe's petrochemicals sector. If the industry is to avoid their fate, it will have to rationalise with a speed and determination which it has yet to demonstrate.  -------------------------------------------        FAR EAST CAPACITY ADDITIONS          ('000 tonnes a year)  -------------------------------------------                  1988-90   1991-92  1993-95 Ethylene          3,085     3,055    5,210 Polyethylene      1,665     1,090    1,225 Polypropylene       995       940      710 Polystyrene         422       260      260 PVC                 240       460      490  ------------------------------------------- Source: Stuart Wamsley's Focus on Chemicals  -------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KIDS OUT OF CONTROL;  </P> <P> WHEN TEEN-AGERS RUN WILD, QUESTIONS ARISE ON PARENTAL, SOCIETAL ROLES IN FAMILY  LIFE  </P> <P> Jane Martin watched a handful of the 600 kids under her control trooping past  the brick walls and high fences at the San Fernando Valley Juvenile Hall in  Sylmar.  </P> <P> As supervisor of that small link in the labyrinthine system of cops, courts,  camps, schools, foster homes and treatment programs that contend each day with  the thousands of kids who have run into trouble, she has paid particular  attention to the news of late.  </P> <P> What went wrong that so many of the kids society produced now have come back to  haunt us? Where along the line did we lose control?  </P> <P> "We have to look at our culture," she said. "How did our priorities change?"  </P> <P> Figure that out, she said, and you might begin to figure out the youthful  violence that has suddenly captured the country's attention.  </P> <P> In New York's Central Park this month, a dozen or so 14-, 15- and 16 year-olds,  went "wilding," attacking strollers at random and brutally beating and raping a  jogger. When the police asked why, one teen-ager allegedly said, "For fun."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prophecy in Film  </P> <P> Last weekend in Los Angeles' Griffith Park, two boys, 15 and 11, allegedly shot  a 79-year-old man with with BB guns. They reportedly told the police they did  it as a joke. That same weekend, gang kids shot up half a dozen other Angelenos  with real bullets, adding two more people to the 2,700 murders they've  committed this decade.  </P> <P> "I've thought about 'Clockwork Orange' more than a couple of times lately,"  said Michelle Lewis, juvenile placement director for the Los Angeles County  Probation Department, referring to the futuristic film in which amoral youths  roam the streets inflicting pain for no apparent reason.  </P> <P> Reacting to the Central Park attack, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said that New  Yorkers are now confronted with "the terrible possibility that we have, by our  failures, produced young people who have learned to disdain simple principles  of right conduct, principles so basic to our good order, that we never  contemplated their being rejected."  </P> <P> Ask around in the hodgepodge of groups trying to get a grip on what's happening  with young people in this country. They say America is like a big dysfunctional  family.  </P> <P> Most concede that a percentage of young thugs ought to be locked away where  they can't do more harm. But they also say that society can no longer afford to  sneer at the cliche -- that young creeps may owe their criminal behavior to "a  troubled childhood."  </P> <P> Lisbeth B. Schorr, whose 1988 book, "Within Our Reach," has become required  reading by many policy makers, sees the chasm quickly narrowing between  conservatives who blame juvenile delinquency on a parent's failure to teach  values, and liberals who see the problem stemming from ingrained social  injustice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Change the Values  </P> <P> Most experts now agree that values must be changed through education, health  care and other social programs, she said.  </P> <P> The fusion of viewpoints comes in part "because everyone is really scared," she  said. It is also fueled by business leaders' realization that unless something  changes, they may soon be faced with a major shortage of educated, trustworthy  workers.  </P> <P> The State Bureau of Criminal Statistics reports that felony arrests of  juveniles in California have tended to drop since 1979.  </P> <P> But most people who work with problem kids say there are more relevant  statistics. According to the child advocacy group Children Now, more kids than  ever are growing up in poverty in California -- 1 in 5; 1 out of 3 kids never  gets a high-school diploma.  </P> <P> "In California, we have hit all-time highs and lead the nation per capita for  kids in foster care and kids in juvenile custody," said Richard Barth, an  associate professor in the UC Berkeley School of Social Welfare and a  contributor to the "Conditions of Children in California" report issued this  year by an organization called Policy Analysis for California Education.  </P> <P> "How are we doing?" asked Lewis of the probation department. "We're sticking  our finger in the dike."  </P> <P> Lyn Kobosa-Munro, a social worker at Hathaway Children's Services, a privately  run social services agency, agreed. "The world's complicated. Pressures on  parents are increasing."  </P> <P> And while those pressures are building most dangerously in homes where a single  parent struggles to put meals on the table, the yuppie mom and dad hard pressed  to make the BMW payments are not exempt.  </P> <P> Parenting takes more energy than most tasks, but when parents come home drained  from a day of coping with modern life, there's not much energy left for child  rearing, Kobosa-Munro said.  </P> <P> And parents who are overwhelmed lack the energy to respond with what  Kobosa-Munro calls an appropriate "you did WHAT?" response. Instead, they  respond by "shrugging their shoulders," until, suddenly, they decide that their  child is out of control.  </P> <P> "The kid isn't out of control," she said. "It's just that (the parents) are not  doing the controlling."  </P> <P> Often, parents whose kids are out of control were out of control themselves  when they were young, Kobosa-Munro said. They figure they outgrew their  problems and their kids will, too.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adventures of the Beav  </P> <P> But being out of control has changed radically since the days when Wally and  the Beav were getting in and out of jams.  </P> <P> In most parts of the country, society no longer nurtures its kids on the road  to adulthood. Kids are no longer escorted from the classroom by a caring  teacher, kept under surveillance by concerned neighbors, paternally cuffed by a  friendly minister or rabbi.  </P> <P> "The informal safety net -- strong neighborhood, strong church, strong schools  -- has been slashed," Barth said. At the same time, new pressures are pushing  kids away from traditional values and out of parental control.  </P> <P> "Here in the Bay Area, kids around the sixth-grade are being recruited to be  spotters for 10th-graders who are dealing drugs," Barth said. "No one told me I  could make money as a spotter when I was in sixth-grade."  </P> <P> Consequently, families that could have withstood a few adolescent crises in the  past, "suddenly aren't functioning so well," Barth said. "They have a much  greater challenge than they did before."  </P> <P> And once a kid's fortunes start to slip, many people simply can't afford to  spend the time it takes to straighten out the mess. For many, taking the time  off work to shepherd a kid through his troubles, to seek counseling and to  confer with his teachers can be a gamble that risks the employment that keeps  the kid fed.  </P> <P> "And the schools probably wouldn't have social workers or staff that could  develop or implement a plan anyway," Barth said.  </P> <P> The obvious problem, said Judy Nelson, executive director of the Children's  Bureau of Los Angeles, is that "there are no funds in this country. We just pay  after the fact."  </P> <P> Heather B. Weiss, who runs the Family Research Project at Harvard, agreed.  "Trying to get funding for prevention when the world is falling apart around  you is very tricky," she said. "There is a lot of vested interest in the way  things are."  </P> <P> While crucial, the complex public bureaucracies and private institutions that  incarcerate and try to treat problem kids tend not to see beyond "crisis  intervention and crisis treatment," she said. "But at some point you have to  stand back and say, 'The systems we're working with now aren't working. That's  what I think people are now agreeing . . ."  </P> <P> Society has come up with some solutions. More and more experts concur that if  society intervenes in the early years of a child's life and helps the parents  develop child-rearing skills, the chances of what Lisbeth Schorr calls "rotten  outcomes," decreases dramatically.  </P> <P> By most accounts, the release in 1987 of the Washington D.C.-based Committee on  Economic Development report "Children In Need; Investment Strategies for the  Educationally Disadvantaged," gave a range of policy makers a good shake.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Society Must Intervene  </P> <P> The report, sponsored by a number of Fortune 500 companies, concluded that  society "has to intervene at various stages along the developmental spectrum,  from prenatal care all the way to adolescence," said Sandra Hamburg), a  spokeswoman for the council. "We've taught people to be disaffected from the  society in which we all have a stake," she said, adding that now it's time "not  only to teach people how to work, but how to understand society and govern it."  </P> <P> The program will cost a lot. But, putting it in terms the sponsoring companies  would understand, the study, Hamburg said, "identified some particularly  effective investments for these kids, the kinds that really yield good results  in financial terms and human terms."  </P> <P> Explaining those investments is a major goal of Children Now, said Wendy  Lazarus, vice president for policy at that Los Angeles based child-advocacy  group.  </P> <P> It costs a total of $3,000 to provide in-home support services for a family,  she said. "That's about what it costs per month for a child removed from a  home."  </P> <P> Peter Forsythe was a prosecutor before becoming director of the Edna Clarke  McConnell Foundation in New York, one of the growing number of private  foundations sinking money into solving the problem of delinquent kids. He goes  out of his way to say he is no mollycoddler.  </P> <P> But he also knows that most of the murderers passing through the juvenile  justice system didn't go bad the day they hit junior high. "Parenting is a  learned skill," he said. "Control starts early. If you lose it early, there's  no reasserting it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Break Up the Home  </P> <P> Research shows society has more luck helping bad families become functional  than it does with helping rotten kids become good ones.  </P> <P> "The knee-jerk reaction (when a child gets out of control) is to break up the  home," Forsythe said. "Got a problem kid? Send him somewhere. But that usually  makes the kid worse. At a minimum, you destroy the laboratory in which the  child and parents can learn to solve the problem. They can't learn to deal with  the rebellious teen-ager if the son or daughter isn't there."  </P> <P> Forsythe's foundation, like others nationwide, is now spending money on "family  preservation" programs with names such as Homebuilders, in which therapists are  sent into "high-risk" homes, where they devote as much as 20 hours a week to  family therapy and educating parents and kids on everything from getting the  water turned back on to dealing with anger.  </P> <P> Three counties in Northern California now are engaged in a similar, two-year  pilot program that diverts money from traditional programs to  family-preservation projects, which try to keep kids with their families  through 24-hour in-home crisis intervention, family therapy and parent  training.  </P> <P> None of which will do much good, experts say, unless society begins to support  the sort of behavior that parental education teaches.  </P> <P> "We teach children through all of the messages we send," said Hamburg, of the  Committee for Economic Development.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cultural Loss  </P> <P> Judging from what business leaders reported seeing in the emerging work force,  many kids have somehow learned that in this culture "we don't value teamwork,  don't value compassion," she said.  </P> <P> Society also doesn't instill self-worth and pride in doing a job well, Hamburg  said: "You can't send teachers to the blackboard to teach values. They come  from the way we behave."  </P> <P> Martin, at Juvenile Hall, observed: "Adolescence is an incredibly difficult  time." And when a kid runs into the normal physical and emotional stresses of  adolescence unprotected by a shield of values, his reaction may prove  particularly ugly.  </P> <P> Yet Martin finds herself confronted with more and more teen-agers who never had  structure in their lives, who were never told that some things are right and  some things are wrong and who never were told "something as corny as the  principle, 'Do unto others,' " she said.  </P> <P> Outside her office, some of those kids, their faces scrubbed, their  institutional clothing neatly pressed, lined up and walked in loose formation  through the landscaped courtyard. For some of them, it may be the first and  last time they are under control.  </P></p>

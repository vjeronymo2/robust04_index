			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television Enoch Powell (C4, 9.45) is a repeat of a programme in which the eloquent old statesman returns to Cambridge and reminisces about his life in the university in the thirties and the profound and lifelong impact upon him of A. E. Housman's lectures on textual criticism and classical literature. The impact of the arrival of television on the workings of the fame machine is explored in the fifth episode of Clive James - Fame in the Twentieth Century (BBC 1, 9.30), although 'explored' is too serious a word for this frivolous and banal series. It is mildly watchable in the same way as rifling through old magazines but with the benefit (or otherwise) of listening to James's inimitable one-liners. This week the line-up includes Lucille Ball, Liberace, and Grace Kelly, and tyro politicians learning to come to terms with the new medium. Eastern Europeans have a passion for mushrooms, hence the title of the new comedy drama serial dealing in East-West relations, The Mushroom Picker which starts tonight (BBC 2, 9.25), starring Nigel Terry who played the starring role in Derek Jarman's Caravaggio.</p>

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / China turns screw on France over fighter sales to Taiwan FRANCE yesterday expressed regret at reports that China has banned French companies from a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) subway project in the southern city of Guangzhou in protest against a reported sale of French fighter aircraft to Taiwan. Li Ziliu, mayor of Guangzhou, yesterday told the Wen Wei Po newspaper that his city would 'cancel all co-operation with France including plans to purchase key equipment' and would prohibit French companies tendering for subway contracts. The threatened ban comes when Sino-French relations are under strain because of reports of the sale of 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets to Taiwan. The Chinese last week ordered the closure of the French consulate in Guangzhou. The official Xinhua newsagency said in yesterday's People's Daily that the Mirage sale 'wantonly trampled on the established norms of international relations'. Xinhua warned that 'the French government's determination to serve its own parochial interests will force it to eat bitter fruit'. This is the toughest diplomatic action taken by China in years and could seriously damage French business interests in the south, the fastest growing Chinese region and one of the fastest in the world. The chief casualty of yesterday's threatened ban would be GEC-Alsthom, the engineering group owned by the UK's GEC and France's Alcatel Alsthom, which had hoped to win a Dollars 300m contract to supply rolling stock and telecommunications equipment to the subway. GEC-Alsthom declined to comment other than to stress that it had 'not received official notification' of the ban. The French government said it 'regretted anything which would affect co-operation' with China. The French have made strenuous efforts to forge commercial links with China. French exports to China were worth FFr6.3bn (Pounds 760m) in the first 11 months of this year, against Chinese imports to France of FFr17.2bn. But French companies have won substantial contracts in China. Alcatel Alsthom is currently also involved in the Daya Bay nuclear power project with the EdF electricity group and Framatome, the nuclear reactor concern.</p>

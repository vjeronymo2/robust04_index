			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (12): Shortages seem likely to persist / A look at the problems of the energy sector Power shortages are nothing new in Morocco. Nor, for that matter, are power cuts. Throughout the 1980s, however, power cuts affected factories and were all but invisible to the public at large. In the autumn of 1992 the cuts took a turn for the worse. The National Electricity Office (ONE), which has a monopoly of electricity generation, and the municipal distribution companies (Regies) were forced to cut off customers, often entire industrial zones, and stop television programmes between 2pm and 6pm. Such cuts hit the country's industrial production and undermined the arguments put forward by senior officials keen to attract foreign investment to the kingdom. The immediate cause of the cuts was a drought. Hydroelectricity usually accounts for 15 per cent of all electricity in Morocco, but its share two years ago was cut to 4 per cent. However, the root causes of the persistent shortages are more deep-seated. They include a substantial build-up of unpaid bills and debts throughout the sector; a lack of autonomy from government ministries which discourages management initiative; a lack of co-ordination among the enterprises within the sector; the absence of an economically sound approach to tariff regulation and finally the lack of a clear legal code and regulatory system. The sheer size of unpaid bills underlines the problem. As of March 1993, ONE clients were approximately Dollars 500m in arrears. Of that amount the Regies owed ONE about two-thirds. In turn, the Regies were owed substantial amounts by their customers, mainly in the public sector. Though ONE has for 40 years had a monopoly on the production of electricity, it has never been able to manage existing and potential demand, because of political interference. In particular, ONE has had no influence on price setting, tariffs and distribution. Tariffs do not properly reflect economic costs. This explains, for instance, why peak demand represents 180 per cent of base demand and lasts only five hours every day. Low tension electricity is sold more cheaply than high tension electricity, even though it is more expensive to produce. Industrial users subsidise domestic ones. One half of all purchases of electricity are conducted through local Regies, which are jointly controlled by local authorities and local representatives of the state. The results are predictable. Funds and appointments have long been mismanaged. In some areas of Morocco such as Tetuan ONE and local authorities competed to build power lines and then fought for clients who could not afford to plug into the available power because the cost of doing so was set so high by the local authorities. The drought was thus, in the words of one senior Moroccan official, 'akin to knocking a paralytic to the ground'. The panic buying of nine gas turbines at a total cost of Dollars 300m has enabled ONE to produce an extra 300 megawatts but running costs are three times those of a coal-fired power station. Gas turbines, designed to run on diesel for short periods, have been running continuously. So there has been inadequate time to do daily maintenance or clean the residue of the heavy diesel fuel from the turbines which have sometimes broken down. Installing new capacity in a hurry may solve the problem in the short term but senior officials accept that it will do little to avoid shortages at a later stage. Demand is growing at about 7 per cent per annum, but it must be reduced in a systematic way, notably by discouraging it at peak times through special tariffs, encouraging energy efficiency and building new capacity. The constraints imposed in recent years on spending have pushed the government into looking, for the first time, at the idea of private investment in electricity generation. There are three keys to a successful policy apart from new men - the leadership of ONE was changed at a stroke last March. 1 Morocco must allow for a rise in demand for electricity and double its present generating capacity to around 5,000 megawatts by the year 2000. 2 ONE, which has a heavy public service obligation and is handicapped compared to potential private investors, must be allowed a freer hand. 3 A clear legal code for regulating the sector and the predictable and sound caucus of rules governing tariffs must be adopted, which will allow ONE to address the needs of a modern economy. There are three ways in which power generation can be increased, all of which are now being pursued. The first is to sub-contract primary power generation to private companies. This is being done at Jorf Lasfar, south of Casablanca, where tenders have gone out for the management of two existing coal fuelled stations which produce 600 megawatts and the building of two new ones which will produce an equivalent amount of electricity. Leading western groups such as ABB, AES-GE, Els, Endesa, National Power and Bechtel are competing for a contract which over a 10-year period is worth Dollars 1.4bn. The second source of energy will be the transit fee in gas that Morocco will collect from the Maghreb Europe Pipeline (GME) which will carry gas from Algeria to Spain and Portugal. Construction has just begun. Gas from this pipeline will fuel two combined cycle plants, due to be built in Kenitra and Mohamedia, which will produce 300 megawatts each. Electricity interconnections with Algeria, which allow Morocco to purchase up to 150 megawatts, already exist. By 1996 the planned interconnection with Spain will enable Morocco to purchase 300 megawatts, a figure which will rise to 600 by the year 2000. Recasting the institutional framework is the third challenge Morocco faces. Political involvement at all levels reduces management autonomy and effectiveness. Some examples illustrate the problem. ONE's investment plan is developed and financed in a way which reflects immediate problems facing the government. Financial constraints have led to a preference for bilateral aid financing rather than commercial credits, which in turn leads to delays in realising projects. ONE must pay import taxes which amount to 50 per cent of the import value of fuel; in Tunisia and the Iberian peninsula such taxes amount to 1.5 per cent or nothing respectively. Individual electricity boards have a social role, thus connecting customers is sometimes driven by political and social pressures rather than by the pursuit of commercial gain. Privatising local boards could well provide an answer. Tariffs must reflect economic costs, be adjusted to inflation and not penalise industry. Two-part tariffs for low voltage must be introduced, and more sensitive tariffs for all customers are a must. Such changes, some Moroccans argue, are difficult to introduce because of metering problems. All customers paying a peak tariff would need a new meter. Also, there is the problem of explaining to customers why there is a peak tariff. Changing bulk supply tariffs will be difficult politically if it entails a change from the previous 'no win no lose' policy. It is, however, fair to point out that the crisis of 1992 opened people's eyes. Those now in charge of the sector - Mr Abdellatif Guerraoi at the Ministry of Energy and Mines and Mr Driss Benhima, the new head of ONE - are able hands-on operators. They know, as do their colleagues in government, that the number of households in the countryside which receive electricity must be pushed up above the current level of 30 per cent and that efforts to promote the activities of local entrepreneurs and attract foreign investment will come to little if there is no power to back up such activities.</p>

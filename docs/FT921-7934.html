			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Letter: Percentage route to resolving problem of skilled staff transfer fees Sir, Like many of your readers I have been wrestling for years with the practical difficulty of silver handcuff transfer fees as some recompense for the training costs of employers whose skilled staff are poached or hired by others. The problem is to give the losing employer control of the funds from which to reimburse himself while protecting the employee from unfair restrictions on movement or a loss of any withheld earnings. A solution might be to allow an employer to withhold a percentage of gross salary from the first two years' earnings of any employee earning over, say, Pounds 250 per week. The money would be held in an external fund outside the company like a pension scheme. The employer could reclaim 100 per cent of the employee's deductions if they were to leave within, say, two years and 50 per cent if they leave within three years. If the employee remains, he or she can reclaim the money plus interest, less tax, in year four or perhaps pass it over to their company or personal pension fund, tax free. In practice a new employer would probably be pressed to offer a golden 'hello' matching any deductions sacrificed by recruits and this would shift some of the training costs borne by the old to the new employer. If the current employer went bust the fund, assuming it's not a Maxwell type group, would not be a corporate asset and employees would receive their deductions plus interest as part of a tax-free termination payment. Let me stress that employers would be free to deduct or not deduct, as they saw fit, and would probably only use this technique for staff whose departure would represent a very serious loss to the company of training or contact skills.

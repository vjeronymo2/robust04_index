			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (8): Never-ending drainson the exchequer - Demand for electricity and water is growing On the kingdom's National Day - September 23 - there was a freak blackout, lasting up to 16 hours in parts of Riyadh and the eastern province. It was an uncomfortable reminder of how dependent the Saudi have become, in the short space of 20 years, on uninterrupted power supplies, writes a special correspondent. Hectic developments in all sectors of the country's economy since the first oil-price rises in 1973 have resulted in a generation that has grown soft, compared with its predecessors, on an abundance of energy for air-conditioning and refrigerated products and all the material comforts that modern technology can buy. The power cuts came in spite of the enormous - and overwhelmingly successful  -efforts of the industry and the electricity ministry, the state electricity corporation and its agencies, the regional Saudi Consolidated Electric Companies (Sceco), plus the Saline Water Conversion Corporation to increase power supplies in line with the rise in demand. The kingdom covers an area the size of western Europe. The Sceco companies are divided into four areas - central, south, east and west - with the largely desert area in the north, bordering Jordan and Iraq, being supplied by different state companies. Together, they produce some 17,000 MW of power, which is supplemented by some 4,000 MW from the sea-water desalination plants operated by SWCC. The government has now embarked on, or has pending, plans costing some Dollars 10,000bn to increase power generation by more than 9,000MW in the next six years. Looking beyond 2000, the electricity corporation has commissioned Quebec Hydro, with the Riyadh-base Saudi Consulting Services, to draft a master plan evaluating needs for the next 25 years. Demand is now coming as much from industry and commerce as from householders. Five years ago, industry was responsible for only some 5 per cent of total consumption. But since the economic boom of the last three years, industry and commerce are now reckoned to be using some 20 per cent of total supplies. By far the biggest increase in demand has come from the western region, including Jeddah and the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah. The region consumes some 40 per cent of power supplies, but produces only some 25 per cent of aggregate power. The second largest consuming area is the central province which includes the capital, Riyadh. Then comes the eastern province, taking some 20 per cent of total power, but producing some 30 per cent of the country's total. Most of the power network - 71.2 per cent in 1991 - relies on gas-burning technology and this proportion is likely to rise. But the gas available from the kingdom's master gas system is limited to the associated gas coming from crude oil production of some 8m b/d. Until oil production is increased or more natural gas is found, Sceco will have to make do on existing supplies or turn to other forms of technology. Such has been the increase in power consumption - some say the growth is of the order of 10 per cent a year - that there are cities where the system is operating dangerously close to design capacity. But the king is committed to keeping prices low. This is a very sensitive political issue. When he tried to cut subsidies in 1987-88, the public's reaction caused him to rescind the cuts almost immediately. The government now spends SR3bn (Dollars 800m) a year on electricity subsidies. These exclude the amounts in hidden subsidies emanating from Sceco not paying Saudi Aramco for gas and oil supplies. Power generation is a never-ending drain on the exchequer. In addition to the subsidised price of SR0.05 per KwH paid by industry, ministries and agricultural users as well as hospitals, regardless of consumption, the state is equally generous to householders and non-industrial businesses. Since April 1992, these pay on a sliding scale from SR0.05 for the lowest consumers to SR0.07, and SR0.10 up to SR0.15 for the biggest users. There are those who say that the need now is to improve distribution through construction of a national grid rather than concentrate so much in the immediate future on building more plants without encouraging people to limit consumption voluntarily. For instance, they point out that for the next six years the Haj season - when some 3m Muslims make an annual pilgrimage to the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah - will fall in the cooler autumn or winter months, when theoretically less power would be necessary. Lack of a distribution network had something to do with the decision, four years ago, to abandon the proposed Dollars 1bn Xenel Industries aluminium smelter at Yanbu. The smelter would have used up almost all the existing power capacity, so it was proposed to extend the grid to Yanbu. Planners were, however, reluctant to do this unless Sceco-West was able to charge commercial rates for its power supplies on a sliding scale, depending on the current market price for aluminium. However, the smelter planners argued that the smelter should benefit from subsidised prices available to the rest of industry. In the end, no tariff system could be agreed, and prices started to slide on the world markets. But should the opportunity arise again to build a smelter, there is still no national grid to enable power to be transferred from one part of the kingdom to another in the event of shortages in one region and a supply surplus elsewhere. In spite of budgetary problems, the power companies are pushing ahead with ambitious expansion plans. The largest are: construction of Riyadh's ninth power plant; Power Project 9 - to provide the city with a further 1,200MW, for which turnkey bids are being evaluated; a 1,000-2,500MW power plant at Shuqayq, north of Gizan on the Red Sea coast for Sceco-West, for which bids are due next march; a 2,400MW plant at Ghazlan in the eastern province for which pre-qualifiers are due to apply this month; a 1,500-2,000MW plant at Shuaiba, about 25 miles south of Jeddah, for Sceco-West, for which bids are due next year. The greatest problem is finance. Each of these four plants will cost between Dollars 800m (Shuaiba) and Dollars 2bn for the plant at Ghazlan. The power companies need to raise money but the banks want a finance ministry guarantee or at least a letter saying that included in the budget are sums assuring creditors of repayment of principal and provisions for debt-servicing. The export credit agency of the winning bidder could back up the supplier credit, but not only has no supplier credit yet been put together for the kingdom's power sector, but any export credit agency would itself want a similar guarantee from the finance ministry. Further privatisation of the consolidated electric companies could, theoretically, be an option. All four are already publicly quoted with 40 per cent of their shares being held by 'GCC citizens'. How many of these 'citizens' are truly private sector individuals or companies rather than members or agents of ruling families - and as such an arm of the government - is impossible to gauge. But since the kingdom's power subsidies detract from the real profitability of the companies, this kind of utility stock can hardly be attractive to an investor seeking a genuine return on equity. However, the utility companies are reported to be paying a net 7 per cent return per share and given the amount of cash available in the private sector, there would, it is reckoned, be buyers if equity financing was deemed to be an option. Sceco's attempts to raise money through the commercial banks have not so far been successful. National Commercial Bank is reported to have sought to raise some Dollars 400m for Sceco-West for the Rabigh 3 power expansion project. After six months' negotiations, only Dollars 320m was raised, and the banks which did participate had to be encouraged with front-end fees to add to the  13/16 margin over Libor. The same financing problem affects the Saline Water Conversion Corporation's expansion plans. Power and water are inexorably linked. SWCC provides 70 per cent of the water used in houses and a significant proportion used by industry, as well as 20 per cent of the kingdom's total energy supply through the power plants which form part of the desalination plants. So the provision of desalinated water at subsidised prices for drinking and other domestic uses is closely tied in with power generation. As with electricity, the subsidies are generous. Consumers, both domestic and industrial, pay SR0.15 per cubic metre for consumption of between 1-100 cu m per quarter; and on a sliding scale up to SR4 per cu m. These prices do not make SWCC an attractive commercial proposition for investors. Alarm bells have started to ring as consumption has mounted. At the beginning of November Crown Prince Abdullah appealed to users to show restraint, but appeals of that nature are likely to be ignored until customers are made to pay more. In the meantime, SWCC has to do its best to keep up with incremental demand. Established in 1974 as a semi-autonomous body supervised by the agriculture &amp; water ministry, it produces some 2.2m cubic metres of water daily from 22 desalination plants on the Red Sea and Gulf coasts. SWCC expansion plans, including new plants under construction, envisage almost doubling the number of desalination plants and available water for domestic and industrial use. They include construction of a Dollars 1bn power and desalination plant at Shuaiba to process up to 100m gallons per day, as well as produce 500 MW of power for Scico-West. But SWCC has also to expand its distribution system. Existing lines go only from Jubail on the Gulf coast to Riyadh and Qassim province north of the capital and from three points on the Red Sea coast to the main cities of the western province; Jeddah/Makkah, Madinah, and Abha in the south-west. But fundamental to any solution of water supplies is the need to persuade consumers to use less. SWCC cannot be seen in isolation from other factors such as the depletion of the water table by agricultural users, urban water distribution (up to 40 per cent of water distribution in some urban areas is being lost owing to faulty pipes and leaking connections); and sewage disposal. The tariff structure propping up the power and water subsidies not only encourages the consumer to use more regardless: it prevents the government from saving in one area of the annual budget or five-year plan in order to be able to spend on basic infrastructural needs elsewhere. The decline of these will sooner or later lead to the kind of widespread pressure for improvements that will simply cost more for having been delayed so long. Urban services such as sewage disposal are suffering from a chronic lack of public finance. In the last five years, the condition of Jeddah, to cite just one example, has visibly deteriorated because of these shortfalls.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> BINGO FUND-RAISERS LIMITED TO 1 A WEEK  </P> <P> The Institute of Equestrian Therapy will be limited to one bingo game a week to  raise funds, the Simi Valley City Council decided Tuesday.  </P> <P> The organization, which offers therapeutic horseback riding for the physically  and mentally handicapped, operated bingo games on Friday and Saturday nights at  4241 Valley Fair.  </P> <P> They will continue to hold games on Friday.  </P> <P> The bingo games are the only source of revenue for the $17,000 monthly  operation, said Jacques Fouchaux, institute director.  </P> <P> The city adopted an ordinance in February, 1989, to limit the number of bingo  games held by charitable organizations so one would not gain a monopoly,  Assistant City Manager Brian Gabler said.  </P> <P> The law originally was to become effective in March, 1989, but the City Council  delayed implementing it to allow the institute to find other funding sources.  </P> <P> "I'm very disappointed, although I have to accept the decision, but now our  income is cut in half and expenses are still the same," Fouchaux said.  </P> <P> Ten years ago, the state subsidized much of the institute's operation, but now  it gets no state funding.  </P> <P> The group began bingo games six years ago.  </P> <P> Gabler said the organization had ample time to find other funding sources.

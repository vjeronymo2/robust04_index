			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E MANEUVER  </P> <P> As a taxpaying individual, I was very cool to the idea of a taxpayer takeover  of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. Now that SDG&amp;E is trying to prevent us  from finding out the facts related to this issue, I can see I was wrong.  </P> <P> They, obviously, have something to hide or they wouldn't prevent the Water  Authority from spending a relatively small amount of money.  </P> <P> Bad move, SDG&amp;E, you lost my vote.  </P> <P> V.R. EWALD  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

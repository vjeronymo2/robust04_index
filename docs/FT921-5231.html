			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Expansion at Intrum Justitia INTRUM JUSTITIA, the debt collection agency, yesterday reported a 35 per cent jump in profits and a Pounds 6m acquisition in France. The company that is bringing respectability to what has often been the less than genteel task of chasing up late payers, increased pre-tax profits in the year to December from Pounds 8.65m to Pounds 11.6m on sales up 48 per cent at Pounds 75.5m. Earnings per share rose 20 per cent to 9.1p and the company will pay a final dividend of 1.6p, bringing a total for the year to 2.4p, up 33 per cent on the previous 12 months. Mr Bo Goranson, the founder and chairman, said the acquisition of Eureco, a Strasbourg-based debt collection agency with six branches throughout France was the latest move in the creation of a Europe-wide operation. A quarter of the increase in sales came from organic growth with the balance from a full year's contribution from Cas, the UK company bought in 1990, and Dutch and Danish acquisitions during the year. Sweden, where Mr Goranson founded his company, Finland and Switzerland had been particularly successful and consumer credit collection in the UK had also seen strong growth. 'Our business is recession resilient,' said Mr Goranson. 'We do well in both a good and bad economic climate.' Intrum Justitia, with Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the credit rating and debt collection agency, is also actively supporting a campaign by the Forum of Private Business to introduce an automatic legal right to charge interest on overdue commercial debts. If such legislation is introduced, or standardised in the UK with European practise, Intrum's commercial business in the UK would receive a substantial boost. Mr Gert van Laar, chief executive, said Intrum has just been awarded a trial contract in Leeds to collect overdue TV license fees.</p>

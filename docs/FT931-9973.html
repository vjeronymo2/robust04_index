			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Denmark's Dollars 1bn offering sells well in spite of tight pricing THE Kingdom of Denmark launched its widely-expected Eurodollar bond yesterday, and syndicate managers expected more new issues today, including a Ecu500m three-year offering from the European Community. Mr Andrew Pisker, head of new issues at the lead manager, Lehman Brothers International, acknowledged that Denmark's Dollars 1bn 5 3/4 per cent offering due 1998 was aggressively priced to yield 20 basis points over comparable US Treasuries. However, he reported good sales into Europe and the UK in spite of the tight spread. Other syndicate managers said the spread on the Danish deal was five basis points too tight, but agreed that the issuer had been able to take advantage of the current demand among investors for dollar-denominated paper. The syndicate on the Danish deal had not broken by late afternoon. Mr Niels Sorensen, head of the foreign debt department at Denmark's National Bank, said he was happy with the cost-advantageous terms of the bond and that the proceeds had been swapped into floating-rate D-Marks. The funds will be used to strengthen the central bank's foreign exchange reserves which have been depleted by the recent intervention to support the Danish krone within the exchange rate mechanism. Investor preference for dollar paper enabled the Republic of the Philippines to increase its previously-announced three-year offering to Dollars 150m from Dollars 125m and set the yield at 320 basis points above comparable US Treasuries, at the lower end of the indicated range of 320-330 basis points. Syndicate managers said the success of the Filipino deal partially reflected that it had been well flagged in advance of its launch yesterday. An official at the lead manager, JP Morgan, said that 80 per cent of the offering was split between Asia and Europe and the remaining 20 per cent was placed in the US. After the syndicate was broken, the bonds were bid at par, above their re-offer price of 99.88. Elsewhere, Credit Local de France raised Pounds 100m of 7 1/4 per cent Eurobonds due December 12, 1998. The maturity was pitched to tap demand for paper at that area of the yield curve. A manager at NatWest Capital Markets, the lead manager, said that a little over half of the Credit Local paper was placed on the Continent. After the syndicate broke, the spread widened slightly by one basis point to 46 basis points above the 7 1/4 per cent UK gilt due in 1998. Syndicate managers said the bond was generously priced compared with a similar offering from Credit Foncier de France launched in mid-January with a yield spread of 40 basis points over comparable UK gilts. Hambros Bank launched the first New Zealand dollar issue in the international market since last June. The NZDollars 50m offering for Primary Industry Bank Australia, due 2000, was more or less sold by midday, mainly to Benelux, German and Swiss investors. The issue was bid at 99.55, within the total fees of two points. Further issues in the New Zealand dollar sector are likely, as some NZDollars 200m worth of paper is due to mature in the next two months.</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Flank left to fester: The west's policy on southern ex-Soviet Union republics needs rethinking, argue Gillian Tett and Steve LeVine President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan had reason to feel pleased after his meeting this week with US President Bill Clinton. In exchange for indicating a willingness to dismantle Kazakhstan's nuclear weapons, Mr Nazarbayev won not only a pledge of US aid worth Dollars 396m, but praise from US officials for his efforts to introduce market reforms and attract western investment. Low down the meeting's agenda, however, was Kazakhstan's less than impressive attempts at reforming its political system, which remains dominated by an all-powerful president. Though such diplomatic reticence may seem unremarkable, it highlights a discrepancy emerging in western policy towards the former Soviet Union. Western leaders have responded in recent months to signs that Russia or the Baltic states might be moving towards fascism. But they have largely ignored the political dictatorships that remain entrenched along Russia's sensitive southern flank. As European institutions such as Nato expand eastwards, this omission is sending dangerous signals to the swathe of countries between Turkey and Estonia, on Europe's outer fringe. The chief victim of this policy so far has been the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe - Europe's 52-nation quasi United Nations, founded in 1972 to promote political democracy and collective security between western democracies and the eastern bloc. Two years ago, the CSCE became one of the first European institutions to welcome ex-Soviet republics into its ranks. Since then, however, most of the central Asian and Caucasian republics have acted against CSCE principles on human rights. In Tajikistan, for example, which for the past 18 months has witnessed civil war between regional Tajik groups, ethnic cleansing and political detention have been widespread. In Transcaucasia, nationalist conflicts have produced other abuses: most recently, in October, Armenian forces expelled about 60,000 civilians from south-western Azerbaijan. Supposedly free elections in Turkmenistan last month saw Mr Sapurmurat Niyazov elected as president until 2004 with 99.99 per cent of the vote. The regime in Uzbekistan remains similarly authoritarian. The only republic with proper opposition political parties is tiny Kyrgyzstan, on the Chinese border. 'Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are unique in actually moving backwards to Soviet-style politics,' says one western diplomat in Uzbekistan. 'No one expects them to become western-style democracies overnight - but when they move backwards there can be little chance of meeting CSCE standards.' In public, at least, CSCE officials deny that the issue is undermining the institution's credibility, and say efforts are being made to explain to the central Asian states their new European CSCE commitments. 'You have to look at this in an evolutionary perspective,' says Mr Nils Eliasson, CSCE director, who points out that, throughout the CSCE's history, there has been a steady improvement in the human rights record of formerly authoritarian members, such as Romania. But the CSCE's problem is that it lacks diplomatic muscle: it has no clear mechanism for expelling members. Most central Asian governments have shrugged off its protests, retorting that the west is ignoring their regional problems. Some US officials have raised human rights concerns. But there is little co-ordinated western pressure. One reason may be western concern that political instability could unleash the region's radical Islamic opposition groups - a fear propounded in particular by Russian diplomats. Another is cultural, with many diplomats privately admitting it is unrealistic to expect the same democratic standards from the 60m Moslem central Asians as from the Russians or Balts. The priority for central Asia now, these diplomats argue, is to avoid economic collapse. So far Dollars 10bn worth of foreign investment has been pledged to the region, according to East European Investment magazine. As that increases, western businesses are likely to have a corresponding interest in maintaining stability. Kazakhstan is believed to have as much oil as Russia, Turkmenistan is the world's fourth-largest gas producer, and Uzbekistan has rich gold reserves. But the problem with this approach, as many CSCE officials agree in private, is that it makes a mockery of the CSCE. 'It is double standards - one standard of human rights for the Slavic states and the Baltics and another for central Asians,' says one senior diplomat closely involved with the CSCE. Since few people outside the diplomatic circuit have heard of the CSCE, this in itself might not seem significant. But recent suggestions that the Russian peacekeeping forces currently operating in the former Soviet Union could operate under the CSCE's mandate seem likely to throw the institution  -and such contradictions - into the spotlight. If this happens, the CSCE will have to rethink its role and mandate. In the meantime, though, the west needs to clarify its own policy towards the region, if other European institutions looking eastwards are to avoid the CSCE's dilemma.</p>

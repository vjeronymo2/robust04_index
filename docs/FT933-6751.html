			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Haitian PM appeals for end to foreign embargo HAITI'S new prime minister, Mr Robert Malval, has appealed for an early end to the international economic embargo which has squeezed the Caribbean nation. He made the request after Haitian legislators, with apparent reluctance, had confirmed his nomination to the post. This has completed another stage in a 10-stage sequence for the eventual return to office of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown and exiled by the army almost two years ago. Under an agreement secured via the United Nations, and which has led to the resignation of Gen Raul Cedras, the army leader, Father Aristide is to return to Haiti on October 30, after Mr Malval's government has been installed and the sanctions lifted. The Haitian chamber of deputies voted on Monday to ratify Mr Malval, a 50-year-old publisher, who is Fr Aristide's choice for premier. The new prime minister is facing opposition over the composition of his cabinet. This will have to be approved by parliament before the sanctions can be lifted. However, legislators want, on Mr Malval's list of prospective ministers, members of Haiti's conservative parties, which hold the majority in parliament. The country of 7m people has fuel for only a few days because of the embargo. This could lead legislators to approve Mr Malval's cabinet so as to have the sanctions lifted.</p>

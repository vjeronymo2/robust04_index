			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / All that is gold no longer glisters: Why the price of the yellow metal has fallen so steeply, and examines the effect on the mining industry The price of gold has fallen to its lowest level for nearly six years, prompting some desperate producers to consider accelerating mine closures and to cut production further. The global stock market crash in 1987; war in the Gulf; political turmoil in South Africa, the largest gold producer; and collapse of the former Soviet Union, once the second-largest producer, have all failed to reverse the downward trend. Reduced demand, resulting from the international economic slowdown, and production at pre-recession levels have compounded the depression facing the industry. Valued in Swiss francs, the yellow metal is at its lowest price since 1978. In Japanese yen it is at a 20-year low. In dollars - the principal currency for gold trading - the price has slumped from its peak of more than Dollars 800 in 1980 to less than Dollars 340 per troy ounce. At this level, according to the Gold Fields Minerals Services consultancy group, at least half the world's gold mining capacity is unprofitable. Most of the uneconomic mines are in South Africa, where large workforces dig to depths of up to two and a half miles to extract the metal from narrow seams. So far, no big South African gold mine has been forced to close. Instead, many companies have discontinued mining in uneconomic seams and concentrated on those where gold is more abundant and easily accessible. Jobs have gone: gold companies affiliated to the South African Chamber of Mines said employment fell from 505,262 in 1989 to 473,685 in 1990 - the lowest since 1980. There were thousands more redundancies last year. Industry observers had forecast that this year the tide would start to turn. But many are having to rework their price predictions for 1992 because gold has fallen much further than they expected. Last week the metal moved into uncharted territory, forced below Dollars 342 an ounce by relatively light, but consistent, selling at a time when there were even fewer buyers in the market than usual. Dealers suggest that this selling came from someone who needed dollars for gold so desperately that there was no time to take market conditions into account. Some believe the seller was an east European central bank, although not Russia's. Several factors have combined to cause the present lack of demand. The market for gold jewellery, which accounts for more than half of demand, is weak because of the prolonged recession in industrialised economies. Investors in North America and Europe have reduced their activity in the gold market for some years, preferring to invest their assets in interest-bearing financial instruments. At present, Middle East interest is seasonally low because it is Ramadan, a month of religious fasting which this year runs from March 6 to April 6. In Japan, one of the world's largest markets for gold bars and jewellery, demand has declined in the face of an economic slowdown. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, high interest rates and the opening up of financial markets have provided new opportunities for investors and hence have diminished the attraction of gold. The market was also dealt a blow by India's budget proposals, announced at the beginning of March and to be implemented in April, which will lift the ban on gold imports and allow Indians living or travelling abroad to import 5kg of gold whenever they return to the country. The premium paid for gold smuggled into India has fallen 14 per cent in rupee terms. Since about 200 tonnes of the metal - 7 per cent of world sales - are smuggled into India each year, international prices have suffered. Given the weakness of demand, the industry has been relying on falling supplies to revive the gold price. But it is taking a long time for low prices to eliminate uneconomic production. According to estimates by the Mining Journal, a respected industry publication, gold mines outside the former communist bloc last year produced a record 1,758 tonnes, 1.4 per cent more than in 1990. Even in South Africa, where there has been widespread rationalisation, production was only slightly down - by 3.5 tonnes - to 601.9 tonnes last year. Mining Journal says that small mine closures accounted for 1.2 tonnes of the 3.5 tonnes. But more substantial cuts in production are now in prospect. Mr Stuart Murray of Gold Fields Minerals Services, whose annual review of the gold market is the industry's statistical bible, suggests the first phase of cost reduction at the South African mines is now complete. He says: 'The next stage will involve real cuts in production such as the closure of a large mine.' His views echo those of Mr Harry Oppenheimer, former chairman of the Anglo American Corporation, the world's second-largest mining company, who said recently: 'Under present conditions South Africa's annual gold output could fall by somewhere between 100 and 200 tonnes, that is possibly by as much as 30 per cent, between now and the year 2,000.' Some Australian and North American high-cost gold mines which have protected themselves from today's low prices by selling gold forward on the futures market at guaranteed higher prices, are also running out of room to manoeuvre, suggests Mr Murray. As existing forward sales contracts expire, new ones are being offered on terms not nearly as attractive. Furthermore, production difficulties in Russia and other former Soviet republics - ranging from shortages of equipment to shortages of capital - are limiting their exports of gold. Despite these cuts in production, any recovery in price is likely to be limited. The main problem is the practice of forward sales which is common among western gold producers. This enables producers to lock in a guaranteed profit in exchange for sacrificing a potentially higher return. When the price of gold rises, however, producers rush to sell more gold forward, placing a cap on any further increase. Another less immediate difficulty may be the prospect of increased sales by central banks. Between them, the world's central banks hold 35,619 tonnes of gold, equivalent to 17 years' production. But many industry observers believe there is now less need to maintain such stocks. European central banks, in particular, may consider reducing their positions. If the process of European monetary union runs smoothly, a single European central bank would control 40 per cent of the world's official gold reserves by the year 2000. 'A single European currency reduces the principal need for reserves of any kind - intervention in currency markets. A European central bank could economise on reserves,' says Mr Andrew Smith, precious metals analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland. He says central banks might become net sellers of about 700 tonnes of gold a year from the mid-1990s. Not everyone in the industry agrees with Mr Smith's ideas: central banks' collective gold holdings have hardly varied in the past 40 years. But just hearing them expressed sends shivers through the embattled gold mining industry.</p>

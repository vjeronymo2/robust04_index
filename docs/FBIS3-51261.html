The missionaries were kidnapped in reprisal for the  arrival of U.S. soldiers in Colombia.    Official sources consulted by NOTIMEX indicated that a group  of 20 rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  (FARC) intercepted the vehicle in which missionaries Steven  Welch, 41, and Timothy Vandyke, 40, were traveling in southern  Meta Department.    According to the report, the two were kidnapped over the  weekend on the road from Villavicencio to Restrepo, 200 km from  this capital.    Although the police did not indicate the reason for the  kidnapping, local unofficial sources said the rebels said it was  in reprisal for the presence of a U.S. military contingent in  the Puerto Lopez area, near the site of the kidnapping.

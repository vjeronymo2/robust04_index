			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> PACINO AND BARKIN MAKE A BIG SPLASH IN 'SEA OF LOVE'  </P> <P> "Sea of Love" (citywide) is a satisfactory end-of-summer diversion, the kind of  film that works as long as you ask nothing of it beyond simple escape. It's a  slick, knowing genre film, through and through, a New York cop suspense  thriller that we've seen countless times before.  </P> <P> It does, thankfully, have a sense of humor, and it does have Al Pacino, Ellen  Barkin and John Goodman, all of whom are a bright, constant pleasure. Pacino  and Barkin do scorch the screen, although this doesn't happen until a full hour  into the picture; nevertheless, they become helpful in distracting attention  from various implausibilities.  </P> <P> Writer Richard Price and director Harold Becker take more time and pains than  necessary to establish that Pacino's Frank Keller, a Manhattan police detective  unsettled by reaching 20 years on the force, is a savvy, dedicated pro, earthy,  gregarious and volatile yet an achingly lonely man beneath all the bravado.  Goodman's sharp, humorous Sherman, a detective in Queens, comes into the  picture when he and Frank team up to try to catch a serial killer whose victims  are selected in the personals column of a singles magazine. Their one break  appears to be that the murderer is attracted to ads employing poetry.  </P> <P> Barkin's Helen, the cool, sexy manager of a chic shoe store, is one of the  respondents to an ad placed by Frank as a bait. After a bit of skirmishing,  Frank and Helen commence a highly combustible romance. Never mind that this is  contrary to orders; Frank is so carried away that he even resists having  Helen's water glass checked for prints. Yet a series of incidents and remarks  suggest that Frank's life could very well be in great danger. Golly, Helen even  has a copy of Phil Phillips' "Sea of Love" in her collection of old 45s, a  record that was playing over and over at the scene of the killings.  </P> <P> On its most basic level, "Sea of Love" works because Barkin has the skill to  keep us guessing whether she is actually a man-hating crazy or just a wary  veteran of the dating wars. There's no question that we are meant to see writ  in large the paranoia that cripples so many relationships out there in the  urban jungle, but this is to take "Sea of Love" too seriously. (Actually, the  film is preferable to the disturbingly muddled seriousness of "Fatal  Attraction.")  </P> <P> There's nothing at all profound in Helen or Frank, and Pacino and Barkin are  engaged in showy star turns, loaded with attitudes and poses, that are fun in  themselves and in fact appropriate for this superficial entertainment. Their  duel of personalities is nicely anchored by the presence of Goodman, whose wit  is as formidable as his bulk. Patricia Barry is heart-breaking as an elegant,  lonely older woman who has answered Frank's ad.  </P> <P> As sleek as "Sea of Love" (rated R for violence, sex and language) is, it can't  quite keep us away from wondering how a smart woman like Helen, whose looks  would stop traffic and whose work would bring her into constant contact with an  array of sophisticated men, would ever resort to the personals -- unless, of  course, she really is a psychopath.  </P></p>

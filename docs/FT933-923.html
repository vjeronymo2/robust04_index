			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Lurking threat of a first world debt crisis 'IS THE Debt Crisis Over?' the International Monetary Fund asks in a supplementary chapter to its latest World Economic Outlook. But which debt crisis is really on the Fund's mind? Ask finance ministers from sub-Saharan Africa whether their debt crisis is over and the answer would be an emphatic No. For, as the IMF also points out, interest and amortisation payments now consume nearly a quarter of the continent's export earnings every year, far higher than in any other region of the world. The IMF says that heavily indebted, low-income countries need substantial debt reduction. Oxfam, the international aid agency, advocates debt relief using the Trinidad terms, which allow for a two-thirds debt reduction. The World Bank says, in private, that even this does not go far enough. So far, sub-Saharan debt relief has not gone very far at all. But ask a group of bankers in New York and London whether the third world debt crisis is over and the answer will be a relieved Yes. Countries accounting for about 80 per cent of the commercial bank debt which had to be rescheduled in the 1980s have now participated in debt restructuring. These have lowered the net present value of repayments by a third, while banks have made provision to cover their remaining exposure. The international financial system, the IMF concludes, is no longer at risk from a widespread third world debt default. Yet, as this risk has receded, so others have taken its place. While commercial banks were removing third world debts from their balance sheets in the late 1980s, they were simultaneously engaging in another bout of speculative lending, this time to consumers and property developers in London and Tokyo and across the US. Once more, a rise in world interest rates turned many of these loans into bad debts, this time with much more severe effects on developed-country growth. The hangover from the debt binge of the late 1980s helps explain why the IMF is now exercised by the threat of a new debt crisis. For the combination of public spending pressures, high interest rates and persistently slow growth has produced large budget deficits in many developed countries, particularly in Europe. The combined budget deficit of European Community members is expected to be 5.6 per cent of gross domestic product this year. The US budget deficit peaked in the 1980s at only 4.1 per cent of GDP. Judging whether developed-country fiscal policies are sustainable is a tricky business. Governments, unlike private individuals, cannot actually go bankrupt, and even severely indebted developed-country governments have still been able to borrow from the capital markets. But, as the IMF points out, the share of net public debt in GDP can only rise for so long before troubles begin. A rising debt-GDP ratio means a growing share of interest payments in the budget, making the government increasingly vulnerable to a sharp rise in interest rates if the capital markets start to worry that the government might be tempted to inflate away the debt, as Italy and more recently Belgium have discovered. The IMF has calculated the budget deficits that developed-country governments would need in order to stabilise their net debt ratios, given projected growth rates and real interest rates. The chart compares these calculations, both this year and in 1998, to the actual deficits that the IMF expects to prevail. The message is clear. Japan has no fiscal difficulties, while Italy and the US plan actions which should bring debt ratios under control by 1998. But Germany, France and the UK all face medium-term deficits which imply rising debt ratios. The UK, in particular, is on an explosive course: by 1998, its budget deficit is expected to remain more than twice as great as that needed to stabilise its debt ratio. Little wonder the IMF privately fears that the debt threat is moving north. These days it is the build-up of first world debt, not Africa's lingering crisis, that haunts the sleep of IMF officials.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (7): Lawyer, 47, accepts daunting brief - 'There's no such thing as the end of history,' says the party leader facing a huge struggle Mr Jan Petersen, the new leader of Hoyre, Norway's Conservative party, has a political mountain to climb. Beaten into third place in last September's general election by the Centre party, Hoyre's traditional position as the main opposition to the ruling Labour party has rarely been so under threat. With deep differences now dividing Hoyre and the Centre party, the prospect of the Conservatives again leading a non-socialist coalition government, as they did in the 1980s, appears remote. But Mr Petersen, a 47-year-old lawyer with 13 years experience in the Storting, is undaunted. He faces, he admits, a marathon task. But, he insists: 'There is no such thing as the end of history. The surest thing in politics is that it is very difficult to make predictions. We have to believe that we will make it into government again.' The last time Hoyre led a government was as recently as 1990. But the administration collapsed after barely a year in office, irrepairably split between Hoyre's strong advocacy of Norwegian membership of the European Union and the equally strong anti-EU stance of the Centre party. The low point for Hoyre came in last year's election when the party was for the first time overtaken as the biggest non-socialist party by the Centre party, winning less than 20 per cent of the vote. It was a far cry from the party's heyday in the early 1980s when, under former Prime Minister Kare Willoch, Hoyre polled almost 32 per cent of the vote. After the September debacle, Mrs Kaci Kullman Five resigned as party leader. In April, Hoyre turned to the bearded, self-effacing Mr Petersen. The new leader's politics are in the centre of the conservative stream. For most of the past 10 years he has concentrated on foreign affairs, leaving him with a low domestic profile. But he intends to make a virtue of this, casting himself as a responsible leader of a credible alternative government. Once November's referendum on joining the EU is over - a campaign in which Hoyre supports the Labour government - Mr Petersen will place the emphasis on the need to stem Norway's government deficit and inject more market-oriented policies. 'We should try to move in the direction of freedom of choice in Norwegian affairs  .. a lot of people are fed up with what they perceive as the arrogance of the government. Labour is definitely not the 'natural' party of government. Very slowly, we are moving upwards again.'</p>

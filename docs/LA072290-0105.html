			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD EDER: MONSTER FRANKENSTEIN'S DOCTOR;  </P> <P> GOTHIC ROMANCE BY EMMANUEL CARRERE TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH BY LANIE GOODMAN  (CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS: $19.95; 269 PP.)  </P> <P> Emmanuel Carrere's "Gothic Romance" turns the dicta of contemporary literary  theory into a sardonic mystery novel; a play of twists and reverses that mocks  the frontier between the fictional and the real. It is what Umberto Eco did in  "Foucault's Pendulum," and the two novels much resemble each other.  </P> <P> Both are consistently and sometimes joyously clever; both are remarkably good  at creating a world of suspense. And in both, the deconstructionist or  deflationary process -- the joke to the effect that no figure in the story is  any more real than something this figure may be imagining or making up a story  about -- is a series of interlocking traps that spring at length and with  maddening deliberateness.  </P> <P> For his variation on the theme that anything written is an invention -- even  history and biography, because although the events and personages existed, the  way they are presented and written about is the writer's choice -- Carrere uses  "Frankenstein" and the circumstances of its composition.  </P> <P> Part of the novel, accordingly, is set in the early 19th Century at Lake  Geneva, where Byron, Shelley and Mary Shelley shared adjoining houses and many  rainy evenings. After a housebound spell of telling ghost stories, each decided  to try writing one. Only Mary Shelley persisted; the result is a classic, far  better known today than its author. This suits Carrere's purpose: the fictional  work usurps its author. And the joke is double, of course. We have all made the  mistake of assigning the name of the monster's creator -- Dr. Frankenstein --  to his creation.  </P> <P> To his historical literary trio, Carrere introduces a fourth personage: Byron's  doctor and secretary, J. William Polidori. (A similar enlargement of the  forgotten Polidori was central to Paul West's 1988 novel, "Lord Byron's  Doctor.") Carrere's Polidori is a drug-ruined wreck, a would-be writer, vain  and fiercely jealous of his employer, as well as of the Shelleys. He claims, in  fact, to have provided the inspiration for Mary's "Frankenstein"; and when hers  is a success, he writes an alternative version.  </P> <P> Carrere has made a witty pastiche in his alternative, the Polidori  Frankenstein. Instead of constructing a creature and bringing it to life, this  Frankenstein uses his wife, Elizabeth. He has to kill her first; she comes back  full of life, though with a ruthless, wanton edge, and with eyes that have  turned black. She promptly kills Frankenstein's brother, and the maid is then  hanged for it. Frankenstein revives them both; they return, oddly fierce and,  again, with black eyes.  </P> <P> To Frankenstein's growing dismay, the killings continue and he is forced to go  on with his work of revival. Before long, the entire city of Edinburgh -- the  household has moved there -- is full of black-eyed zombies, and it's only a  matter of time before Frankenstein himself will unwillingly become one of them.  </P> <P> So much for the story. But it bleeds into the life of the Shelley circle. The  Frankensteins meet the Shelleys one day at a Geneva hotel. Elizabeth tells Mary  a cover story about her husband's work. To make sure this story will stick, and  to mask the gradual takeover by the black-eyes, Mary is killed and then revived  as a black-eye herself. She goes to work dutifully writing the  pseudo-Frankenstein we read today.  </P> <P> And then, this whole now-you-see-it-now-you-don't fiction-reality is hauled up  into the present. Anne, a young woman living in Paris, is employed by a  mysterious Captain Walton to write romances. One day, he gives her the  manuscript of the Polidori Frankenstein to keep safe. It is stolen, and she is  kidnapped for her own safety by Julian, another mysterious character, who tells  her that the black-eyes -- now 98 % of the world's population -- are after her.  </P> <P> Captain Walton, of course, is also the narrator in Mary Shelley's book. And  now, in Anne's misadventures, he is both her real-life patron and one  present-day manifestation of Polidori. Julian seems to be an alternate Polidori  and also Lord Byron. Allan, Anne's lover, is Shelley. Not only has fiction (the  Frankenstein stories) seeped into and taken over historical reality -- Byron  and the Shelleys at Lake Geneva -- but both have now seeped into and taken over  the contemporary "reality" that Anne represents.  </P> <P> There are other elegant complications -- so many that these individually  striking voices entangle and sink into a kind of heavy buzzing. Only God or  Nature could make a bumblebee fly; fiction, I believe, needs more wing span in  proportion to buzz-weight.  </P></p>

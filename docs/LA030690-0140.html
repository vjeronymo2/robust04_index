			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> COUNTY GIRLS' TEAMS HOPE HISTORY REPEATS  </P> <P> This season's crop of girls' high school basketball teams can only hope to  enjoy the same success Orange County teams did in last year's Southern  California Regional playoffs.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda won state Division III and Southern Section 3-A titles, and Katella  won the 4-A title and was a Division II finalist. This season, three schools  won section titles and will compete tonight at 7:30. La Quinta won the 4-A  title, Brea-Olinda the 3-AA and Costa Mesa (3-A) won its first section  basketball title, boys or girls, over Rancho Alamitos.  </P> <P> Of the four girls' team playing, Brea-Olinda (30-0) has the best chance of  winning a state title. Brea, ranked No. 1 in the state, has a 52-game victory  streak and returns four starters from last season's state-champion team,  including Aimee McDaniel, the Division III player of the year last season.  </P> <P> But two other Orange County teams also have hopes of a Division III title.  Costa Mesa will play Selma and Rancho Alamitos will meet LeMoore in Tuesday's  other first-round Division III games.  </P> <P> La Quinta, the fourth-seeded team in Division II, will play host to Sanger  (22-11) Tuesday in the first round.  </P> <P> The Aztecs are led by Amy Jalewalia, who led the state in scoring last season  with a 32-point average. This season, she leads Orange County in scoring and is  second in the state in scoring with a 32.6 average.  </P> <P> If the Aztecs can win their next three games, they will advance to the state  championships March 16-17 in Oakland.  </P> <P> In Division II:  </P> <P> Sanger (22-11) at La Quinta (27-2): Jalewalia, a 6-foot-1 center who will  attend UCLA in the fall, leads the team in scoring, rebounding and steals. The  Aztecs play an up-tempo style, relying on full-court pressure. Junior forward  Heather Brannan averages 15 points a game.  </P> <P> Sanger, the Central Section Division II runner-up, gets balanced scoring from a  front line that features three players who are 5-10 or taller.  </P> <P> Senior center Cathy Isom (5-11) is the only Apache averaging in double figures  in scoring (11.3 points and 8.3 rebounds). Freshman center Brandi Honn (5-10)  averages 9.5 points and four rebounds. Senior forward Annie Lovett (5-11)  averages 8.7 points and 7.2 rebounds.  </P> <P> In Division III:  </P> <P> San Diego Lincoln (16-6) at Brea-Olinda (30-0): Brea-Olinda returns four  starters from last year's team. Point guard McDaniel runs a potent offense that  features double-figure scorers Tammy Blackburn, Jody Anton and Jinelle  Williams.  </P> <P> Lincoln is led by 6-3 junior center Sheila Dixon (26 points, 18.0 rebounds).  Senior guard Abena Byrd averages 9.9 points a game.  </P> <P> Selma (14-10) at Costa Mesa (17-11): Costa Mesa, which went from a third-place  finish in the Pacific Coast League to win the 3-A title, is the Cinderella  story of the Southern Section. Olivia DiCamilli leads the Mustangs, averaging  15.8 points. Junior forward Rachel Ward and senior point guard Thuy Nguyen  average 11 points each.  </P> <P> Selma is led by sisters Anjelica and Etelisia Guzman.  </P> <P> Anjelica, who is 5-2, averages 10 points and Etelisia (5-3) averages 10.7  points. Stephanie Rhodes, a 6-1 junior, averages 9.2 points.  </P> <P> Rancho Alamitos (21-4) at LeMoore (20-7): Rancho Alamitos, under first-year  coach Bob Becker, lost to Costa Mesa in the 3-A final. The Vaqueros have a  tough draw in the regional playoffs on the road against Central Section  champion LeMoore. Rancho Alamitos relies heavily on senior guard-forward Jenny  Newsome (23 points a game). Other key players are Shellie Tsuji (14 points) and  Anita Stecker (10.4 points).  </P> <P> LeMoore is averaging 52.3 points a game while holding opponents to 39.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> Home Away From Home: Ever feel like you just can't get far enough away from  home to get away from home anymore?  </P> <P> The builders conference was held at the Moscone Convention Center in San  Francisco, a very long stone's throw from Orange County.  </P> <P> But about 25% of the various panelists at the four-day event, as well as a  hefty portion of the design, construction project and marketing program award  winners, were from Orange County.  </P> <P> And across the street from the main entrance, a new parking structure was going  up, although nothing yet was poking above ground level.  </P> <P> Except for a large truck trailer belonging to a subcontractor. It was painted a  brilliant white with a big orange painted on its side.  </P> <P> The subcontractor? Saddleback Roofing of Orange.  </P></p>

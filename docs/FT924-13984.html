			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / DTI to query photocopier sales tactics THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is to raise with the Office of Fair Trading renewed allegations of unscrupulous sales tactics by photocopier salesmen. The move follows a meeting last week between Baroness Denton, the DTI minister responsible for consumer affairs, and members of the Campaign to Clean Up Copier Contracts, which has the support of the Confederation of British Industry. More than 1,500 companies have complained to the campaign about very high hidden costs in 'copy plan' contracts, which amalgamate the capital and running costs of photocopiers into a single charge and charge customers on a 'per copy' basis. There have been allegations that some finance companies add the concealed cost of settling earlier photocopier agreements to the cost of new capital equipment. Many companies complain that they are unwittingly signing leasing deals lasting up to nine years for equipment with a three-year life. Any variation in copier requirements can mean that the contract period starts again. The campaign leaders told Baroness Denton that, in spite of an OFT investigation into the activities of one photocopier distributor in 1991 and attempts by some trade organisations to enforce new codes of conduct in the leasing market, evidence remains of widespread malpractice involving photocopy contracts. The OFT says it will consider revoking consumer credit licences if leasing-contract abuses are discovered. Lady Denton has been given a portfolio of cases alleging misrepresentation and possible fraud. She is being pressed to pursue changes in the law to offer companies a two-week 'cooling off' period once contracts are signed. The campaign also wants businesses to have the same protection available to individuals under the Consumer Credit Act. The campaign has announced the establishment of a panel of lawyers and accountants who will analyse complaints, identify the biggest offenders and provide advice on how contracts can be challenged. The DTI confirmed that the issue would be discussed at its next scheduled meeting with the OFT.</p>

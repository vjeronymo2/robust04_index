			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT MARKS CABINET RANK OF VETERANS DEPT.  </P> <P> In a flag-decked ceremony on the White House South Lawn, President Bush on  Wednesday marked the evolution of the Veterans Administration into the  Department of Veterans Affairs after swearing in a former Army private to lead  the agency.  </P> <P> "I consider the new department to have a vital mission. It is so vital there is  only one place for the veterans of America: in the Cabinet room with the  President of the United States," Bush said as the new department secretary,  Edward J. Derwinski, stood by his side.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Swears In Derwinski  </P> <P> Derwinski, a 12-term Illinois congressman who filled high State Department  posts in the Reagan Administration, was sworn in by Bush in a private ceremony  in the Roosevelt Room.  </P> <P> The new secretary said Americans thought of veterans in terms immortalized by  Rudyard Kipling's tribute to the British "Tommy:"  </P> <P> "For it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' 'Chuck 'im out, the brute!'  </P> <P> "But it's 'Savior of 'is country' when the guns begin to shoot."  </P> <P> In praising Derwinski as "uniquely suited" to lead the new department, Bush  said: "He has the skill of a seasoned legislator, the patience of a practical  administrator, the finesse of a diplomat and the heart of a man who knows what  it means to start his government career as a private in the U.S. Army."  </P></p>

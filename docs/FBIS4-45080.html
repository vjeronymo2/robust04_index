			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bharat Bhushan: "Security Concerns Not </F> Negotiable, Says Official; `India Has Not Agreed to Multilateral  Talks'"]    [Text] Washington DC -- India's security concerns were not  negotiable in any multilateral fora and therefore the United  States proposal for multilateral talks concerning Indian  security and nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia was a  non-starter, according to a senior Indian official accompanying  the Indian Prime Minister during his visit to the United States.    The official asserted that no one was more aware than India  of its own regional security concerns and claimed that India had  never agreed to discuss them in any multilateral talks.    This clear enunciation of the Indian position came on the  eve  of the Prime Minister's arrival in the U.S. capital. The Clinton  administration, however, believes that both India and Pakistan  have in principle agreed to multilateral talks on  non-proliferation, arms control and regional security and has  said so in its latest report to the U.S. Congress. However, it  admitted that some important differences remain on the issue.    The Indian official suggested that it was jumping the gun to  talk of details such as the number of countries that should  participate in the multilateral talks or about whether the  direction of the talks was global or regional. He claimed that  India had not even agreed to the concept of the multilateral  talks.    The official was asked whether India had not created the  impressions in the three bilateral rounds of talks with the  United States that it was agreeable to multilateral talks on  non-proliferation. He replied that if such an impression had  been created, and he was not sure whether this need had been the  case, then it was erroneous. He suggested that it was not  India's position to opt for a regional non-proliferation  solution.    The official admitted that the issues of non-proliferation,  arms control and regional security that the United States was  raising came together in the case of Jammu and Kashmir. However,  he dismissed out of hand the U.S. assessment that Kashmir could  be a flashpoint for nuclear war between India and Pakistan.    The official said that it was not entirely correct to  suggest  that India had problems with the United States only vis-a-vis  the political relationship between the two countries. On the  economic side too there were some critical issues to be  discussed, he said. If the United States wanted access to the  India market, so did India want access to U.S. market and there  were problems of access involved in that.    Issues relating to intellectual property rights, the use of  Special 301 provision of the U.S. trade law, the question of  high technology exports and the movement of Indian software  personnel remained some thorny issues that needed to be sorted  out, he said.    The official was mapping the broad range of political and  economic issues that would come up in discussions between Prime  Minister Narasimha Rao and U.S. President Bill Clinton. The  State Department spokesman in his regular briefing on Monday  reiterated the U.S. expectation that the non-proliferation issue  would certainly be discussed by the two leaders. "The President  certainly expects to have a discussion that would cover a full  range of subjects with the Prime Minister and those which  include our shared concerns of a global nature, it would include  issues about non-proliferation and regional security issues that  we raise and discuss with the government of India and others on  a regular basis."    Meetings preparatory to the one between Rao and Clinton have  been going on between Indian and U.S. officials. Last Friday,  Indian Ambassador Siddartha Shankar Ray met Deputy Secretary of  State Strobe Talbott in what was described as "an  organisational, technical meeting."    Asked about the significance of the meeting with Lynn Davis,  an Indian official said that she had sought the meeting with the  Foreign Secretary but that nothing special was expected to be  discussed with her. The meeting it was suggested would be more  in the nature of her getting to know the Indian Foreign  Secretary whom she has not met as yet.</p>

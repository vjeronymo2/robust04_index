			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HIP OPERA;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: THE L.A. MUSIC CENTER OPERA CREATED 'A MUSKRAT LULLABY' PROJECT FOR  AREA GRADE SCHOOLS. STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ARE SINGING ITS PRAISES.  </P> <P> Opera, generally thought of as the entertainment of the evening gown and tuxedo  set, is coming to the Bart Simpson and L.A. Gear set.  </P> <P> Under the guidance of professionals from the Los Angeles Music Center Opera,  grade-school students throughout the county are learning to slither like  alligators, play the drums on trash-can contraptions and sing heartily in the  chorus of a children's opera.  </P> <P> After five weeks of training, they will unveil the opera, "A Muskrat Lullaby,"  on their school stage, sharing the spotlight with professional singers.  </P> <P> At a recent dress rehearsal at Grand View Boulevard School in Mar Vista, the  children, who play alligators and muskrats, went through the score and blocking  -- their movements on stage -- in preparation for that afternoon's performance.  Location director Paul King ordered the gators to stay low to the ground and  act less polite and more "snarly."  </P> <P> The opera involves about 120 youngsters in the fourth through sixth grades.  Several of the children had seen Mozart's "The Magic Flute" or Oliver Knussen  and Maurice Sendak's "Where the Wild Things Are" on field trips last year.  </P> <P> But before the "Muskrat Lullaby" project, most had no idea what opera was. And  if they did have an opinion about opera, teacher Brenda Richards said, it was  that it was weird or boring.  </P> <P> " 'You hear all these notes, and you don't know what they're saying,' "  Richards recalled her fourth-graders saying.  </P> <P> "Even for adults," added director King, the stereotype is that opera is "a  bunch of fat ladies on stage singing." The opera company's school program, he  said, aims to leave children with "their first memory of opera (as) something  they participated in."  </P> <P> With the L.A. Music Center Opera team, a school production is not a casual  undertaking. They conduct workshops in which the children sing musical scales,  learn creative dramatics and acquire a basic music vocabulary. Such people as  Llewellyn Crain, manager of the opera's education and community programs, and  opera docents explain opera and teach lines and cues. Composer and librettist  Edward Barnes and percussionist John Fitzgerald lead rehearsals and talk about  their jobs.  </P> <P> "It was pretty hard to learn how to breathe in the first lesson," said muskrat  Hailey Singh -- that is, inhale through the nose, exhale from the mouth.  </P> <P> She and other students said they had been teased by some classmates about being  in the opera and wearing handmade animal masks. "They think it's for wimps,  they think it's dumb, because you're singing," Hailey said.  </P> <P> But opera has caught on, teachers said. At recess, "(students will) sing, 'Will  you throw the ball to me?' " Richards said.  </P> <P> Eight of the children play in a percussion band on instruments they built  themselves under Fitzgerald's guidance. Among the instruments are a drum made  of three aluminum cans hanging inside a box, a "zipper guitar" made of a dowel  and a metal spring strung between a garbage can and a coffee can, and glass  canning jars filled with water and played with pencils with new erasers.  </P> <P> They are "junk instruments -- easily made, easily repaired," Fitzgerald said.  They were all built in less than an hour.  </P> <P> Playing them, however, took some practice, the youngsters said. "You have to  keep track, look at the teacher, (and know) your instrument," said aluminum can  drummer Jason Clouse, 9.  </P> <P> In addition to the unusual instruments, "Muskrat Lullaby" has elements of  Charleston, salsa, rock 'n' roll and rap. "The style is . . . accessible and  entertaining," said Crain, "more like Sondheim than like Puccini."  </P> <P> "We wanted kids to feel it was real hip, real cool," she said.  </P> <P> No matter that the children don't exactly achieve bel canto. "We don't care how  good they sound," Crain said. "Most important to us is that they understand  this process" of creating an opera and they are coaxed "out of their shells or  their everyday world."  </P> <P> So it helps that "Muskrat Lullaby," which is based on the book "Mama Don't  Allow" by Thacher Hurd, is set in a swamp. The plot is simple: A singing group  consisting of Miles the Muskrat and three other animals (played by members of  L.A. Opera's resident company) goes to the swamp to practice. They are nearly  eaten by a gang of alligators, but they sing themselves to safety by crooning a  lullaby and putting the 'gators to sleep.  </P> <P> There's a moral, of course: "The singing group uses music and cooperation to  get themselves out of this predicament," Crain said.  </P> <P> The student performers say they've been learning that along the way.  Fourth-grader and alligator Claudia Marroquin said she liked working with her  classmates, but she added that it's difficult at times because "some people  don't listen, and they screw it up."  </P> <P> The "Muskrat Lullaby" program, started in March, is the brainchild of general  director Peter Hemmings, who ran a similar project when he led Scottish Opera.  The program is financed by government agencies and private foundations and  costs about $2,300 per school, with the school chipping in $800. By the end of  this month, "Muskrat Lullaby" will have traveled to 29 schools in the county.  </P> <P> The opera company is so pleased with the way the program has gone that it is  developing a similar program for junior high and high schools, Crain said.  </P> <P> On performance day at Grand View, 11 people from the opera company took part,  including the singers and technical crew. They brought costumes, a few props,  conga drums, slide whistles and other instruments. The big star, from the  children's standpoint, was bass-baritone Richard Bernstein, who played the role  of the alligator boss, dressed in top hat, black coattails with green jewels  and metallic green pants.  </P> <P> The student alligators and muskrats seemed dazzled by the show even as they  were in it. Accompanying composer Barnes on keyboards and Fitzgerald on drums,  the sounds of the children's percussion band -- the boing of the spring, thunk  of the garbage can, ticktock of the aluminum cans and plock of the canning jar  tops -- were amazingly melodic.  </P> <P> Barnes said he was delighted at the way the youngsters shed their shyness as  the 20-minute performance progressed. "They learn the value of being a ham on  stage," he said.  </P> <P> The audience of about 200 students first whooped and giggled but were soon  entranced. The alligators popped up out of character occasionally and the band  missed a few beats, but they were given a chorus of bravos.  </P> <P> "It was fun," said a breathless Laura Farahat, 9, who dressed for her part in  apple-green turtleneck and stretch pants.  </P> <P> The performance is over now, but it's not the finale of "Lullaby" yet. Waiting  back in the classroom, said Richards and other teachers, are science  experiments on the sounds of liquid-filled jars, assignments to write reports  on muskrats and other animals -- and tapes of Puccini.  </P></p>

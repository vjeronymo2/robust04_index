"It is a certain fact" that growth will be lower than  expected in 1994, Spaventa said on the sidelines of a conference  here, but if gross domestic product does increase even by just  1.4 percent, as predicted by Confindustria, it would be a  "consistent" improvement and would "produce noticeable effects."    Spaventa appeared wary of comments by International Monetary  Fund officials, who said the government will be forced to  approve additional austerity measures in spring to offset a  runaway deficit. "I am against so-called clinical measures aimed  at patching up the differences in forecast growth caused by  international economic cycles," Spaventa said.    He admitted that "the last word will be up to the IMF,"  which  will probably recommend new measures to contain spending and  possibly some indirect tax increases.    But interest rates are the key to balancing state finances,  according to Spaventa: "The battle against the public debt will  be fought with interest rates," he said.    As for the effects in Italy of recovery in other countries,  Spaventa said he was pleased to see that the German central bank  had not increased interest rates along with growing monetary  mass; "in the past they would not have hesitated to do so."</p>

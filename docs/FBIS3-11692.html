According to the communique, the state of  democratic law does not allow a confrontation among the branches  of the Republic "under penalty of an institutional crisis of  serious internal and external consequences."    In the following paragraph, the Senate notes that it is  appropriate for the press to criticize or praise the actions of  the three branches of government and correct possible mistakes.  The communique says: "It is not correct, however, to use the  media to foment animosities that may compromise the  institutions."    The communique also recalls that Congress did not fail to  support the government, and approved the economic program. The  communique, signed by Congress President Senator Humberto Lucena  (PMDB-PB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Paraiba State]),  notes that nothing will justify a diversion from championing the  "system of responsible rights, our country's supreme legal and  social good, rights that are actually based on respect for  independence and harmony among the three branches of  government." The communique concludes with a call for common  sense to prevail, with negotiations by the president of the  Republic, "who, under a presidential system of government, is  entitled to conduct our country's political-administrative  process."</p>

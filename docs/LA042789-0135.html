			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKEOVER RUMORS BOOST XEROX BY $2.50 PER SHARE  </P> <P> Shares of copier giant Xerox Corp. jumped in heavy trading Wednesday on talk  that it might be a takeover target of British conglomerate Hanson PLC.  </P> <P> Xerox stock rose $2.50 to $67.50 on volume of more than 1.3 million shares on  the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Wall Street analysts said Xerox could be vulnerable to a takeover by Hanson or  another firm that might break up its diversified businesses, which range from  insurance to stock brokerage, plus its well-known business machines.  </P> <P> "Speculation about Xerox has become so substantial because of the underlying  values it has," said analyst Eugene Glazer of Dean Witter Reynolds.  </P> <P> Analysts figured it would take $8.5 billion to $9 billion, or about $85 to $90  per share, to acquire Xerox.  </P> <P> Hanson, which has succeeded in a number of takeovers in the United States but  has been inactive recently, is considered capable of pulling off such a feat,  with a $7 billion war chest, analysts said. Xerox and Hanson declined comment  on the rumors.  </P> <P> Hanson is one of Britain's largest industrial concerns, with pretax profit of  $1.5 billion on sales of $12.5 billion. It is already a player in the office  consumer products market with its Smith Corona typewriters and word processors,  acquired when it took over SCM Corp. several years ago.  </P> <P> Xerox mainly makes and develops copiers and other office equipment, but also  has a large financial services arm that owns the brokerage Furman Selz Holding  Co. and property and casualty insurance firm Crum &amp; Forster Inc.  </P> <P> The takeover speculation came on a day that Xerox Corp. was unveiling what it  calls the world's quietest ribbon typewriter, a machine nearly as quiet as a  computer keyboard.  </P> <P> The typewriters introduced Wednesday use a patented technology that gives the  printer heads the vibrational characteristics of a hammer weighing nearly 35  pounds, Xerox said. That makes them vibrate at a pitch nearly six octaves lower  than usual, almost inaudible to the human ear.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] During operations carried out on Agri Mountain over  the past month, 29 terrorists were killed and 26 terrorists were  caught. Furthermore, 164 persons were taken into custody for  abetting the terrorist organization.    Igdir Governor Semsettin Uzun has said that thanks to the  help of the citizens, the regional cadre of the terrorist PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan] has been destroyed.    The governor pointed out that the interrogation of the  suspects indicates that the number of dead and wounded  terrorists is higher but that the bodies could not be found  because they were buried under the snow.    Meanwhile, in searches conducted in the region, two SA-16  SAM  missiles, as well as large amounts of weapons, ammunition, and  snow gear, were found. The 74 shelters uncovered during the  operations were destroyed, along with the tonnes of food found  in them.</p>

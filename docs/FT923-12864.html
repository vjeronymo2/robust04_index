			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: TGWU chief in benefits call LABOUR'S traditional support for universal entitlement to welfare benefits has come under pressure after unexpected support for targeted benefits from Mr Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU general union, Britain's largest. Mr Morris, whose union controls more than 10 per cent of the total vote at Labour's policy-making annual conference, says in an article in the New Statesman: 'I favour an examination of the ineffective system of universal entitlements, perhaps looking at moving towards a more flexible programme that offers individual pathways out of poverty. 'This does not mean a move away from equality. Instead, I see it as a move towards genuine equality, an equality that does not pretend that the state needs to offer the same to the two-income, two-car family as it offers to the poor any more than men need the same protection as women, or white people the same as black.' Using the example of child benefit, he proposes a compromise of much lower universal payments with additional payments for those in need, should the party feel the need to continue to satisfy the principle of universality.</p>

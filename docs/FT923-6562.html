			<p>920824 FT  24 AUG 92 / The London Conference: Bosnian president to unveil peace plan Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic will unveil to the London conference a comprehensive peace plan based on ethnic rights and a secular democratic state, writes Judy Dempsey. The plan, aimed at preventing Bosnia from being carved up between Serbia and Croatia, or from being divided into ethnically based cantons, involves reconstituting the government of Bosnia. Bosnian officials last night said the republic would neither be a unitary nor an Islamic state. Instead, it would set out to give Moslem, Serb and Croat ethnic communities far-reaching rights which would be enshrined in the constitution, and exercised in a second chamber. The ethnic groups represented in the second chamber would have power of veto. The officials added that the plan would also entail clawing back some of the territory seized by Bosnia's Serbs.</p>

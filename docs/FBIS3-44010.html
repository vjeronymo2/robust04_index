			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the  UN secretary general in Angola, today briefed the prime minister  on the development of events in Lusaka. At the end of the  meeting, Chief Beye told the press that everyone should pray  that the peace talks have a good ending in the shortest possible  time.    Marcolino Moco and Chief Beye met very briefly, considering  the issues discussed at the meeting. In less than 30 minutes  the special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola  spoke about humanitarian assistance and explained to the prime  minister how things are progressing in Lusaka.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Chief Beye, it  must  be true that your meeting with the prime minister centered on  Lusaka peace talks?    [Beye] That is true. That is the concern of the Angolan  people, and, therefore, the concern of the Angolan Government.  I briefed the prime minister on our work. I also had the  opportunity to reiterate to the prime minister my best wishes  for 1994 and that this may be a year of peace for Angola. We  also discussed the issue of humanitarian assistance which  greatly concerns the government, the provision of supplies to  the people, and the visit of the executive director of the World  Food Program.    [Reporter] Will the peace talks still take long?    [Beye] We have to be very prudent. I must also respect the  contract that we made. A day will come when I shall talk and I  think this day will come very soon. We must, therefore, pray  for this. Let us avoid predictions.    [Reporter] What is the deadline for the end of discussions?    [Beye] We cannot set a deadline for the end of negotiations.  It must, however, be as soon as possible. Thank you very much.

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Sage shares up 51p to 656p Shares in Sage Group jumped 51p to 656p after the personal computer accounting software company reported record sales and pre-tax profits and a significant acquisition in the French accounting software market. The Newcastle-based company is paying Pounds 18.7m for Saari, the leader in the French market. Its position is broadly comparable to Sage in the UK. The deal will be financed, unusually for Sage, by a Pounds 20m unsecured five-year loan. There is no earn-out provision, no penalty for early repayment and on a pro forma basis, interest payments are covered eight times. Saari is Sage's second acquisition in France following the purchase of Ciel in 1992. Ciel sells accounting software at the low end of the market, whereas Saari's products are directed at the small and medium-sized business sector. Mr David Goldman, Sage chairman, said there were considerable possibilities for rationalisation within Saari to improve margins and profits. The French company turned over Pounds 29.1m last year, but profits were only Pounds 1.9m. Its operating margin of 7 per cent compares with 44 per cent for Sage in the UK. Mr Goldman said Saari employed 110 people in sales and marketing, compared with only 12 for Sage. A new chief executive and finance director are being sought and some Pounds 1.5m has been earmarked for restructuring, which is expected to take about 30 months. The French company is expected to make an immediate contribution to profitability. In the year to September 30, Sage raised pre-tax profits by 48 per cent to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 9.66m). Turnover increased 23 per cent at Pounds 50.9m (Pounds 41.3m), including Pounds 22.3m from sales of upgrades, services and other products to existing customers. Earnings per share advanced to 45.4p (32.5p). The dividend for the year is raised 10 per cent to 10.91p (9.92p) including a final of 7.26p (6.6p). Net cash at the year end came to Pounds 4m after Pounds 9m was spent on earlier acquisitions and capital investment. DacEasy, the principal US subsidiary, raised operating profits by 86 per cent to Pounds 2.2m on revenues of Pounds 12.9m, demonstrating recovery from problems experienced last year. COMMENT The accounting software business was, Mr Paul Walker, Sage chief executive, said yesterday 'very simple.' Over the years the company has benefited from a spare, simple approach to management. Its latest acquisition will clearly benefit from this approach. Mr Goldman is justifiably pleased with the price paid - 64 per cent of sales - compared, say, with Microsoft's acquisition of Intuit for six times sales. Sage's one slip - some carelessness over the management of DacEasy in the US - was swiftly corrected and the same mistake is unlikely to be made with Saari. With estimated profits of Pounds 17m - Pounds 18m this year giving a prospective p/e of between 12 and 13, the shares are very reasonably priced.</p>

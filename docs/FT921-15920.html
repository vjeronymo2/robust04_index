			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: Du Pont faces Dollars 3bn-plus charge to meet standard DU PONT, the US chemicals group, expects to take a Dollars 3bn to Dollars 4bn one-time after-tax charge against earnings in the first quarter of 1993 to comply with a new standard of accounting for the post-retirement health benefits of employees. All US companies have to adopt the new standard by 1993. Many big corporations have announced similarly large non-cash charges against earnings. The standard allows the charge to be taken in one blow, as Du Pont proposes, or amortised over 20 years.</p>

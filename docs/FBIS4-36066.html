			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA)--Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq  al- Shar' affirmed today that Israel's latest aggression against  south Lebanon yesterday is clear evidence that Israel does not  desire peace and places obstacles to the peace efforts to cause  tension in the region.    In press statements made here today, he said the lack of  progress in the peace process is being blamed on Israel, which  does not want to withdraw from the Arab territories it occupied  in 1967.    He said that the Arab parties are committed to the peace  process and the UN Security Council resolutions.    Answering a question on the effect of the Israeli stance on  achieving progress on the Syrian track, he said that although  Israel does not want peace, the United States will not abandon  the peace process.    He said the Lebanese have the right to defend themselves  against the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon to implement  international legitimacy and Security Council resolutions.    On the Syrian presence in Lebanon, he said this presence is  aimed at helping the Lebanese people in reconstruction efforts.    Commenting on the situation in Yemen, the Syrian foreign  minister said his country is currently holding intense contacts  to stop the ongoing fighting in Yemen and preserve Yemen's unity.</p>

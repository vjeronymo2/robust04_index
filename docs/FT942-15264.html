			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (11): Elegant Unsal shuns blame - An adviser to the prime minister talks to John Murray Brown Talking to Osman Unsal, it is easy to forget the country is grappling with its worst financial crisis for a decade. Just back from yet another trip to south-east Asia, he sounds like a born-again capitalist who has seen the promised land - in his case the tiny island state of Singapore. A former Citibank employee, with a taste for monogrammed shirt cuffs, Mr Unsal is today the government official the business community loves to hate. For Mr Unsal, 39, is a key confidant of Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister. His lack of years has already been the cause of one humiliation: bureaucrats in Ankara succeeded in blocking his appointment as Treasury head on the grounds that he had seen insufficient time in the civil service. Since the announcement of the austerity package, Mr Unsal has been replaced as acting under-secretary at the treasury, moving instead to the prime ministry. Mr Unsal made his name as head of the foreign investment department under the former Motherland party administration. His connection with Mrs Ciller goes back further - she was his professor at the Bogazici University. It is his public finance strategy that is widely blamed for fuelling overnight rates, which led to high borrowing costs, causing a dramatic contraction of business activity, and leaving the banking sector gasping for breath. His bid to restructure the government's domestic debt is seen as the main cause for the collapse of the Treasury bill market. In the wake of January's 12 per cent devaluation and the subsequent currency turmoil, interest rates on government bills have shot up to 125 per cent, and even at that rate there is little demand. The Treasury is selling less than TL100bn at its Wednesday auction compared with an average figure of around TL20,000bn last year. Mr Unsal's strategy had a certain elegance. By lengthening maturities, the government set out to ease its debt service burden. The side-effect, however, was that the repeated cancellation of the weekly auction has left the market with an overhang of Turkish lira - one of the main factors fuelling dollar demand, and leading to the run on the currency. 'I didn't say that interest rates should come down. I just said for one-year paper I'll pay more. We were lucky to do that. If we had gone into this crisis with heavy three-month funding for the Treasury, we would have been in deep trouble. But in nominal terms, it's the same as last year or even less than last year. 'I don't think we have a problem,' Mr Unsal avers, pointing to a 30 per cent increase in foreign investment approvals in 1993. 'On the contrary, with the customs union (with the European Union) Turkey will be a production centre, a stepping stone, the penetration point for the markets.' His personal conviction has so far failed to persuade the markets. The lira has lost close to 35 per cent in the wake of the 12 per cent devaluation in January. Mr Unsal is keen to stress that whatever has happened was a collective decision. 'It wasn't fair to blame me. We had hourly meetings or daily meetings, with the central bank, the state planning organisation and with finance.' He prefers to put a more positive gloss on what has happened. 'Because of our inability to borrow in the last two months, our projected stock of Treasury paper will be something like 22 per cent of our GNP, when it was quoted in the budget at 26 per cent.' Turkey's problems, he asserts, are short-term. 'To lose the confidence of the market can happen in just one day. To rebuild you may need more than one day. But the public should realise, the banks should realise, it's normal to have such disturbances.' Mr Unsal appears equally confident that the banking sector can ride out the crisis. 'If you make money with your short position, you may lose with your short position, and that's a fact of life,' he says. But he is sensitive to the suggestion that his policies contributed to the currency crisis. 'Everyone needs a reason for a problem,' he says, searching for an explanation. 'Tax was certainly one aspect. If you start taxing some of the instruments and not others, you create a disturbance to the advantage of one and disadvantage of the other. 'Treasury paper was used as a tax shelter. In late November, when the tax rumours started, that's when the banks started to cover their positions.'</p>

Dr. Bukoshi, who started a three day visit to the United  States, called on world authorities once more not to ignore the  explosive situation in Kosova, but to undertake preventive  measures before it will be late.    "We demand an international presence in Kosova which will  help prevent Serbian abuses, which may lead to a large conflict  with destructive consequences for the peace in the region", Mr.  Bukoshi said. He reiterated that sanctions towards Serbia  should be conditioned with the correct resolution of the Kosova  question. Mr. Bukoshi said that the peaceful policy of the  Kosova leadership may loose its credibility among the Albanian  people on both sides, and this peaceful approach may be  considered by Belgrade as a challenge to the increasing  repression.    Mr. Bukoshi said that this stand of the Albanians may be  considered by the international community as a reason to ignore  the situation in Kosova.    "Kosova fulfills all premises to be an independent state  like  other republics of former Yugoslavia. It is the richest region  and with sufficient human potential. We are not demanding  unification with Albania and this is the greatest compromise we  are as a people. [sentence as received] We do not demand a  violent change of the borders," Mr. Bukoshi said in a response  to a question "Is Kosova able to be an independent state and  will it demand a unification with Albania?"</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Dutch party leader resigns Mr Elco Brinkman (left) resigned yesterday as Christian Democrat leader in the lower house of the Dutch parliament in a delayed response to the party's record losses in last May's general election. His departure comes days before the expected inauguration of a coalition government that will exclude the Christian Democrats from power for the first time in modern Dutch politics. His successor, not yet named, will effectively become leader of the opposition. The new government is to be formed by Mr Wim Kok, the Labour leader. Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister, chose Mr Brinkman as heir apparent within the Christian Democrat party when he decided not to stand for a record fourth term in office. However, Mr Brinkman never managed to achieve Mr Lubbers' authority or popularity, and the party saw its seats in the 150-seat parliament cut to 34 from 54 in the election.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Fernando Veloso and Orlando Muchanga] </F>   [Excerpts] (Beira)--Afonso Dhlakama, leader of Renamo  [Mozambique National Resistance], is in Beira. He told MEDIAFAX  yesterday that he was received by "a large crowd of over 50,000  people." Independent sources, and others linked to Frelimo  [Mozambique Liberation Front], without risking giving numbers,  noted that the reception was "in fact unusual." A Mozambique  Television journalist commented that "undoubtedly there were  many more people than those who went to receive Chissano." Yet,  a Radio Mozambique journalist estimated the number of people who  went to the airport as 10,000. The same journalist told us that  at the traditional reception ceremony, in which Dhlakama was  dressed in a leopard skin, five local traditional chiefs  attended the event.    Commenting on the reception given to Dhlakama, who is  visiting Beira after a 16-year absence, the sources recognized  that the security forces were not efficient. "Renamo guards  even beat up a number of people who could not control their  desire to see Dhlakama." A journalist commented that the  government police were apathetic.    The level of absenteeism in the companies was enormous. Our  sources say that this explains why so many people went to  welcome Dhlakama on a normal working day, although workers were  not given a day off when Joaquim Chissano arrived in Beira on a  visit in his capacity as president of the Republic. [passage  omitted]    Commenting on the "passive" attitude of the government  police  during the Renamo chairman's arrival in Beira, the Sofala  Provincial governor said that this happened because "the  coordination with Renamo was difficult" on security measures.    He added: "I do not yet know exactly what happened, but it  was nothing serious."    On several occasions, we asked the Renamo leader and the  Sofala governor about the controversial issue of woodcutters.    Dhlakama says he has no planned meeting with the woodcutters  "in particular," but with businessmen "in general."    The concern of the woodcutters, who are unable to continue  their activities, has emerged again. Dhlakama began by saying  that he is "very angry with MEDIAFAX" for not having precisely  reproduced his ideas in our newspaper recently. He said we  "misinformed" people when we reported that he said he would give  priority to U.S. nationals in detriment to Mozambican citizens.    He said: "I met with U.S. businessmen from several sectors,  but I do not know whether there were woodcutters among them."    On this issue, concerning Renamo priorities, Dhlakama  explained that "there is a policy for the woodcutters, be they  Mozambicans or foreigners. When they cut wood they must plant  seedlings, otherwise two years from now we will have no trees."    We asked him what criteria would be followed to identify the  Mozambican woodcutters.    Dhlakama said: "We have always said that they can cut the  wood, but with the following conditions: cut one tree and plant  another one. We know that the Mozambican businessmen do not  have these facilities because the state does not grant them  loans and they cannot work just with an axe, a saw, or a hoe."    But there are businessmen who have the financial resources  for that and complain that they are not allowed work. Dhlakama  replied: "No, there are no such businessmen!"    He added: "We understand that the wood cutters want to earn  money, they want to prosper, they also want to pay their workers  because they are living in difficult conditions. We know that,  but it is better to think about the future of our children and  grandchildren."    We asked whether Renamo recognizes licenses issued by the  government, with whom it signed the Peace Accord. He said: "You  should know that the Frelimo government is corrupt," and added,  "in Mozambique a number of licenses have been issued to  foreigners through corruption which does not benefit the  Mozambican people in any way."    He also said that it is not a matter of Renamo recognizing  the licenses or persisting in having a dual administration. The  issue is, although Renamo "is an opposition party and recognizes  the government, we do not accept the fact that the government  continues with its corrupt actions and the populations remains  without land because it is offered to foreigners, and the  dollars go to the ministers' pockets."    Sofala Provincial Governor Francisco Masquil says he does  not  know whether Renamo authorizes the woodcutters to work in areas  under its control, but would like the problem to be solved "as  soon as possible."    We asked Masquil whether Frelimo was becoming alarmed about  the Renamo leader's visit to Sofala and he said: "This is not  our concern at present," adding that "we are currently concerned  about peace."

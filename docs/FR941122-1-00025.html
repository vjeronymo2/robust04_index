			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this proposal, the total allowable deduction for the residence would not exceed actual costs or one standard allowance. If one household pays all the utility expenses, that household would be entitled to the applicable standard or could claim actual costs. The household that did not pay any utility costs would not be able to claim any actual utility costs or any part of a standard. If one household pays for heat and the other household pays another expense, such as water, a standard that includes the costs of heating and water would be prorated between the households according to a method established by the State agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We propose to provide in revised &sect;273.9(d)(6)(iv) of this rule that the State agency shall prorate any utility standard among all parties incurring an expense covered by the standard or allow actual costs incurred by each party. The State agency would be able to determine the proration method if a standard is prorated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Corrections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are taking this opportunity to correct the reference in the first sentence of 7 CFR 273.12(a)(1)(i) to the joint processing regulations. The correct citation is 7 CFR 273.2(j)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the requirements of section 13971(b)(6) of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, this rule provides that the increase in the excess shelter expense deduction to $231 in the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia ($402 in Alaska, $330 in Hawaii, $280 in Guam, and $171 in the Virgin Islands) will be effective and must be implemented on July 1, 1994; that the increase to $247 in the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia ($249 in Alaska, $353 in Hawaii, $300 in Guam, and $182 in the Virgin Islands) will be effective and must be implemented on October 1, 1995; and that removal of the excess shelter deduction limit will be effective and must be implemented on January 1, 1997. The changes in provisions for the homeless shelter estimate in 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5)(i) will be effective July 1, 1994. State agencies are required to adjust all cases on January 1, 1997 to reflect the deduction for all allowable excess shelter expenses. Restored benefits must be provided to all households whose cases are not adjusted on the required implementation date. Variances resulting from implementation of the final rule would be excluded from quality control consideration for 120 days from the required implementation date in accordance with section 13951 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are proposing that the changes in requirements for standard utility allowances made by this rule be effective and implemented 120 days after publication of the final rule. The affected regulatory sections are: 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5)(ii)(C), 273.9(d)(6), 273.10(d)(3), 273.10(d)(6), and 273.12(a)(1)(i). State agencies would be required to adjust the cases of ongoing households at the next recertification, at household request, or when the case is next reviewed, whichever comes first. Variances resulting from implementation of the provisions of the final rule shall be excluded from error analysis for 120 days from the required implementation date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 273  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Claims, Food stamps, Fraud, Grant programs-social programs, Penalties, Records, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Social security, Students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, 7 CFR Part 273 is proposed to be amended as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

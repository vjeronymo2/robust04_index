			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 22  April on page 39, and Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 22  April on page 5, run the same full page ANC election campaign  ad. The black, green, and gold of the ANC flag covers  two-thirds of the page. A portion of the Northern Cape  Provincial Ballot Slip is reproduced in the center of the flag.  The names of the different parties, their logos, and the  photographs of their leaders are printed in black and white.  The ANC logo and the photograph of ANC leader Nelson Mandela is  printed in color, and next to it is a large voter's checkmark.  Directly above the ballot, in large letters, are the words:  "WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE PEOPLE, THE ANC HAS WON THE RIGHT FOR  ALL SOUTH AFRICANS TO VOTE." Directly below the ballot are the  words: "VOTE ANC ON APRIL 27, AND WIN A BETTER LIFE FOR ALL.  Everything we've worked for over the years comes down to the  choice you make on April 27. A vote for the ANC will put a  government in place that has a workable plan to create jobs, to  ensure 10 years free, quality education for all our children,  and to provide the homes and infrastructure our country needs.  Above all, a vote for the ANC means a government that will take  responsibility for bringing peace and stability to South Africa.  Your vote will win a better life for all. Use it. On April  27, vote ANC." This is followed by the following: "A  better life for all. Working together for jobs, peace and  freedom." The ANC logo is in the bottom right-hand corner  of the ad.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Helmut Egenhardt report: "No Hit: Who Is Supposed To Pay </F> for That?"]    [Text] The Bundesbank expects about 2 trillion German  marks [DM] in debts for the regional authorities (Federal  Government, laender, communities, and supplementary budgets) in  1994. This gigantic mountain of debts is, however, classified  as "acceptable" in various comments, because it is a sum that  amounts to "only" about 67 percent of the annual GNP -- "no fear  of debts," because there exists a high amount of monetary and  fixed assets of private persons (about DM9.5 trillion) and of  companies and the state (about DM6 trillion). However, the  state debts are, by far, not the total debts of the FRG. How  much are they?    For decades, the FRG has engaged in an enormous policy of  incurring debts, above all on the part of the governments. By  1993, a gigantic mountain of debts of about DM6.5 trillion  (after deducting potential double counting) had accumulated.  How did it come about?    The mountain includes the above-mentioned debts of the  state,in particular of the federal government of about DM700  billion, the western German laender of about DM380 billion, and  the communities of about DM150 billion. The supplementary  budgets also had high debts, e.g. the railroads of about DM53  billion and the post of about DM98 billion. The "successful  work" of the Trust Agency has so far added a deficit of about  DM150 billion. Debts of about DM180 billion have been incurred  for the Unity Fund and the Loan Payment Fund. European Recovery  Program loans amount to DM28 billion. For the eastern laender  and the eastern communities, about DM45 billion in debts  developed just over the three years of anschluss policy. This  already adds up to about DM1.8 trillion in state debts for 1993.    In addition, there are debts of companies, self-employed  people, farmers, etc. These debts are considered to be "normal"  in the market economy and are, therefore, mostly excluded from  the overall picture. Quite contrary are the statements on the  former GDR, where all "debts" (including those of the companies)  are always mentioned.    By the third quarter of 1993, the western German banks had  issued leans of about DM4.9 trillion -- DM3.8 trillion to  domestic nonbanks. Of these enormous loans about DM1.8  trillion, for instance, went to companies and DM1.1 trillion to  housing construction. Savings and loan associations issued loans  of DM160 billion and insurance companies about DM450 billion.    This was not enough, however. In the FRG there are also the  so-called commercial loans (debts of companies among each other  without a bank) and acceptance credits, which add up to about  DM700 to DM800 billion. This adds up to the total debts, which  set off the assets.    Even though comparisons with the GDR are currently  officially  taboo -- unless one runs this country down -- it is permissible  to mention the GDR debts. In this, one has to take into account  that in the GDR there were only direct bank loans (no commercial  loans, securities, capital markets). Calculated in German  marks, the loans in the GDR amounted to about DM220 billion in  1989. These were about 70 percent of the GDR GNP -- calculated  in German marks and assessed at relatively low values -- in this  year. In the FRG the proportion of overall domestic debts  compared with the GNP in 1989 was 217 percent. A harsh verdict  in terms of monetary policy!    Regarding the debts of the state (budget including bezirks  and communities), in 1989 the GDR had about DM7 billion in  investment loans for institutions in the cultural-social area,  but basically no current loans. In contrast, the balance sheet  even showed positive sums -- e.g. about DM90 billion from  foreign trade direction coefficients. When, in 1990, loans of  about DM28 billion were raised on the eve of unification, this  was due to the political situation in this year.    In contrast to the FRG, the GDR had about DM20 billion debts  abroad, which were relatively low by international standards but  are mentioned as particularly negative nowadays.    What does this all mean for the citizen? Statistically, in  1989, the overall debts per capita of the inhabitants in the FRG  was about DM75,000 and in the GDR DM13,700. This includes debts  for housing in the FRG of about DM15,000 and in the GDR of about  DM2,800. Particularly important for everyone, however, are the  debts of the state, because they are to be carried by all  citizens: In 1989, they were about DM16,000 per person in the  FRG and about DM3,000 (mid-1990) in the GDR (including foreign  debts, without housing). What was thus contributed to  unification by each side is obvious. If, in 1994, the state  debts are skyrocketing to a total of DM2 trillion, each FRG  citizen will have a share of DM24,700 in it (for a four-person  family: DM99,000). For the sake of justice, at least the FRG  debts incurred until unification should not burden the eastern  citizens (DM16,000).    Beyond the state debts, loans to companies and private  persons in the FRG, for instance, have risen by DM1 trillion to  about DM3 trillion since 1989. One can see that the development  of debts is not primarily due to the anschluss of the GDR, as  politicians like to claim.</p>

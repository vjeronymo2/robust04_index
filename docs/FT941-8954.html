			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Unemployment rise described as 'exceptional' Department of Employment officials yesterday described January's 15,500 rise in the jobless total as 'exceptional' and insisted that the trend in unemployment remained downwards. The seasonally adjusted increase - which took the total to 2.787m - was the first rise since last August. The rate of unemployment was unchanged at 9.9 per cent compared with 10.6 per cent at the same time a year ago. The jobless total is generally expected to rise in January when recruitment is slack. But the size of the increase took statisticians by surprise. Unadjusted, the number of people out of work and claiming benefit rose by 106,572. In spite of the increase, unemployment has fallen on average by 21,500 a month during the past six months. Since January 1993 it has fallen by 204,700. Fewer people left the dole queue last month than at any time since December 1992. The figure was 341,000, which is almost 31,000 fewer than in the same month a year ago. The number of people joining the count, however, has also eased. Last month the seasonally adjusted figure for new people joining the count was 344,100, compared with 388,600 in January last year. All regions, other than the west Midlands and Northern Ireland, saw an increase in unemployment. Nationally, for men, the rise was 13,600 to a rate of 13.4 per cent. Female unemployment rose 1,900 to a rate of 5.3 per cent. Following a quarterly decline, long-term unemployment picked up. Those unemployed for more than one year rose by 11,000 on the previous quarter, compared with a 10,000 fall in the three months to October. Those unemployed for more than six months rose by 23,000 on the quarter, compared with a 94,000 fall in the previous quarter. After three slim monthly increases, manufacturing employment fell. It fell by 11,000 in December to 4.176m compared with 4.19m in December 1992. There were big job losses in coal mining and mineral extraction. A 3,600 fall in vacancies in January nevertheless left the stock of unfilled vacancies at its highest level for three years. During the past three months seasonally adjusted vacancies have risen by an average of 2,500. New vacancies notified to Jobcentres totalled 196,000 in January, down 6,900 from December but higher than in January 1993. The hours of overtime worked in December were 8.96m compared with 8.36m in November, with the biggest increases coming in chemicals and man-made fibre industries. The number of hours lost through short-time working fell after three monthly increases. Final figures for the number of stoppages through industrial action last year were the lowest on record. In 1993 there were 187 stoppages compared with 253 in 1992. Signs that earnings growth has levelled off showed up in official figures released yesterday. In December, average earnings for the whole economy rose an underlying 3 per cent, unchanged now for four consecutive months. Moreover, average earnings growth in services and manufacturing was revised up by 0.25 per cent in November. As a result, manufacturing earnings have been stable at 4.25 per cent for the past four months, while service-sector earnings have edged up from a low of 2.25 per cent in October to 2.5 per cent in both November and December.  --------------------------------------------- UK unemployment  --------------------------------------------- January, seasonally adjusted  --------------------------------------------- A  Northern Ireland          13.5% B  North                     12.0% C  West Midlands             10.4% D  North-west                10.3% E  Wales                     10.0% F  Yorks &amp; Humber            10.0% G  South-east                 9.7% H  Scotland                   9.4% J  South-west                 9.2% K  East Midlands              9.2% L  East Anglia                8.0%    UK                         9.9%  --------------------------------------------- Source: Department of Employment  ---------------------------------------------</p>

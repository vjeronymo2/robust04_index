			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MERCURY S&amp;L IS ACQUIRED BY SECURITY PACIFIC  </P> <P> Security Pacific Corp. said Friday that it has acquired the 24 branches and  some of the assets of Mercury Savings &amp; Loan, the insolvent thrift based in  Huntington Beach that was seized earlier this year by federal regulators.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-based bank holding company paid $44.4 million to acquire $1.4  billion of Mercury's deposits, $330 million of its assets and its offices --  including five branches in Orange County and 12 in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The Resolution Trust Corp. retains $1.2 billion of Mercury's assets, which  consist largely of multiple family residential loans and commercial loans. The  RTC provided Security Pacific with $859 million to cover the difference between  the liabilities and assets it assumed.  </P> <P> RTC spokeswoman Kate Spears said the resolution of Mercury ultimately will cost  the taxpayers $34 million.  </P> <P> Jerry A. Grundhofer, president and chief executive of Security Pacific National  Bank, said the company acquired Mercury because the thrift -- crippled by a  change in federal accounting rules for S&amp;Ls and some bad commercial loans  -- fit well with its existing customer base.  </P> <P> Mercury was taken over by regulators Feb. 23, after a $40-million loss for 1989  drove it into insolvency. It since has been run by RTC.  </P></p>

They are  subject to disease and stress (two of the dolphins at the Waikoloa have already  died), and their life span is considerably shortened due to their captive  environment.  </P> <P> There is nothing educational nor of any scientific merit gained by penning  these intelligent animals in a hotel situation.  </P> <P> MARIS SIDENSTECKER  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Save the Whales  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Some FM Stations Can Boost Signals: The Federal Communications Commission has  approved new rules that will allow thousands of FM stations serving small  communities to double their signal strengths and reach larger audiences. The  commission, in a 3-0 vote, said so-called Class A FM stations could boost their  power from the present limit of 3,000 watts up to 6,000 watts. The commission  also revised the distances by which Class A stations must be separated from  other stations to limit interference. Existing stations that do not meet the  revised separation requirements will be "grandfathered," and will be allowed to  move their antennas or request permission to use directional antennas.  </P></p>

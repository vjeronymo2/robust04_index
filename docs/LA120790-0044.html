			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'ROOKIE': EASTWOOD SERVES UP WARMED-OVER COMPOST  </P> <P> There's a moment early on in "The Rookie" where Clint Eastwood, playing a  grizzled, combative cop named Nick Pulovski, looks over at Sonia Braga and  mutters, "They don't make 'em like that anymore."  </P> <P> The moment could just as easily apply to Eastwood himself. At least that's what  he seems to be banking on here. Who else besides Eastwood freaks would want to  see this bummer? As a cop thriller, "The Rookie" (citywide) is sub-par even by  TV series standards. As a buddy movie -- Eastwood, who also directed, is paired  with Charlie Sheen -- it's one more tired entry in an already terminally  fatigued genre. Even as an Eastwood vehicle -- an appropriate term for a movie  about a cutthroat car-theft ring -- the film is a warmed-over compost.  </P> <P> Except for the lethally enticing Braga and a few of second-unit director Buddy  Van Horn's car-crash set pieces, the film (rated R for violence and strong  language) has almost nothing to recommend it. Unless, of course, your idea of a  good time is watching people being plugged continually between the eyes.  </P> <P> The plot is an excuse to string together as much mayhem as possible. Nick  Pulovski is a direct-action kind of guy, and the movie is molded to his manias.  When his first partner is blown away by the car-theft honchos, Nick's vengeance  is unleashed. His new partner, David Ackerman (Sheen), is, of course,  everything Nick isn't -- polite, well-dressed, thoughtful -- but it turns out  he also harbors his own restless soul (big surprise). David, it turns out, has  a shadowy past, which, in the Eastwood universe, means you were brought up with  money and manners and the ability to read.  </P> <P> The universe also includes the usual pulp polarities. The two cops' excursions  into East Los Angeles are heavy on the Mexican xenophobia; the biker bars and  pit-bull matches might have come out of a Cheech &amp; Chong fever dream.  </P> <P> It comes as a surprise, then, that the leader of the car-theft ring, played by  none other than Raul Julia, is supposed to be German. I'm all for  cross-cultural casting but, despite the best efforts of the dialogue coach,  Julia is about as German as Ruben Blades.  </P> <P> On the surface, what Eastwood does in this film seems hopelessly recidivist,  right down to the "dumb Pole" stereotyping of his own character. Still, you've  got to hand it to him. Making this film's chief villain German seems hopelessly  outdated, but maybe Eastwood is on to something. In the search for  post-glasnost era movie meanies, the Germans could be staging a comeback.  Eastwood, in his Dirty Harry heyday, used to beat up on psychopathic hippies.  Now he's hot for the Huns.  </P> <P> 'The Rookie'  </P> <P> Clint Eastwood: Nick Pulovski  </P> <P> Charlie Sheen: David Ackerman  </P> <P> Raul Julia: Strom  </P> <P> Liesl Sonia: Braga  </P> <P> A Warner Bros. presentation of a Malpaso production.

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): No firing over Japan's smoke? If heads are to roll because of the flop last week of the Japan Tobacco flotation, then Jiro Saito, vice minister of the Ministry of Finance, is vulnerable. Regarded as the ultimate ministry of finance bureaucrat - shrewd and arrogant backed by astuteness and power - Saito is not known for apologising, writes Emiko Terazono. All he has said is that he regrets the way the flotation turned out. However, that may not be enough to mollify Japanese brokers unhappy over its handling at a time when average daily trading volume on the Tokyo stock market remains below 300m shares. With demand for stocks still fragile, they feared that extra supply would depress investor confidence. Saito has also come in for criticism over the method used for pricing the public offering. Rather than going through the 'book building' process used in other leading financial markets, the ministry of finance offered the stock at the mid price of a pre-offer auction. Both Japanese and foreign brokerages felt frustrated; they could see the ministry ignoring their claims that the flaws of the method echoed those in the last year's failed privatisation of the East Japan Railway. Saito says that his ministry would 'humbly listen to opinions from the outside' about future privatisations. This sort of statement may be enough to curb calls for his head. But if UK and North American investors had seen the value of their investment drop by 23.5 per cent in its first day's trading, they would not have let the man from the ministry get off so lightly.</p>

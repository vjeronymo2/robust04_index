			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "The Confederation of Trade Unions Will </F> Remain Apolitical"]    [Text] Bratislava--At a regular meeting in Bratislava  yesterday, participants in the Assembly of the Confederation of  Trade Unions (KOZ) dealt with labor safety and health protection  issues, the development of employment, and the implementation of  an active employment policy. They discussed a proposal  concerning KOZ's involvement in the election campaign and  internal trade union issues.    According to the trade unionists, the level of employment  has  declined, in particular, in the branches of agriculture,  industry, and construction. In their opinion, not a single  government has adequately addressed this problem. No  comprehensive concept has been drafted, and no basic direction  of policy has been determined. It is therefore necessary to  carry out a consistent analysis of the labor market and the  effectiveness of financial resources spent [on employment  policy]. As far as the management of state administration is  concerned, the trade unionists regard as the best solution the  management of labor offices and the regional Employment Fund  bodies from a single center.    The participants in the assembly noted that KOZ will become  involved in the elections only through individual trade unions  and will not give support to any political party. They asked  KOZ president Alojz Englis to communicate to the prime minister  of the Slovak Republic the trade unionists' dissatisfaction with  the speech made by Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Julius  Brocka at the Sixth Conference on Trade Union Cooperation in  Europe.</p>

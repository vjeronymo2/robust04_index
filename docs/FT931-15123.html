			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Dudley Jenkins up 51% at Pounds 383,000 Dudley Jenkins Group, the USM-quoted mailing list broker and supplier of services to users of direct mail, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 383,000 for the half year ended October 31. That was an improvement of 51 per cent over last time's Pounds 254,000 and came on the back of a 9.5 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 5.18m. However, the interim dividend is trimmed from 1.35p to 1p. Earnings per share amounted to 2.71p (2.54p). In considering the dividend, the directors said they also considered the enlarged number of shares now in issue - 9.04m at the period end against 6.06m. In their view, 'it would be imprudent to follow a progressive dividend policy, resulting in a continued uncovered dividend'. For the last full year to end-April the group paid a total dividend of 4p which was uncovered by earnings of 3.9p per share.</p>

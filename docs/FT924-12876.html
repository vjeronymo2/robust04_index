			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Japan close to foreign policy reform JAPAN'S foreign ministry is finalising details for overhauling its foreign policy-making to allow a swifter response to crises and to introduce a more strategic approach to foreign policy. The ministry expects that by the end of the year it will complete plans to create a policy co-ordination bureau which could become the most powerful centre for foreign policy-making in Japan as the country seeks a wider political role to match its international economic power. Traditionally, Japanese foreign policy has closely followed that of the US. The bureau, which will start work next summer, is likely to be headed by a senior deputy vice-minister. It is thought the bureau's head would automatically become a leading candidate to become the next vice-minister, the most powerful official at the ministry. Officials at the Foreign Ministry acknowledge that Japan's foreign policy has often been too reactive on broad issues and yet too slow-moving in crises because of the time it takes to establish a policy consensus. This is partly because the ministry has lacked an effective mechanism to co-ordinate its own often competing and conflicting bureaux which are housed in cramped offices along the labyrinthine corridors of the ministry's building near the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. This weakness was particularly exposed during the fast-moving events which led up to the Gulf war, when Japan found it difficult to respond quickly to allied calls for greater contributions to the allied military effort. A senior US diplomat closely involved with those efforts explained: 'There were people whose apparent job was to co-ordinate Japanese policy but it was difficult to find someone who was doing it effectively.' The foreign minister's secretariat, which is nominally responsible for policy co-ordination, is mainly involved in the routine administration of finances, personnel, upkeep of embassies and despatching telexes.</p>

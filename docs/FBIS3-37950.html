			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As is known, the third round of Abkhaz-Georgian  talks is under way in Geneva. A statement made by the Georgian  delegation at the talks says in particular:    Georgia is in a worse situation at the start of the third  round of talks on the large-scale settlement of the Abkhazian  conflict than it was during the second. Thousands of civilians  in Gali Rayon have been driven out of the region. Hundreds of  houses have been burned down. Hundreds of people have been  killed, frozen, or injured. Representatives of the Gudauta  regime made absurd statements at the Moscow talks of experts on  Abkhazia's political statute within Georgia, thus making  ineffective all efforts made by the group of experts to  accomplish their task constructively.    Having seen that Russian-Georgian relations are turning to a  new stage and that this will result in the stabilization of the  situation in the whole Caucasian region, Gudauta separatists did  everything they could to prevent the signing of the treaty on  friendship, good-neighborliness, and cooperation between Russia  and Georgia. The moment the treaty was signed and was welcomed  by the whole world, Abkhaz armed gangs, together with  mercenaries, launched a large-scale operation on driving the  remaining Georgian families out of Gali Rayon. On the very day  -- on 3 February 1994 when the Russian-Georgian treaty was  signed -- Abkhaz forces armed with heavy equipment burned down a  number of villages in Gali Rayon. It should be emphasized that  the Gudauta authorities did not allow representatives of the UN  mission in Sukhumi to enter the area of punitive operations.    This convinces us that realizing that the state of affairs  is  driving toward the unconditional elimination of the regime and  that they will not be able to prove the logical concept of the  separatist and fascist regime they had established against the  territorial integrity of Georgia, the Gudauta authorities are  using the policy of a completed fact.    Will this challenge to, not only Georgia but also the whole  world community continue? How many resolutions should be taken  by the UN Security Council to convince the Gudauta separatists  to rethink themselves.    We highly appreciate efforts taken by Edouard Brunner, the  UN  secretary general's personal envoy. It was due to his efforts  that a certain success was reached at the talks. A constructive  policy by the Russian delegation was also positive during the  drafting of important documents. But the time has come for more  vigorous activity.    We appeal to the United Nations Organization to seek  effective means to end the suffering of hundreds of thousands of  people. The Gali events convinced us that all negotiations are  only used as screens by the Gudauta regime. We cannot  participate in this sort of development. This would encourage  Abkhaz separatism. Every negotiation should be based on trust,  but this very trust and hope of the Abkhazian side's goodwill  has been eliminated. The development of events demonstrates  that Abkhaz separatists respect and recognize only the language  of force.</p>

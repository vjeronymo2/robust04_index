			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Warning clips FNFC shares FIRST NATIONAL Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group, said yesterday that it expected losses in its commercial lending division to be 'somewhat higher' for the 12 months to October 31 than for the previous year. The shares reacted via an 11p fall to 75p. Last time the commercial lending bank activity, FNCB, incurred a deficit of Pounds 19m. For the year just ended a loss of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m is expected. The extent of the losses is seen as the result of continuing difficulties in the property market. Along with the appointment of a new executive vice-chairman FNFC also announced that it had decided to underline the statement that accompanied its first half results in July that 'further substantial provisions and losses' were expected in its commercial lending division and discontinued activities. There had been concern within the company that the scale of the losses had not been fully appreciated by analysts. Mr Tim Ingram, finance director, said the 'clarification' of the earlier statement had no implications for FNFC's ability to fulfil the terms of the refinancing deal agreed in July for its Pounds 1.1bn debt owed to 107 international banks, and through which it narrowly avoided collapse. The results for the year to October 31 1993 are due to be announced in January. See People</p>

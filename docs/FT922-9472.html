			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Leaseholders to be given right to buy - Lease Reform THE GOVERNMENT is proposing to give many of Britain's 1.5m long-leaseholders of flats the right to buy a share in the freehold of their building. The proposal, to be included in a Housing, Land and Urban Development Bill, will end the centuries old system by which much of the country's property reverts to the original landlord once the lease expires. Flat-owners in blocks will get the right to buy their freehold at market value, provided two-thirds of householders in the block vote in favour. The buyers will become the joint freeholders for any tenants or leaseholders who do not participate. The right will only apply to properties where not more than 10 per cent of the floorspace, excluding common parts, such as staircases, is used for non-residential purposes. At least two-thirds of the flats must be held by long-leaseholders, those whose original lease was for more than 21 years. Crown property and charitable trust housing already let at a discount will be exempt, as will converted flats in houses where the landlord is resident. Flat-owners in blocks which do not qualify will get the right to extend their leases, at market price. The Bill does not include proposals to introduce a new system of common ownership or 'commonhold' of blocks of flats for new developments.</p>

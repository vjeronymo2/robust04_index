			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Santoyo from Chiapas for the "ACIR Radio </F> News" newscast -- live]    [Excerpt] [Announcer] Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner  for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas; Samuel Ruiz, bishop of  San Cristobal de las Casas; and members of the EZLN [Zapatist  National Liberation Army] general staff issued a joint  communique stating that consultations with the EZLN rank and  file are continuing in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, the  results of which will be disclosed in coming days. Here is Juan  Santoyo with a report:    [Santoyo] Good afternoon. No major announcements followed  the second meeting with Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis,  mediator Samuel Ruiz, and the 10 members of the EZLN general  staff. The parties merely pledged that they will make new  contacts in upcoming weeks and that the EZLN will, in the coming  days, comply with the 36 points agreed upon in San Cristobal de  las Casas. At the meeting held in nearby Guadalupe Tepeyac,  Monsignor Ruiz said the EZLN has resumed consultations for peace  negotiations. Msgr. Ruiz also expressed concern over recent  events that at any moment could hinder the peace process. He  emphasized, however, that major difficulties have been overcome  and current conditions are very different. Ruiz also referred  to Camacho Solis' statements during the meeting with the EZLN.    [Begin Ruiz recording] Peace Commissioner Camacho Solis  referred to progress in the EZLN's compliance with the San  Cristobal commitments. He said the conditions are right for  prompt compliance with those commitments. The key issue at  hand, he added, is peace negotiations in Chiapas that restore  tranquillity nationwide. The parties agreed to maintain contact  in the coming weeks. [end recording]    [Santoyo] Following these comments on Camacho's meeting with  the EZLN, Ruiz reiterated that the parties have agreed to meet  again but gave no specific date. Camacho Solis, who was also  asked about the meeting, said it took place at a location chosen  by the EZLN near Guadalupe Tepeyac and that it lasted over six  hours.    [Begin Camacho recording] The meeting was attended by 10  representatives of the EZLN, and they also kept the area under  very tight surveillance. Before the meeting, EZLN followers and  ordinary citizens demonstrated to voice their views and  political demands. Subcommander Marcos also attended the  meeting. [end recording]    [Santoyo] Reports added that some residents of San Cristobal  de las Casas, who were listening to Camacho Solis and Msgr.  Ruiz, were somewhat disappointed because they thought more  concrete agreements had been reached. Many residents expected  to hear that a specific date had been set to sign a peace  agreement.    [Announcer] Although no specific dates were set, this  meeting  with the EZLN in the Lacandon jungle was significant. For one  thing, Camacho Solis stated that this consultation process among  all the EZLN members in the area may set the stage for another  meeting and a continuation of the peace dialogue. This  opportunity is likely to arise once EZLN discussions on  proposals and counterproposals to petitions made in the first  phase of the peace talks conclude.    [Santoyo] Yes, those are the prospects, but we must also  raise a point made by the EZLN members themselves. It is true  that they have currently resumed their consultations, but they  are also asking the entire country, including all peasant and  social organizations, to conduct surveys on the 36 points agreed  upon in San Cristobal de las Casas. The EZLN seeks to include  those surveys in the second phase of the peace dialogue and use  them to draft their response to the 36-point San Cristobal  agreement. Many observers are following this situation very  closely, basically because it constitutes an effort by the EZLN  to make their internal consultations a national matter, which  could cause some delay.    The EZLN is expected to give a definitive answer to the 36  points in the coming days -- whether it agrees or disagrees --  and at that juncture set a date for the second phase. In  addition, rumors have mushroomed here in San Cristobal since  Msgr. Ruiz revealed a few days ago that he had plans to travel  to Rome. When asked about this trip, his closest associates  said they were awaiting a definitive answer following the  meeting with the EZLN to know whether Msgr. Ruiz will leave  tomorrow for Rome to meet with top leaders of the Catholic  Church as well as to discuss the Chiapas situation. Msgr. Ruiz'  trip to Rome has not been confirmed yet, but rumors are strong.  Some say Msgr. Ruiz might return from Rome in 15 days when an  answer is likely to be ready and the date for a second talk set.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PHYSICIAN'S TRIBUTE TO AN UNCOMMON BRAVERY  </P> <P> On behalf of the UCI Clinical Cancer Center faculty and staff, I would like to  express our sincere appreciation for your tribute to Maria Flores.  </P> <P> Medical professionals and care givers face the difficult burden of losing  terminally ill patients continually; yet when confronted by the loss of a  courageous patient -- particularly a young child -- the strain is all the more  profound.  </P> <P> Your acknowledgement of Maria's uncommon bravery and attitude was a great  comfort to her family, friends, and care givers. Indeed, they will treasure  both the June article and September memorial tribute.  </P> <P> Thank you again for your sensitivity and understanding.  </P> <P> FRANK K. MEYSKENS JR., MD, FACP,  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

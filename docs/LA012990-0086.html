			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: HARPER TAKES ON CITY HALL -- FROM THE INSIDE  </P> <P> What a good idea for a series.  </P> <P> Years of TV and newspaper headlines have confirmed our suspicion that,  generically speaking, something funny is going on inside City Hall.  </P> <P> Hence "City," a promising CBS comedy that, in targeting the menace of  bureaucracy, locates some of the humor lurking within the wider tragedies  besetting many of America's metropolises.  </P> <P> It premieres at 8:30 tonight on Channels 2 and 8.  </P> <P> What James Coco and a fleeting CBS comedy called "Calucci's Department" wittily  articulated about institutionalized denseness at a New York state unemployment  office in 1973, Valerie Harper and "City" now apply to local government, with  mixed results.  </P> <P> Harper is bright, idealistic city manager Liz Gianni, faced on the home front  by an independent 19-year-old daughter (LuAnne Ponce), and on the work front by  destructive city politics and a chaotic, eclectic staff, led by her assistant,  Roger (Todd Sussman), who lip reads her conversations through the glass of her  private office.  </P> <P> Tonight, co-executive producer Paul Haggis' script has Liz being undermined by  the mayor's office when she attempts to resolve the embarrassing problem of  caskets sliding out of a cemetery on a hill into people's homes. It's a clever  premise with lots of potential for dark humor, some of which is realized. On  the other hand, the mother-daughter relationship doesn't work at all and is  expendable.  </P> <P> Roger and some of his colleagues are overdrawn, and Liz is too sweet and  vulnerable to be totally believed as a city manager, even for laughs. "For a  person who runs an entire city," her daughter observes, "you're a very gullible  person." Exactly.  </P> <P> Harper, however, is so likable and skilled at TV comedy, and some of this  opening episode is such a kick, that optimism prevails. For now at least, city  lights shine somewhat brightly.  </P></p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / MCC pensioners may have no claim on missing money PENSIONERS of Maxwell Communication Corporation, one of the public companies of the late Mr Robert Maxwell, may have no claim on the company to make good money missing from the pension fund, Price Waterhouse, MCC administrator, said last night. According to legal advice, Price Waterhouse is obliged to prefer the highest bid for an MCC subsidiary over one that offered to repair the pension fund, the accountancy firm said. Price Waterhouse, which is soliciting bids for at least four MCC subsidiaries, added it had 'a duty to Maxwell Communication Corporation's creditors but not to its pensioners'. Law Debenture Trust Corporation, the firm appointed trustee of the MCC pension fund, is attempting to estimate how much of the fund was raided - along with pension funds of some other Maxwell companies - to support the late Mr Robert Maxwell's tottering private companies. Some interested bidders had proposed to compensate the pensions of employees they considered essential to the businesses. Price Waterhouse is seeking bids for Nimbus, the compact disc maker, Panini, the Italian sports sticker printer, and Maxwell Business Communications Group, a magazine and exhibition publisher. It has just closed its requests for bids for MacDonald, the UK book publisher. Some of the pension funds, including Nimbus's, were kept separate and are intact. MacDonald, which had turnover last year of Pounds 25m, owed its parent Pounds 33m at the beginning of 1992. Twelve offers had been received for at least some of MacDonald's imprints but only two proposed to take over the company and its staff. One of its main authors, horror writer Mr Stephen King, had threatened to begin proceedings to wind up the company, before its directors requested that it be put into administration. Mr David Lee, the Price Waterhouse partner heading the investigation into the disappearance of about Pounds 500m of MCC's assets, said last night he had not yet asked to interview MCC directors and officers, but would do so. The firm said it expected to have a 'broad brush' picture of the position of MCC's creditors by autumn this year. Conrad Black interest, Page 20</p>

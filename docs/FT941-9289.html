			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (10): Unique challenge of the Olympics - Skiing / The special appeal of the Games is in the drama of a make-or-break occasion Many well-known sports correspondents would rather be anywhere than at a Winter Olympics. It is not just that Torvill and Dean ice dancing to Let's Face the Music and Dance offends macho definitions of sport, although that often comes into it. Not even that competition is so often judgmental or clock-based, lacking the head-to-head drama of, say, a 100 metres sprint. Most of the major TV sports are ball-based yet the nearest anyone will get to a ball at Lillehammer is an ice-hockey puck. The prime enjoyment of winter sport has to be based on its ethereal nature, and no part of the world knows this better than Scandinavia, where worship has for so long attended the weather gods. Outdoor ice and snow are fickle, elemental products which, when the weather curtain parts and the sun begins to shine, offer a backdrop which can be pure enchantment. That much can apply equally to season-long World Cup events as to Winter Olympics. The special appeal of the Games is in the drama of a make-or-break occasion. It is the reason why CBS spent Dollars 300m on the broadcast rights and another Dollars 75m in production expenses. Moreover the commercial, advertising-oriented research of US television identifies another interesting fact: more women watch than men. Of the 184m who swept the ratings on the 16 nights of the Albertville Games coverage, 57 per cent were women. At the height of the women's ice skating final, 28 per cent of American households were tuned in, while the men's downhill peaked at 25.4 per cent. Little wonder that a charismatic Olympic champion such as Jean-Claude Killy, Franz Klammer or Alberto Tomba can become a legend in his own time. The first of the heroes made by television was Austria's Toni Sailer at Cortina d'Ampezzo in the black-and-white days of 1956. It was not just that the 20-year-old Kitzbueheler became the first man to win three Alpine ski gold medals, or that he was handsome enough subsequently to attempt a film career. In truth, he was an unknown who won by unprecedented margins. In his first race, the giant slalom, it was by as much as 6.2 seconds, representing about 70 yards. Next, Sailer won the slalom four seconds ahead of Chiharu Igaya, winning Japan's first Winter Olympic medal. Then, just before the start of the downhill, he broke a leather binding strap. Borrowing another from a companion, he threaded it just in time to be in the starting gate. Ten of the first 24 failed to finish in a temperature of minus 22C but although Sailer nearly fell when exiting into a bitter wind from some woods, he went on to win by 3.5 seconds. It is usually overlooked that another skier, Sixten Jernberg of Sweden, actually won four medals at these Games. He won a gold in the 50 kilometres 'marathon', plus two silvers and one bronze. But Sailer's feat finally settled Alpine skiing, so long decried as unmanly by the Nordic countries, as the most widespread and popular of ski disciplines. Not even Stein Eriksen's 1952 Oslo performance of giant slalom gold, and slalom silver, before his own crowd, had quite done that. The Nordic bias was so strong that organisers printed only 11,000 tickets for the slalom and another 15,000 watched without paying. Lillehammer is hardly likely to make that mistake: the final day's slalom involves Italy's Alberto Tomba seeking slalom gold, uniquely, at his third Olympics, if he has not already succeeded in the giant slalom. By then all Norway will be hoping that Kjetil-Andre Aamodt or one of a phalanx of young Norwegian Alpine skiers will be denying him the prize. That is how much things have changed. The inauguration of the Alpine ski World Cup in 1967 linked big races for a season-long grand prix for the first time. It created a more coherent platform for the sport and enabled the growing armies of holiday skiers to see, learn and be entertained via TV. But neither the World Cup nor the International Ski Federation's own World Championships, first run by the British at Muerren in 1931, overshadowed the 1968 Grenoble Winter Olympics and Jean-Claude Killy's feat in matching Sailer with triple gold. The two performances are not easy to compare. Specialism was emerging. So was professionalism. And so was increased sophistication in the equipment industry, which could deliver certain advantages to teams or individuals at given times. Killy had some advanced wet-wrap skis involving a kind of mummifying process offering different properties over the ski length. A soft tip and hard tail gave him just the instrument he needed for his 'avalement,' a technique where he appeared to sit back further on his skis and jet out of his turns. Killy's triple gold came at a convenient point for third-generation, purpose-built resorts springing up from Geneva down to the Mediterranean. Killy, cold-shouldering Avery Brundage and the Olympic movement's dying amateur throes, sold his picture to Paris Match, created a clothes empire he has bought, sold and rebought, and marketed his lean good looks so successfully that Albertville had need of him as organising president of its 1992 Games. Even today, the average American asked to name a world skier would probably answer first: 'Jean-Claude Killy.' Women skiers have not found equivalent fame, although it is a sport with up to 40 per cent female participation, with all the influence that represents in travel, holiday and sartorial terms. Nancy Greene of Canada won the 1968 giant slalom gold and slalom silver, and France's Marielle Goitschel and Switzerland's Marie-Therese Nadig all acquired gold. But the major presence of the 1970s, Austria's Annemarie Moser-Proell, had to retire and return before attaining her first Olympic gold in the 1980 Lake Placid downhill. Rosi Mittermaier of Germany was a charming winner of two golds and a silver at Innsbruck in 1976. But her fame never came close to that of Franz Klammer, whose epic run was widely acknowledged as the downhill performance of all time. In the Austria of the time you could lose any race except the downhill. And here was the man from Bad Kleinkirchheim, winner of 19 World Cup races out of 23 in his prime, required to justify Austria's pride on home snow. In a fever of excitement, Switzerland's Bernhard Russi, the reigning champion from the 1972 Sapporo Olympics, set the target for Klammer, going 15th. The intermediate time winked up - Klammer was only third. Then, on the last third of the course, Klammer seemed to defy both gravity and all known technique. Arms whirling, legs pumping, off the snow as much as he was on it, he was under the finishing banner a mere sliver - 0.33 seconds - quicker than Russi. A new legend was born. Since then, an army of Swiss have come and gone with Pirmin Zurbriggen and Peter Mueller lingering in the memory. Italy's Gustavo Thoeni; Sweden's unexcelled slalom master, Ingemar Stenmark; and the Austrian-born Marc Girardelli have filled columns of World Cup record books. Thoeni, though, managed only one Olympic gold - in the giant slalom in 1972. Stenmark finally made his mark with two golds at Lake Placid in 1980, and Girardelli has probably his last chance of one at Lillehammer. Hard as everyone tries to resist the idea that World Cup matters more than Olympic glory, the truth is different. Individual champions may come and go. How many outside a small circle will remember Heini Hemmi's giant slalom gold for Switzerland in 1976, or Barbara Cochran's slalom for the US in 1972? But for the master class the challenge remains. The unique pressure of an Olympics must be overcome, before the world beyond skiing's specialist limits bestows the highest accolade. The author has covered every Winter Olympic Games since 1964 THE NAMES TO WATCH Downhill skiing may be the most glamorous Alpine event but it traditionally had little following in Norway. A young Norwegian named Kjetil-Andre Aamodt changed all that. His scintillating form in the World Cup, at No 1 for most of this season, puts him in line for a medal at Lillehammer. Despite being a World Cup star for week after week, Luxembourg's own Marc Girardelli has never won Olympic honours. This is probably his last chance. No one will be watched more closely than the Italian legend Alberto Tomba, in the slalom. A third consecutive gold medal for Tomba would be a record. Knowledgeable ski-watchers say, however, that 1994 must be the year of Patrick Ortlieb, Austria's most famous skier since the days of Franz Klammer. The tragic accident of Garmisch-Partenkirchen two weeks ago robbed women's skiing of a potential Lillehammer medallist. Ulrike Maier had been in Austria's World Cup squad since 1985. Supporters of Pirnella Wiberg, the Swedish girl currently lying second in the World Cup, will not have far to travel to support their best medal prospect. Canada's world champion, Kate Pace, is highly rated. And Germany's Katza Feizinger is the women's downhill favourite.</p>

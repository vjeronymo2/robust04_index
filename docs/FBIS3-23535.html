			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Col A. Petrov under the rubric "The People's </F> Army": "Why the Democrats Fear the Army"]    [Text]  <H5>  Serve the Fatherland! </H5>   Television and the press are again vigorously raking the  Army  over the coals. This time for supporting Zhirinovskiy in the  election. We already know that the "free, democratic press" does  nothing without first clearing its actions with a certain center  for the coordination of propaganda campaigns.    Why have certain sages among the democrats suddenly begun  devoting so much attention to the army? Is it not because recent  events have shown that democracy still lacks the strength to  make a statement in internal affairs and some people are afraid  it will make a statement on its own? Fear for their own skins  put all the "zealots for the people" into a state of panic  following the election.    Having despicably forced the Army to take part in the  October  bloodshed, the timeservers decided that they could treat the  army like a prostitute. But no, despite the participation by  several units and formations in the unconstitutional putsch, the  mood in the army as a whole did not become one of greater  loyalty to the regime. On the contrary, there was a hatred in  the Army for those who provoked it to commit bloodshed!    When speaking of the Army, it is impossible not to mention  the participation of fightingmen in the execution of the legal  authorities, a matter painful to the heart of every honorable  officer and enlisted man. I am not in a position to make a legal  assessment of the crime. This must be done at the official,  state level by experienced legal experts. As an officer I am  merely trying to understand the moral and ethical motivation of  those who were forced (just that, forced--with the exception of  a few scoundrels) to carry out the unconstitutional orders.    What was the core around which the entire life and the  career  of the Russian, a Russian officer, was based, structured and  transpired? It was certainly not his earnings. There has never  been a time in the history of Russia or the USSR when an officer  received very high pay rates. Read the memoirs of the old  Russian generals and other officers. Within our memory, in the  "stagnant" past, the officer's pay was comparable to that of a  skilled worker. And any merchant today receives many times the  earnings of an officer. Furthermore, the former does not remain  on duty day and night at a range, does not operate in a state of  constant nervous tension in a missile silo or on a submarine or  a missile-carrier, does not run forth in the face of bullets  somewhere in Central Asia or the Transcaucasus. This means that  it is not material benefit which has screened these people but a  strength commensurate with the difficulties and dangers. Russian  historian L.N. Gumilev defined it as "zeal."    As applied to the officer, it is a desire to realize his  vital aspirations in the military, in service to the state and  the people. It was precisely an orientation toward the state  which constituted the dominant imperative in the shaping of the  officers' world outlook. Beginning at the end of the '80s,  however, this core first lost its stability and then, with the  collapse of the Union, became an ephemeral element. The most  unstable, career-minded, essentially marginal portion of the  officer corps set out on a course openly betraying their duty,  the army and the state. One need only to recall the exposure of  commercial activities being engaged in by higher command  personnel in the Western Group of Forces, in certain fleets, in  the aviation and the districts.    I feel that this development has had an extremely  demoralizing effect upon the army, possibly even greater than  when the Gorbachev government betrayed the army in Tbilisi and  Vilnius; greater than the dirty, vile campaign in which  democratized elements in the mass media accused the army of all  the sins of the universe.    The force of cultivated traditions is so great, however,  that  even in today's extremely difficult circumstances the large part  of the officer corps continue conscientiously to bear their  cross.    It was precisely the reflexive force of discipline which  forced most of those officers who entered Moscow bearing weapons  to submit to the unconstitutional orders, since the orders  emanated from those groups to which the army is subordinate, the  state leadership. Habit is second nature.    The fact that the introduction of troops into Moscow was  effected with typically authoritarian methods also played a  role. General Kondratyev, deputy defense minister, issued orders  directly to the commanders of the 2nd and 4th divisions and the  27th brigade (I deliberately and for perfectly understandable  reasons omit the word "Guards" in their names). Furthermore,  commanders at all levels were forbidden to give any information  to staff members of the district, which was not informed of the  introduction of subordinate troops into Moscow. The ban was  lifted only after the defenders of the parliament were  suppressed. How do you like that? The leadership of the Ministry  of Defense does not even trust the district command element and  its staff! We can see that fear predominates in the sentiments  of the upper level even there. Fear forced the Ministry of  Security to be destroyed, but since the Army cannot be treated  that way, we should anticipate some personnel changes in the  leadership of the Ministry of Defense and the districts,  primarily the Moscow district.    With respect to the prestige of leaders of the state and the  Army in the military, its value is vanishingly small, as the  mathematicians say. The October events turned against Yeltsin  even those few officers who still harbored certain illusions  about him. The most unfortunate thing is the fact that none of  the prominent military leaders, either of the present or from  the past, enjoys absolute or even predominant prestige among the  officers.    And so, the following conclusions can be drawn:    that the Army as a special institution of the state is  presently incapable of performing its main function, with the  exception of the nuclear forces;    that the Army is still capable of exerting a major influence  upon the outcome of events inside the country; and that its role  can be either fatal or rejuvenating;    that the Army in the person of its officer corps absolutely  rejects the present regime;    that the Army is not yet a unified, unequivocally  like-minded  organism; it has not acquired a leader, and this is a major  destabilizing factor.    One can predict events to come. There is no doubt that a  narrow group of rulers will continue to implement "their" plan  for subordinating the nation to the West, no matter what the  cost. Resistance in the people to this course is great and  continues to grow. Support for the regime will be sought in  so-called power structures. The Ministry of Security was  destroyed, and for some time these agencies will not have the  capacity seriously to influence the situation. The army's  antipathy toward the regime is indisputable, but the inertia of  subordination is still great. Only the MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] is capable of providing support, a fact demonstrated by  past events. It is with good reason that this ministry's  strength is presently being vigorously built up. More than 20  percent of the draftees within the MVO [Moscow Military  District] are destined for the MVD. This is an unprecedented  figure.    Considering the inconsistent position taken by the Army (not  to be confused with the leadership of the Ministry of Defense),  state-minded, patriotic forces, organizations and leaders should  interact more closely with the officer corps. In no case should  we repeat the errors of the past, when it was taken for granted  that the army would refuse to employ weapons, and based on those  groundless hopes almost no work was performed with it. The fuss  raised by certain officer organizations found the bulk of the  officer corps indifferent. The main stress in working with the  army should be on appealing to its state-oriented, patriotic  instinct. The origins of most officers in the people and their  basic linkage with the people should be stressed to the  maximum--not an abstract but a concrete people gasping from the  current difficulties but still supporting the army which  betrayed it in October of '93. We need to promote constantly,  persistently and purposefully the concept that a Russian, a  Russian officer, if he is a real officer, is incapable of  lifting a hand against a compatriot or against legal authority.</p>

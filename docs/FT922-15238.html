			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: SKF plans SKr935m debenture issue SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, is planning a convertible debenture issue aimed at international investors. The deal could raise as much as SKr935m (Dollars 156.3m) at SKF's current share price, The issue will correspond to up to 8.5m shares, and shareholders can either convert the issue into equity - in this case into unrestricted series B shares - or be repaid. SKF said the convertible debenture was intended to refinance some of its debt. The company increased its debt by about SKr2bn when it acquired part of Ovako, a specialty steel producer with plants in Sweden and Finland. The issue will also be used to pay off some of SKF's short-term debt. The issue, which requires approval from this month's annual meeting, will be directed at the international capital markets, and will be in a foreign currency. SKF reports interest among international investors in non-share investments. The group said it would waive existing shareholders' preferential subscription rights in favour of international investors. This would allow it 'to raise a more favourable long-term financing than otherwise'. Foreign investors already own between 16 and 18 per cent of the group's share capital. SKF is listed in London, Zurich, Geneva, Basle, Paris and on Nasdaq in the US.</p>

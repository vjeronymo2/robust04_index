			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Boeing opens technical research centre in Moscow BOEING, the world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, yesterday opened a technical research centre in Moscow, reflecting the growing trend of collaboration between Russian and western aerospace groups. The Boeing centre follows a year of planning with leaders of the Russian commercial aerospace industry. It is equipped with computer facilities for use by Russian research engineers and scientists who will work under contract to Boeing. Boeing said the centre's initial projects would include research into aerodynamics, special alloys and the impact of sub-zero weather on aircraft fuel systems. If research projects proved fruitful, there would be benefits to current and future civil aircraft programmes including studies on a 600-800 seater super jumbo airliner and a new generation of supersonic aircraft. Boeing is already studying development of a super jumbo with the four European partners in the Airbus programme, including British Aerospace, Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace and Casa of Spain. All the partners have already indicated they would be interested in extending their collaboration to other manufacturers, including Russian aerospace groups. Boeing has been anxious to exploit the long-term potential of the commercial aircraft market in the Commonwealth of Independent States and Russia's well-established research and scientific expertise. For their part, Russian manufacturers have been keen to forge close links with western companies to secure new sources of hard currency funding and access to western markets. Boeing, which has already supplied 737 twin engine airliners to CIS airlines, expects domestic traffic in the CIS to grow by around 3 per cent a year between now and 2010, while international traffic to and from the CIS is forecast to grow annually by 5 per cent. Over the next 16 years, Boeing expects demand for 1,300 new aircraft for domestic use in the CIS and a further 250 aircraft for international use, worth a total of Dollars 55bn (Pounds 36.4bn) at current dollar values.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: French yield spread narrows to new low at long end THE FRENCH government bond market continued to rally yesterday, closing the yield spread over Germany still further. The 10-year yield spread moved down to an all-time low of 23 basis points over the comparable German bond, down from 27 basis points previously. Comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, to the effect that France could happily accommodate lower interest rates were compounded by positive comments from Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister. He said the franc was 'running like a dream'. He foresaw further German rate cuts and said French interest rates could settle well below German levels and close to Dutch and Belgian rates. Financial analysts said bond prices were driven by the stronger franc, which in turn responded to confidence in the French economy compared with the German economy. Mr Kit Juckes, an economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, said: 'The maturity at which French rates are moving below German rates is drifting along the yield curve.' June futures on the Matif rose 42 points to 117.72 on heavy turnover and continued to move higher in after-hours trading. RELIEF over the success of the latest DM3bn Treuhand bond issue and speculation that the Bundesbank might announce a slightly lower repo rate today prompted a recovery in the German government bond market. The September bund futures contract opened at 94.12 and rose 0.22 to 94.34 on hope that the repo rate, which has remained at 7.6 per cent for the past month, will edge downwards. Economists believe that the relatively high liquidity of the commercial banks will give the Bundesbank leeway to ease. SPANISH government bonds continued their post-election rally with strong buying interest - notably from foreign investors - concentrated on the longer maturity bonds. Dealers said yields fell across the curve following Sunday's election victory by the Socialists. They said the strength of the peseta would provide room for further interest rate cuts. The 13.45 per cent bond due 1996 rose from 107.35 to 107.65, while the 10.90 per cent bond due 2003 rose from 98.05 to 98.75. THE ITALIAN government bond market gained on hopes that an interest rate cut in Germany would pave the way for further easing in Italy. The September Liffe futures contract was propelled to a high of 100.10, up from its recent 99.65-99.75 trading range. IN the UK, gilts traded in a tight range but closed steady as the Bank of England announced that its three most recent issues had been taken up. The Bank said a tranche of 7 1/4 per cent Treasury stock due 1998, an issue of 9 3/4 per cent stock due 2002, and a tranche of 9 per cent Treasury stock due 2012, each worth Pounds 200m, were also sold out yesterday. The September long gilt futures opened at 103.24, slipped 7 basis points, and then recovered to close at 103.23. JAPANESE government bond prices were driven higher by the strength of the Yen, which reached an all-time high against the dollar in overseas trading. The rises pushed the yield of the benchmark No 145 JGB down from Tokyo's close of 4.525 per cent to 4.505 per cent in London trading. US Treasury prices fell at the long end of the maturity range as dealers and investors traded cautiously ahead of inflation news. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/2 at 102 5/8 , yielding 6.912 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was only slightly weaker, down  1/32 at 99 5/8 , to yield 4.308 per cent. The market's attention remained fixed on the inflation picture, which should become clearer on Friday when the May producer prices index is released. Analysts said they were expecting an increase of no more than 0.2 per cent in the PPI.</p>

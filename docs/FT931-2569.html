			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / German rate cut fails to lift European markets THE Bundesbank yesterday cut one of its key interest rates in a move that was welcomed by German industry and politicians as an appropriate step to help the economy out of recession. However, the decision by the Bundesbank's policymaking council to cut its discount rate by  1/2 percentage point to 7.5 per cent, received a lukewarm response in financial markets across Europe. The French franc came under strong selling pressure inside the European exchange rate mechanism last night, as investors felt that the cut in rates had failed to reduce the relative value of the D-Mark against the French currency. The Bundesbank action also failed to give European stockmarkets more than a modest lift, although it helped to push up share prices in New York, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 39 points to 3,465.64. Investors expressed disappointment that the Bundesbank did not cut its Lombard rate, which sets the effective ceiling for German rates, and remains at 9 per cent. The Bundesbank move underlines perceptions that the central bank has embarked on a series of reductions in official rates, which could over the next few months bring down the cost of borrowing across Europe. However, rapid or large cuts are thought unlikely. Mr Johann Gaddum, a member of the bank's directorate, said that money supply data released in the morning, and which showed the key M3 measure expanding at an annualised rate of 5.5 per cent over the past six months, had been the decisive factor behind the Bundesbank's move. 'The bank has used and will use its room for manoeuvre on interest rate policy,' he told a diplomats' meeting in Bonn. Inside the ERM, the French franc weakened against the D-Mark, falling below the level of FFr3.41 against the D-Mark for the first time since the start of this year. It continued to trade at similar levels in New York. The franc's fall to little more than two centimes above its ERM floor against the D-Mark raised concerns that the ERM may come under strain following the first round of the French parliamentary elections on Sunday. French money market interest rates rose yesterday, raising concerns that dealers were borrowing the franc to speculate against it. The rate for borrowing one-month francs rose from 11.3 per cent to 12 per cent. However, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, said the move would encourage European neighbours' central banks to reduce their rates and provide their economies with similar incentives. Switzerland, Denmark, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands all reduced their official lending rates in the wake of the Bundesbank's move. In the French finance ministry, the Bundesbank's move was registered as 'positive'. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, said earlier that no changes in French interest rates could be expected until after the parliamentary elections, irrespective of what the Bundesbank did. Yesterday's cut in Germany's official 'floor' rate followed political agreement last weekend on the framework of a solidarity pact to help recovery in the east. This may have helped relieve some of the uncertainties about inflation and Germany's fiscal deficit troubling the Bundesbank's policymakers. News that producer prices in February were just 0.5 per cent higher than a year earlier, compared with an 0.8 per cent rise in January, also indicated further lessening of inflationary pressure.

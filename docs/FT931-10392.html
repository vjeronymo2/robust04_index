			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / US plan for Bosnia holds key to next move on peace THE United Nations Security Council was due yesterday to conduct its first review of the international mediators' efforts to broker a peace settlement for Bosnia-Hercegovina, but was not expected to take any decisions before the US comes up with its promised alternative plan, probably later this week. The mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance for the UN, and Lord David Owen, representing the European Community, continued without success their efforts at the weekend to win the approval of all the warring factions for their proposals to divide Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. So far, only the Bosnian Croats have endorsed all three parts of the peace plan and are also the only ones to have subscribed to the mediators' proposed map. The Bosnian Moslems, confident that the US would not subscribe to any solution which would force them to make territorial concessions, declined to discuss the map during the weekend talks and concentrated on the proposed ceasefire arrangements. Over the past few days, however, there have been growing indications that it will be possible to find common ground between President Bill Clinton and the mediators, particularly given the strong international support for the Vance-Owen plan. The UN yesterday resumed its humanitarian airlift to Sarajevo amid heavy fighting in eastern Bosnia and western Croatia. Fourteen flights arrived with 131 tonnes of emergency relief, Laura Silber writes from Zagreb. They took off from Frankfurt and Split, the Croatian port, after Serb anti-aircraft fire hit a German relief aircraft bound for Zagreb at the weekend. In eastern Bosnia, heavy fighting was reported around Srebrenica, despite a UN-brokered ceasefire which was supposed to come into force at noon yesterday. In Croatia's Dalmatian hinterland, Serb forces claimed to have seized Pridraga and Novigrad, strategic towns near the vital Maslenica bridge. Belgrade radio said Serb forces were advancing towards the bridge, which links Croatia with its Dalmatian coast.</p>

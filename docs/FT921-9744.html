			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Volcker may be guru to save rouble: The band of consultants in Moscow is growing FROM the heart of government headquarters to smart western-style hotels, Moscow is swarming with foreign consultants and gurus telling the republic how to proceed to a market economy. Likely to join them is Mr Paul Volcker, the former (two-term) chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, who is considering an offer to serve as a part-time adviser to the Russian government on economic and banking reform. Mr Volcker now divides his time between teaching at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and serving as chairman of James Wolfensohn, a New York investment bank. The areas on which Mr Volcker might provide advice include the banking system, currency arrangements between the various republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States and Moscow's relations with the International Monetary Fund. Mr Volcker would work alongside other advisers to the Russian governments. At the top of the pile, three professors - Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, Anders Aslund of Stockholm, and Richard Layard of the London School of Economics - are publicly advising the Russian government on a 'shock transition' to a market economy. They have even joined in Russian political battles, accusing Mr Georgy Matiukhin, the chairman of the Russian central bank, of destabilising government reform with a lax credit policy. Funded by western foundations, the trio have also led calls for massive financial aid from the west. Behind the scenes, the IMF, with its unrivalled experience of economic reform around the globe, is providing advice of a more discreet kind. But it is coming under increasing pressure to lead from the front, not least to cut through the chaos within the former Soviet Union and the differences among western governments on how to help. 'The Russians say they are in the hands of Jeffrey Sachs because they do not know what the IMF is recommending,' said one western diplomat. 'Meanwhile western countries are each doing their own thing in their own corner. The Fund should play a co-ordinating role,' the diplomat added. The IMF counters that it cannot put its prestige on the line by getting involved in internal Russian politics. Besides it says that the government, led by deputy prime minister Yegor Gaidar, is perfectly aware of what the IMF wants it to do. 'It is just not possible to do it all overnight,' explained Mr Sergei Alexashenko, an independent economist who has contacts with both the government and its foreign advisers. Still the tremendous difficulty of switching to a market economy after 74 years of communism leaves the door open for any outsider who offers decisive advice and attractive solutions. Hence the arrival in Moscow last month of a new consultant to the government, Mr Jude Wanniski, a former editorial writer at the Wall Street Journal. Mr Wanniski is proposing that the Russian government issue long-term bonds which would be backed by reserves of natural resources such as gold, oil, gas and other assets. The bonds, which would be issued in lieu of interest payments to foreign creditors and in tandem with a new currency, are seen as a way of salvaging the savings of ordinary Russians, while giving Russia breathing space to restructure the economy. He is vociferously opposed to the recommendations of Prof Sachs, saying they will topple the government, cripple the economy, and give priority to foreign creditors at the nations expense. Another outside plan has been put forward by Mr George Soros, the private benefactor of eastern European reform, who wants the west to finance a payment union enabling republics to trade with each other even if they switch to separate currencies. The proposal is due to be discussed by Russia, Ukraine and other republics at a meeting brokered by the European Commission in Brussels next week. At the lower end of the scale, consultants funded under western 'technical assistance' programmes are advising officials and enterprises on various areas of micro-economic reform. The danger is different from that at the top. It is about how former Soviet republics can avoid receiving 'soft advice for hard currency' as private consultancies rush to cash in on what is sometimes seen as just a gravy train. The problem of selecting consultants with proven competence and expertise may become particularly acute as the European Commission begins to assign contracts this year for its Ecu400m (Dollars 516m) technical assistance programme. Another concern is that the assistance should be well targeted. Apart from pushing British companies' 'expertise' on privatisation, a Russian-British seminar in January ranged from kindly generalisations ('Keep a steady course and don't lose heart,' advised Mr Edward Leigh, a junior minister from the Department of Trade and Industry) to over-sophisticated advice on public share flotations. The Russian officials attending the seminar had not even begun a crucial first stage of privatising small shops and the trade sector, so it was not surprising that what many of them really wanted from their trip to Moscow were long-promised government instructions on how privatisation was to be carried out. But a heartening contrast was provided by a simultaneous privatisation seminar which was co-sponsored by the World Bank in another part of Moscow. Its purpose was to train representatives from several former Soviet republics to form their own privatisation experts and agencies. The advice was practical, drew on concrete experience, and was designed to help republics help themselves Foreign Speakers included the likes of Mr Marco Simoneti, from Slovenia's privatisation agency. He urged participants to decide clearly what they wanted from their western advisers, and also gave timely advice on how to side-step old-style communist politicians when running a privatisation agency. The need for purely practical assistance was also emphasised in a recent interview by Mr Anatoly Chubais, Russia's privatisation chief, who expressed gratitude for an abundance of foreign advice. However, he added that what he really needed now were computers, photocopiers and fax machines to help agencies round the country carry out privatisation.</p>

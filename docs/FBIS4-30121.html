			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The EAEC: the Major Powers Have Failed To </F> Fulfill Their Promises"]    [Text] Although human civilization is said to be reaching  its climax, the colonial mentality remains entrenched in most  Western nations, especially in the major powers. They try to  impose their values and initiatives on small nations but  strongly object to views from small countries or groups of small  countries in the Third World. The United States is a major  power that adopts such an attitude.    Washington's opposition to the proposal to establish the  East  Asian Economic Caucus [EAEC] is proof of how a major power  deprecates and tries to push aside any proposal from the Third  World, in this case ASEAN. The United States has acted  "elusively" by prevailing over Japan, another major power and  economic giant.    In fact, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has already sensed  the American reaction. For him, Malaysia is prepared to face  the U.S. opposition. The prime minister said he had gotten  information about Washington's stance, although it had been  announced [as published] to the Japanese Government. Malaysia  may ask Japan or China for cooperation.    Beijing's cooperation is important for the EAEC's success.  China's interests were apparent in the U.S. action extending  China's MFN [most favored nation] status for another year early  this month despite human rights violations there. Washington is  powerless to impose its wishes on China because it realizes that  China has great economic power. The volume of trade between the  two nations is estimated at RM [Malaysian ringgit] 100 billion.    Assuming the U.S. presidency January last year, Bill Clinton  pledged to establish closer relations with Asia, which absorbs  60 percent of Washington's total exports. A few months later,  Clinton was however mired in various regional problems, mainly  over the implementation of his campaign promise to fight for  human rights and establish Western standards in a region which  he fails to understand. In addition to facing problems over his  policy toward China, Clinton also made a major error that hurt  Malaysia. He convened the first summit of the Asia-Pacific  Economic Cooperation [APEC], which was made up of 15 members  (now 17 members), including ASEAN, in Seattle by the end of last  year without taking into account the views of other member  nations. The prime minister, who foresaw that APEC would be  monopolized by major powers, was reluctant to attend it.  Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating tried to exploit the  matter by describing Dr. Mahathir as a "recalcitrant."    Clinton, who realized his error during the APEC summit,  later  adopted a wait-and-see policy toward the Malaysian-mooted EAEC  idea. However, the United States is undertaking a campaign to  persuade APEC members not to support the EAEC idea while  adopting the wait-and-see policy. Besides the United States,  Australia is also trying hard to foil the establishment of the  EAEC. During a press conference in Manila last Monday, Foreign  Minister Gareth Evans openly said that the EAEC may undermine  cooperation among nations in the region. He warned that any  regional trade group which excludes the United States will only  pose a great danger.    Evans claimed that the EAEC would not pose a threat if it  became just a consultative forum within APEC. Once again, a  major power has tried to prove that the idea of a group of  developing nations was unacceptable to developed nations. We  are not surprised over Evans' remarks or the latest U.S.  opposition to the EAEC. The two nations have adopted a  deprecatory attitude toward the idea; however, in the beginning  they did not openly show their opposition.    The United States is now claiming that it is trying to  understand the problems of Asian nations. U.S. officials  admitted that Washington's policy toward Asia faced problems  last year but said that its relations with the region had  returned to a correct path. However, we feel that the United  States and its allies have failed to fulfill their promises.  Their opposition to the EAEC shows their distrust of Asian  nations. Their opposition also shows their power and is not in  the interests of the world community.</p>

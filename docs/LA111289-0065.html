			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITH MITCHELL, DEMOCRATS FIND EFFECTIVE SPOKESMAN  </P> <P> For many Democrats, happy days are here again in the person of Senate Majority  Leader George J. Mitchell. On such highly visible issues as the proposed  capital-gains tax cut and the fledgling democracy movement spreading across  Eastern Europe, the lean and reserved Maine Democrat is the long-pined-for  articulator on where his party stands and how it differs from the GOP of George  Bush.  </P> <P> Mitchell's ideology is close to textbook liberalism. But the ex-federal judge's  lawyerly demeanor appears to have enhanced his effectiveness and appeal -- at  least in Congress and with the press -- by masking partisanship.  </P> <P> By most accounts, Mitchell has comfortably moved into his new political role.  In his first year as majority leader, he has also been feeling his way in the  separate and frequently arduous legislative task of managing 99 unruly egos.  </P> <P> Although it is too early to measure Mitchell's full impact, Bush conferred a  backhanded compliment at his broadcast press conference on Election Day. In  excoriating the Democratic-controlled Congress for its dismal performance in  addressing his first-year agenda, the President made one notable exception.  With Mitchell, said Bush, "there's an honest difference of opinion on capital  gains."  </P> <P> As painful as the result has been for Bush, the capital-gains fight has made  Mitchell something of a hero. Without his unyielding opposition to Bush's  initiative, the Senate almost surely would have followed in lock step behind  the House's approval of the tax cut in September.  </P> <P> Mitchell had an advantage: the Senate's filibuster rule requires 60 senators to  shut off extended debate. As Bush complained, his forces had the majority  needed to pass the capital-gains bill, but they could not rally enough forces  to compel the vote. Mitchell enjoyed no such parliamentary advantage in  orchestrating two other critical setbacks for the President on Capitol Hill:  rejection in March of the nomination of John G. Tower as defense secretary and  last month's defeat of the constitutional amendment to bar flag-burning.  </P> <P> Consistent with the axiom that "good politics" often is "no politics," Mitchell  -- like a cardsharp poor-mouthing his own hand -- downplays his own leadership  in foiling Bush's initiatives. These were not issues that "I went out and  sought," he said in an interview last week. "They were forced upon us by the  Administration."  </P> <P> Mitchell would rather talk about several legislative initiatives he has ushered  through the Senate, often in the face of Administration opposition. Among them  are tougher oil-spill liability standards, rural development, minimum wage --  and a child-care bill that he trumpets as his chief accomplishment. The  majority leader also likes to remind listeners that he cooperated this spring  with Bush, to the chagrin of some Democrats, in early efforts to reach  agreement on the budget and on humanitarian aid to the Contras. But such  bipartisanship has been fleeting in the Senate, as was demonstrated anew in  last week's continuing conflict over the federal budget.  </P> <P> Mitchell's differences have been chiefly with White House hard-liners,  including Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and Office of Management and Budget  Director Richard G. Darman, not with the more conciliatory Senate Republicans  led by Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). Dole's independence of Bush on both  capital gains and budget is, in part, because "Dole wants to present an  alternative Republican plan," said an Administration official.  </P> <P> Whatever the reason, Mitchell is the beneficiary, and he is doing what he can  to broaden his relationship with Dole. As a result, Dole has been less partisan  in his approach to issues than in the past, according to a source close to the  Democratic leader.  </P> <P> Despite his nonpartisan air and his friendship with Bush (they have shared  weekend plane rides to Kennebunkport), Mitchell has been almost contemptuous of  Bush's cautiousness in foreign policy. On steps to encourage and strengthen  Mikhail S. Gorbachev's initiatives, aid to Poland and Hungary and Bush's  reluctance to criticize the Chinese crackdown in Tian An Men Square, Mitchell  has called for more aggressive, more liberal U.S. actions.  </P> <P> As Mitchell has become more vocal, other Democratic senators have urged him to  speak out even more and to move beyond what some Democrats earlier this year  considered his own undue caution. Taking a tougher, more partisan approach has  its own risks, but Mitchell appears willing -- especially when he, the smart  lawyer, knows he has a good case. Mitchell has ruled out, for example, any  effort to cooperate with Bush next year on a budget "summit," which some White  House aides consider the only way to allow all sides to make the politically  difficult choices in cutting the deficit.  </P> <P> Although he has sworn off a 1992 presidential bid, his legislative efforts and  rhetoric could go a long way toward shaping the political environment of that  contest. For the dogged and often underestimated Mitchell, the move to the  center of the national political stage may know no bounds.  </P></p>

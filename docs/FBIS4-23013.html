To  this end, L-lysine decarboxylase (UII type from E.  coli) made by Sigma (U.S.) and Vladipor No. 1 cellulose  membranes are used. The enzyme electrode preparation method and  a block diagram of the L-lysine concentration measurement  circuit are cited, and the dependence of the L-lysine sensor  activity on pH and the effect of the measurement temperature on  the lysine sensor sensitivity are plotted. The enzyme optimum  operating conditions fall within pH=5.5-6.0; a decrease in pH  increases the biosensor sensitivity, but lower pH values inhibit  the enzymatic activity. The optimum operating temperature is  37. The sensor is characterized by a linear response within  a 0.4-8 mM concentration range. In addition to lysine detection,  the proposed sensor may be used for other chemicals, e.g.,  chlorophos. Figures 3; references 6: 2 Russian, 4 Western.</p>

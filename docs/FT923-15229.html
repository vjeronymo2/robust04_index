			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Management: Cleaning up after communism - Unilever has ambitious plans for local manufacturing and sales in eastern Europe From a Warsaw office building where General Jaruzelski once chaired meetings of the politburo, Hans Overgoor, chairman of Unilever's operations in Poland, busies himself today keeping the nation's laundry whiter than white. It has been a full-time task since he was parachuted into the job a year ago, when the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company bought Pollena Bydgoszcz, a large Polish detergents producer, and set about turning it into a viable modern business. The results are already starting to show. Pollena, re-named Lever Polska, has raised output by more than 50 per cent, is market leader in washing powder and is expanding its range. Though Overgoor will give no figures, he says sales this year will exceed 'many times' the roughly Dollars 30m made in the second half of last year. Unilever is keenly aware that making a success of Lever Polska is important in a country which craves foreign investment but views multinational companies with some suspicion. 'If you want to make further acquisitions, you have to handle the first one well,' says Hans Eggerstedt, Unilever's main board director responsible for Europe. The operation is also the flagship of a plan to establish a local manufacturing and sales network in eastern Europe on a scale equalled by few, if any, competitors. Eggerstedt expects Unilever to have production in all three countries in the region and annual sales of as much as Pounds 700m in five years, by when the operations should all be profitable. The strategy is the fruit of a meticulous planning exercise begun more than two years ago. Once the broad goals were set, teams of experts descended on the region to scout for potential acquisitions, tour plants and talk to managers. Having identified its targets, Unilever has stuck to its guns, resisting opportunistic buys. In Hungary, Unilever has acquired VMTV, an ice-cream maker, and last February teamed up with Ferruzzi, the Italian agribusiness company, to buy NMV, a producer of oilseeds, margarine and detergents. Unilever also has a Czech ice-cream joint venture and aims to round off its acquisitions this year with a food business in Poland and food and detergents companies in Czechoslovakia. Though many day-to-day responsibilities have been left with managers and staff of the acquired plants, teams of expatriate executives have been dispatched to give advice and training. These 'facilitators' are hand-picked for above-average ability and a talent for coaching local managers, who are expected eventually to run the businesses. 'In the longer term, foreigners can't play more than a marginal role,' says Andre Mico, head of Unilever in Hungary. Because Unilever vetted its acquisitions closely before purchase, their factories have produced few surprises. Quality is said to be satisfactory and Pollena's output was increased largely by ironing out bottlenecks in the plant. Redundancies have so far been avoided at Pollena. But Unilever, which refuses to commit itself to fixed employment levels, expects to cut staff in Hungary by as much as 15 per cent annually over several years. Unilever is now upgrading its plants to handle technologically advanced products, most of which are still imported from the west. It plans to invest at least Dollars 24m (Pounds 12.9m) in Pollena, including adding a liquid detergents production line, and Dollars 10m to treble VMTV's capacity to 10m litres of ice-cream a year. Mico expects 90 per cent of VMTV's sales to be locally produced by the end of next year, up from 25 per cent today. Manufacturing is heavily influenced by brand strategy. Unilever is pursuing a twin-track approach, keeping the better local brands while steadily adding international ones, with prices about 50 per cent higher than local equivalents. Lever Polska's most successful product, Pollena 2000 washing powder, was developed before the company was acquired - as was its television commercial. Based on a Polish legend, its punchline, 'Dad, beat him up]' has entered the local vernacular. In Hungary, however, sales of Panda, VMTV's ice-cream brand, melted away after Unilever began importing products from western Europe. Though enthusiasm for western brands is strong in eastern Europe, positioning products can be tricky. For instance, some consumers believe locally-made products - even when they carry international brands - are inferior to imported ones. Market research is still rudimentary: Overgoor is unsure even how many Polish households have washing machines. He relies heavily for marketing guidance on informal soundings with colleagues, customers and individual consumers. Pitching advertising correctly also calls for careful judgment. Unilever has found that glamour and glitz work for toilet soap, but a more informative, down-to-earth message is needed for detergents. One challenge which even Unilever's careful planning has not been able to deal with is eastern Europe's chaotic and rapidly-changing distribution systems. 'The trade environment makes it very hard to reach the consumer,' says Mico. 'The really critical bottleneck to be tackled is to establish a sales force and manage the supply chain.' In Poland, Unilever estimates that a third of its products are sold through street traders, even though it does not supply them directly. 'Distribution is developed only in the sense that, one way or another, products seem to find their way onto the shelves,' says Overgoor. Until the situation stabilises, improvisation will remain important. As well as working with and training selected local wholesalers and shops, Unilever is building up sales forces and distributing some products itself. Mico has called in colleagues from developing countries to advise him. Says Overgoor: 'Basically, we try anything that works'. Both men hope the current turmoil is simply a transition phase, and that more efficient and professional distribution systems will emerge in eastern Europe later this decade. Judging by the daily pressures they face now, the change cannot come a moment too soon.</p>

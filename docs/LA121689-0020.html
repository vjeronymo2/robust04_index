			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRITERS AND AGEISM  </P> <P> Regarding Mary Helen Berg's "Ageism Thwarts Older Writers in Hollywood" (Dec.  7):  </P> <P> It comes as no surprise to television viewers and moviegoers that the Pepsi  generation is now at the helm of the good ship Hollywood. Young writers and  producers, along with their co-conspirators at the corporate level, form a Cult  of Mediocrity concerned primarily with recycling the television of their  sainted childhoods.  </P> <P> This sad state of affairs will remain unchanged as long as young writers are  hired instead of good writers, regardless of age. With Hollywood versions of  Dan Quayle burdening every executive office in Hollywood there is little hope  for the future.  </P> <P> JOHN WELSH  </P> <P> Pomona  </P></p>

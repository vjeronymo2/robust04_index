			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS / MONTEREY PARK;  </P> <P> PROP. S WOULD REPLACE SLOW-GROWTH INITIATIVE  </P> <P> Proposition S, which would replace a 1982 slow-growth initiative, would help  avert legal challenges and control the pace of residential construction in the  city, supporters say.  </P> <P> If approved by voters, the new measure would modify and extend Proposition K,  which voters adopted eight years ago to limit the number of residential units  built each year in the city.  </P> <P> Proposition K, which was challenged in court by developers, expires in 1992 but  would be repealed in January, 1991, if Proposition S is passed. The new measure  would be in effect for 10 years, from Jan. 1, 1991, to Dec. 31, 2000.  </P> <P> Irv Gilman, president of the Residents Assn. of Monterey Park, which pushed for  the 1982 initiative, said Proposition S is needed to keep the slow-growth  measure from being challenged again in court.  </P> <P> The ballot lists no opposing argument.  </P> <P> In 1984, the development firm Monterey Views sued the city, contending that  Proposition K violated a state law requiring cities to expedite construction of  affordable housing. The firm also charged that Proposition K -- which  restricted new construction to 100 units a year -- was inconsistent with the  city's General Plan, which had allowed construction of 500 new units a year.  </P> <P> In 1989, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Paul Turner ruled in favor of the  city, saying the developers should have appealed to the city before they went  to court. The developers have appealed.  </P> <P> Mark Jabin of Monterey Views said Proposition S would not affect his property  because of its zoning. But Jabin said he opposes such measures in general  because they do not address what he considers the real problem: commercial  development.  </P> <P> Because of Monterey Views' legal challenge, Gilman helped revise Proposition K  in an attempt to protect it against future lawsuits.  </P> <P> Proposition S would be tied to the city's General Plan, under which a total of  1,300 residential units may be constructed. Under Proposition K, the new units  could be built at a rate of 100 units a year. Under Proposition S, the annual  limits would change to an increasing percentage formula that would in effect  limit construction to about 90 units a year, Gilman said.  </P> <P> "It gives the city room to breathe," Gilman said.  </P> <P> Low- and moderate-income housing would be exempt from a building allotment  system until the city meets its obligation to provide a fair share of  affordable housing, as determined by the Southern California Assn. of  Governments.  </P> <P> Also on the ballot are six candidates seeking three council seats. Mayor Pat  Reichenberger and Councilman Barry Hatch are seeking reelection. Other  candidates are Fred Balderrama , David Barron, Sam Kiang and Marie Purvis.  </P></p>

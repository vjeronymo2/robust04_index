			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian companies link to build alumina plant INDIAN ALUMINIUM (Indal) has teamed up with Tata Industries to build a 1m-tonne alumina (aluminium oxide) plant at an estimated cost of Rs2bn (Pounds 35m). Alcan of Canada, which holds nearly 40 per cent of the equity in Indal, is also participating in the project. According to Mr Tapan Mitra, managing director of Indal, the proposed refinery, will be drawing bauxite (aluminium ore) from the Baphalimali deposit in the Koraput district of Orissa. The bauxite reserves at Baphalimali are estimated at 200m tonnes. The project will be drawing technology from either Pechiney, Alusuisse or Alcan. The Indal-Tata joint venture is likely to attract overseas equity participation and pre-purchase financing by prospective foreign buyers of alumina. Mr Mitra says the alumina refinery will be commissioned in six years. Indal will also be promoting a new company to undertake the job of recycling aluminium scrap. Initially, the plant be able to recycle 30,000 tonnes of scrap. Later, plant capacity will be doubled, according to Mr Mitra.</p>

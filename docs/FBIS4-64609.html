			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkey has prepared a plan to occupy all of Cyprus  and has asked Islamic countries for support. Two of them have  already replied positively.    The Arab newspaper AL MUHARRIR, which is published in Paris,  has revealed this information crediting well-informed Turkish  diplomatic sources. The newspaper adds that, according to the  Turkish sources, Cyprus has been selected as a center for  laundering dirty money made from drug trafficking, secret arms  selling, and violations of the embargo against Yugoslavia. They  also claim that there is cooperation between Russia, Yugoslavia,  and Cypriot Orthodox people to suppress the Muslims.</p>

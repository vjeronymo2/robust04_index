NODONG SINMUN today views this as another sign that the  puppet clique's war moves to slay the fellow countrymen in the  North, teaming up with outside forces, have been carried into  extremes.    The analyst says:    At a time when the United States was working full blast to  deploy Patriot missiles at U.S. bases in South Korea as part of  its attempt to overpower the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea militarily, the puppets decided to introduce the missiles.  This is an anti- national act which can be done only by  warmaniacs who are balking at a peaceful solution to the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula and trying to unleash a war  against the North of the same nation.    Though the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is attempting to  frighten the North with something like Patriots, it is an inept  act.    Even if the United States and the South Korean puppets bring  into South Korea anything more terrible than Patriots, our  people and People's Army will never be frightened.    The warmaniacs would be well advised to act with discretion.</p>

			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Moscow THE Russian government will sell shares in three state-owned oil-related companies on August 18 in its first public privatisation offer in the oil sector, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. Mr Dmitry Skorduli, head of the All-Russian Co-ordination Centre for Voucher Auctions, said 8.3 per cent of the shares would be offered at auctions to be held simultaneously around the country. Subscriptions will remain open for two weeks. Foreigners with Moscow offices will find it easier to buy shares than non-residents as the latter are still not allowed to hold rouble bank accounts and are unable to transfer funds to pay for shares from abroad.</p>

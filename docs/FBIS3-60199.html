			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [News Report: "Operation Cleanup Against Narcotics Ready in </F> Tribal Area"]    [Text] Islamabad (PPA)--The Narcotics Control Task Force  has planned an operation to stop the growing, selling, and  smuggling of narcotics in the nation. The prime minister has  given approval to this plan at the Prime Minister House this  week during the task force meeting. The operation clean up will  be first started in federal tribal areas as opium is grown in  these areas and the largest heroin factories in Asia where the  most expensive heroin in the world, the Golden Heroin, is grown  are also situated here. [sentence as published] A high-level  meeting of officials of various agencies involved in drug  control was hold on Sunday at the ministry of drug control. This  meeting was attended by Dil Jan Khan, secretary of drug control  ministry; M.I. Muhasan, chairman of Narcotics Control Board;  Ghulam Ali, secretary of Narcotics Control Board; and other  high-level officials of the home ministry. According to informed  sources, the decision to start operation clean up first in  tribal areas was made because major drug smugglers are hiding  here and the law enforcement agencies have a difficult time in  arresting them. It was decided in the meeting to ask for the  cooperation of the Frontier Constabulary. It was also decided  that the political agents will be used to start the operation  because these areas are under FRC laws which cannot be  challenged in any Pakistani court. Only the political agents can  arrest persons under these laws. The decision to strengthen the  security on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border to stop smuggling of  narcotics from Afghanistan to Pakistan was also made in this  meeting. All related officials have been informed in this  context. Mr. Dil Jan Khan, secretary of drug control ministry,  is going to meet with the home secretary and governor of Sarhad  to get cooperation from Sarhad state.</p>

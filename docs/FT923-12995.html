			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Tea for C2s on an outing to the shopping mall - Consumers are happy to stop for a bite, so long as the theme is right In Flips Diner, a 1950s pastiche in chrome and apple green with Chevrolet advertisements on the walls, a gaggle of teenage schoolgirls are drinking Coke and coffee. Born in the late 1970s, they find the diner glamorous and its cosy booth seating ideal for discussing boys. 'They all go to diners in the films,' says 15-year-old Jenni Evans. On the other side of Monument Mall, Newcastle upon Tyne's newest retail development, Wilf Gray and his wife are drinking coffee in the Choux Shop, sitting on dark wood chairs beneath a reproduction Victorian light fitting. Tynesiders in their late 50s, they are reminiscing about Tilley's tea-rooms, an oak-panelled, now-defunct local institution. 'Tilleys had more atmosphere but this is very nice,' says Margaret Gray. Her husband agrees but frowns as they pass the Perfect Pizza bar and the Manchu Wok Chinese eaterie, also on the Mall's top floor. 'Those don't appeal to me at all,' he says. Britain's 1980s boom in huge out-of-town shopping complexes and glitzy city centre malls has changed not only retailing but also the catering offered to footsore shoppers. Old style queueing at long self-service counters, where strings of customers wanting only a cup of tea would wait inertly behind a family ordering fry-ups, has given way in many locations to food courts like Monument Mall's, offering different types of food and service in various themed units. Assessing potential demand, designing the eating areas and operating them has become a speciality niche for Courtlands, which describes itself as the largest independent food court operator in England. But the recession poses an acute marketing problem; how does a fast-growing company, operating solely in post-1985 shopping developments and frankly describing itself as 'parasitic on retailers', defend its market share and profit margins when retailing is in the doldrums? For Courtlands, born six years ago at the inception of the MetroCentre in Gateshead and now running more than 60 units in 13 city centre and out-of-town locations from Southampton to Newcastle, the key is demographic and market research: always important, it has become vital in a recession. Mostly, says managing director Jonathan Gillespie, his clientele are the C1s and C2s - the lower middle and skilled working classes; they are the people who like to linger in malls and enjoy spending money, rewarding themselves with food and drink en route. They are receptive to the message: 'Treat yourself'. As and Bs - the middle and upper middle classes - have more money but they are a difficult audience; educated, selective, not keen on spending and 'semi-moralistic'. They tend not to stay long in malls, he says, preferring to discover the cheapest prices and then go home to beat down their local shopkeeper, whom they then feel good about supporting. However where As and Bs are a big enough catchment, his company slides upmarket. At Hedge End, a Southampton superstore development with Marks and Spencer and Sainsbury, Courtlands' sandwiches become filled baguettes and it sells espresso and cappuccino to weary husbands at a little Cafe Express unit: 'a lifestyle concept', enthuses Gillespie. Pensioners - category E - are a difficult market too; on coach trips to out-of-town shopping centres, they consume little. This is bad news for Gillespie, who sees his job description as increasing shareholder value. In the current market, he says, units are working at only 60 per cent effectiveness; he needs to attain 70 per cent or even 80 per cent. An admirer of the Americans' grazing approach to food consumption, he wishes the British would eat meals at off-peak times; he is now working on a campaign to offer OAPs reduced price mid-afternoon fish and chips. But mostly, although conscious of a Pounds 3 a head barrier among his customers, he shies away from price cutting; his units' pitch is quality of environment, food and service, not cheapness. Instead he is trying to maintain spend by offering extras as special promotions, like a baked potato plus strawberries and cream for Pounds 2.75p, or children's meals for 99p: the child sprat catches the adult mackerel. Name signs too are vital in the fight for market share. 'The more obvious you make the name over the door, the easier it is for people to make purchasing decisions,' says Gillespie. And decor matters; he believes people are becoming socially lazy, wanting to be entertained by their surroundings. He is also experimenting with seating; empty expanses deter potential customers and may unnerve those who do consume, undermining attempts to build brand loyalty. Monument Mall is the first Courtlands food court where all seating is unit specific. Compared with traditional cafeterias, Courtlands' range of food looks wide; but coffee, cakes and sandwiches are still the big sellers. Innovation can be risky; one customer who ordered an espresso complained, loudly, that it had come in a small cup without milk. 'Sometimes,' sighs Gillespie, 'you do things ahead of their aspirations.'</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Political wobbles have their price: Japan's new era of unstable government is a challenge for business and the bureaucracy Corporate planners across Japan are counting the business costs inflicted by the unprecedented instability of political power in the world's second-largest economy. 'We are very worried by the current stalemate. It contributes to the speculation driving up the yen, holds up public works spending and delays stimulation measures like economic deregulation and market opening,' says Mr Masaya Miyoshi, director-general of the Keidanren business federation. The Keidanren is so worried that it has begged Mr Tsutomu Hata, the prime minister for the past three weeks, and Mr Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic party, to set aside their war and work together to get the economy back on its feet. Its message has been only half heard, as Mr Kono has vowed to call a vote of no confidence against the Hata administration as soon as the budget, which has now been delayed until July, is passed. The Keidanren echoes a concern shared in boardrooms large and small, as they adjust to unstable coalition governments, after the end last summer of 38 years of rule by the pro-business LDP. A private poll of Japanese executives indicates the day-to-day handling of the economy is surprisingly unaffected by political instability intensified by last month's resignation of prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa and the establishment of what looks set to be a short-lived minority coalition. Yet many fear the results of any weakening of the ties between business and government, which is now unpredictable. In the short term, the strength of Japan's bureaucracy, and the fact that few top bureaucrats are appointed for party political reasons, means a change of government brings less upheaval than in other leading economies. The finance ministry is now, for example, keeping the country funded with provisional budgets, while politicians struggle to agree the full budget, due to have come into force on April 1. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan intervenes, unhampered by the political rows, to keep the yen from running out of control and carries out monetary policy - for better or worse - as before. Other ministries plug away, implementing deregulation measures, from brewing to air transport, agreed by parliament. Thus, Japan's public administration probably has more of a hand in preparing policies than many foreign counterparts. But it cannot make political decisions on matters like tax reform. In this area, failure to agree on a permanent income tax reduction (seen by many as essential to pull Japan out of recession) contributed to the downfall of the Hosokawa government. The reduction was to be funded by a subsequent rise in consumption tax. The precise cost to business of this uncertainty is unclear. Estimates are subjective and tend to vary, depending on the company. Mr Susumu Yamaji, chairman of Japan Airlines, for example, says his business is more affected by global competition than Japanese politics. A manager at a leading trading company is more cynical. 'Perhaps we are lucky that politicians are not running the economy at the moment,' he reflects. At the other extreme, Mr Toshihiro Kiribuchi, managing director of Omron, the control components group, says the cost of paralysis of economic policy and continued trade friction with the US is 'very serious'. But all agree the budget, tax reform, deregulation and US trade talks are the main areas affected by current political turmoil. The budget only calls for a 1 per cent rise in state spending to Y73,081bn, unlikely alone to galvanise the economy. The problem posed by delay is the government cannot propose extra spending, such as another stimulation package, until this year's budget is settled. Last year, the government needed three supplementary budgets to fund emergency spending to combat recession, so it will probably need at least one this time. While new spending is being held up, Japan's conservative bureaucracy has been doing its best to prevent revenues from being eroded by the recession, so cutting across government fiscal policy. Several ministries have quietly tabled public sector price increases in the past few months, totalling a net Y2,301bn, covertly clawing back nearly 40 per cent of the income tax rebate agreed by the Hosokawa government in February. This provoked such an outcry from business organisations, worried about choking the fragile hopes of a consumer led recovery, that the government had hastily to freeze the rises. On tax reform, the main cost of government paralysis is the inability of business to plan for a rise in consumption tax. This is serious for small retailers, such as Mr Ryuichiro Yasui, who employs four people in his jewellery store in central Tokyo. Mr Yasui kept his net prices stable when a 3 per cent consumption tax was introduced in 1989, and plans to do the same if the tax is increased - probably to 7 per cent. His shop is barely breaking even, so he will have to borrow to cover the loss he plans to take. 'It's difficult to set my costs when I don't know what's happening to taxes,' he says. The outlook for deregulation is equally poor, fear many business people. Mr Hata has declared that cutting red tape is a top priority for his administration. Yet that is little comfort given that his opponents are unlikely to allow him the time to usher a new batch of deregulation measures through a sometimes reluctant bureaucracy. Mr Mark Bedingham, chairman of the European Business Community, a lobby group of European chambers of commerce, fears many deregulation measures dreamed up by a business panel established by Mr Hosokawa will end up in civil servants' bottom drawers. Deregulation might slow down, but a growing number of businesses believes market forces will not let it stop. Mr Akio Mikuni, president of Mikuni Credit Rating, points out: 'It does not matter whether governments regulate or deregulate. Growth in our export markets is dead. Because of this, we are facing a shift from a sellers' to a buyers' market at home.' The final big concern is that Japan's weak government will fail to make progress in the dispute with Washington over market access for foreign goods, on which the two resumed their dialogue in Washington yesterday. Here, Mr Hata's government has made good initial progress, and president Bill Clinton has softened his stance on Japan, so helping to stave off a sharp rise in the yen in the Japanese leader's first few days. The more recent jump in the yen was partly driven by fears, rightly or wrongly, that the US might retaliate to a breakdown in the trade talks by nudging up the Japanese currency - perhaps by intervention, interest rate manipulation, or merely by suggestion. 'For now, the pressure on the yen has been alleviated, but this does not give us any relief at all,' says the Keidanren's Mr Miyoshi. 'A further reversal can take place at any time,' he says. Here, the business costs are easier to calculate. The government's Economic Planning Agency estimates that Japan's export industries are on average competitive at Y117 to the dollar, as against the current Y104 at which the currency has settled after nearing Y101 the day after Mr Hata formed his cabinet. For the economy at large, Mr Miyoshi reckons each 5 per cent rise in the yen/dollar rate knocks 0.3 of a percentage point off annual growth in gross domestic product. Of one thing Japanese business can be sure. The message of the bumpy transition from the old days of the LDP to an as yet undefined new political system is that it cannot expect as much help from the guiding hand of the state as they did in the past. 'Business is starting to realise that it cannot depend on government action,' says JAL's Mr Yamaji. 'We will have to start doing more for ourselves.'</p>

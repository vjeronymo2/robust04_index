Under the Finance Ministry's medium-term financial  plan, expenditures on information about the illness and its  prevention is to be reduced from 20 million German marks [DM]  this year to zero by 1997. The Federal Central Office for  Health Information, which will have to disband its AIDS  department, is not the only organization that will be affected  by the Bonn savings program. German AIDS Help, an umbrella  organization to which 130 AIDS groupings belong, will also  experience financial difficulty. As federal funds are to be  reduced to DM16 million next year and to DM11 million in 1996,  Waigel's officials want to cut down on the information campaign  in the new laender above all. The argument is that there are  still not that many AIDS cases there.</p>

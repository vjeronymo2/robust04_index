			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A mere morsel in the hands of fate - The river which changed Alan Porter's course ALAN Porter has always believed in Fate. Over the past three years this belief has been fully vindicated as two events outside his control - a river which burst its bank and flooded his depot and the 1990 Food Safety Act - transformed his business in size, style and profitability. Porter began humbly. He studied hotel and catering management at Surrey University but found the course too theoretical and left. A year working in the food business with Justin de Blank in London gave him practical experience. After that he did a variety of jobs, for a while he ran the outside catering at Ripley Castle. In 1972, he opened Porter's Provisions in Knaresborough with Pounds 2,000 borrowed from his father, which, in the course of the interview, he remembered he still had not repaid. He built up a chain of five shops including one at Farnley, which Jane Grigson, the cookery writer, once called 'the finest food shop in England.' Above the shop, Porter developed a wholesaling operation supplying professional chefs. Interest in the lines Porter was importing grew rapidly in the early 1980 and so did demand for Porter's knowledge and provisions. But a successful primary wholesaler purchasing directly from the producer must buy in large quantities to minimise transport charges. This means at least one pallet from each supplier. These range from Pounds 2,000 for a 500kg pallet of top quality olive oil to Pounds 10,000 for one tonne of the Valrhona chocolate which Porter imports for his patisserie customers and his latest project, The Chocolate Society. Once you are buying these quantities of perishable items you need a similarly large customer base to ensure a rapid turnover of stock. In 1987 Porter decided to close all five shops and to move to a large depot in Boroughbridge. This increased his annual rent from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 20,000. Grasping this expensive nettle forced him to learn many new skills. For the first time he had to delegate, and to work within the discipline of an organised structure. Turnover rose to Pounds 2.5m and the workforce grew to 24. Porter also had to go out and find new markets. He opened a depot in Scotland and, after three years of negotiations, won a contract to supply to Forte group hotels, restaurants and manufacturing outlets (including all the own-label chocolates for the Wheeler's group) which added Pounds 1m to turnover in its first year. Porter says he should have abandoned the retail side even earlier. He misses the contact with the public, but there was little room left for profit. Dealing with the bigger buyers who understand his products and appreciate his enthusiasm for the latest British goats' cheese makes commercial sense and satisfies his need to supply the best. The discipline of the market had forced Porter to cut the number of lines he sells to 2,500. Fifty per cent of turnover is cheese. The rest falls into five categories: oils, vinegars, olives, mustards and chocolates and he aims to turn the stock over every two to three weeks. Porter no longer allows himself the luxury of any oddball items and has, at the fifth attempt, given up trying to sell pasta. Then fate struck twice. The 1990 Food Safety Act changed Porter's plans. The effect of the Act on perishable food wholesalers convinced Porter there would not be a future for small, national distributors of perishable food. He had three choices. To move out of perishable foods altogether, which is where his expertise lay; to borrow heavily and open a system of fully refrigerated depots around the country or to wholesale the products he imported to others with depots. The third solution seemed the only practical one but, as Porter realised, other wholesalers were unlikely to buy from him as long as he continued in the wholesale business able to undercut them as the primary importer. This summer Porter merged his wholesaling business with that of Justin de Blank. This will create a national wholesaling and distribution company with a turnover of at least Pounds 3.5m and free Porter's Provisions to become what Porter would like it to be, a primary wholesaler sniffing out the best produce in Europe. Porter has also learnt from a disaster in January 1991. when the River Ure broke its banks and flooded his depot. The timing, just after a record year's turnover, could not have been worse. The insurance policy based on turnover and loss of profits had not been revised upwards and the insurance company would cover only half the Pounds 150,000-worth of damage. Once the building was repaired, overheads had to be cut and the following year's accounts showed a much reduced gross profit but an even higher net profit. A photo of the flooded depot outside Porter's small office serves as a reminder that, occasionally, Fate has a sunny side.

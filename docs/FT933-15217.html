			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Advertising decline hits income at Dow Jones DOW JONES &amp; CO, the publishing group which owns the Wall Street Journal, yesterday reported a 5.3 per cent drop in second-quarter net income, which it said was due mainly to a decline in advertising lineage at the Journal. The company reported net income of Dollars 39.81m, or 40 cents a share, compared with Dollars 42.02m, or 41 cents a share, in the same period of last year. Revenues rose 4.2 per cent to Dollars 487m. For the first half, the company reported net income of Dollars 70.75m, or 71 cents a share, up from Dollars 58.17m, or 57 cents a share, on revenues which rose 5.2 per cent from Dollars 904m to Dollars 950m. First-half earnings rose 2.6 per cent when a 1992 charge for changes in income tax and post-retirement benefits is excluded. Mr Peter Kann, chairman, said second-quarter advertising lineage had been soft, largely because of general economic uncertainty. 'Businesses are still cautious about a recovery and that affects their spending.' Operating income for the quarter at the group's information services segment, which includes the Dow Jones/Telerate and Business Information Services groups, totalled Dollars 39.1m, up 4.4 per cent, on revenue 8.6 per cent ahead at Dollars 214m. The business publications segment saw a 12.3 per cent slide in operating income, to Dollars 37.9m, with revenue little changed at Dollars 210m. The Wall Street Journal's advertising lineage was down 7.3 per cent. Ottaway Newspapers, a community newspapers subsidiary, saw an 11 per cent dip in operating income, to Dollars 9.1m, while revenues rose 4.6 per cent to Dollars 63.1m. Advertising lineage rose 1 per cent. Chevron, the US oil group, is to sell its 71-year-old headquarters building at 225 Bush Street in San Francisco's financial district as part of its corporate restructuring, agencies report from San Francisco.</p>

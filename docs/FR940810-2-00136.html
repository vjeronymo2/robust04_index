(Mercedes) of Montvale, New Jersey determined that the headlamps on some of its vehicles fail to comply with the lens bonding requirements of 49 CFR 571.108, Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108, ``Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment,'' and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Mercedes also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) (now 49 U.C.C. 30118 and 30120) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of receipt of the petition was published on February 11, 1994 and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 6674). This notice grants the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section S4 of Standard No. 108 defines ``replaceable bulb headlamp'' as one that is comprised of a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bonded  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> lens and reflector assembly. From August 1991 to December 1993, the petitioner imported approximately 46,000 Mercedes-Benz vehicles for sale in the United States in which the headlamps were not ``replaceable bulb headlamps'' because their lenses were clipped onto their reflectors as an assembly rather than bonded. These vehicles included approximately 35,925 S-Class, 7,379 E-Class, and 2,632 C-Class models. In addition, approximately 1,873 noncompliant replacement part headlamps and approximately 1,147 noncompliant replacement part headlamp lenses were sold to Mercedes-Benz dealerships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mercedes supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Damaged Lenses Will Be Replaced With Complying Headlamp Assemblies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the number of replacement lenses sold in Model Years 1991&hyph;92, [Mercedes] estimates that approximately 500 lenses are replaced each year in the subject vehicles. Thus, the number of vehicles involved is relatively low.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Effective November 2, 1993, [Mercedes] no longer sells lenses as a replacement part. This means that no source for replacement lenses now exists. Therefore, when lenses are damaged in the future, the owner's only recourse will be to replace the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> entire  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> headlamp assembly that complies with Standard 108.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the unlikely event that a noncomplying aftermarket lens market were developed for the 46,000 vehicles produced, their use would be restricted by state inspection laws. At the present time, approximately two-thirds of all states have periodic inspection programs. As evidenced by *&blank;*&blank;* state vehicle regulations [which Mercedes included with its petition and are contained in the Docket], replacement headlamp lenses are required to keep the headlamp in compliance with Standard 108. It is our understanding that State Inspection garages routinely reject cars if their headlamp lenses do not bear the ``DOT'' marking, since the lack of ``DOT'' quickly identifies the headlamp as a non-U.S. unit. Therefore, in the unlikely event that a vehicle owner replaces a damaged lens with a noncomplying aftermarket lens rather than a complying headlamp assembly, the vehicle will fail inspection in most states.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Headlamp Aim Not Affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a recently published  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice (Docket 93&hyph;57) requesting comments on the subject of bonded versus unbonded headlamps, NHTSA stated: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In previous denials of petitions to allow removable headlamp lenses, NHTSA argued that mechanical aiming of lamps with lens-mounted aiming pads could be affected by any change of the alignment relationship established between lenses and reflectors at the time of manufacture. Thus, alteration of the original alignment during lens replacement could misaim the beam. [58 Fed. Reg. 42,924 (August 12, 1993).] <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

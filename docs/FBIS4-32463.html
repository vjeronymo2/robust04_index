			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] A 7 June meeting in Zagreb between  Slovene President Milan Kucan and Croatian President Franjo  Tudjman on bilateral issues has been the subject of much  discussion in the Slovene and Croatian press.    The 9 June issue of the Ljubljana independent daily DELO  reported that the day after his return from Zagreb, Kucan told  reporters at a Ljubljana news conference that his visit had been  "useful" and that he had achieved his "goal" -- to give impetus  to Slovene-Croatian negotiations on unresolved bilateral issues,  which range from border disputes to stagnating economic  relations. Although the presidents did not try to find  "concrete" solutions to the specific problems, Kucan mentioned  as particularly aggravating issues the Piran Bay dispute and  deteriorating trade relations. He said that the best solution  would be to compromise or, absent an agreement, accept the  status quo. The worst possible option, in his opinion, would be  "to ignore the problems" or "force unilateral solutions." He  remarked that he was not "completely convinced" that the Slovene  Government was aware of the importance of Slovenia's relations  with its neighbor or that it had formulated a strategy for  dealing with the unresolved issues.    Kucan stressed the importance of Croatian Prime Minister  Nikica Valentic's scheduled July visit to Ljubljana, during  which he and his Slovene counterpart Janez Drnovsek will  probably tackle the major problems: the border in the Piran Bay,  the construction of the Phyrn highway, the Ljubljanska Banka's  debt to Croatian depositors, numerous property claims by  nationals of both countries, the Krsko nuclear power plant, and  the trade decline. In Kucan's view, the upcoming  Slovene-Croatian talks should be guided by the following  principles: to seek "just" and "mutually satisfying" solutions  and to respect the "equality" of the two partners. Kucan  expressed willingness to take part in formulating the Slovene  positions in preparation for the July meeting, DELO reported.    In the same issue of DELO, commentator Veso Stojanov  assessed  Kucan's meeting with Tudjman as "above all, a useful exchange of  opinions" on how to get Slovene-Croatian relations out of their  dead-end street. While he agreed with the official statements  that the normalization of relations is "of vital interest to  both countries," Stojanov suspected that "threats from Rome"  against both countries also played a part in the talks, since it  is important for Slovenia and Croatia to formulate a joint  strategy toward Italy. Stojanov noted that the approach of the  tourist season makes it especially urgent for Croatia that  tensions be removed. At the same time, he criticized the Slovene  Government, especially the Foreign Ministry, for lacking a  foreign policy strategy, reflected in "complete indifference"  toward solving the problems with Croatia.    In an earlier commentary published in the 8 June DELO,  Stojanov questioned whether Kucan's unofficial visit to Croatia  would contribute to better cooperation, while agreeing with  Tudjman's and Kucan's statements that the present relations  between Slovenia and Croatia "do not suit the interests of  either state." Stojanov pointed out that the short history of  Slovene-Croatian relations "is full of meetings and negotiations  at different levels -- disputed issues, however, remain  unresolved." Stojanov blamed the impasse mostly on a "lack of  interest by the neighbors or their nonobservance of agreements  and promises." In his opinion, the talks can be judged  successful only when "Zagreb, in fact, shows a readiness to  normalize relations with Ljubljana."    A commentary in the 8 June issue of the Maribor (Slovenia)  daily VECER stated that President Kucan had to show "firmness"  in his talks with President Tudjman because Slovene foreign  policy toward Croatia had been "by and large unsuccessful,"  resulting in quarrels and finger-pointing on the Slovene  domestic political scene. An important new development pointed  out by the commentator is the fact that, from now on, Slovenia  will not "stand by idly" if Croatia attempts to "further  complicate already serious problems," as Kucan, according to  VECER, told Tudjman, who has the final say in Croatia.    The 9 June issue of the Zagreb daily VJESNIK noted the good  will of both sides toward solving Slovene-Croatia problems, "if  not out of great love," then out of common political and  economic interests, among which VJESNIK listed the wish of both  countries to be integrated into the European Union and a  perceived common threat from Italy regarding Istria. The  announced visit to Slovenia by Prime Minister Valentic was  viewed by VJESNIK as a step toward improving Croat-Slovene  relations.    The independent Rijeka daily NOVI LIST, in its 9 June issue,  was critical of both sides, for extolling their own virtues and  arguing over a "dry river bed," forgetting that they both live  in the shadow of Italy, "an unpredictable neighbor."    The 8 June issue of the Split daily SLOBODNA DALMACIJA  predicted that the "two presidents will not find any concrete  solutions," not only because the Slovene president has less  authority to negotiate than his Croatian counterpart but also  because Slovene-Croatian relations have been neglected and  stalled by both sides for a long time. The paper said it would  consider the meeting a success if both sides expressed a  willingness "to resolve the problems," such as the border and  property issues, and "to create a good atmosphere," which would  then lead to meetings of expert groups and meetings between  Valentic and his Slovene counterpart, Janez Drnovsek.</p>

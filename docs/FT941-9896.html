			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bond market worries trigger big falls in equities - Market Report The UK equity market came under further pressure yesterday, weakened by persistent selling of the FT-SE future and continuing worries about international bond markets. The latter rallied in afternoon trading yesterday, dealers said, but remained nervous ahead of news of the US bond auction and amid wild rumours that one of the big US investment banks had taken a big loss on its international bond trading desks and that there had been departures from its bond trading team in London as well as sackings on its German and Japanese bond trading teams. The speculation centred on Goldman Sachs. The investment bank said it would not respond to market rumours, but sources close to the bank said the stories were totally untrue. Talk that Goldman had suffered big losses in its trading activities since the US Federal Reserve increased its Fed Funds rate has been circulating in markets all week. Dealers said a late slide on Wall Street, which was down almost 20 points after the London market had closed, and talk that one of the New York market's most influential commentators was expecting a 4 to 7 per cent short-term setback for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, would have a sizeable impact on London this morning. After hours saw the FT-SE 100 future trading at 3,386, indicating that the cash market would open well below 3,400. 'It is the last day of the account tomorrow and the market has been taking on lots of stock,' said the head of trading at one top UK securities house. He said the market would be unable to hold the 3,400 markk and that the next level of real support would come at 3,350. The FT-SE 100 began the session on a firm note, opening almost 16 points higher and edging up to a day's best of 3,441.1 within an hour of the opening, supported by a solid start by gilts and sterling. However, a gradual deterioration in gilts, said to have been prompted by heavy selling from the US, upset those stocks and undermined sentiment in equities, where US houses were said to have been aggressive sellers of stock. The Footsie fell away thereafter, testing 3,400 on the downside and reaching a session low of 3,400.7 before stabilising and closing a net 22.1 off at 3,407. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index also reflected some determined selling in the marketplace, retreating 32.2 to 4,068.9. Turnover in equities picked up again, reaching 995m shares, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for 671.7m shares, or 68 per cent of the total. The value of customer business yesterday was Pounds 2.04bn. NatWest Securities, one of the London market's most influential securities houses, caused substantial weakness in the utilities area of the market after telling clients to take profits in the electricity sub-sector. A decision on whether the two English/Welsh generators will be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is expected this morning and could produce a big move in either direction, depending on the decision of the industry regulator. BP, meanwhile, could not maintain an early strong rise triggered by good fourth-quarter figures and news of drilling success west of the Shetland Islands and closed lower on balance. But there were strong rises for National Westminster Bank, after reports of switching out of Barclays, for Reuters, after its recent bumper figures, and for Vodafone, after big US support.</p>

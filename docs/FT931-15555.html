The KLSE has directed each company to submit fortnightly progress reports on the status of their proposed China ventures. Last September, Magnum and Dunlop, both part of the Multi-Purpose Holdings group, had announced that the authorities in China's Guangdong province had approved 'in principle' the operation of a lottery by the two companies. Subsequently, the KLSE insisted on more information. Magnum and Dunlop then said that though Guangdong had approved their project, other 'relevant authorities' had still to give their endorsement.</p>

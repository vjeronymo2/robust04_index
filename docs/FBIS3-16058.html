			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Mart Laar told the BALTIC NEWS  SERVICE [BNS] that the next round of Estonian-Russian talks is  scheduled for the beginning of April in Moscow. Russia has  proposed to continue the interstate talks and evidently Estonia  will accept this proposal, the Prime Minister said. Taking into  account the latest statements from top Russian officials there  is reason to sit down around a talks table again. If Russia  also gives up the additional conditions set for the withdrawal  of troops there is hope that quick progress will be made  regarding agreements, Laar claimed to BNS.    Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on 11 March  on his visit to Finland that Russia will withdraw its troops  from Latvia and Estonia by the agreed deadline, 31 August 1994.  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, too, has gone back on  his previous statements and stated in Germany that Russia will  honor the 31 August deadline for the troop withdrawal. Russia  had previously stated that it does not view the troop withdrawal  date as binding. Russian representatives have also claimed that  they will take time out at Estonian-Russian talks.    Mart Laar sees Chernomyrdin's and Grachev's latest  statements  as positive. According to the [Estonian] prime minister,  Estonia does not intend to make any changes in the delegation  and will continue with the existing team. At the same time Mart  Laar is convinced, as before, that it is necessary for the  Estonian and Russian top officials to meet.</p>

The spokesman has said the explosion, the cause of which is  still unknown, occurred after noon and caused a large fire at  the site, located in the Cunduacan region, near this city.    So far, the spokesman added, there are 15 wounded but no  fatalities from the catastrophe, which reportedly had spread to  another Pemex installation in the bordering town of Santa Isabel.    The Red Cross had mobilized to the site 12 ambulances--which  were "all that were available" in the area--and coordinated the  "rescue operation" of the individuals who were affected by the  fire, the spokesman said.    He said the catastrophe was already under control and that  the wounded had been moved to Pemex's hospital in that area.    Tabasco government and fire department sources of that city  also said they ignored the elements that caused the explosion at  the petroleum installations.    Tabasco State, 660 km southeast of this capital, borders  Chiapas State, where on 1 January an Indian rebellion broke out  against the government, which still has been unable to establish  a dialogue with the rebels.</p>

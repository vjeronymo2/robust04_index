			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from the "Opinion" page on an interview with Lin </F> Yifu, an economist with the State Council Development and  Research Centre, by CHINA DAILY reporter Fu Jian; place and date  not given: "Fair Competition the Only Way To Ensure Efficiency"]    [Text] Having been in existence for more than 10 years,  China's enterprise reforms still need to be improved.    Today's enterprise system--consisting mainly of shareholding  corporations--is seen as a good way to invigorate enterprises  and reform most of the country's large and medium-sized  State-owned enterprises.    But according to Lin Yifu, an economist with the Development  and Research Centre of the State Council, a modern corporate  system is not enough to ensure enterprise inefficiency.    "Fair competition is the most important factor in improving  enterprise efficiency, no matter what system is adopted," Lin  said in an interview with China Daily.    "Many shareholding corporations in developed countries run  badly or even go bankrupt, while many State-owned enterprises,  such as Singapore Airlines and the Regie Nationale des Usines  Renault, are well operated," Lin said.    In both shareholding corporations and these State-owned  enterprises, management and ownership is separate.  <H5>  Profits </H5>   Managers of shareholding corporations, who receive salaries  but not stock bonuses, might be more concerned with increasing  their own income than earning more profits for shareholders.  Managers of State-owned enterprises might have a similar  intention.    Some of them might even sacrifice enterprise benefits for  higher personal incomes.    It is also impossible for shareholders (or the State) to  closely monitor managers daily.    This problem can only be solved through market competition,  Lin said.    Market competition will force managers to be faithful and  diligent, lest they lose money.    Owners of poorly run enterprises (shareholders or the State)  will fire managers and appoint more competent people.    For Chinese enterprises, competition has not been fair, Lin  said, since reforms on prices, interest rates and foreign  exchange rates have lagged behind enterprise reform. These  levers are still controlled by the State as well.    Thus enterprises are still heavily affected by set prices  and  government interference in the market place.    China began enterprise reform so as to give enterprises more  decision-making power and a larger share of profits. The  measures were efficient in the short term, but in the long-term  they do not address the heart of the problem.    Currently about two-thirds of State-owned enterprises are  running at a loss.    What's more serious, State-owned firms have lost money  because of high salaries and welfare payments to managers and  employees.    The government has had difficulty in stopping this not only  because of enterprises' enlarged power, but also because of a  lack of self-restraint and appropriate supervision mechanisms,  Lin said.    Even if enterprises are transformed into shareholding  corporations, these practices may continue if firms are still  kept afloat by the State and not forced to deal with the threat  of bankruptcy.    Moreover, State-owned assets may still be siphoned off  unless  firms are forced to deal with market forces.    To force enterprises to exercise self-restraint and become  more efficient, they must be left to survive on their own in the  market economy, Lin said.    Furthermore he said, reforms in finance, taxation and the  banking system should be carried out.    Since the Party's Third Plenary Session of the 14th National  Congress last October, such reforms have been strengthened.    And it is expected huge steps will be made in these reforms  this year.  <H5>  Labour </H5>   Since China is short of capital but has an abundant labour  force, labour-intensive light industries can survive and develop  more easily than heavy industry.    So Lin said that the government should put less control on  prices to guarantee funds needed for development.    The development of light industries can also accumulate  funds  to help develop heavy industry.    Thus, China should put more emphasis on the development of  light industry and cut the number of firms in heavy industry,  Lin said.    As for existing heavy industrial enterprises, large- and  medium-sized ones that are vital to the country's economy should  be maintained while small ones can be sold or leased to  individuals, or merged with other enterprises.    The enterprises that are kept--many of which are incapable  of  surviving on their own--should be supported by the State.    To prevent additional losses, a responsibility system could  be adopted, Lin said.    Firms should be given a certain amount of leeway, but if  their losses are too great the State should fine or fire the  managers.    Enterprises with good performances should be rewarded and  allowed to retain their profits.    With the development of light industry and the service  sector, the demand for heavy industry commodities will increase.  The country's capital will become more abundant and enterprises  will be able to become autonomous and survive without government  support.</p>

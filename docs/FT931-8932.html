			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Accountancy body may trim scrutiny THE self-regulatory body for chartered accountants who conduct investment business is considering reducing the monitoring of its members. Mr Bruce Picking, director of practice regulation at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said 'embryonic' discussions were under way to increase the period between inspections by the joint monitoring unit, which is run by all the chartered accountants' institutes in the British Isles. The unit at present visits every five years all 6,000 chartered accountants registered to conduct investment business. It visits every two years all those - numbering only about 600 - who are authorised to hold clients' money. But Mr Picking said: 'We are considering lightening the burden. We don't need blanket monitoring with visits. We may move to a more risk-based approach.' He stressed that inspectors would continue to monitor annual returns from all registered firms and would carry out targeted visits to those which required greater attention. The discussions come soon after the institute made representations to Mr Andrew Large, the chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, over the regulatory demands imposed on accountants. Accountants already had to comply with their own codes of professional conduct and investment business comprised a small fraction of their work - estimated at only 1.5 per cent of fee income.</p>

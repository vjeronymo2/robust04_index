			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHENEY SEES SAVINGS IN NEW CONTRACT PLAN  </P> <P> Predicting savings of $30 billion over the next five years, Defense Secretary  Dick Cheney unveiled a new plan Tuesday to streamline the Pentagon's procedures  for awarding contracts annually worth $150 billion.  </P> <P> But Cheney warned that "there is no silver bullet" that will quickly eliminate  fraud and waste from the Defense Department. Instead, he said, a number of  steps must be taken if the Pentagon is to get well-built weapons delivered on  time.  </P> <P> Among those steps, which were approved last week by President Bush:  </P> <P>  -- The creation of a new committee composed of top-ranking Pentagon officials  responsible for coordinating weapons purchases with national security and arms  control objectives.  </P> <P>  -- The establishment of a Defense Department ethics council charged with  educating the department's employees on standards of conduct.  </P> <P>  -- New hiring and promotion standards among the Defense Department's 350,000  civilian employees involved in military contracting.  </P> <P>  -- The establishment of a separate career path with special educational  requirements for about 30,000 military officers involved in acquisition.  </P> <P>  -- The increased use of multiyear commitments to the development and  production of some weapons systems, which it is hoped would provide industry  with an incentive to lower costs.  </P> <P>  -- Strictly defined performance standards that every Pentagon weapons system  must satisfy before proceeding to a further phase of development or production.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Paper Work Burdens Cited  </P> <P> The defense chief echoed several of his predecessors in laying part of the  blame for the department's management ills on Congress. Cheney said his former  colleagues on Capitol Hill must do their part to remove paper work burdens on  the Defense Department if it is to function more efficiently.  </P> <P> "Our efforts will be for nought unless we can get some help from Capitol Hill,"  Cheney said. He charged that Congress' "micro-management" of defense matters  appears to have driven up the number of regulations governing Pentagon  acquisition to 1,600. Since 1970, the number of reports required yearly by  Congress has increased 1,800%, he said.  </P> <P> Standing beside two 5-foot stacks of Pentagon reports delivered to Congress  last year, Cheney complained that Congress' appetite for Pentagon reports has  become gluttonous and expensive, costing $35.8 million in 1988.  </P> <P> At the same time, Cheney and Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood Jr. said  that, in imposing new discipline on its own buying decisions, the Pentagon  should make no new demands on the defense industry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Corporate Ethical Standards  </P> <P> Atwood praised the defense industry for its efforts to develop corporate  ethical standards and said the Pentagon's role should be to "make sure that  defense industry governs itself."  </P> <P> Atwood vigorously criticized the "confrontational atmosphere" that has grown in  relationships among the Pentagon, Congress and the defense industry.  </P> <P> "I've never seen anything like it," said Atwood, a former executive at General  Motors. If private industry had similar relationships with commercial  suppliers, Atwood said, "they wouldn't be able to function."  </P> <P> Atwood's day-to-day management of the Pentagon is expected to set the tone of  the department's relations with business. Under his direction, he said, the  Pentagon will continue to make wide use of competitive bidding in the award of  major contracts.  </P></p>

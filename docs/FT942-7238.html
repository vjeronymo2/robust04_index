			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Beckett opens way for wider Labour contest: Leadership team to be declared on July 21 Labour's national executive committee threw the party's leadership election wide open yesterday by inviting a challenge to Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader. The surprise decision, taken at Mrs Beckett's request, opens the way for her to join up to five other candidates in the race to succeed Mr John Smith as leader. It also raises the prospect of a contest for both jobs between teams linking 'modernising' and traditional candidates. The new team will be declared on July 21 after a six-week campaign and a postal ballot involving up to 4.3m party members and trade union supporters. But the NEC will not accept nominations until after the European election on June 9, suggesting that Labour is in for at least a fortnight of backstage manoeuvring by potential candidates. Mrs Beckett remains acting leader, and is not obliged to stand down as deputy, even if she decides to stand for the leadership. The decision to trigger an early contest removes the threat of a divisive election at the party conference in September. It also offers substantial financial savings. The joint poll, a preferential ballot conducted mainly by post, will cost the party about Pounds 100,000 and the unions up to Pounds 1.5m. Mrs Beckett, a traditionalist, is regarded as an outside candidate for the leadership, which is widely expected to go to Mr Tony Blair, the modernising shadow home secretary. Last night a poll among trade unionists paying the political levy, who have one third of the votes in Labour's electoral college, gave Mr Blair a comfortable lead over his four main potential rivals. The NOP poll for The Independent and BBC-TV's Newsnight put support for Mr Blair at 37 per cent of levy-payers, ahead of Mr John Prescott, employment spokesman, on 22 per cent, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow home secretary, 21 per cent, Mrs Beckett 12 per cent and Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, 7 per cent. Labour MPs said Mrs Beckett's chances could be boosted by her high-profile role as acting leader during the European election campaign. Or she could strengthen her authority as deputy leader by standing for re-election independently or on a dream ticket with Mr Blair or Mr Brown. The possibility of a contest for deputy leader also widens the options for the other main traditionalist candidates - Mr Prescott and Mr Robin Cook. In another surprise development, Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said he had not ruled out standing for the leadership. Unions face biggest bill in Pounds 1.5m Labour poll, Page 10</p>

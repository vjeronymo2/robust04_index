			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Abbey shores up French arm ABBEY National, the mortgage lender and retail bank, yesterday announced that it had been forced to more than double the capital of Abbey National France after the subsidiary incurred a large loss last year. Abbey said it had injected FFr300m (Pounds 36.5m) of additional capital into the offshoot to meet capital requirements and support future growth. It said the subsidiary's anticipated loss for 1992 was less than FFr300m. The group made a Stock Exchange announcement of the loss after the information was disclosed in press advertisements in France last week. This was in spite of Abbey being in the close season before its full-year results in March. The company said it had put measures in place to ensure that price-sensitive information would not be disclosed again in this manner. It said it had made the announcement in order to clarify the loss to the Stock Exchange. The anticipated loss means Abbey is likely to have to raise provisions for France in the second half of the year. It provided a total of Pounds 30m for bad loans in France, Spain and unsecured British lending in the first half. Abbey National France, which had capital of FFr207.5m before the injection, is operating as a mortgage lender on private residential property in France for both British and French home buyers. The subsidiary was previously called Ficofrance, and was acquired by Abbey in 1990. It has mortgage assets of Pounds 700m, and has been badly affected by the slump in the French property market. Abbey said that part of the subsidiary's assets was loans to property developers. It stopped all such lending last April after the extent of the problems became clear.</p>

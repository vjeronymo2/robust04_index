			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Government plans large fines for anti-competitive practices BRITISH COMPANIES could face fines of up to 10 per cent of turnover for engaging in anti-competitive behaviour under proposals outlined by the government yesterday. The power to impose penalties of this magnitude is a feature of two of the three legislative options set out by the government in a green paper discussing possible changes to the law on abuse of market power by individual companies. Practices that could make companies liable to such fines include deliberately pricing goods too cheaply to cover costs and refusing to supply certain outlets. The government is already committed to improving the law against price fixing, market sharing and other cartels by stepping up powers to deal with cartels by prohibiting anti-competitive agreements. The three options on which the government yesterday invited discussion are: To strengthen the case-by-case approach through measures that could involve improving the Office of Fair Trading's investigative powers and allowing more scope for the director-general of fair trading to accept binding undertakings. To introduce a general prohibition on abuse of market power while repealing existing UK legislation on the subject. This comprises the monopoly provisions of the 1973 Fair Trading Act and the 1980 Competition Act. To implement a 'dual system' by introducing a prohibition and repealing the Competition Act provisions on anti-competitive practices, while keeping the relevant provisions of the Fair Trading Act. Although careful not to prejudge the consultation process's outcome, the government said it believed the case for introducing a prohibition on abuse of power, alongside a restricted trade practices prohibition, 'deserves serious consideration'. Labour welcomed the green paper and said its preference was for a prohibition system. At Westminster, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told MPs that excessive discounts such as those said to be given by some suppliers to supermarkets could be considered by the government's review if they were improperly applied. Regulated utilities such as British Gas and the regional electricity utilities should be 'as fully subject to competition legislation' as was consistent with their own statutory and regulatory framework. Questioned on the shaping of UK policy in the context of the European Community, Mr Heseltine said one of the arguments for moving towards one of the prohibition options was that it 'brings practice for domestic purposes' closer to Europe. UK legislation differs from EC law in that abuses of market power may be prohibited only after they have been found to be against the public interest.

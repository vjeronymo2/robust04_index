			<p>BFN     [Text] In a statement he issued yesterday, South Lebanese  Army Commander Major General Antoine Lahd dealt with what was  called the stealing of water from the al-Litani and al-Wazzani  rivers by Israel. He said: I do not know how a UN body like the  Economic and Social Commission of West Asia, ESCWA, permitted  itself to endorse a report of an official nature on a sensitive  issue like the stealing of water by one state from another  neighboring state--even though they are hostile to each  other--without relying on tangible evidence and without  conducting a direct field study to arrive at its conclusions.    Maj. Gen. Lahd affirmed that this is what the ESCWA has  done.  According to a statement by 'Umar Tuqan, the official  responsible for the water program in ESCWA, to a BBC  correspondent last Wednesday, it was content just to collect  available reports and articles published by some magazines and  newspapers on the issue of water in west Asian countries and  then presented the results of its work to the member states  without confirming the correctness of these reports and articles.    Maj. Gen. Lahd added: The Lebanese Government picked up this  report and began clamoring about dangers that only exist in its  imagination. This comes at a time when Lebanon is neglecting  and overlooking a more serious danger, which is undermining  Lebanon's sovereignty and threatening its very existence.    He asked: Doesn't the Lebanese Government have enough  problems to worry about with regard to the economic situation,  the suppression of liberties, and the domination of the nouveax  riches and the angels of punishment? Or did it fabricate all  this clamor in order to distract people's attention from other  matters being cooked up in secret, something that constitute a  real danger to Lebanon's entity and future?    Maj. Gen. Lahd concluded: How long will the Lebanese  Government continue such lies, false heroism, and distraction of  the people from the essence of matters?</p>

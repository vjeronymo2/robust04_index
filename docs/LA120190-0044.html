			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> National Dairy Board Sued: A biotechnology watchdog charged in a lawsuit that  the National Dairy Board is illegally promoting a growth hormone being used  experimentally in cows to increase milk production.  </P> <P> Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Washington-based Foundation on Economic Trends,  has used a variety of legal maneuvers to try to block the use of bovine growth  hormone on the grounds that it is unsafe. He also petitioned the U.S. Food and  Drug Administration to "immediately halt any promotion of this product by FDA  officials and to immediately rescind the use of this product in the marketplace  until it is approved." Neither the FDA nor the dairy board had a comment.  </P></p>

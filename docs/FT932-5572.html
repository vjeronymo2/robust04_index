			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Surrey tops affluence table despite recession OFFICIAL FIGURES today show that Surrey was still living up to its image of commuter-belt affluence when recession hit at the start of the decade. The latest edition of Economic Trends from the Central Statistical Office shows household income per head in 1990 was estimated to have been higher in Surrey than anywhere else in the country. At Pounds 11,300 it was 37 per cent higher than the UK average. The Welsh county of mid-Glamorgan had the lowest household income per head of Pounds 6,400. The only other county to come close to Surrey was Hampshire, where per capita income was Pounds 10,129. Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, and Merseyside joined mid-Glamorgan at the bottom of the pile. The figures confirm that in spite of recession in the south-east in the early part of the decade wealth remained concentrated in London and the home counties. A breakdown by region shows that in 1991 personal incomes per head were about 25 per cent higher in Greater London than the average for the rest of the country. By region, total personal annual income per head was highest in Greater London at Pounds 11,151 and lowest in Northern Ireland at Pounds 7,327. Although personal incomes were low in Wales between 1988 and 1991, consumer expenditure per head rose steadily compared with the UK average. The south-east experienced a relative decline over the same period. Consumer spending per head was highest in Greater London in 1991, reaching nearly Pounds 8,000 compared with less than Pounds 5,500 in the north of England. Food, drink and tobacco accounted for 24 per cent of consumer spending in the north and the Yorkshire region, compared with only 19 per cent in Greater London. It was highest in Scotland, where it accounted for 25 per cent of consumer spending. Spending on housing and fuel was highest in the south-west and west Midlands, accounting for 20 per cent of consumer spending. It was lowest in Scotland at 14 per cent. Overall, the south-east, with only 30 per cent of the population, accounted for more than 35 per cent of personal income. Income from employment accounted for 60 per cent of total household income in the south-east, compared with 53 per cent in Wales and the south-west. Social security benefits were 12 per cent of household income in Northern Ireland compared with 6 per cent for the rest of the UK. The lowest benefit figures were found in East Anglia, the south-east and the south-west - although the last recorded 17 per cent of income from occupational and state pensions.</p>

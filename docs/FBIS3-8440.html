			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This afternoon, the leaders of the Democratic  Convention of Romania [CDR] and those of the Democratic Party  (National Salvation Front) [PD-FSN] discussed the political  situation following the recent government reshuffle.    A declaration was signed that specifies that the  parliamentary opposition parties believe that the reshuffle was  carried out by ignoring the parliament; thus the situation has  been reached that a third of the current government is made up  of people who have not been confirmed by the parliament.    At the same time, the party leaders expressed their common  attitude toward the replacement of Lieutenant General Niculae  Spiroiu as head of the Ministry of National Defense within the  context, quote, of intolerable extremist attacks against the  military institution, something that creates great concern about  the modernization and reform process, a measure that will exert  a negative effect on the army and that will lead to the  instability of basic institutions of the Romanian state, unquote.    The declaration expresses the parties' joint position in  connection with the attacks -- which are viewed as immoral --  against former political detainees of the communist regime  coming, quote, from some of the most docile servants of that  regime, unquote.    In conclusion of the declaration, all the leaders of the  opposition parties call on those responsible within the current  government majority not to waste the chance for a rapid recovery  of the material situation of our country's citizens.    Our reporter has also informed us that the PD(FSN)  secretary,  Mr. Cristian Radulescu, specified that tomorrow's planned  meeting between the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] and  the PD(FSN) has been postponed until next week. The date will  be announced later. The reason for the postponement is the  prolongation of the PDSR permanent delegation meeting that will  be held tomorrow.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / EC corporate tax proposal CORPORATE tax rates in the EC should be harmonised at between 30 and 40 per cent, according to an experts' report for the European Commission which could be transformed into legislative proposals before the end of the year. The report, to be published in full in May, calls for rapid action to eliminate differences in national corporate tax systems, which it says are hampering cross-border business investment and shareholdings. Brussels has already proposed a number of detailed measures aimed, for example, at harmonising the tax treatment of interest payments between companies. The committee recommends an extension of some of those directives. But attempts to go further could fall foul of EC members' reluctance to let the Commission tamper with its domestic tax rates and systems. All tax measures require unanimous approval and as one national official said yesterday: 'Hell will freeze over before any of these recommendations are adopted.' Mr Onno Ruding, the former Dutch finance minister who chaired the panel of experts, admitted there were political hurdles ahead, but said he was 'not too pessimistic'. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the EC tax commissioner, said she would table a paper inspired by the Ruding report in the next few weeks, but she did not specify which of the recommendations the Commission was likely to favour. The report recommends that certain measures should be in place as early as the end of 1994. They include the removal of discriminatory differences in the way profits earned in another member state are taxed, and measures to enshrine a minimum corporate tax rate of 30 per cent. A maximum rate of 40 per cent could wait until the second phase of economic and monetary union (Emu), the report says.</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / French right wing heads for landslide poll win FRANCE was last night on the road to electing the biggest conservative majority in its parliament this century, threatening confrontation with Mr Francois Mitterrand who remains president despite his Socialist government's defeat. With 566 of the National Assembly's 577 constituencies counted, the Gaullist RPR and centre-right UDF parties had won 76 seats decided at yesterday's first round of voting - without a single seat going to the Socialists who have been in government since 1988. Polling predictions forecast that after the second round of voting next Sunday the two conservative parties, fighting under the banner of the Union pour la France (UPF), might win 440 to 476 seats. President Mitterrand's choice of prime minister will be largely determined by the relative showing of the UDF and the RPR. It appeared last night that each party would gain between 19 and 20 per cent of the vote which leaves it unclear which of the two parties would emerge with the stronger claim to provide the next prime minister. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the current Socialist prime minister, acknowledged defeat, calling the outcome 'a severe failure' which he blamed on Europe's recession. Mr Beregovoy himself was forced into a run-off ballot next weekend, after which he is expected to offer his government's resignation. Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the Socialist party, called on electors to use the second round to rally behind 'any left-wing, ecological or progressive' candidate who had done the best in the first ballot yesterday. But, given the poor performance of all left-wing parties, the Socialists' best hope of keeping the conservative victory in check is the possibility that many who abstained from voting yesterday were Socialist sympathisers and that some may feel driven to vote and UDF did not encourage such speculation. Mr Chirac warned his supporters of an excess of optimism and to keep up their effort until next Sunday - a sentiment echoed by Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the UDF. Mr Alain Juppe, the RPR secretary-general warned that the conservative victors had 'a terribly difficult task' in front of them to put the economy to rights, and to accomplish this 'a majority of some 460 seats was not excessive'. Mr Mitterrand still has two more years of his seven-year presidential term to run, and few supporters of the UPF coalition believe he will quit early. But Mr Juppe said 'the rejection of President Mitterrand is very deep', and warned that 'we (the right) will apply our programme with aggression but without concession' to the president. Early computer predictions gave the Socialists the possibility of winning fewer than 60 seats on some 19 per cent of the vote, and only 70 seats if ecologist voters switched their support to the Socialists in the second round. Mr Fabius said 'the left risks being crushed in parliament'. He attributed thedefeat to 'the wear and tear of time, unemployment, and disappointment'. Reports and analysis, Page 5</p>

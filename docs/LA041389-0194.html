			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> MOTORCYCLE HELMET BILL GETS OK  </P> <P> The state Assembly today narrowly approved a bill, identical to one vetoed last  year, that would require all motorcycle riders to wear safety helmets.  </P> <P> The vote was 41 to 24, a bare majority of the 80-member house, for AB8 by  Assemblyman Dick Floyd (D-Carson). It goes to the state Senate.  </P> <P> The law now requires helmets to be worn by riders 15 1/2 years old and younger.  The bill would require all motorcycle riders to wear helmets approved by the  federal Department of Transportation.  </P> <P> Last year, the Legislature passed an identical Floyd bill, but it was vetoed by  Gov. George Deukmejian, who said he was concerned "about the need to mandate  all motorcycle riders and passengers to wear helmets."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Third of five installments of article by Alexandru I. </F> Mihail: "Concerted Fire Upon the Leu"]    [Text] The monetary mass is also put under special  pressure by its totally unequal distribution among the various  categories of the population, that is, by the accentuated  polarization of the money. One of the poles consists by a  restricted number of physical and, especially, juridical  persons, who over the past four years have accumulated a huge  amount of money. Above all this refers to state-owned public  corporations and companies, various private firms, certain  producers, and various Romanian and foreign businessmen. There  are a few dozen billionaires and several tens of thousands of  millionaires. Anticipating the catastrophic collapse of the  leu, they placed their money into hard currencies, buildings,  real estate, automobiles, and various other highly valuable  goods. A significant part of the money they invested in such  goods has never returned to the economic circuit.    The other pole is represented by the almost 20 million  people  owning no money reserves at all, who can hardly afford to buy  the most necessary things they need (food, clothes, shoes, and  so on). Thus, all other goods manufactured by domestic industry  are not intended for these layers of the population and  therefore they cannot be sold, as they are not attractive for  the rich either. This also aggravates inflation. The  polarization of the money explains the paradox represented by  the fact that there was a large monetary mass on the market,  which meanwhile has been turned into goods, while the majority  of the population still went down to the limit of absolute  poverty.    The polarization of money also caused the polarization of  assets. The polarization of money is a factor causing the acute  growth of inflation. As the indexation of salaries and pensions  cannot keep pace with the rate of inflation, the polarization of  money is intensifying dramatically, which generates social  tension the consequences of which are hard to be predicted.    The executive ignores this grave phenomenon of polarization  of money and assets. The "evil" thing is not the fact that some  persons have become billionaires or millionaires who could  invest their money in productive activities, thus absorbing a  significant part of the unemployed coming from the state-owned  sector. The "evil" thing about it is the existence of 20  million people living in poverty, which was caused by stagnation  in industrial production, agriculture, and investments. Thus,  the polarization of the money is the consequence of the economic  blockage, which permanently generates a financial and monetary  blockage as well.    The state budget deficit is a source of inflation, which it  generates by spending money that is not properly covered by the  state's incomes. Even if later they find ways to cover the  deficit, until they do it the deficit makes them have uncovered  money, that is, money printed without any economic foundation.    Spending for consumption beyond the limits of the state  budget is directly causing inflation, as the money they issue  never returns to the circuit of production. Such is the case of  the subsidies granted to the mining sector.    The indexation of salaries made from the state budget (in  the  administration apparatus, education, health, culture, and so on)  increases the state budget deficit, as the state has no other  appropriate income sources to cover up for the money.    The exceeding of the limits established in the state budget  in areas other than that of investments also causes inflation.  The negative consequences of such spending upon the monetary  circulation can only be annihilated when the projects begin  producing, which usually happens several years after the money  was invested. This is the case of the Krivoy-Rog project, in  Ukraine, in which over $600 million were invested until the end  of 1992 and for which, in 1993, a further 120 billion lei and,  in 1994, a further 120 billion lei were allotted. A similar  situation is to be found in the case of the Bucharest--Constanta  freeway, for which they spent 17 billion lei from the budget,  after which work was halted owing to lack of funds. This will  delay the inauguration of that freeway and, implicitly, the  return to the economic circuit of the money that was already  invested.    The originally expected budget deficit of 430 billion lei in  1993, which was later modified to 800 billion lei, also means  inflation. Regardless of whether one has to deal with the  initially expected budget deficit, the modified one, or the one  actually registered in the end, in all instances the state  budget deficit causes inflation. Currently it is even the  principal source of inflation. This is why both the  International Monetary Fund and the World Bank watch the  evolution of the state budget deficits of the countries they  offer assistance to so closely, including Romania. The state  budget deficit is a key performance criteria reflecting the  actual stage reached in the recovery of the economy or in its  degradation, as in the case of Romania.    The programmed deficit over 1994 amounts to 1.9 trillion lei  and this continues to generate inflation. This is why it is not  recommendable that parliament should try to further augment the  budget deficit.    Over the second half of 1993, the executive took certain  measures that also increased inflation. First, they  reintroduced the initial customs taxes, thus eliminating the tax  reductions and exemptions on certain products. This made the  price of those products go up. Beginning with 1 May 1993, even  staple foodstuffs were subject to high customs taxes, usually 25  percent, which increased costs and their retail price. Let  alone the fact that they also introduced customs taxes for  products that are not manufactured in the country at all, which  is clearly an aberrant thing.    An important increase in costs and retail prices was caused  by the introduction, beginning with July 1993, of the  value-added tax [VAT]. In the case of a great number of  products of services that previously used to be subject to  turnover taxes of 1, 3, or 5 percent, the VAT, which amounts to  18 percent, significantly increased their costs and prices.  Previously, under the circumstances of a 1-percent turnover  tax, if a product changed hands five times, the total sum of  taxes amounted to 5 percent. Even if the turnover tax amounted  to 3 percent, in the end it amounted to 15 percent, which is  still less than the VAT applied only once. The introduction of  the VAT for imported products, including foodstuffs, made their  prices skyrocket, thus aggravating inflation.    The introduction of increased customs taxes and the  subsequent introduction of the VAT had an inhibiting effect, as  customs taxes of 25 percent plus the VAT amounting to 18 percent  made the price of imported goods increase by 43 percent, which  discouraged imports. Considering the current state of economic  regression, the 18-percent level of the VAT is totally  exaggerated, let alone the introduction of VAT in the domain of  energy and fuel imports, which is wrong, as it further increased  their already high prices so that both companies and the  population find it increasingly difficult to pay for them.    The same inflationist effect was caused by the introduction  of very high profit taxes in the case of a large number of  important products.    If one added the 45-percent profit taxes to the customs  taxes  and the VAT, one will clearly see that the tax policy applied by  the Vacaroiu government is a repressive, rather than a  stimulating one.    The grave consequences of the measures taken in 1993 are  quite obvious, because as a consequence of them, the price of  the great majority of products and services increased two or  three times. Such products are: meat, sugar, edible oil, rice,  wheat flour, coffee, cigarettes, electric power and heating,  public transportation, and interurban transportation. In the  years 1990 to 1992 there was no similar shock. For the  population this was tantamount to a genuine disaster, as the  50-percent indexation of salaries and pensions could not  reimburse the 300-percent increase in the prices of products and  services weighing heavily on their household budgets. It was  admitted unanimously that inflation got out of control beginning  with the second half of 1993. As a matter of fact, a proportion  of over three quarters of the 320-percent inflation registered  in 1993 occurred during the second half of that year.    By applying such measures, the state budget was partially  salvaged, as the state income became higher. However, this was  possible only by the unprecedented increase of prices that made  the standard of living drop drastically and that impoverished  large categories of the population.</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: DIAMOND BAR;  </P> <P> $8.5-MILLION BUDGET OKD  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday unanimously adopted an $8.5-million budget for the  1990-91 fiscal year, which will include park improvements, beefed-up law  enforcement, additional staff members and a $2.7-million surplus.  </P> <P> "This speaks quite well for the city's first year," Mayor Gary Werner said.  "We've come a long way."  </P> <P> The year-old city's finances received an extra boost earlier this year when the  state Legislature passed a bill to give Diamond Bar $1.2 million in property  taxes for the 1989-90 fiscal year. Previously, the city had been barred from  collecting the money because of the timing of its incorporation in April, 1989.  </P></p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Court rules on equal pensions THE European Court of Justice yesterday ruled that employers are not liable to pay equal pensions to men and women for any period of service before a landmark ruling in May 1990. The judgment was issued in connection with one of four cases before the court. The court was asked to interpret its earlier ruling that pensions are effectively deferred pay and that employers may not discriminate between men and women on pay. Yesterday, the court issued its ruling in the case of Mr Ten Oever who sued his late wife's pension scheme on the grounds that it provided survivors' benefits to widows and not to widowers. .Mr Ten Oever asked the court to decide whether the scheme must also pay benefits to men. The court declared that pension schemes could not discriminate between men and women in survivor's benefits, but only in respect of service after May 17 1990. The case decided by the court in May 1990, Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange, left key questions about pension equality unanswered, including whether employers would have to make enhanced pension payments retroactively before the judgment was issued. European governments had argued that full retrospection for pensions could cost employers throughout the EC up to Pounds 100bn in back-payments. Until May 1990, employers in most EC countries allowed women to retire on full pensions at 60 while requiring men to work until 65 before receiving the same benefit. Thus, women had been receiving more generous pensions than men. 'The court has decided to settle the retrospection question for once and for all,' said Mr Geoffrey Furlonger, head of EC practice at consulting actuaries William M Mercer Ltd. The Ten Oever case was one of a group of cases brought before the court to try to resolve matters related to retrospection. However, the court has yet to rule on the most complicated of those cases, that of a group of former employees of Coloroll, the former UK home furnishings company now in administration. The court must there decide how employers are to pay equal pensions despite the fact that women live longer than men and thus require more money to finance the same level of benefit. The UK insurance industry and groups of European actuaries have asked the court to consider whether life insurance companies which sell annuities to provide pensions must base their rates on 'unisex' actuarial tables which ignore women's greater longevity.</p>

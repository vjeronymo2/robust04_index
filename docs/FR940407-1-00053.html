			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The severe practical problems involved with implementing the MBR method of computing an allowable rate of return on common-stock equity capital sharply reduces the utility of the approach. Accordingly, the Commission does not propose the MBR method of computing an allowable rate of return on common-stock equity capital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Comparable Earnings Method. The CE method is based upon the fundamental economic concept of opportunity cost. This concept states that the cost of using any resource ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , land, labor, or capital) in a particular activity is what that resource could have earned in its next best alternative use. Thus, the opportunity cost of an investment in a regulated firm's common stock is what the invested funds could have earned in their next best alternative investment ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , in another company's common stock, in a government or corporate bond, in real estate, in gold, etc.). In brief, the CE method infers a regulated company's cost of common-stock equity capital from the average (sometimes the adjusted average) book value rate of return on common-stock equity of a group of firms comparable in risk to the regulated company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As already discussed above, the CE method is not thought to be well grounded in economic theory, primarily because the method is implemented using accounting data rather than market information, and does not accurately reflect the regulated carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital. Accordingly, the proposed rule does not specify the CE method for computing the regulated firm's cost of common-stock equity capital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. Final Cost of Common-Stock Equity Capital Estimate. Rather than choosing between the DCF, CAPM, and RP methods, the Commission believes that all three methods should be used to produce separate estimates in arriving at a final estimate of a regulated carrier's cost of common-stock equity capital, in order to avoid any inappropriate judgments that could be embodied in any one of the individual estimates. Accordingly, the proposed rule states that the Commission shall consider the cost of common-stock equity capital estimates obtained using the DCF, CAPM, and RP methods in arriving at a final cost of common-stock equity capital estimate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Other Cost of Capital Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comparable-Risk Companies <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . a. Comparable-Risk Cost of Common-Stock Equity Capital Estimates. When a regulated firm finances assets with common-stock equity that does not trade publicly, it is necessary to use a surrogate to impute the firm's cost of common-stock equity capital. The cost must be imputed because the regulated firm's equity position is not explicitly recognized in the capital market and, consequently, the necessary data for directly estimating the regulated firm's cost of common-stock equity do not exist. This occurs when: (1) The regulated firm is an independent company ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , one which has no corporate parent) which issues no publicly traded common-stock equity, or (2) the regulated firm is a subsidiary of a parent company, and the subsidiary issues no publicly traded common stock of its own.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of the independent regulated company which issues no publicly-traded common stock, the cost of common-stock equity capital must be imputed from a sample of firms having risk similar to that of the regulated company. Once an appropriate sample is selected, the cost of common-stock equity capital is calculated using the methods described earlier ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , DCF, CAPM, and RP) to produce a range of estimates for the independent regulated company. In the case of the regulated subsidiary, as discussed above, it may be appropriate to use the consolidated system's capital structure and component costs to estimate the subsidiary's WACC. If so, the consolidated system's cost of common-stock equity is obtained by applying the DCF, CAPM, and RP methods directly to the parent company, provided that the parent issues publicly-traded common-stock equity so that the stock market price data required for such an application exist. Otherwise, the regulated subsidiary's capital structure and component costs are used, and it is necessary to impute the subsidiary's cost of common-stock equity from a sample of firms having risk similar to that of the subsidiary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Selecting a Proxy Group. The proxy group must be composed of companies whose business and financial risks are substantially comparable to the risk of the regulated firm. Since no two companies are identical in risk characteristics, and because a company's risk profile may not be perfectly stable over time, at least several companies must be chosen to maximize the reliability of the estimated cost of common-stock equity capital computed for the regulated company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The criteria for selecting the proxy companies should evaluate the comparability of each company's business risk and financial risk with those of the regulated firm. Comparability with regard to business risk is most readily and directly accomplished by selecting companies in the same line of business as the regulated firm. The comparability of financial risk can be established by analyzing various financial statistics and investment quality ratings which are commonly used as measures of risk by investors. The Commission's proposed rule sets forth a set of risk criteria for selecting proxy companies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

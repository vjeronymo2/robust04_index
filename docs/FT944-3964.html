			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): I'm suing my solicitors  -Briefcase Q&amp;A I intended to sell my house in 1987 but the deal fell through because of a defect in my title to the property. I am now pursuing the solicitors involved for damages, including interest charges on the money I would have had if the sale had proceeded. Are such charges assessable for income purposes? Broadly speaking, interest on damages is taxable as interest but any interest element in the calculation of damages is not. The damages themselves are liable to capital gains tax, of course, but you probably would escape by virtue of extra-statutory concession D33 (capital gains tax on compensation and damages). You can get the free booklet of concessions, IR1, from your tax office. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

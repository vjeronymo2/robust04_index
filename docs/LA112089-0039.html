			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> IS IT MIDNIGHT FOR DAWN STEEL AT COLUMBIA?;  </P> <P> STUDIOS: MANY INDUSTRY INSIDERS ARE BETTING THAT COLUMBIA'S PRESIDENT WON'T  REMAIN NOW THAT PETER GUBER AND JON PETERS ARE FINALLY IN CHARGE.  </P> <P> After two months of haggling with Warner Bros. over their exclusive production  contract with that studio, producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters are finally  free to take over Sony's newly purchased Columbia Pictures. And they're hitting  the ground running.  </P> <P> Already they've talked about the corporate jets they will order. Plans are in  the works to build a gym and day-care center and to spruce up the executive  offices at Columbia Pictures' new home at the former MGM lot in Culver City.  Even before Warner officially released them from their contract last Thursday  -- in a settlement that could eventually cost Sony as much as $500 million --  Guber and Peters had met with Columbia's production staff to review the  studio's slate of movie projects.  </P> <P> But one of the first orders of business remains on the table: staffing the  studio's executive suites. Still to be determined is the fate of Columbia  Pictures president Dawn Steel, who has been weighing her options since Sony  first announced plans to purchase the studio for $3.4 billion in September. A  decision is expected in the coming weeks.  </P> <P> Many industry insiders are betting that Steel won't remain at the studio,  despite reports that Guber and Peters have invited her to stay. In an interview  last week, Guber and Peters ducked the question of whether they wanted Steel to  stay on as president of Columbia.  </P> <P> "We have been friends with Dawn Steel a long time," said Guber. "We would like  to do whatever is the appropriate thing." Steel declined comment on her future  plans.  </P> <P> Sources close to Steel, as well as to Guber and Peters, say there has been  discussion about the terms of her possible departure from Columbia. Steel still  has about a year left on her employment agreement, so if she were asked to  leave, her contract would have to be bought out. If she were to quit, Columbia  wouldn't be obligated to pay her anything. If Steel does leave, informed  sources expect her to do so with a financial settlement in hand.  </P> <P> Steel has had a number of offers elsewhere in the industry, principally an  independent production contract at Disney. There also have been rumors that  Steel may take an independent production deal at Fox, where she is close to  company chairman Barry Diller, or that she may make movies with her husband,  producer Charles Roven ("Heart Like a Wheel"). Other rumors have Steel taking  on executive positions at other studios.  </P> <P> There still is no official word on which industry figures Guber and Peters will  bring into the company. As Guber put it last week: "We've spent the last month  and a half consumed with litigation" over the Warner contract.  </P> <P> But industry sources point to Alan Levine, their longtime attorney at  Armstrong, Hirsch &amp; Levine, as the principal candidate for chief operating  officer. One source close to Levine said his move to Columbia "was a done  deal."  </P> <P> Levine's firm is an influential one in the entertainment industry and has close  ties to Creative Artists Agency, which handles some of the biggest directors  and stars in the business. If Levine does join Columbia, it is expected that he  also will oversee much of the studio's TV production, since he is one of the  most prominent legal names in television.  </P> <P> Another potential candidate for a senior post at Columbia is Alan Rich, an  executive at Guber-Peters Entertainment Co., which Sony bought for $200 million  in order to obtain the services of its two co-chairmen. Guber told Daily  Variety last week that their former company would remain as a standing entity  inside Columbia Pictures.  </P> <P> However the impending management changes at Columbia turn out, they will cut  short Steel's two-year tenure at the helm of the studio, making it difficult to  assess her success. She spent much of her energy during that time finishing up  the 33 movies left behind by her iconoclastic predecessor, David Puttnam.  </P> <P> While one of those, "The Last Emperor," walked away with a best-picture Academy  Award, and a few Puttnam films did respectable business at the box office, most  of them came and went without much audience or critical attention. Industry  observers attribute some of that failure to the limited theatrical release  Columbia gave many of these films, as well as their quality.  </P> <P> The last of the Puttnam films, "Time of the Gypsies," which earned a best  director award for Emir Kusturica at the Cannes Film Festival last spring, will  be released in February. Filmed in a Gypsy language called Romany, this is  believed to be the first film in history to require subtitles in every theater  it plays around the world.  </P> <P> Steel's efforts also were set back by the five-month-long writers' strike last  year. But some of her critics say that, despite these obstacles, Steel should  have moved faster to put films into production. Some industry sources speculate  that she was hemmed in by the budget-conscious managers above her -- former  chief executive Victor Kaufman and chief operating officer Lewis Korman -- who  were eyeing a potential sale of the studio. (Both executives resigned after the  Sony purchase.)  </P> <P> Steel's first major films appeared this past summer -- "Ghostbusters II" and  "Karate Kid III." "Ghostbusters" did an impressive $110 million in ticket sales  but was considered a disappointment for the studio, which had hoped for grosses  closer to the $220 million that the first film did four years earlier. "Karate  III's" box-office performance, while a respectable $39 million, was also  considered disappointing.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, both films helped re-establish Columbia's presence with  exhibitors and helped boost the company's market share to 15.9% so far this  year from about 9% at the end of 1988.  </P> <P> That market share also has been helped by the surprise success of a Tri-Star  release, "Look Who's Talking," the baby-talk comedy produced by MCEG  Productions that so far has grossed more than $75 million. (Tri-Star was folded  into Columbia Pictures earlier this year, and Steel wasn't involved in the  development of its current releases.)  </P> <P> Columbia's market position also was aided by the recent box-office success of  "When Harry Met Sally," which the studio released under its distribution  agreement with Castle Rock Entertainment.  </P> <P> One of Steel's pet projects at Columbia was "Casualties of War," a big-budget  Vietnam drama starring Sean Penn and Michael J. Fox that the studio released in  August. Although the film drew some impressive reviews, its $17 million in  ticket sales fell far short of its $22.5-million budget.  </P> <P> The studio continues to hold high hopes for at least four other films  spearheaded by Steel -- "Revenge," a Ray Stark production starring Kevin  Costner; "Postcards From the Edge," based on Carrie Fisher's novel and directed  by Mike Nichols, with Meryl Streep starring; "Flatliners," a drama about  Harvard medical students starring Kiefer Sutherland and Julia Roberts, and  "Awakenings," a Penny Marshall-directed drama starring Robert De Niro and Robin  Williams.  </P> <P> Guber and Peters will inherit these projects, as well as about 16 Tri-Star  films already scheduled for or in release, including "Steel Magnolias,"  "Glory," "Family Business," "Music Box," "Mountains of the Moon," "Blind Fury"  and "Loose Cannons."  </P> <P> They also will inherit an exclusive production agreement with Michael Douglas,  as well as non-exclusive deals with a dozen artists and film makers that Steel  brought onto the Columbia lot, including actors Sally Field, Cher, Madonna,  Glenn Close and Jane Fonda.  </P></p>

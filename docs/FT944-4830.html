			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / CSCE agrees to Karabakh peace operation A conflict that has cast a long shadow over oil drilling contracts worth up to Dollars 8bn moved closer to resolution yesterday when the summit of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe agreed in principle to send a peacekeeping force to the war zone of Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-populated enclave of Azerbaijan. Tens of thousands of people have been killed, and 20 per cent of Azerbaijan's territory has been wrested from government control, by a war which broke out in 1988 and has driven over a million people from their homes. Azerbaijan recently signed what it described as the 'contract of the century' with a consortium led by BP for the extraction of oil from the Caspian Sea. But Russia, which has broadly supported the Armenian side in the past two years of war, has challenged the contract's validity and is obstructing moves to build the pipeline which would be necessary to transport the oil. Azerbaijan claims Russia is using the war to destabilise the republic and prevent it from taking the benefit of its oil wealth. Moscow's assent to the idea of a multinational - as opposed to Russian-dominated - peacekeeping force was cautiously welcomed yesterday as a gesture which could bring stability to the region. However, diplomats warned that many points of detail were still outstanding. In a sign of Russia's continuing wish for freedom of action in the southern republics of the former Soviet Union, the summit failed to agree on a broader document setting out general principles for peacekeeping over which diplomats have been wrangling for many months. If it goes ahead, the operation will be the first such effort to be organised by the CSCE, a 53-nation body which has sought to carve a role for itself as a smaller version of the United Nations. Both the Nagorno-Karabakh force and the broader agreement of principles have been held up by Russia's insistence on having as free a hand as possible for its military activities in the former Soviet Union. Diplomats said the Baltic states, Croatia and Hungary were among the countries which had offered to provide troops for a force in Karabakh, which they expect to number about 3,000. Russia, which initially wanted to provide the main body of the force, has apparently now accepted that its soldiers will not amount to more than 30 per cent. Azerbaijan, supported by its close ally Turkey, has opposed the idea of a force dominated by Moscow, which over the past two years has broadly supported the Armenian cause. Turkey also hopes to provide 30 per cent of any force. However, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen, Danish prime minister, said it remained 'very uncertain' whether the Karabakh force would ever be constituted because so many detailed points were still outstanding. Hungary's President Arpad Goncz, chairing the summit, said of the Karabakh force: 'The CSCE has taken one of the most important decisions in its history.' Any satisfaction was balanced, however, by disappointment on the sensitive issue of 'third-party peacekeeping', a term that in practice refers mainly to Russian arbitration in the disputes of its smaller neighbours. Several CSCE members - including the US, and the Baltic states - remain suspicious of Moscow's claim to be an impartial holder of the ring in the multiple wars that have broken out on the periphery of the former Soviet Union. In Moldova and Georgia, Russian officials have made no secret of their sympathy for pro-Moscow secessionist movements.</p>

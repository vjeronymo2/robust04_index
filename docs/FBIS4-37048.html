			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Avinash Singh: "It's sleek, but punch is </F> deadly"]    [Text] New Delhi, June 4    A bolt from the blue, sleek and deadly;       It knows no friends, only enemies;       A weapon of today; it shall remain,       The weapon of tomorrow    India's Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme  (IGMDP), aimed at the country emerging as a missile power not  dependent on outside technology, got a major boost today when  the third generation surface-to-surface medium-range Bharal  Dynamics Limited (Hyderabad) product Prithvi hit its  pre-determined target at Wheelers Island 75 km from the point of  its take-off at Chandipur-on-sea in Orissa.    This was the 12th successful trial in 13 attempts since the  first silver-white 40-250 km range missile was test-fired from  Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh in February 1988. The weekend's  achievement is a watershed as it was the first user's trial, to  be followed by another on Monday and more under battlefield  conditions in land firing ranges in other parts of the country  soon.    While Saturday's glitch-free launch from a movable-launcher  established India's credentials as a missile power that can  deliver a range of such weapons of tomorrow anytime. The trial  should also set the speculation at rest that India was bowing to  any pressure to abandon its missile programme under any external  pressure.    Early this year India had accomplished its "mission" as far  as perfecting its capability in the Intermediate Range Ballistic  Missile (IRBM) was concerned by successful test-launching of  1,200-2,500 km range Agni.    Prithvi's trial came close on the heels of the announcement  that low-level quick reaction Trishul and medium-range  high-altitude Akash missile are ready for induction in the Army  after their user's trials are through. The `fire and forget'  anti-tank missile Nag has already made its prowess known to many.    If Agni was the first Indian missile in the true ballistic  class, Prithvi, one of the most advanced projectiles, is India's  own version of Scud. While Scud follows ballistic trajectory,  Prithvi's flight throughout is controlled by an on board  computer. The last Prithvi trial was conducted on May 30 1993.    Prithvi definitely gives India a better option to attack  static targets, important defence installations, air defence  sites, ordnance factories and large army maintenance areas which  should fall in it range.    Earlier, in two Indo-Pak wars these installations were  attacked by Indian Air Force bombers. In today's advanced world  of early airborne warning system (AWACS), and improved radar  systems, it is easy to detect an enemy plane and neutralise it.    However, in case of theatre ballistic missile, that Prithvi  is, it is difficult to detect it on radar and also find out its  trajectory and impact point because of its supersonic speed and  limited flight time.    Covering of 75 kms in four minutes time today was a pointer  to the fact that very few weapons could be effectively used  against an astra like this. It certainly is an offensive weapon  with clinical. [sentence as published]    To quote an Indian expert: "Prithvi is extremely accurate  (its circular error probability -- CEP -- is lower than most  missiles of its class) and four of them can devastate front of  an attacking army effectively blunting an enemy attack on the  ground."    As per some of the international defence journals, Prithvi  can carry several types of warhead like high explosive,  prefragmented, cluster munitions and fuel air explosives (FAE).  The last mentioned can cause four time the damage done by an  ordinary nuclear bomb. These journals insist that Prithvi has  the capability to carry nuclear and chemical warheads too, a  factor on which Indian scientists are tight-lipped.    Prof Abdul Kalam, who along with Maj. Gen. V.J. Sundram, is  the brain behind the Prithvi project has, however, said more  than once that this missile can carry five types of conventional  warheads only.    Prithvi, which is being projected as the biggest threat to  Pakistan's security and the one that could disturb the arms  balance in the Indian sub-continent according to Americans,  interestingly has most of its components locally made. Only  five to ten per cent of its parts like precision sensors  microprocessors and special alloy used for its silver-white  exterior are imported.    Among the munitions developed for Prithvi are the deadly  cluster bomblets, which are released while the missile is still  in the air. Each of these bomblets is designed to piece armour  or shower lethal mental fragments, a capability that is proving  to be Pakistan's anethema.    The 1.1 m diameter battlefield tactical missile can come in  two versions -- the 250 km range type with 500 kg payload and  150 km range projectile with 1,000 kg payload. The target  shooting range could be increased or decreased by altering the  angles.    The only failure in 13 trials so far has been when the  missile was commanded to do a 15 degree roll. Perfection has  since been in this category too.</p>

He said  numerous problems have been solved after signing the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement. He stressed Egypt's readiness to  try to help overcome the remaining problems if requested to do  so. The remarks came in a joint news conference held by Foreign  Minister Musa and the director of the PLO Political Department,  Faruq Qaddumi, following their talks in Cairo this afternoon.  He said he and Qaddumi discussed the latest developments  relating to the peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli track.  He said they discussed issues relating to Egyptian-Palestinian  coordination, noting that Qaddumi will leave Cairo for Amman  tomorrow to complete discussions on Jordanian-Palestinian  coordination within the framework of Arab coordination and  boosting the peace process.    Musa said the discussions in Cairo a few days ago were  useful  and very serious, noting that a paper containing the elements  left outstanding has been prepared. He said there are numerous  papers and ideas relevant to the remaining points and we  understand both parties' positions. He stressed that the  picture is not gloomy, because both parties are concerned with  reaching an agreement to implement the Declaration of Principles  signed by them. He said it is only natural that such a  complicated issue should involve differences in views between  the two sides, noting that numerous points have been resolved  and the remaining ones are few in comparison. He said he  expects the negotiations to resume soon.    Qaddumi said the goal of his visit to Egypt is to explain  all  the developments in the Palestinian arena. He said: Our task  focuses on relations between the PLO and Egypt and on completing  coordination and cooperation with Jordan and Syria, because Arab  coordination is an important factor that will enhance the  negotiating position and maintain the peace process. He thanked  Egypt for its efforts and role in advancing the peace process.    Qaddumi said the PLO's relations with Jordan are  distinguished and he described 'Amr Musa's visit to Jordan  yesterday as important and fraternal, falling within the  framework of achieving Arab coordination. He said there is no  document of understanding between the Palestinians and Israelis  but ideas for discussion. He said negotiations must continue  and both parties should remain concerned with reaching an  agreement, which should be reached eventually.    Qaddumi pointed out that despite his opposition to several  articles of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, he is putting his  hand in the hand of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, because  differences in views do not mean division, rather distribution  of roles. He said PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas  will continue to head the Palestinian delegation to the Liaison  Committee meetings. He stressed that Israel's failure to  implement the Declaration of Principles on time on 12 December  is considered to be a violation of the agreement. He stressed  that the Palestinians insist on continuing the negotiations and  on honestly implementing the articles of the Declaration of  Principles, highlighting that Israel should comply with this.  He called on the United States to exert its good offices as a  sponsor of the peace conference.</p>

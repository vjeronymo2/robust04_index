			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NIGHT LIFE: UNITED NATIONS HIP-HOPS WITH RACIAL HARMONY  </P> <P> It's somewhere around 1 a.m. somewhere on the eastern fringe of Hollywood, and  somebody on a tiny stage in a big hall steps up to a microphone and bellows:  </P> <P> "Somebody, everybody, anybody . . . screammmmm."  </P> <P> He tells the crowd to throw their hands in the air and to wave them as if they  just don't care. He asks the ladies in the house to say "owwwww." And many of  them do.  </P> <P> By now, most everyone realizes that the people with the man on stage are  members of the progressive hip-hop posse Boogie Down Productions -- guests on  "The Arsenio Hall Show" just a few hours earlier -- making a surprise  appearance at this club.  </P> <P> The club deejay at the side of the stage gestures wildly, the beat from Audio  Two's rap hit "Top Billing" thuds from the massive speakers, and the man with  the microphone begins to rap, first haltingly and then more fluently, until a  woman rapper seizes the mike and embellishes the beat with her melodic island  lilt.  </P> <P> Boogie Down's KRS-One takes over, rapping in a quick, reggae-toaster style,  lashing out in raw, spontaneous rhyme against racism and the bullies of the  Bush Administration, darting in and out of and enlivening the monotonous,  bass-heavy beat.  </P> <P> He works the crowd, prodding it, flirting, building to a delighted roar.  KRS-One's never been much live -- he depends on the audience to know every word  -- but he's electric here. As suddenly as the rapping started, it ends, a mere  10 minutes later. And half the house keeps on dancing, oblivious to anything  but the beat.  </P> <P> MTV and Rolling Stone look for the Summer of Love in every Parisian soca joint  and Ecstasy-soaked Manchester disco, but the real thing might be going down  every Tuesday night in an aging L.A. ballroom: an ongoing festival of peace,  love and understanding that vibrates to the sound of rap music, a crossroads of  Afro-centric youth culture that just happens to work as a wildly popular dance  club.  </P> <P> United Nations is the cultural arm of the Zulu Nation, a loose, international  collective of musicians, organizers and graffiti artists that dates back to the  earliest days of rap. (Any time you see an artist wearing an Afrika medallion  in a video or on stage -- Public Enemy, Kool Moe Dee, Ice-T, De La Soul, even  Milli Vanilli and Bobby Brown -- he or she is probably down with the Zulus.)  </P> <P> The club is a utopian fantasy of a '90s hip-hop discotheque, 1,500 young people  of every conceivable ethnic group bobbing mostly drug-free until 3 a.m.,  brightly colored peace signs and tie-dyes and Afrika medallions everywhere.  </P> <P> It's the kind of groovy racial harmony rarely seen outside a Soul II Soul  video: black and white and Asian and Latino slamming side-by-side to the beat.  If you could set the Rainbow Coalition to music it would look something like  this.  </P> <P> "Hip-hop is a true culture, and we present it as honestly as we can. . . . The  music, the dance, the African fashion, the graffiti art," says Zulu Nation  leader Afrika Islam. "The kind of freestyle dancing you see in videos and at  the club dates back to Africa -- it's a genuine part of our culture. Even break  dancing is coming back, because the music is intense and United Nations is a  place to do it among peers."  </P> <P> Islam, United Nations' star deejay and the man who creates the beats for  Ice-T's records, has been involved in hip-hop since at least the mid-'70s,  first as the right hand to hip-hop innovator Afrika ("Planet Rock") Bambaataa  in the South Bronx, then in the Rock Steady Zulu Kings.  </P> <P> Brought to California by Ice-T about 10 years ago, he has spun at many of the  best L.A. dance clubs -- including Radio, near MacArthur Park, the first local  rap club -- and he brought out, in turn, several of the early Bronx rappers to  work with Ice-T's Rhyme Syndicate and with the club. Old-school Bronx hip-hop  makes its home in Hollywood these days.  </P> <P> The core Zulu audience coalesced near the end of the '80s at Water the Bush, a  rap-oriented dance club at Hollywood Live, a hall across the street from Mann's  Chinese Theatre.  </P> <P> After that club closed late last year, United Nations opened its doors at the  Stardust Ballroom, on Sunset just west of Western.  </P> <P> In L.A., dance clubs move around a lot -- some people think a new location  renews a club's energy. Since Boogie Down Productions' impromptu performance at  the Stardust, United Nations has moved twice.  </P> <P> After a couple of weeks back at Hollywood Live, it's now ensconced in the  cavernous, 1,500-capacity dance hall called the Casa, south of downtown at the  corner of Washington and Oak. Whatever the location, the spirit remains intact.  </P> <P> Branches are scheduled to open in Tokyo in October and in London next January.  Zulu Nation members work the door, make the art, furnish the music, provide  security.  </P> <P> United Nations partner Fareed estimates there are 100 Nation members in L.A.,  but maybe 5,000 "affiliates." What is an affiliate?  </P> <P> "Someone who will come to the club and buy a T-shirt and dance."  </P> <P> Over the dance floor swing black lights and disco balls, red-glowing globes and  fluorescent ankhs, peace signs, Africa-shaped cutouts, Islamic stars and  crescent moons and Zulu-type masks; the flags of all nations hang in an arc.  </P> <P> At one end of the room, Bruce Lee and Ice-T videos play, without sound, on a  screen. At the other is a deserted bar. . . . People here mostly don't drink.  In a corner, a photographer takes a picture of three blondes against a  wild-style graffiti mural.  </P> <P> A percentage of the club's profits goes to Justiceville, Ted Hayes' coalition  for the homeless; Earth Day and Malcolm X's birthday are celebrated in a big  way.  </P> <P> The songs blasting are mostly familiar to any "Yo! MTV Raps" listener -- Tone  Loc, Heavy D, Big Daddy Kane, Queen Latifah -- and flow seamlessly, often for  only a minute or two each. The original cowbell version of LL Cool J's "Rock  the Bells" slides into Eric B.'s "I Know You Got Soul" so smoothly that it's  impossible to decide where one record ends and the other begins.  </P> <P> Two records play at once more often than you would think, one beat reinforcing  the other; the scratching is usually slick enough to have been part of the mix  to begin with. At least half the music is rap "oldies." Time hasn't made  Run-DMC's "Rock Box" any easier to dance to, but people try.  </P> <P> In an incense-scented room off the entrance, a few dozen slower-moving people  skank methodically to reggae and the funkier types of world music -- island  versions of the "Ghostbusters" theme -- under a dim, black-light glow.  Somewhere else, vendors sell African beads, dashikis and all manner of bootleg  Bart Simpson shirts, also tithing to Justiceville.  </P> <P> The club's flyers, thrust on you at rap shows and underground clubs, specify  Zulu attire. What constitutes Zulu attire? Well, anything really: tight body  shirts and biker shorts, if you can get away with them, polka dots or bold  stripes, berets, Egyptian toques, clean college sweat shirts, big hoop  earrings, overalls with one strap hanging off the shoulder, or a tight dress.  "Anything but jeans and T-shirts, really," Islam said. "A peaceful attitude  extends to peaceful attire."  </P> <P> United Nations -- whatever its location -- is the place to wear that special  saffron-and-scarlet Nefertiti gown. If you're a rapper yourself, or know one,  you might wear a black cap with your crew name or a sports emblem on it; if  you're a Japanese tourist, you'll wear many yards of West African kinte cloth,  maybe a blouse-like dashiki with wildly contrasting bloomers, because that's  what it says to do in the magazines. Leather Afrika medallions, Rastabart  shirts and anything red, black and green.  </P> <P> Late most nights, Islam takes over the turntables, and he layers bits of songs,  speeding some up, kicking a short phrase from turntable to turntable so the  groove seems to last forever. When you're dancing, you may not notice Big Daddy  Kane asking, "Won't you be my beefaroni" until the sixth or seventh repetition.  </P> <P> "Whassup," says a young black man to the big Samoan with ceremonial braids. The  young man adjusts his L.A. Kings cap, then sweeps across the club, people  nodding in recognition, and disappears into the crowd.  </P> <P> Later he pops up in a corner of the room, doing a credible imitation of someone  who has stuck his finger into an electric socket, jerking to a Cool Rob G tune,  and a circle forms around him.  </P> <P> After an hour or so, when the break dancers are exhausted and the hangers-on  are bored, a skinny kid jumps into the circle, falls face first, catching  himself at ground level, and launches into a complicated whirl, flipping and  vaulting and tucking his legs in a spectacular display.  </P> <P> Enraged, a couple of dancers rush him, and boom, Zulu security hustles them out  the back door in seconds, before anyone realizes what's happened. Even in a  club dedicated to peace and unity, the real world sometimes intrudes.  </P></p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Action over ulcer drug is dropped Mylan Laboratories of the US said yesterday that SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US drugs company, had dropped its patent and trademark lawsuit filed last week against Mylan over Tagamet, the ulcer drug. The US patent on Tagamet, once SmithKline's best-selling drug, expired at midnight. Mylan said it will launch its generic version today. Mylan will join two other manufacturers, Canada's Novopharm, and an alliance between US companies Du Pont and Merck to sell the generic drug - cimetidine. SmithKline and Novopharm settled a separate patent and trademark dispute out of court on Monday. Both actions were over the alleged visual similarity between the generic manufacturers cimetidine tablets and Tagamet. Novopharm agreed to darken the green colour of its product. SmithKline has said that up to 10 generics manufacturers may eventually enter the market. Novopharm has said it expects the generic price to be 30 per cent to 50 per cent below that of the branded drug. Recent cases of other big-selling drugs running out of patent protection suggest that an 80 per cent discount is likely within 12 months. Tagamet sales are worth Dollars 1bn (Pounds 664m) a year.

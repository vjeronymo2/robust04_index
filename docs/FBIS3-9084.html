			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 18 Mar (TANJUG) -- "The Croats and the  Muslims today exercised their sovereign right to decide on how  they wish to live and, as long as this is not aimed against the  Serbs, we are ready to accept this agreement as their choice,"  president of the Srpska republic Radovan Karadzic said while  commenting on the signing of the Croat-Muslim agreement. "We are  closely examining every individual implication of that  agreement, hoping that it will lead to peace," he added.    Commenting on U.S. President Clinton's statement on the need  to include the Serb side, with the aim of achieving total peace,  the Srpska republic president said that the Serbs are ready to  join every peace process. "We are already involved in the peace  process under the patronage of the European Union, and we are  ready to sign a peace agreement at any time, but we expect  guarantees that all three sides would be treated equally, which  includes the issue of the lifting of the sanctions," Karadzic  said.    Asked by correspondents how he interpreted Izetbegovic's  statement in Washington today, when Izetbegovic emphasized the  problem of preserving the old borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Karadzic said that today's events have created a completely new  international legal and political situation.    "In this respect you cannot have your cake and eat it too.  This is a new state created on the basis of their sovereign  rights. We can either be sorry or happy for being excluded from  this state of theirs, but the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina as  desired by Mr. Izetbegovic simply no longer exist. In fact,  they have never really existed because we never accepted the  idea of a Bosnia outside Yugoslavia," President Karadzic said.</p>

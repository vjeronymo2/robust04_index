			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Seafield terminates Imari merger talks Seafield, the Dublin-based transport and distribution company, yesterday announced that talks with Imari concerning a possible merger had been broken off. The board of Seafield came under fire last month when a group of shareholders called for an extraordinary meeting to consider a change of leadership at the company. The dissident shareholders last week wrote to other shareholders outlining their reasons for seeking to replace Mr Brian Chilver, chairman, and Mr Richard Hayes, a director. They have nominated Mr Robert Cosby for chairman, and Mr Tony Wilson, a former executive chairman of the group. The dissidents, who speak for 25.4 per cent of the share capital, catalogue the 'dismal trading and acquisition record' under the present management. However, Seafield said that the company's problems had been caused by the purchase of Charterhall Properties when Mr Wilson was chairman. Charterhall was sold last October. Mr Chilver said the group would be writing to shareholders this week. The extraordinary meeting has been convened for June 10. Last summer Waterglade International, the property group, withdrew an attempt to replace Seafield's board.</p>

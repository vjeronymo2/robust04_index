			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena, Colombia, 26 Apr (PL) -- Today, a Cuban  representative charged that the United States is still violating  UN resolutions and deviating from the spirit of cooperation that  exists in America by maintaining and intensifying the economic  blockade against Cuba. The statement was made by Jorge Garcia, a  member of the Cuban delegation to the 25th period of sessions of  the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean  (ECLA), in response to a U.S. participant.    The U.S. delegate to the UN forum on regional economic  mechanisms tried to respond to charges made this morning by  Ernesto Melendez, state minister for economic cooperation. In  his speech, Melendez described as incongruous the fact that his  country continues to endure -- as it has done for over one-third  of a century -- the U.S. imposed economic blockade amid a  continental climate of commercial liberalization. A member of  the Washington committee responded later, trying to justify the  economic pressure on the Caribbean island with the same  arguments used 30 years ago.    In his counterresponse, Garcia, an official of Cuba's State  Committee for Economic Cooperation, recalled that Melendez based  his charge on UN General Assembly resolutions approved by an  overwhelming majority and by virtually all the representatives  at the ECLA event.    Such documents have the fundamental objective of ending a  blatant violation of international law and recognized principles  of coexistence among nations, he stated. In reality, the  blockade policy that even U.S. groups have begun to question  lately has been intensified.    He added that Washington is seriously affecting the economic  interests of U.S. businessmen. Garcia also termed Washington's  policy of aggression against Cuba as disproportionate, unreal,  and a failure to heed the call of the international community  and U.S. allies by "disassociating itself completely from the  spirit of cooperation" in ECLA.    "Cuba is a small country geographically speaking, but we  will  continue to grow if that is what it takes to defend our  legitimate right to sovereignty and self-determination," Garcia  stated.</p>

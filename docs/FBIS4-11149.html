			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The conference entitled the Nation and the Emigre  Community continues today with an analysis of the matter of  current relations and prospects between the nation and the Cuban  community abroad. This topic was addressed by Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina. Here is a report on this morning's  session by journalists Zenaida Costales, Maria Elena Alonso, and  Orlando Contreras [as heard]:    [Begin Contreras recording] Upon talking this morning about  emigration problems, their origin, the nature of this  conference, and the desire to pursue work jointly with the  emigre community in order to normalize relations, Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina said that Cuba realizes the time has  come for consular facilities to exist not only in Washington,  and that the U.S. authorities are aware of this opinion.    Robaina said he felt it was necessary to give this  conference  some continuity, and also said he feels that the diversity of  ideas within the emigre community should not constitute an  obstacle to continuing this work.    The foreign minister said: Cuba is not giving up on the  emigres, and the emigres are not giving up on the fatherland.  Robaina explained: The society summoning them is not a bankrupt  society, and added that all the proposals being presented at  this meeting will be studied.    The foreign minister summed up the history of Cuban  emigration, the historical circumstances surrounding it, and its  nuances -- from Heredia to Wilfredo Lam -- and the  (?fundamental) differences that exist between the emigre  community in favor of annexation, and that part of the community  that demands that the nation's sovereignty, history, and culture  remain intact and linked to its projected future, both inside  the United States and in other countries.    Robaina's words led to a discussion that, like the first  day's, unfolded within a framework of respect and a willingness  to seek feasible solutions, the culmination of which obviously  overflows the framework of this conference of only three working  days.    However, to judge by the statements of emigres, problem  areas  and possible solutions are being identified; and areas for  concrete proposals by the emigre community to the nation --  topics such as the emigres' entry into and exit from Cuba; the  positive tone of the change in perceptions of an important part  of the emigre community, also linked to the nation's  understanding toward those Cubans; and other specific matters.  Just a few moments ago, conference spokesman Miguel Alfonso gave  a briefing [preceding word in English] on this morning's work.  [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Washington, May 4 (TANJUG) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton said on Tuesday evening he wanted the warring sides in  the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to return to  the negotiating table, reach peace and establish normal peaceful  relations. He said he also wanted such relations with Serbia  but added that it had to be done in a correct and moral way. He  made the statement at an annual rally at the headquarters of the  CNN television network in Atlanta which was devoted to foreign  policy issues.    Clinton declined, however, to give a straight answer to the  question put by a Yugoslav journalist on whether the time had  come to start treating equally all parties to the Bosnian  conflict (Moslems, Serbs and Croats) and stop threatening the  Serbs alone. The U.S. President said he was not inclined to the  lifting of the U.N. sanctions against the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) and added, as an argument, that  Serbia had allegedly violated the U.N. embargo on arms  deliveries and had been arming the Bosnian Serbs.    Serbia sends to the Bosnian Serbs only humanitarian supplies  which include food, medicaments and clothes, while the U.N. arms  embargo is being violated by the he former Yugoslav Republics of  Slovenia and Croatia, which are directly arming Bosnian Croats  and Moslems and allowing the Islamic and some western countries  to smuggle arms into Bosnia-Herzegovina through their  territories.    Clinton said he agreed that there could be no military  solution to the Bosnian conflict and, in corroboration of the  view, mentioned a Serb attempt to "gain advantage" in the  eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde. He overlooked the fact that  Gorazde -- a U.N.-designated "safe area" which should have been  demilitarised last spring -- had been abused by the Bosnian  Moslems and used as a military stronghold for launching an  offensive on Serb territories late in March.    When the Serb side launched a counter-attack and the Moslems  faced a total defeat, U.S. NATO warplanes bombed Serb positions  around the town on April 10 and 11. Clinton said that the U.S.  was trying to use NATO's air force to protect "safe areas" but  that the chief objective was the return to the negotiating  table. He stressed that the U.S. did not want to get involved  in the Bosnian war on the Moslem side either alone or through  NATO.    Clinton said the U.S. Administration had conveyed to the  Bosnian Moslem [word indistinct] that it could not expect  support from the U.S. to change the military balance of forces  and that a peaceful settlement was the only solution.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Belgrade, 8 Feb (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime  Minister Radoje Kontic today held a meeting in the Palace of the  Federation with the prime ministers of the republics of Serbia  and Montenegro, Nikola Sainovic and Milo Djukanovic, the Federal  Ministry of Information has announced.    The meeting was attended by Dragoslav Avramovic; Bozidar  Gazidova, deputy governor of the Yugoslav National Bank; Zarija  Martinovic, managing director of the payment transactions  service, and a number of federal ministers. They examined the  implementation of this year's economic policy and the program of  reconstruction of the monetary system and Yugoslavia's economic  recovery.    It was concluded that significant results beyond  expectations  have been achieved in the implementation of the anti-inflation  program, primarily as regards the purchase of foreign currency,  market supply, and the reduction of hyperinflation. The  Yugoslav National Bank has up to today purchased foreign  currency to the tune of 54 million new dinars, and at the same  time has sold only 3 million German marks, which shows that the  foreign currency reserves of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  have increased by 51 million German marks in 17 days of  implementing the economic program. In addition, the level of  prices over the past seven days dropped by 0.5 percent compared  with the previous week. Some 150 million new dinars and 5  million German marks have been deposited in business bank  accounts. The Yugoslav National Bank has printed notes: 227  million new dinars have been forwarded to the payment  transaction service, and 271 million new dinars to business  banks. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Such woolly ideas Once it was fur coats. Now, since fashion gurus have obscured the difference between real and ersatz hides, it is woolly jumpers. Shops one thought of as staid - the Scottish knitwear specialists, with their changeless tartan ties and avuncular cardigans - have become targets of the Animal Rights Militia. This is the organisation which gutted the Cambridge store of Edinburgh Woollen Mills earlier in the month. The local animal rights spokesman allocated precise credit for the action to a guerrilla sub-group of his movement, known as the Justice Department. And justice, he said, had been done on the grounds that 'sheep-shearing leaves sheep susceptible and cold as a naked human.' This was not an isolated incident. The Cambridge branch of Boots the Chemists was set alight, and certain research units around Britain have received a new sort of home-made bomb: an exploding mousetrap primed with razor blades. This aims not only to remove the digits of those scientists suspected of animal abuse, but also makes a statement on behalf of mice, so often the choice for laboratory tests. A flurry, then, of animal rights activity. There is nothing new in this. But the extension of anathema-status to pullovers is new, and it is always interesting to watch how the British deal with such issues, for the British make it part of their self-definition that they are kind to animals when others in Europe, especially southern Europe, are not. This nationalistic pride was trumpeted during European negotiations about rules for transporting livestock. Even those of us who like a good steak, it seems, are concerned that the ox shall travel to his slaughter in decent comfort. Gourmets will point out that a well-rested beast tastes better, so this is not pure charity; still, it is true that the British get angry about the ill-treatment of animals, and in that sense the animal rights movement is never entirely marginal. Whether many wool-wearing people or even woolly liberals will ever feel pity for chilly sheep is doubtful. But translating kindness towards animals into justice for animals is something that we ought to take more seriously than we do, and scientists, with distinguished exceptions, such as James Gaia Lovelock, are too quiet about it. Those activists who resort to pyromania are probably not the sort to engage in rational argument. Yet it is a debate which used to be very much alive in pagan philosophy. Pythagoras, who first articulated vegetarianism in the sixth century BC, was only one of many thinkers who addressed animal rights. But Christian theologians from St Augustine onwards have quelled the issue, being content to accept the animal kingdom as a part of creation subordinate to human needs. According to St Augustine, if we took the commandment 'Thou shalt not kill' as an injunction not to slaughter animals, we should also have to prohibit ourselves from uprooting parsnips. This is what logicians call a slide. To say that one move will lead to another is a familiar method for blocking moral progress. Faced with a man who believes that sheep should not be shorn, we might then insist that he abstain from the consumption of honey, milk and eggs - all of which have been regarded as theft by some legally-minded purists - and, like St Augustine, challenge him to wrench a happy parsnip from the earth. The application of human justice to the animal world hinges, as Richard Sorabji demonstrated recently in Animal Minds and Human Morals (Duckworth), on how far we consider animals to share in the human capacity for reason. Charles Darwin believed that there was no human trait which could not be found reflected in one animal or another; but modern scientists, following Aristotle, have been forced to use an exclusion zone based on a technicality. The technicality is that animals have no syntax. It follows that if a creature cannot construct a sentence, then we are at liberty to do with it what we will in the slaughterhouse or the research institute. Consideration of babies, parrots and chimpanzees will immediately generate worries about the absolute logic of this technicality. Indeed, it is hard to see what relevance it has in a debate which is primarily about pain and the capacity of living things to feel it. Pythagoras stopped a man beating a dog because he recognised in the dog's yelps the voice of an old friend. Most of us, if we think about it, will admit unease about testing chemicals on beagles. That does not mean, necessarily, that we would not wish chemicals to be tried on rats, nor that we should charitably prefer to wear nylon rather than wool. What matters is that we give the matter some thought. In that sense, one has to feel grateful for the occasional arson attack. Crass as they are, such actions are not unfounded. They rightly make us think.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Victoria Carpet up at Pounds 456,000 Victoria Carpet Holdings, the Worcestershire-based carpet and carpet yarn manufacturer lifted pre-tax profits to Pounds 456,000 in the half year to September 30 on sales of Pounds 17.1m. The outcome compared with profits last time of Pounds 227,000 on turnover of Pounds 16.4m. In a cautiously optimistic statement, Mr John Bettinson, chairman, said that although margins remained under pressure, the industry had shown signs of recovery in recent weeks. 'There are also signs that export sales are increasing as confidence returns to the international contract market,' he said. Earnings per share emerged at 4.17p (2.03p): 'We see no reason at this stage why the year-end dividend should be returned to its previous level,' Mr Bettinson said.</p>

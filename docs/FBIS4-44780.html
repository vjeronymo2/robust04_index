			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Shafts Cut Weight by 70 Percent in </F> Naval Use"]    [Text] Shafts made of a new composite material which is  stronger than steel, reduces the weight up to 70 percent and  lowers installation and maintenance costs, have been introduced  by Applied Composites in Linkoping, south Sweden. The new  composite, made of carbon fibers, aramid and glass fibers, is in  use in an experimental craft, called Smyge, a stealth vessel for  the Swedish Royal Navy.    Shafts installed in Smyge, which has undergone four years of  extensive tests, have shown no signs of fatigue. According to  laboratory tests, shafts made of carbon composites transmit over  10 times more torque by weight than a steel shaft, or about  3,300 Nm per kg compared to 150 Nm per kg for a steel shaft.  Nor is it necessary to change the transmission system for the  installation of composite shafts which are available in a  standard production range of 6.5 meters or more in length and up  to 2 meters in diameter.    By combining different types of fibres and varying the  angles, shafts can be tailor-made for different purposes. Using  filament winding it is possible to make the composite shafts  stronger than steel said the company, which is part of the  Celsius Group, the leading Swedish defense industry. The fibers  most commonly used are glass, carbon and aramid with epoxy or  vinylester resin.    As composite shafts have a much higher critical speed than  conventional metal shafts, they can reduce or eliminate the need  of bearings.    Composite shafts are non-corrosive, non-magnetic,  non-conductive and have higher damage tolerance and reduced  vibrations. They can be used as drive shafts, wheel shafts,  rudder shafts and rods.    Weight reduction is one of the most important properties of  the composite shafts; a traditional metal shaft with a weight of  about 7 tons can for example be substituted by a composite shaft  weighting approximately 300 to 400 kg.</p>

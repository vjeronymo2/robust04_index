			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / VIDEOS: MOST OF BARBARA STANWYCK'S FINEST PERFORMANCES AVAILABLE  </P> <P> Most of the best movies of veteran screen star Barbara Stanwyck, who died last  week, have been released on video.  </P> <P> The bulk of her quality movies were made between the late '30s and the  mid-'50s. Here is the cream of that period -- all available on cassette:  </P> <P> "Stella Dallas" (Nelson, 1937). In one of the great no-holds-barred soap operas  of the 1930s, Stanwyck plays a good-hearted, lower-class woman who consistently  puts her daughter's happiness ahead of her own. Stella's unsophisticated ways  -- and horrible taste in clothes -- ultimately cause her social-climbing  daughter (Anne Shirley) much consternation. Of the great self-sacrificing  heroines, Stella is in a league with the Gladys George's suffering character in  the 1937 version of "Madame X" and Bette Davis' spinster in "The Old Maid."  </P> <P> "The Lady Eve" (MCA, 1941). One of the two or three best movies by  writer-director Preston Sturges. In this hearty romantic comedy, Stanwyck,  flashing impeccable comic timing in early scenes, plays a card-shark who works  the ritzy ocean-liner circuit, fleecing wealthy passengers. Her prize prey is a  shy millionaire (Henry Fonda). However, her con job goes awry when she falls  for her pigeon.  </P> <P> "Ball of Fire" (Nelson, 1941). In director Howard Hawks' fast-paced, screwball  comedy, Stanwyck stars as a tough-talking burlesque dancer who, while running  from the police, moves in with a group of stuffy professors who are working on  an encyclopedia. Of course, she falls for one of the scholars (Gary Cooper).  Even the out-of-control, slapstick ending doesn't really spoil this one. One of  Stanwyck's comic peaks.  </P> <P> "Meet John Doe" (Media, 1941). In one of director Frank Capra's more  sentimental homages to the common man, Stanwyck forcefully portrays a cynical,  conniving reporter who hatches a plan to turn a naive drifter (Gary Cooper)  into the leader of a national grass-roots movement. But a corrupt politician  (Edward Arnold) plots to use the scheme for his own devious purposes. Brimming  with wartime idealism and cornball Americana. Cooper's performance is really  the heart of this movie.  </P> <P> "Double Indemnity" (MCA, 1944). One of the best of the hard-boiled '40s  melodramas. Stanwyck plays a scheming wife who plans, with a smitten insurance  agent (Fred MacMurray), to kill her husband and collect the insurance. The  major obstacle is the agent's clever boss, played by Edward G. Robinson. As  good as Stanwyck is, she is overshadowed by MacMurray, who gives the best  performance of his career as the man led astray by illicit passion. The script  was co-written by detective novelist Raymond Chandler.  </P> <P> "Christmas in Connecticut" (MGM/UA, 1945). This is the wrong season for this  one, but so what? Stanwyck stars as a columnist who, to save her job, has to  arrange a cozy Christmas in Connecticut for a soldier (Dennis Morgan). Though  one of her more obscure movies, Stanwyck's chemistry with Morgan transcends  anything generated with Gary Cooper and Henry Fonda in more famous romantic  comedies.  </P> <P> "The Strange Love of Martha Ivers" (Kartes Video and Congress Video, 1946).  Terrific performance by Stanwyck as Ivers, a rich, powerful temptress with a  shady past. Her husband (Kirk Douglas, making his film debut) capitalizes on  her dark secret. One of the best evil-woman roles of her career, but this one  is usually neglected by fans and historians in favor of her work in "Double  Indemnity."  </P> <P> "Sorry, Wrong Number" (Paramount, 1948). This showy, somewhat overwrought  performance was her last good shot at a best-actress Oscar but she lost out to  Jane Wyman in "Johnny Belinda." Stanwyck plays an obnoxious, bedridden woman  who torments her husband (Burt Lancaster). Overhearing a murder plot on the  phone, she figures out that she's the target.  </P> <P> "Executive Suite" (MGM/UA, 1954). Taut, well-written, star-studded drama of  corporate in-fighting, co-starring William Holden, June Allyson, Fredric March  and Shelly Winters. Stanwyck is effective in a relatively small role as a  pivotal stockholder, but it's really Holden's movie.  </P> <P> The best of rest on video:  </P> <P> "Golden Boy" (RCA/Columbia, 1939). Notable as William Holden's debut as a  leading man, but he is guilty of overacting (as are Stanwyck and Lee J. Cobb)  in this tale of a young man who choses boxing over a career in music. Clifford  Odets' dialogue now seems laughably overripe.  </P> <P> "Lady of Burlesque" (Video Yesteryear, 1943). Lively suspense comedy about the  search for a killer who is strangling strippers with their own G-strings.  </P> <P> "Clash by Night" (United, 1952). Moody love triangle with Stanwyck effectively  playing an unhappy wife. Co-starring Paul Douglas, Robert Ryan and, in a  secondary role, Marilyn Monroe. Very hard to find in video stores.  </P> <P> "Blowing Wild" (Republic, 1953). Underrated, steamy action-adventure tale about  another love triangle involving an oil baron (Anthony Quinn), his wife  (Stanwyck) and her ex-lover (Gary Cooper).  </P> <P> "Cattle Queen of Montana" (Buena Vista, 1954). The best thing about this  routine Western, featuring Stanwyck as a powerful rancher battling Indians and  crooks, is the spectacular scenery. But it's infamous because it boasts  possibly the worst performance in the career of co-star Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> "The Maverick Queen" (Republic, 1955). Rousing action Western about a feisty  bad girl (Stanwyck as a saloon owner) falling for a good-guy lawman (Barry  Sullivan).  </P> <P> Not yet on video but worth seeing if and when available:  </P> <P> "The Bitter Tea of General Yen" (1933), "Always Goodbye" (1938), "Union  Pacific" (1939), "The Two Mrs. Carrolls" (1938, co-starring Humphrey Bogart),  "The Furies" (1950), "All I Desire" (1953), "Witness to Murder" (1954), "The  Violent Men" (1955) and "There's Always Tomorrow" (1956).  </P></p>

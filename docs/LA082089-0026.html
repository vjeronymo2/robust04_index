			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HER WORLD: EXPLAINING THE BARN BARRAGE  </P> <P> The New Englander walked into my California home, glanced around -- upstairs  and down -- and said: "I had no idea you were so crazy for barns."  </P> <P> I did not deny it, but how could he know? My house is modern.  </P> <P> "Look at your art," he went on. "There are barns in every room."  </P> <P> He pointed to a barn in the background of an acrylic landscape of the lesser  Andrew Wyeth sort, a barn that was only incidental. He pounced on a large  mixed-media work that featured a stark white horse barn with empty windows -- a  work I had bought on an autumn afternoon in Woods Hole, Mass., while waiting  for a ferry to Martha's Vineyard.  </P> <P> He led me to an oil painting by a Polish artist, which I thought of as a wintry  study of barren trees and angles, a moody work in whites, browns and blacks. I  found it at a gallery in Geneva. Sure enough, there is a building in it, but I  swear it's a cottage.  </P> <P> His next target was a sand casting by Charles Faust of San Diego, an ethereal  white-on-white work that I treasure for its abstract roots and full moon. Yes,  there's a hint of a structure on the folds of sand.  </P> <P> Finally the New Englander pointed to a small wooden object the size of a rural  postbox, a work of gleaming pear wood and cherry that stands on round brass  feet. "That obviously is a barn -- a carved, toy barn."  </P> <P> "Wrong," I said stubbornly. "That is a doghouse -- an antique French doghouse  that I bought in Asprey's in London on Christmas Eve and paid far too much for  and have never regretted it."  </P> <P> He smiled at my mad confession.  </P> <P> Still, while my friend saw some barns that weren't there, his premise was  correct: I love barns and covered bridges and autumn leaves. And I love seeing  them together along the byways of New England.  </P> <P> The most awesome barn I've visited is the 1826 Shaker masterpiece in Hancock  Village, just outside Pittsfield in western Massachusetts.  </P> <P> This round stone barn is bigger than life, rising in simple glory amid rolling  hills. The functional beauty of its architecture meant that wagons entered the  vast top level to empty hay into a central haymow. Stables radiated from a  manger at mid-level so that one person could feed the herd. Manure pits were  below.  </P> <P> Hancock was an active Shaker community from 1781 to 1960; now it is a museum  village that tells the story of the "Shaking Quakers" who came to America from  England and practiced communal living and hard work.  </P> <P> There are barns for all seasons in New England, but autumn is my favorite time  to ramble along those roads.  </P> <P> Golden birch leaves were splattering down as I drove into Brattleboro, Vt., and  saw a grand old barn of rain-darkened wood. Light streamed from its open doors  and from the hayloft above.  </P> <P> This, for me, was Vermont: substantial, proud, inviting. I slowed in the dusk  to read the sign: FITNESS BARN. Inside were shiny exercise bikes and  body-building machines. So much for fat cows and tradition.  </P> <P> New England's graceful barns house more than stock or feed, tractors or trucks.  Some have become country stores fragrant with apples, maple syrup and  extra-sharp Vermont Cheddar cheese. Others have been restored and converted as  restaurants, wayside inns, doctors' or dentists' offices, craft centers and  antique shops.  </P> <P> The ultimate spiffed-up model is The Inn at Sawmill Farm near West Dover, Vt.  With hand-hewn timbers and a decorator's flair, it is a place of studied  elegance. With swimming pool, skiing and golf nearby, it seems more country  club than country.  </P> <P> Barns have been turned into weekend homes and studios for artists, sculptors  and violin makers. The pale sun glints on skylights and solar panels atop  pitched roofs.  </P> <P> The New Hampshire town of North Conway has a pleasant setting east of the  streams and the green and crimson forests along Kancamagus Highway.  </P> <P> But scenery is not what brings visitors by the busload. North Conway's streets  are chockablock with factory outlets that offer brand-name discount  merchandise. One of the brighter cut-rate clusters is called the Red Barn.  </P> <P> Last October at the Old Tavern Inn of Grafton, Vt., a Colonial hostelry of  immense charm and high-back rocking chairs, I had two questions:  </P> <P> First, where were some good hiking paths? Answer: Try the cross-country ski  trails of winter.  </P> <P> Second, where was a public telephone?  </P> <P> The woman at the reception desk pointed over her shoulder and smiled. "The  phone's in the barn."  </P> <P> But of course. And so is the taproom.  </P></p>

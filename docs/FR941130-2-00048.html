Recent events have demonstrated a need to clarify and amend various parts of the July 27 Order as explained below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 5, 1994, the TAA member lines filed amendments to the TAA, including a change of the conference's name to the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement (``TACA''). <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  As noted in footnote 1 of the July 27 Order, the Commission intended that this nonadjudatory investigation would continue if TACA became effective. On October 24, 1994, TACA became effective, with certain modifications. To ensure clarity as to its intent regarding investigation of TACA, the Commission is revising the first ordering paragraph of the July 27 Order to state expressly that this nonadjudicatory investigation is to develop evidence on whether or not TAA, TACA, and some or all of the sixteen ocean common carriers which comprise TACA's membership <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  may have engaged in, or may be engaged in activities violative of various provisions of the 1984 Act, and to provide a basis for any subsequent adjudicatory, assessment or injunctive action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Despite this modification, the members continue to refer to the modified agreement as TAA. For clarity, this order refers to the modified agreement as TACA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> On August 29, 1994, Hanjin Shipping Co., Ltd. became a member of TAA (and, subsequently, of TACA); the Commission is amending the appended list of conference member lines to include this carrier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By three separate orders issued this date, the Commission has commenced adjudicatory proceedings to determine whether TAA and some or all of its members violated various provisions of the 1984 Act in connection with the establishment and operation of container pools; limitations on the right of independent action; and restrictions contained in certain vessel sharing agreements in the trans-Atlantic trades. In view of the institution of these adjudicatory proceedings, the Commission will not seek testimony or further evidence from TAA (or TACA) and its members in the remainder of the Fact Finding investigation as to the issues under adjudication. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure a thorough examination of the facts regarding TACA's implementation, and to provide adequate resources and flexibility for addressing the issues remaining in this investigation, the Commission is amending the July 27 Order to add a sixth Investigative Officer to the proceeding and to give the Investigative Officers additional time for the preparation of a final report of findings and recommendations. The July 27 Order required issuance of a final report within 180 days after publication of that Order. The amendment extends that deadline for approximately two months, to March 24, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Now therefore, it is ordered,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> That pursuant to sections 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 23 of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. 1704, 1706, 1707, 1709, 1710, 1711 and 1721, and Part 502, Subpart R of Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 46 CFR 502.281,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the Commission's July 27 Order is amended to preclude the Investigative Officers from seeking additional testimony or further evidence in this proceeding from the Trans-Atlantic Agreement (or the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement), or any of its members on the following issues: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Whether or not TAA (or TACA) or any of its members has violated or is violating any of the prohibited acts set forth in section 10 of the 1984 Act by providing chassis and/or container equipment to shippers at U.S. West Coast and interior locations other than the carrier's designated containeryard or terminal facility; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

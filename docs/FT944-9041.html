			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Extra protection for children The law in Scotland regarding children will be comprehensively updated by the children (Scotland) bill, the biggest piece of children's legislation for more than 20 years. The bill will incorporate lessons learnt in the Orkney child sex abuse affair. It will set more exacting criteria to be met before children are taken into care in emergencies. These will include a new 'exclusion order' under which a suspected abuser can be banned from a child's home. There will also be a 'statement of parental responsibilities' outlining what is expected of parents in raising their children.</p>

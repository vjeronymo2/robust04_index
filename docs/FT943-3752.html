			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Scandals and growth fears dent PRI win: Mexican investors are taking a cautious view of the new government The euphoria that many investors had expected would follow a comfortable victory by Mexico's ruling party in the presidential election last month has failed to materialise. Since Mr Ernesto Zedillo emerged triumphant from the August 21 election, allegations of banking fraud and corruption, the opposition's refusal to endorse the result, and uncertainty over economic policy have cast a cloud over the political and economic scene. Investors - who had bet heavily on the Institutional Revolutionary Party's (PRI) victory - seem more cautious than in the days before the election. The stock market has risen only slighlty from pre-election levels. Contrary to forecasts, short-term interest rates have risen and the exchange rate has weakened. The current nervousness over the political situation may soon fade. Having won more than 50 per cent of the vote, in elections many outside observers believe the freest Mexico has had, Mr Zedillo has a strong mandate to deepen the pro-market economic policies of President Carlos Salinas, and push ahead with further democratic reforms. Many expect Mr Zedillo's programme to boost economic growth and reduce political instability. However, for the moment confidence has been dented by the order for the arrest of Mr Carlos Cabal Peniche, the head of Mexico's fourth largest financial group and of the Del Monte Fresh Produce agro-business, on charges that his banks illegally lent him Dollars 700m (Pounds 451m). Mr Cabal was one of Mexico's leading businessmen, with strong ties to politicians in the south-east and many entrepreneurs who have risen to prominence during the administration of Mr Salinas. While the scandal appears not to have affected the stability of the financial system, the opposition has attacked the government for giving Mr Cabal two banking licences. The incident may make foreigners more careful about backing Mexican businessmen. Mr Cabal's purchase of Del Monte Fresh had been partly financed by Dollars 300m of high-yield bonds placed in international markets by Morgan Stanley. Allegations by Mr Eduardo Valle, a former official in the attorney-general's office, surround the Cabal affair. Drug traffickers, he said, infiltrated the security team of the Institutional Revolutionary Party's initial presidential candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, who was assassinated in March. Traffickers may have ordered the assassination, it is alleged. Mr Valle separately raised questions about Mr Emilio Gamboa, communications and transport minister, who last November received in his offices a woman alleged to be representating a drug cartel. The attorney-general's office has dismissed the allegations of links between drug traffickers and government and PRI officials, and Mr Gamboa has vehemently denied any impropriety. Mr Valle's accusations have damaged the credibility of the government's counter-drug operations, and are said to have divided the Salinas administration. These scandals have coincided with harsh attacks by the left-wing opposition Party of Democratic Revolution on the conduct of the presidential election. Mr Cuahtemoc Cardenas, PRD presidential candidate, has gradually hardened his line against the government, claiming that 10m votes were stolen. He has led rallies in two states against the results, and threatened to spurn future elections. His rallies have had little public support, but have emphasised the continuing and apparently unbridgeable divide between the PRI and the leftist opposition, which won 17 per cent of the total vote. In the state of Chiapas, Zapatista rebels who launched a rebellion at the beginning of the year have backed the cause of Mr Cardenas. While the leaders of the centre-right National Action Party (PAN) have grudgingly accepted that the PRI won the election, radical factions have supported Mr Cardenas's position. Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the PAN's presidential candidate, after initially accepting defeat, has since described the PRI's victory as illegitimate. Feverish speculation over the policy and appointments of the new Zedillo administration has further heightened uncertainty. There is growing concern over the content of a new 'pacto,' the agreement between business, labour and the government under which price, wage and exchange rate policy is set. Mr Zedillo is expected to set the general policies of the new pacto, even though he does not take office until December. While Mr Zedillo has publicly said he does not believe in a abrupt devaluation of the peso, there is speculation he may support an increase in the daily maximum depreciation of the peso/dollar rate of 40 centavos a day. The possibility of a change in exchange rate policy has been heightened by a reported division between Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister, and the central bank, on the one hand, and Mr Guillermo Ortiz, the powerful deputy finance minister, on the other. The former are believed to support a strong currency so as to maintain the fight against inflation. Mr Ortiz is said to back a faster devaluation of the currency as a way to boost exports and economic growth.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH IN EUROPE;  </P> <P> BUSH TO PROPOSE POLAND AID FUND;  </P> <P> LANDS IN WARSAW, EXPECTED TO SEEK $100 MILLION FOR PRIVATE SECTOR  </P> <P> President Bush, preparing a package of economic assistance "for the sake of a  stable and prosperous Poland," is expected to propose the creation of a  $100-million fund to invigorate the struggling Polish economy's private sector,  White House officials said Sunday night.  </P> <P> The President, who arrived in Warsaw on Sunday evening, greeted a Poland in the  midst of political upheaval and struggling to achieve economic reform, and  pressed ahead with his call for a Europe that is "whole and free."  </P> <P> With U.S. support for budding economic and political reform as his central  theme, the President is expected in a speech today to the Polish Parliament to  unveil a number of steps, including the $100-million fund, to demonstrate  Western support for the new signs of openness in Polish life.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Congressional OK Required  </P> <P> White House officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the  $100-million fund would need congressional approval. They said Bush would  encourage other major industrialized democracies, meeting next weekend in  Paris, to offer similar contributions.  </P> <P> In addition, the President is expected to:  </P> <P>  -- Encourage the World Bank to move ahead with loans already under  consideration and believed to be worth $325 million.  </P> <P>  -- Ask other major lenders to consider rescheduling a portion of Poland's  crushing $39-billion foreign debt -- 65% of which is owed to Western lenders.  Under his proposal, about $5 billion in debt payments would be deferred, for an  unspecified period.  </P> <P>  -- Propose a joint U.S.-Polish effort, worth $15 million, to attack air and  water pollution in the Krakow area and establish a cultural and information  center.  </P> <P> The President also planned to pledge that he would seek "concerted action" by  the West to assist Poland and Hungary, the second stop on his four-nation  European tour.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Details Upcoming  </P> <P> White House officials said that although the broad outline of the proposal was  prepared in time for today's speech, specific details are yet to be drawn up  for broad international action, and that it is uncertain whether the  $100-million fund that Bush plans to unveil will be in the form of loans or  grants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Greeted by Jaruzelski  </P> <P> As Bush stepped from Air Force One at Warsaw's Okecie Airport on a warm, humid  evening, he was greeted by Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Communist Party  leader. Also in the welcoming party was Andrzej Wielowieyski, deputy Speaker of  Poland's new freely elected Senate and an adviser to Solidarity leader Lech  Walesa. It was the first time a Solidarity representative has been included at  an official Polish state welcome.  </P> <P> Upbeat as he embarked on his second trip as President to the changing Communist  world, Bush referred to the political reforms that have shaken Poland in the  past three months, declaring at the welcoming ceremony:  </P> <P> "These are great days for Poland. Solidarity is again legal. The beginnings of  a free press now exist. A new Parliament is in place. The Polish Senate has  been restored through free and fair elections.  </P> <P> "Poland is making its own history," he said. "And America, and the whole world,  is watching."  </P> <P> Jaruzelski, whose once-sure shot at the Polish presidency is now up in the air  as a result of the political turmoil, told Bush: "You are arriving in a country  in which a process of basic change is at work. You are going to see a Poland  that is following with determination profound socio-political and economic  reforms."  </P> <P> Describing democratization and reconciliation as an "indispensable promise,"  Jaruzelski said that "our Polish transformations are aided by positive trends  of detente in the international arena."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Call for 'Working Together'  </P> <P> And, he said, Poland subscribed to the idea that "the philosophy of enmity  should be replaced by that of rapprochement and working together."  </P> <P> For Bush, who was accompanied by First Lady Barbara Bush, the two-day visit to  Poland offers a sharp contrast to his previous journey here, in September,  1987. At that time, Solidarity was outlawed, and the then-vice president of the  United States irked his Polish government hosts with public displays of support  for the opposition movement.  </P> <P> But despite the sudden shifts in the political climate here -- parliamentary  elections produced an overwhelming victory for Solidarity, which took 98 of the  100 seats in the newly constituted Senate -- the President is still treading a  narrow line. His goal is to avoid pressing the Communist leadership too hard  and avoid unleashing pent-up enmity for the government and producing a backlash  that would undo recent progress.  </P> <P> "It's got to be handled in a subtle fashion -- the fine line you walk -- so  that the things you do and say are helpful to the process of greater freedom,"  a senior White House official said.  </P> <P> Some senior government analysts have expressed at least limited concern that  Bush's visit could produce the same sort of incendiary impact that Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's journey to Beijing contributed to the  now-crushed pro-democracy movement in China. But one White House official said  Bush "knows what are the effective, prudent things to do."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'You Want to Inspire'  </P> <P> "You don't want to incite; you want to inspire. That's the goal. And you want  to congratulate a government when it is making positive steps, and show that  positive steps will be complemented by positive steps on our part," said  another senior Bush aide.  </P> <P> Bush will meet with Jaruzelski today and with Walesa on Tuesday in the Baltic  port city of Gdansk. He address to Parliament is scheduled this afternoon.  </P> <P> Then, after two days in Poland and a visit to Hungary, he will attend the 15th  annual economic summit conference in Paris of the world's leading  industrialized democracies, which is expected to work toward an overall  approach by the West to help boost the Polish economy.  </P> <P> Linking political and economic reforms, Bush referred to the West's demands  that any economic assistance must be met by reforms in the Polish economy that  could risk an increase in unemployment if the inflation rate of nearly 100% is  to be curbed.  </P> <P> He said:  </P> <P> "Poland has started along an ascending path of democratic change. This climb is  exhilarating, but not always easy, and will require further sacrifices. But, if  followed, it will lead to a renaissance for this remarkable nation."  </P> <P> White House officials maintained that the size of assistance package Bush will  offer is less important than the fact that such a package is being offered, as  a reaction to the reforms taking place here.  </P> <P> Besides, said one, referring to the large Polish-American community in the  United States, "I doubt the Poles in Chicago have an eye for what the aid  package will be, but they do have an eye for the fact that the President of the  United States" would visit Poland.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Care 'Not To Over Promise'  </P> <P> Indeed, Bush told reporters aboard Air Force One that he wanted to be careful  not "to overpromise, do too little or do too much."  </P> <P> Suggesting that the real import of the trip was simply in his presence, he  said: "Remember Woody Allen -- 90% of life is just showing up."  </P> <P> Much as he did during his first overseas trip as President, when he visited  China in February, Bush is focusing on the political and economic reforms  occurring in the Communist world -- in this case, in Poland and Hungary. He is  also calling for an end to the ideological, political, and economic barriers  that have divided the European Continent for four decades.  </P> <P> "Here in the heart of Europe, the American people have a fervent wish: that  Europe be whole and free," Bush said.  </P> <P> In an interview with four Hungarian reporters before he left the United States,  Bush, however, reflected the sensitivity of appearing too demanding.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not a President's Role  </P> <P> "It is not an American President's role to say to those in another county, 'you  have to have your system this way, matching our system, or else we can't do  business with you.' That is not my role," he said.  </P> <P> "It would be inappropriate for the President of the United States," he said,  "to try to fine-tune for the people of Hungary how they ought to eat -- how the  cow ought to eat the cabbage, as we say in the United States."  </P> <P> Bush's visit to Hungary will be the first by an American president. His visit  to Poland is the third, following one by Richard M. Nixon in 1972 and another  by Jimmy Carter in 1977.  </P> <P> It was on Carter's arrival that a State Department interpreter, in a mistaken  translation, said in Polish as he worked through Carter's speech: "I have come  not only to express our own views to the people of Poland but also to learn  your opinion and the understanding of your lusts."  </P></p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Iraq keeps up shelling of marsh Arabs Iraqi troops have continued indiscriminate artillery bombardments of Shia Arabs in the southern marshes, although aerial attacks ceased with the imposition of a Security Council no-fly order, writes Michael Littlejohns at the UN. A UN report, prepared by Mr Hans van der Stoehl, a former Dutch foreign minister, is a severe setback for Iraq's case for the lifting of sanctions. It coincides with the current visit to New York of Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraqi deputy prime minister, who is trying to convince Security Council members his government has complied with all relevant resolutions and should be allowed to resume unrestricted oil sales. But Mr van der Stoehl rejected this argument. As for the Iraqi claim for sanctions to be lifted on humanitarian grounds, he said Baghdad had refused an opportunity to sell oil worth up to Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.07bn). He blamed the plight of Iraqi civilians, including the marsh Shias, on the Iraqi government.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hasan Muhammad Tayib, Saudi Airlines deputy </F> director general, by 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Ghamidi; place and date  not given--first four paragraphs 'UKAZ introduction]    [Text] In light of the all-around renaissance our country  has achieved in many fields, the move towards Saudization has  begun more urgently to guarantee the continued progress of  contruction, restoration, and the safeguarding of the cultural  and developmental gains we have accomplished thus far.    This direction has opened the gates of hope wide before the  youth of this nation to obtain the jobs that best suit their  capabilities, making them better able to take part actively in  serving this country and its citizens.    Saudi Arabian Airlines is considered one of the leading  organizations in this field; it has achieved 78 percent  Saudization, and according to its current plan, this is slated  to increase to 86 percent by 1415H [1995].    Mr. Hasan Muhammad Tayib, Saudia's deputy director general  for employee affairs, spoke to us in this interview of the  philosophy of Saudization which the airlines has carried out,  and continues to carry out now.  <H5>  Priority to Saudis </H5>   [Al-Ghamidi] Now that Saudia has done what everyone wanted  to  do, how far has Saudia gone in this direction?    [Tayib] The constant instructions of the Custodian of the  Holy Mosques, God preserve him, on the development of national  manpower and raising its performance standards, are the engine  of our strategy in the field of human resources. Saudi Airlines  has over time focused on their development through its plans for  the development and training of Saudi persons to take their  natural place in the company's technical and administrative  positions. Over the last two decades a number of steps have been  made in the field of Saudization, in line with the company's  phases of growth, the evolution of its staff structure, and  local job market data, all focused on the creation and  protection of enough job opportunities for Saudis to supplement  the decrease in expatriate labor.  <H5>  Training and Development </H5>   It was our obligation for Saudia to offer our citizens the  opportunity to join our training and development program in  various areas of the air transport industry, in accordance with  the government's policy. For this purpose we established  training departments in the technical and management fields. We  have also sent trainees abroad to specialize in all branches and  activities of this industry that are not found domestically.    Turning to the Saudization program plan, a study was  prepared, the first of its kind, with the cooperation of the  Manpower Council. It lasted nearly two full years and was aimed  in general at arriving at an executive plan in a fixed-time  program that began in 1407H [1987] and is continuing until 1415H  [1995], with the general average of Saudization of total  employees inside the Kingdom to be 86 percent by the end of the  plan. Saudia has completed a major phase of the execution of  this plan, with 78 percent Saudization; and this will increase  to 86 percent according to the plan by the end of 1995.  <H5>  A Badge We Are Proud Of </H5>   There are positive signs that indicate the acceptance of  Saudi youth of some of the vocations that they were hesitant  about before, ending a real obstacle to the implementation of  the Saudization program, such as jobs in air service and  accessory office work.    It is enough for me to point to the praise, or rather the  certificate with which Saudia was honored, from His Royal  Highness Nayif Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, minister of interior and  chairman of the Manpower Council. It showed His Highness's kind  appreciation for Saudi Airlines' efforts to implement the  Saudization plan. We consider this a badge on the chest of every  member of our company who helped to reach the basic goal of  Saudization.  <H5>  Practical Solutions </H5>   [Al-Ghamidi] As an offical and a citizen, how do you view  the  extent of Saudization in the private sector?    [Tayib] There are numerous efforts being made by official  and  national agencies to enact practical solutions to the  Saudization question in the private sector, such as the national  labor seminar in the national sector that was held in the  Institute for Public Administration in January 1992, in which  they dealt with the extent of participation, the seriousness of  the effort, and the frankness of receptivity.    I sincerely hope these efforts will continue so that we may  see what they have planned transformed into a living reality.    Saudi is carrying out, in this field, the role it was given  by its membership in this society. In addition to its program,  it is part of a committee made up of the Interior Ministry, the  Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, and the Presidency of  Civil Aviation to put rules and recommendations in place aimed  at Saudizing jobs at airline agencies and travel agencies.  <H5>  I Disagree </H5>   [Al-Ghamidi] Some private sector executives think that Saudi  employees are not carrying out their proper role, and ask for  more productivity. How true is this, in light of your own  experience with Saudi employees?    [Tayib] My personal conviction is completely different, and  it is a conviction formed over long practice, and through varied  employee experiences. The human element is an important part,  even the most important element of production, and its profit is  in conformity with the investment in it, in terms of training  and development. Some business owners have a capacity for  patience for projects sometimes, for the profit to show, but  they hesitate in integrated investment thinking which deals with  Saudi employees, considering them national human capital.    There is a problem of training the national sector, and the  reasons for it must be studied, and solved; perhaps some are the  non-existence of specialized, integrated agencies to carry out  this role, or business's weak conviction of the importance of  training, or financial reasons.    This is in addition to the importance of looking at what is  expected of Saudi employees who work in travel agencies in which  Saudi Airlines takes part in accordance with the request of  travel agents (TACA) [acronym as transliterated] by developing a  training program covering no less than 25 specialized training  courses for agency employees alone.  <H5>  Philosophy of Saudization </H5>   [Al-Ghamidi] What is the strategy upon which employee  training is based?    [Tayib] The management philosophy of Saudization is based on  the consideration that the human element is the decisive factor  in the success or failure of any company. From this standpoint,  constant training is seen as the basic pillar of its growth and  the expansion of its facilities and services, especially in an  industry as highly skilled as air transport.    Training is also one of the social goals of Saudization, by  building and polishing our people's skills and training them to  work in the company's positions essential for management and  operating its fleet by using the most modern methods in line  with the highest international standards and specifications in  thus industry. The company's training strategy is based on three  components:     -  Operating needs, covering the volume and variety of work  in the frameworks of both time and place.    -  Employment requirements essential for operating requirements,  including the variety of qualifications needed and the necessary  expertise and ability for training.    -  Methods of modern technology and management thinking, in  light  of which we are reviewing the training programs, methods, and  equipment to suit our technical needs and conceive a method of  work performance.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM-TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev 13 April, TASS -- The press service of the  Crimean Security Department issued a statement on Wednesday  denouncing Kiev's response to the latest appointment of a new  department head decreed by the Crimean president.    "The latest steps by Kiev hinder the fulfilment by the  Crimean Security Department its constitutional duties and  infringe moral losses to its personnel," the statement said.    On Monday, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov dismissed Kiev's  appointee Major-General Ivan Kolymtsev from the post of the  local security chief and replaced him by his own protege,  Retired Major-General Vladimir Lepikhov.    Security bosses in Kiev responded instantly with an angry  message signed by Yevgueny Marchuk, head of the republican  Security Service. The message commanded Kolymtsev to ignore  Meshkov's decree and continue to run the office and qualified  Meshkov's decree as unconstitutional.    The UKRINFORM report did not specify which of the two  generals exactly runs the department today, but at least "all  scheduled operations to safeguard security and civil accord on  the Peninsula are being conducted normally", the press service  stated.</p>

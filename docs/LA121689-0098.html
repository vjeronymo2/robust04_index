			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DORSEY'S FIRST VICTORY OVER CARSON EARNS CITY 4-A TITLE  </P> <P> On a night that Dorsey High School fans will remember for many years, the Dons  won the City 4-A football title by defeating top-ranked and defending-champion  Carson, 26-15, Friday before a crowd of 4,000 at El Camino College.  </P> <P> Dorsey, which lost two of its first three games, avenged an earlier loss to the  Colts to win the school's first 4-A title.  </P> <P> The win, Dorsey's first against Carson in 10 games, extended the Colts' losing  streak in title games in odd-numbered years to seven. Carson has not won  consecutive titles since 1971-72.  </P> <P> The Dons were led by running back Lamont Warren, who rushed for 101 yards in 25  carries and caught five passes for 110 yards. But it was fullback Larry  Edmonds' 25-yard touchdown run with 2:13 remaining in the fourth quarter that  clinched the win.  </P> <P> The title completes a season that the Dorsey team dedicated to the late Kevin  Copeland, the Dons' wide receiver who died from heart failure during a game  earlier this season.  </P> <P> "This is the best feeling in the world because Kevin always wanted to beat  Carson and Banning but didn't in his two years (playing)," said Dorsey  linebacker Tamecus Peoples. "We did everything this year for him."  </P> <P> A key factor in the game was Dorsey's ability to neutralize Carson's offensive  attack and quarterback Armin Youngblood, who set a school record this season  with 30 touchdown passes.  </P> <P> Against the Dons, Youngblood completed only 7 of 26 attempts for 96 yards. He  was intercepted four times.  </P> <P> "The coaches had their (Carson) offense broken down to the point where we knew  every play they were going to run once they lined up," Peoples said.  </P> <P> Dorsey co-coach and defensive coordinator Eugene McAdoo said pressuring  Youngblood was important.  </P> <P> "We ran more two-deep coverages than we did when we played them before," McAdoo  said "I think we confused him at times tonight.  </P> <P> In a game in which Dorsey never trailed, the Dons drove 66 yards in six plays  to score on their first possession. The key play being a 43-yard pass reception  from quarterback Chris Cook to Warren, who capped the drive with a five-yard  sweep.  </P> <P> Dorsey added to its lead in the second quarter when linebacker Dennis Paige  intercepted a pass by Youngblood and returned it 17 yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> Trailing, 12-0, Carson finally scored after a six-play, 48-yard drive that  featured the skills of Michael Ross.  </P> <P> Ross, who owns every Carson receiving record, caught a deflected pass by  Youngblood for an 18-yard gain, which set up Youngblood's 1-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> Dorsey capitalized on another Carson mistake after Colt linebacker Nkosi  Littleton fumbled on a fake punt attempt on fourth down. The Dons drove 49  yards in nine plays, with Cook scoring on a four-yard run, and after Warren ran  in the two-point conversion, Dorsey led, 20-6, at halftime.  </P> <P> Youngblood completed four of 17 passes for 63 yards and was intercepted three  times in the first half.  </P> <P> In the third quarter, Carson recorded a safety when backup quarterback Ronald  Peebles, who replaced the injured Cook for two series, fumbled out of the end  zone after being hit by linebacker Harry Fuamatu.  </P> <P> Carson closed to within five points when Youngblood scored from five yards out  on the first play of the fourth quarter. However, the Colts never threatened  again as Dorsey was able to make big plays on offense and defense the rest of  the game.  </P> <P> "We knew that we had to attack their defense right up the middle because they  had too much speed," said Dorsey Co-Coach Paul Knox. "We saw things from our  first game that we thought we'd be able to work on."  </P> <P> Dorsey finished the season with a 10-3 record. Carson was 10-2.  </P></p>

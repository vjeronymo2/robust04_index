			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Dr. Reza Amrollahi, vice president </F> for atomic energy and director of the Iranian Atomic Energy  Organization, IAEO; Engineer Dr. Mashayekhi, IAEO international  affairs adviser; and Dr. Mohammad Reza Ayatollahi, Iranian  representative at the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA;  by unidentified announcer and citizens in the weekly phone-in  program ``In Line With The People, In Step With Officials'' --  live]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted including quotations from  Khamene'i and Khomeyni about the futility of nuclear weapons]    Announcer: Could you please answer the question  which was posed on whether the hostile propaganda of western  media has had any negative effect on the course of the  activities of the Atomic Energy Organization [AEO] and what  steps are being taken to confront all that propaganda?    Amrollahi: We are witnessing a psychological war  in the world by the news media of certain countries. If you  watched CNN a few days ago you would have seen that a CNN  correspondent came and asked one of the officials of our country  -- I think it was Mr. Kharrazi [Iran's permanent ambassador] in  the United Nations. He said: First, you have purchased  submarines? Second, You have increased your defense budget.  Third, you have nuclear capability. In other words, they have  a number of presuppositions. It does not matter what the  answers are. They only wish to instill certain ideas in the  minds of their listeners. We see this very clearly. At least,  I and all my colleagues feel this with all our being that they  are not after finding out the truth. They only wish to  indoctrinate those who are unfamiliar with our works, those in  foreign countries, and wish to tell them that Iran wishes to do  this or that.    I wish to ask a few questions of those who make such  insinuations: Have we not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty? Are we not a member of the IAEA? Do we not accept the  nuclear treaty of the IAEA [as heard]? Why does the usurping  Zionist regime not sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty?  Why does it not accept the IAEA's nuclear treaty? Why do they  not ask such questions of the latter? This shows that they have  some ulterior motives, and they wish to insinuate certain things  in the minds of the people abroad who are not in our country and  who are not reached by our mass media. In brief, let me say  that such hostile propaganda will have no effect on our work.  However, I do not deny that they will influence the minds of  the people who have nothing to do with us and who live outside  our borders. [passage omitted answering a question about a small  number of solar energy reactors which are planned for some  remote villages outside the electricity grid].    Announcer: There was a question about the use of  nuclear energy in Iran.    Amrollahi: See. All our people know more or less  that our most important aim is to complete our nuclear reactor  which we have, which is incomplete. Eighty percent of its work  is completed, and by today's estimate more than $10 billion has  been invested in it. In my view, in any country where there is  such an investment in a project eighty percent of which has been  completed, any sane person would try to complete it so as to  generate electricity by it. We have made this huge investment,  and the whole world knows that a nuclear reactor only produces  electricity. This is what we are after. Our country is short  of electricity and the best return on our investment is to  complete it and to make use of it.    Let me also answer the other question which was asked about  who is completing it. Unfortunately, the Germans fell short in  this connection. They did not help and did not finish this  project. They have kept us waiting for 14 or 15 years. Finally,  we signed a contract with Russia. Work has been started for  some time and they are finishing it. [passage omitted on history  of nuclear energy in Iran].    Announcer: Dr. Amrollahi, when do you think the  Bushehr reactor will be completed?    Amrollahi: God willing, according to the talks  which we have with the Russians, it will be definitely completed  in less than four years and will produce energy.    Announcer: Concerning [nuclear] disarmament --  although of course we cannot call it disarmament, let us say  about nonproliferation -- Dr. Ayatollahi and Dr. Mashayekhi can  you please tell us something in this connection?    Ayatollahi: [passage omitted on the dangers of  nuclear weapons for the environment, the use of atomic weapons  at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the nonproliferation treaty;  asserting that not only the countries which do not have nuclear  weapons should not produce them, but the big powers which also  have them should get rid of them]. Concerning this western  propaganda and the motivation behind that propaganda, all our  nation, every hezbollahi member of the society knows the truth.  However, let me refer to just one reason behind all this  propaganda. This is my own personal analysis, and I may be able  to produce some evidence for what I am saying.    After the collapse of the former Soviet Union the American  spy agency [CIA] was made bankrupt. This is why you see the CIA  director going to the U.S. Senate and beginning threats against  the Islamic Republic of Iran. He engages in this propaganda  claiming that the Islamic Republic of Iran is pursuing a policy  for the production of nuclear weapons and that Americans should  be vigilant. There he is trying to save himself from bankruptcy,  he wants to prevent the closure of his organization, he wishes  to safeguard the budget of his organization, and wishes to  safeguard his own prestige. At the same time, he wishes to  initiate a new propaganda line that the Islamic Republic of Iran  poses a threat.    Yes, Iran objects to the western democracy which is  following  a domineering policy in the world in such an absurd way. It  questions that system and threatens it with its logical  arguments. The whole world knows this. However, in an attempt  to cast aspersions on the Islamic Republic of Iran and to  distort the truth and achieve their goals at least in the short  term, they are engaged in this propaganda. Let me also say that  we do not pay any attention to all this propaganda. It will not  have the slightest effect upon the decisions of the Islamic  Republic of Iran and Iran's nuclear industry. We know that  their propaganda is flimsy and no one will believe them. The  IAEA is the only official international agency which is composed  of various nations and the Islamic Republic of Iran is also an  active member. That organization expresses its views. We have  also announced truthfully and bravely that we are not after such  a policy. From the outset we have believed that the policy of  [acquiring] nuclear weapons is wrong and we will not pursue a  wrong path. If you are suspicious and have some evidence for  your suspicion, come and inspect. We have no objection. So  far, they have also come. We have invited them. They have come  and inspected and have admitted and confessed [that Iran does  not have nuclear weapons]. The admission of this official  organization as an international authority as regards the  nuclear industry is sufficient for us, even though western media  engages in all sorts of propaganda.    Unidentified citizen: I would like to ask a  question about the role played by the country's Atomic Energy  Organization in supplying our electricity requirement? I would  also like to ask what happened to the Bushehr nuclear power  station, and will it boost the power generation when it is  completed?    Mashayekhi: Bushehr nuclear power station  comprises two 1250 megawatt units. It was started by the  Germans before the revolution and it was 85 percent complete  during the last days of the Shah's regime. Unfortunately it was  abandoned by the German side. [passage omitted giving reasons  for interruption of the project during the Iran-Iraq war].    Today we are trying to reach an agreement with the Russian  Government to complete the project. Of course work has started  already and the Russians are studying the project so as to  install their own equipment. God willing we will then see  completion of the first project during the coming years. We can  probably begin the operation of our first nuclear power station  in four years time.    Announcer: God willing. Is it economical to  depend on nuclear energy in Iran?    Mashayekhi: The world has answered this question  already. You witness that most of the world countries are today  striving to expand their nuclear power stations to generate  electricity. Fossil fuel pollutes the environment and will run  out. The world in the 21st century will have to face the  problem of generating its electricity requirement by nuclear  power. We are also one of those countries which should make the  necessary investment today. [passage omitted]. The Supreme  Energy Council has approved that we should supply 20 percent of  the country's energy requirements by nuclear power stations.    Amrollahi: I wish to conclude the discussion by  mentioning something about our proposal for the creation of a  nuclear free-zone. The Islamic Republic of Iran is pursuing  this proposal every year and has been doing so for a number of  years. It is appropriate to mention here that the regional  countries are siding with us gradually on this issue. The only  real saboteur of this proposal is the regime occupying  Jerusalem. May God's peace and mercy be upon you all.</p>

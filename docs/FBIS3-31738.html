			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Text of "Letter From the Democratic Party in Response to </F> the Invitation to Dialogue From the Social Democracy Party of  Romania: The Country's Situation Is Much Too Serious for  Discussions in General Terms"; place and date not given]    [Text] Mr. Oliviu Gherman: The Democratic Party [PD]  considers constant, frank, and direct dialogue as one of the  principles of its policy as well as a condition for a sound and  effective democratic life. We have repeatedly and publicly said  that if civilized, principled, and constructive dialogue between  the political forces and within the democratic institutions of  the state governed by law does not exist, then differences turn  into disputes, while disputes are transferred to the street to  be solved with the help of violent means characteristic of the  street. Within such a context, the PD -- by itself or together  with other parties of the current opposition -- has repeatedly  invited you to discuss our country's real problems and to  jointly contribute to their solution. This is the spirit in  which in October 1992 we participated in negotiations preceding  the formation of the Vacaroiu government, in which we adopted  the PD Declaration of 14 September 1993, edited the PD letter of  3 January 1994 regarding the possibility of concluding a  National Pact, and signed the joint declaration of the PD and  the parliamentary parties of the Democratic Convention of  Romania [CDR] of 14 January 1994, which was addressed to the  president of the republic. Numerous other communiques and  public statements by the PD always reaffirmed its readiness for  dialogue in general and for dialogue with the Social Democracy  Party of Romania [PDSR] as the political formation that is  currently holding the relative majority of parliamentary  mandates in particular.    Thus, it was with hope that we welcomed your letter of 4  February 1994, whereby you informed us about the offer of  beginning official discussions between the PD and the PDSR.  Unfortunately, your party's readiness is flagrantly at variance  with all the concrete actions taken by this party, which are  often full of hostility toward the PD and disloyalty toward the  principles of a genuine democratic life.    Despite this contradiction, consistent with our own  proposals  for dialogue, we are ready to begin the discussions you mention  in your letter and to rid our minds of all suspicion.    On the other hand, we believe that our country's situation  is  much too serious and decisive to conduct discussions in general  terms as your suggest.    What we need today are not generalities, but specific  solutions as a result of our courageous and responsible exchange  of ideas, an exchange without any grudge, falseness, and  preconceived ideas. Consequently, we propose -- as, in fact, you  do -- that the agenda include the following points:    1. Identifying concrete ways and means to immediately begin  tripartite PDSR-CDR-PD negotiations to conclude a National Pact  like the one proposed by the PD in the open letter addressed to  President Ion Iliescu on 3 January 1994 and to form a new  government;    2. Deciding on actions aimed at restructuring the current  parliamentary majority and setting up, on this basis, a new  government that is able to take our economy out of the crisis,  put an end to the daily needs and suffering of our citizens, and  reestablish our country's credibility abroad, and that enjoys  strong political support in the process of implementing its  reform program by a credible, stable, and solid majority made up  of the PDSR (34 percent of parliamentary mandates), the CDR (33  percent of the parliamentary mandates), and the PD (14 percent  of the parliamentary mandates);    3. The phenomenon of extremism in Romania's political arena;  measures to isolate extremist pressure groups and preventing  their access to the levers of power;    4. Guaranteeing genuine autonomy for local administration  and working out tangible measures to stop any kind of political,  government pressure on the administrative authorities emerged  from the last local elections.    Given the importance of the subjects proposed and the  extremely urgent need to solve them, we believe that the  delegations that are going to represent our parties have to be  made up of people with political experience and decisionmaking  ability; they have to be invested with full powers to be able to  make prompt decisions. In this sense, the PD has empowered the  political department to set up the following delegation: Adrian  Severin, PD vice president; Victor Babiuc, PD secretary; Eugen  Dijmarescu, PD secretary; Bogdan Niculescu-Duvaz, PD secretary;  Cristian Radulescu, PD secretary; and Ilie Stefan, PD deputy.    We propose that the first meeting take place on 18 February  1994, at 1000 [0800 GMT] at PD Headquarters in Aleea Modrogan  No. 1, Bucharest.    Looking forward to this desired dialogue, please accept the  expression of our most distinguished sentiments.    President Petre Roman    14 February 1994</p>

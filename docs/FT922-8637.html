			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Travel agents dubbed 'lazy' MANY TRAVEL agents are 'incompetent and lazy' and waste money by making basic errors, according to a report from Which?, the Consumers' Association magazine, published today, John Thornhill writes. The magazine says more than half its inquiries to 253 travel agents in 10 cities were handled badly, with agents telling half-truths and quoting unnecessarily high fares. Only one in five agents was able to find the cheapest routine flight to Nice  -a Pounds 129 offer from British Airways. Which? says Hogg Robinson provided the best service of the five big travel chains.</p>

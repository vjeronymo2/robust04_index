			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bull market forecast to resume in October Copper's bull market has some way to run and prices are likely to peak at above Dollars 1.20 a pound (Dollars 2,645 a tonne) in the first half of 1995, suggests the Bloomsbury Minerals Economics consultancy organisation. The sale of surplus copper stocks may depress prices later this month and September to the Dollars 1- to Dollars 1.05-a-pound range (Dollars 2,204 to Dollars 2,314 a tonne), but they are likely to start firming again in October. It will not be until the second half of 1995 that the copper market will see a slight supply surplus again, 'signalling the probable end of the bull phase,' BME suggests in its latest Copper Briefing Service newsletter. Mr Peter Hollands, the editor, points out that western world copper consumption is on track for a 500,000-tonne or 5.5 to 6 per cent increase this year - to 9.635m tonnes - and one of 350,000 tonnes, or 3.5 to 4 per cent, in 1995. Compared with that, western world copper output can be expected to slip by 50,000 tonnes or 0.5 per cent to 9.045m tonnes this year because a 100,000-tonne increase in Latin American output will be more than offset by falls in Japan and Europe caused by shortages of custom concentrates and blister (intermediate materials). Next year, however, western world production is set to grow by about 500,000 tonnes or 5.5 to 6 per cent. Even though net imports from the former eastern bloc countries can be expected to rise from 225,000 tonnes last year to 335,000 tonnes, there will still be a supply deficit of 255,000 tonnes in 1994, BME suggests. It expects the deficit to fall to 110,000 tonnes in 1995. However, in the first half of 1995 a deficit of about 115,000 tonnes is forecast and, as a result, by mid-year western stocks will fall to just under 1m tonnes - equivalent to only 5.3 weeks of consumption.

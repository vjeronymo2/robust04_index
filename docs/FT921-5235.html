			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Shares in GKN rise despite profit fall SHARES in GKN, the UK motor components, industrial services and defence group, jumped by 20p to 352p yesterday in spite of a 44.7 per cent drop in pre-tax profits last year and a warning of job losses to come. Reduced borrowings, a maintained dividend and chairman Sir David Lees' depiction of GKN as having costs under control and ready to take full advantage of market upturns were seen as the main offsets to pre-tax profits falling to Pounds 95m from Pounds 172m. Sales were down 6.3 per cent, to Pounds 2.43bn from Pounds 2.59bn. Sir David said: 'Although the immediate future in terms of demand does not give grounds for much optimism, the resilience of the group does.' He disclosed that all but Pounds 1m of Pounds 16.2m spent on restructuring last year had gone into redundancies, with 1,700 of the 2,850 jobs lost concentrated in the UK. However, he forecast that redundancy costs this year would drop to around Pounds 5m, indicating fewer than 800 job losses. Following last year's shake-out the group employs 30,000 world-wide, about 18,000 overseas. About 52 per cent of GKN's turnover is in cars, commercial vehicles and engineering products, the trading surplus on which fell to Pounds 60m last year from Pounds 90m. GKN expects its Pounds 90m supplies to the Japanese in 1991 to rise to more than Pounds 100m this year. The group's other main activity, industrial services and distribution which account for 29 per cent of sales, also saw a sharp drop in trading surplus, to Pounds 35m from Pounds 59m, largely due to deterioration in the UK, US and Australian construction markets. The contribution made by associated companies fell by more than 50 per cent, to Pounds 28.5m from Pounds 57.9m, almost wholly due to problems encountered by United Engineering Steels (US). Group trading profit was Pounds 95.4m, down from Pounds 149.3m. Net borrowings fell Pounds 45m to Pounds 175m, reducing the group's gearing to 26.4 per cent from 32.3 per cent, the lowest for 15 years. There was a net cash inflow of Pounds 59m, against an outflow of Pounds 9m. The tax charge fell to Pounds 41.3m from Pounds 60.2m. Net earnings after minority interests of Pounds 17m (against Pounds 18.7m) were Pounds 36.7m (against Pounds 93.1m), reflecting the absence of Pounds 48.8m 1990 extraordinaries. Earnings per share were 14.2p against 36.1p in 1990. The final dividend of 12.5p left the total dividend for the year unchanged at 20.5p. Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Mutual sacrifice puts new thinking into boardrooms / Analysis of the deal which could set a trend in the search for capital YESTERDAY'S deal between Scottish Equitable, the Edinburgh-based life insurance company, and Aegon, the Dutch insurance group, could set a trend. As competitive pressures in the overpopulated UK life insurance market intensify, many more small and medium-sized mutually-owned life insurance groups may follow in the footsteps of Scottish Equitable, sacrificing or watering down their mutual status to attract fresh capital. And more European companies could find a link-up with a mutual a cost-effective route for expansion. 'For anyone who wants to get into the UK life sector it looks as though the easiest way could be through a similar transaction,' says Mr Tim Dawson, European insurance analyst with Lehman Brothers, the securities house. French, Swiss, Italian and German groups all come to mind as potential buyers, he says. Scottish Equitable is not the only UK life insurance company short of capital. Industry analysts expect the search for capital is likely to prompt significant mergers and acquisitions in the next few years in an industry which already has more competitors than demand. Indeed, competitive pressures are partly to blame for the mutuals' capital shortage. For marketing reasons, mutuals companies, who historically have specialised in so-called with-profits business - in which companies 'smooth' investment returns over a period of years - have been distributing more in assets than they have been earning on investments, according to Mr Geoffrey Westall, European manager at actuarial consultants Tillinghast. 'They are eating into their free reserves,' he said. 'It is almost certainly the case that a large number of mutuals will demutualise within a few years,' said Mr Peter Hoy, partner at accountants Price Waterhouse, specialising in the life insurance industry. Scottish Equitable, with nearly Pounds 6bn in assets under management, thus becomes the largest of the British mutuals to have succumbed to a stronger partner so far. The irony about SE's search for capital is that it has become particularly necessary because of the company's success in ploughing a narrow furrow in the insurance market. The company is the fourth or fifth largest pensions provider in the UK, and dominates pensions sold through independent financial advisers. By concentrating on the upper end of the IFA market, SE has played to the executive pensions and personal pensions sectors which have proven most profitable in the industry. In 1992, the company's new total premium income grew by 15.5 per cent to Pounds 1.004bn, up from Pounds 869m in 1991. Total assets under management grew to more than Pounds 5.8bn from Pounds 4.6bn in 1991. But success has its price and that price is capital. 'We couldn't have continued to grow at our current rate if we didn't have additional capital,' is the blunt explanation of Mr David Berridge, SE's group chief executive. The company's free asset ratio - the estimate of assets over liabilities calculated for regulatory purposes - was 10 per cent at the end of 1992, down from 11 per cent the year before, a level considered uncomfortably close to the minimum 4 per cent margin required by regulators. In many ways Aegon is an ideal suitor. A creation of a merger between a mutual, AGO, and shareholder-owned Ennia in 1983, Aegon is one of a handful of European mutuals which have modified their own structure to attract capital. Mapfre, the largest Spanish insurer, and Axa, the French group, which in 1991 invested more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in the US life insurer, The Equitable, when that company demutualised in 1991, are the two most notable examples. More importantly Aegon has the resources available for expansion. Under the leadership of its chairman, Mr Jaap Peters, who is retiring, the company's decision to focus its business more heavily on less volatile and more profitable life insurance has been highly successful. Premiums from life insurance now account for 64 per cent of premium income, compared with just more than 50 per cent in 1983, and generated more than three quarters of the group's profits in 1992. Income amounted to Fl 15.3bn (Pounds 5.52bn) in 1992, with profits - before realised gains - rising to Fl 785m. Mr Bob Yates of brokers Fox-Pitt Kelton estimates the company has more than Fl 2bn for expansion and says the group is constantly seeking to add to its network of subsidiaries. Recent acquisitions have been guided by the aim of building sizeable shares of well-defined market segments, an approach which contrasts with the 'all products for all customers' philosophy favoured by some of its rivals but which fits in neatly with the thinking of Scottish Equitable.</p>

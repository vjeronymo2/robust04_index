Of course, the last thing you could ever accuse the  Bolsheviks of was wanting to build a civil society. But the  needs of industrialization forced them to achieve 100-percent  literacy among the population and to give higher, if not  classical, education to millions of people.    And political awareness is the inevitable offshoot of  education. So we have the Bolsheviks to thank for that, too!    However, once their "political enlightenment" had given us a  taste for big politics, they were unable to satisfy our  political appetite. We had to do this ourselves, getting  together with friends and colleagues in somebody's kitchen.  Where else, I wonder, would the cook and her children do it?    O kitchen!    You are the birthplace of all our country's present  political  concepts and doctrines. You launched the careers of many stars  and entire troupes who are now giving shows on the political  stage. And it does not matter that the relations between them  are, frankly, more appropriate to the kitchen. What matters is  that the actors and performers should have a perfect mastery of  at least the main recipes in political cuisine: all those  cooked-up facts served up with titillating "plums," all that raw  meat from the hot spots, stuffed with lead and covered in  ideological sauce. Of course, the public does not always like  these details -- it is a matter of taste. But since they are  feeding it to us anyway, we had better make sure they do not  foist any really uneatable bad meat on us.    That is why, from now on, page two of our newspaper will  carry articles by the best chefs who prepare dishes for the  table of the country's president, government, leading  politicians, and businessmen. Let us hope that with their help  we will all reach the standard of that legendary cook who is  supposed to run the state.    And irony aside: That standard is what is called a civil  society.    Today we offer for your attention two pieces of research  work  carried out specially for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's analysis service  by a group of experts.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI has exclusive rights to this research.    So, welcome to our political kitchen!    Yours,    Feliks Babitskiy.    [Malyutin, Grigoryev, Yakovenko article begins] And All  This Is About Him    About the terrible Zhirinovskiy, from whom, for some reason  or other, people expect unheard-of villainies and great acts of  heroism on a Quixotic scale -- and some of them, in a fit of  "administrative rapture," have even decided to form a front to  barricade themselves against him. This is totally unwarranted  -- you only have to remember Zhirinovskiy at the Constitutional  Conference to see how quiet and God-fearing he can be. He too  will be a center. Center in every sense, including a center of  attention, and, with 70 people, a center of decisionmaking.  Unless, naturally, a centrist majority forms, and finds a common  language with the government, and that is clearly not going to  happen for the first few months at least. And if enough acts of  folly are committed during that time, the Duma in its present  composition might never succeed at all.    Of course, on the strength of its basic principles,  Zhirinovskiy's party is the typical "power party," in some ways  downright archetypal, as Grandpa Lenin would have said. But  unlike the Communists and the national patriots, who based all  their plans (and still do, sometimes, to this day) on raising  the masses against the ruling regime and using parliament as a  platform to kindle the masses' fury, Zhirinovskiy has every  chance of coming to power legally in the very near future.  Never in his life has he had any philosophical allergy (whether  based on communism or on a back-to-the-land philosophy) to using  general elections, the presidency, and parliamentary democracy  as tools. Without comparing him to Hitler, we would nonetheless  like to point out that the Third Reich was a strictly  rule-of-law state, and its Fuehrer never broke a single law in  his life (OK, so he wrote the laws himself, but every great man  has his whims).    And so the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], like  the other groupings (YaBL [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin] and the  PRUA [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] most of all) for whom  the most important thing is the presidential elections in summer  1996 (that is the very latest date, they could be earlier), will  use the Duma (which, moreover, does not decide anything, in the  sense of exercising power) to "flex their muscles." Shakhray  and Yavlinskiy will demonstrate to the whole world that "only  they can stop" Zhirinovskiy, using him as a battering ram. If,  say, after a while Zhirinovskiy concludes that there is a high  probability of his losing the elections, he will undoubtedly go  over to the intransigents and become their leader, but that is  not how things stand for the time being. He does not really  need them as a worn-out step up to his pedestal.    What we have here is a kind of "negative synthesis" of the  NSF [National Salvation Front] in content and Democratic Russia  in form -- and more effective in both cases, thus far. There is  no need to embark on an analysis of the front's ideology now:  The predominant force there was "down with!", and any attempts  to think in terms of "long live!" ran aground on the problems  faced by "an alliance of cats tied together by their tails." It  is quite obvious that in September-October the NSF suffered an  organizational failure, since it was not in control of anything  and played the part of more or less active "cannon fodder" and  "cheerleaders" for Khasbulatov and Rutskoy. All in all, there  were too many petty contenders for the roles of leaders and  ideologues, none of whom knew how to work with the mass media --  nor were they willing to learn....    As for Democratic Russia, it had, generally speaking, the  same organizational Achilles heel. For this movement of  brilliant (mainly Moscow-based) individualists, Yeltsin was  initially "not one of ours." They quite openly decided to take  him up and make use of him as a battering ram in pursuit of  their own goals, making no secret of the fact that they could  drop him if they no longer needed him, and he repaid them in  kind. Yeltsin very sensibly never claimed to be an original  thinker. They got into parliament thanks to their own efforts,  and when, for one reason or another, they were disappointed with  Yeltsin, they distanced themselves from him, and often gained by  doing so. It is no accident that virtually nobody from Moscow's  Democratic Russia has made an even remotely successful  government career, even after August 1991.    Yeltsin, for his part, within his "milieu," always kept the  radicals at a certain distance, preferring the position of  "father of the nation." In actual fact Zhirinovskiy likewise --  with adjustments for temperament and style -- was never a  radical in his actions, nor is he an "unbounded" demagogue. As  long as you do not hang on his every word and judge him by his  public statements, in actual fact he is rather a cautious  creature who always has a keen sense of the dividing line  between what is permitted and what is not, for the moment,  permitted. Even without him, the Duma will have no shortage of  radicals, who will inevitably try to "out-Zhirinovskiy" him and,  in a way, to revive the traditions of the "White" wing of the  NSF.    Zhirinovskiy took "his" list into the Duma himself, on his  own back: 60 of them, of whom only six are from the electoral  districts -- a striking contrast! They include practically no  well-known, outstanding individuals except for A. Kashpirovskiy  and the ecologist M. Lemeshev, nor are there any really  independent thinkers with claims to originality -- although the  presence of the editor of YURIDICHESKAYA GAZETA and a group of  legal experts and economists formerly linked with the radical  wing of the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation]  solves the problem of who will write the draft laws, while at  the same time giving rise to a certain lack of internal  homogeneity in the team, where there is already a growing  dissatisfaction among the "old boyars" with the "new staff of  smart guys." It will therefore be a very obedient tool,  especially if the idea of the imperative mandate --  propagandized not only by Zhirinovskiy -- catches on and the  entire faction votes as one man, so that the "lawyer's son"  could end any parliamentary or extraparliamentary argument with  the same phrase (like Cato about Carthage): "Apart from all  that has been said, I must add that Russia's problems will never  be solved until I am elected president, the sooner the better."  This phrase will sound all the more weighty given that, with  the existing structure of the Duma, Zhirinovskiy's faction could  block any decision by abstaining. Unless the center can come to  an agreement with either Zyuganov or Gaydar on any given  question.    Meanwhile Vladimir Volfovich will willingly explain to  whoever wants to listen that he is voting in this way because he  does not want to get dragged into squabbles between bankrupt  politickers who are always sharing out power and do not think  about the people. Against the background of the democrats'  convulsive attempts to knock together an antifascist front (it  is not clear that this front is going to do anything except make  trips abroad: It might hold rallies -- but who is going to  come?), these tactics will instantly win new supporters. Of  course, there will be rows too, and on many more occasions our  hero will have to write the word "traitor" next to the names of  those who are presently his closest comrades in arms -- for a  charismatic leader, that is quite normal....    Moreover, the "Zhirinovskiy factor," irrespective of the  fact  that everyone has already declared that they will not join a  coalition with him, will strengthen the intransigent opposition  of the old stamp.    That opposition can now operate as zealously as it likes --  because this Duma cannot be disbanded, except, of course, at  bayonet point. And judging by the vote, the main military  secret is not how many bayonets, sabers, and other antiquated  items the former Red Army has, but whom the army is backing  today. The present Kremlin authorities know very well that  there can hardly be a repetition of the October onslaught -- a  miracle is a miracle precisely because it happens only once.  The intransigents could even blackmail the democrats with the  threat of self-dissolution by the Duma, because at the moment  everyone knows who would win the next elections if such were  held. Obviously not "Russia's Choice," especially since the new  electoral law (including the Law on Presidential Elections) will  be adopted, amid heated debates, by this very Duma. And  Yeltsin's edicts, whether on the timing of the presidential  elections or on abandoning them, also need ratifying. So there  you are.    Naturally, Zhirinovskiy's future as a politician is by no  means cloudless, and his success is by no means predetermined,  just as Yeltsin's political past -- turbulent even by our  standards, which are far from poor in this respect -- was not  cloudless. In the opinion of many serious analysts, Yeltsin's  career, retrospectively, looks like a chain of lucky chances  which at any moment -- until the evening of 3 October 1993 --  turned out ultimately in his favor. But that does not really  have anything to do with parliament: The LDPR faces questions  relating to the building of its own political party, the  coordination of extraparliamentary forms of pressure on the  regime, work with the Army, foreign policy actions, and much  else. After all, before the elections it was no more  substantial than the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia] in this  respect, that is, it had a few thousand activists and, according  to expert assessments, its numerical strength was not much in  excess of 10,000 members, and, other than in the Moscow region,  it was influential and had a real presence only in the  Nonchernozem and a few other regions.    It is clear that all this will not be decided at the level  of the parliamentary faction: That faction will give voice to  the planned strategy and tactics in the public area, which,  incidentally, is what has always been done throughout the world.  But since, in this article, we are analyzing not the prospects  of a certain type of charismatic leader and his "ultramodern  party" taking power, but the prospects of the new parliament on  whose stage he will put on his political performances, what has  been said about the LDPR is sufficient, as a first  approximation. Zhirinovskiy has received his mandate of  confidence as the "Yeltsin of today," in an even more provincial  version. Let us see whether he will be able to take advantage  of it.  <H5>  On the Eve of a Choice </H5>   In its very first hours of work the State Duma will face a  question whose answer will immediately clarify much. It is a  kind of archetypal "knight at the crossroads" situation. With  its "if you turn left...and if you turn right...." This is not  the question of the government, as many people fear. Ultimately  Chernomyrdin has quite a good chance of being given confidence,  although, of course, some unpleasant moments lie in store for  him when he is forced to answer the question of the possible  presence of Gaydar, Chubays, Fedorov, and Kozyrev in the  government. After all, if worst comes to worst, the question of  the government can be avoided entirely, but the question of  ratifying Edict 1400 cannot be avoided. Especially since this  procedure was stipulated by the edict itself and by subsequent  legislative activity carried out by the president "on credit."    The consequences of the ratification or nonratification of  Edict 1400 are obvious. If the edict is not ratified, the  entire new political and legal structure collapses. After that,  while the president will unequivocally be, from the legal  viewpoint, a "usurper and rebel who carried out a bloody coup  d'etat," parliament, although it will not have been elected  entirely legitimately, will still remain the organ of people's  power. All it has to do is to declare itself, by a simple  majority, to be the successor not only to the Congress, but also  to the State Duma and the Constituent Assembly into the bargain,  and even to the Zemskiy Sobor that used to elect the czars at  one time.    First of all, the new Constitution automatically ceases to  operate, since the referendum on it was held in violation of the  Law on the Referendum, which Yeltsin was entitled to do only in  the event that the edict was ratified. Incidentally, in their  haste, they omitted to repeal or suspend that law.  Nonratification of the edict does not necessarily mean the  automatic reinstatement of the disbanded Congress, but it does  allow for the possibility of turning the Duma into a Constituent  Assembly, and here you cannot get away with just another edict  to the effect that the relevant point of Edict 1400 is invalid  on the basis of the referendum results (nationwide approval by  one-third of the electoral register is politically insubstantial  and has no legal status without ratification by parliament),  especially since the new Constitution was not adopted in the  majority of components of the Federation.    The situation is made even trickier by the fact that votes  must be collected not against, but for ratification, and it is  quite possible to propose the interpretation that since Edict  1400 is undoubtedly constitutional, it requires a constitutional  majority (that is, three-fourths), and this cheerfully postpones  the question until the twelfth of never. There will be people  in the Duma who will raise this question, but the centrists will  be very well aware of what prospects face them in this  connection. Especially since the YaBL bloc has decided to seize  the initiative and has declared that it will seek the formation  of a commission for parliamentary investigation of all the  circumstances relating to the adoption and implementation of  Edict 1400. It will then be "not just simple, but very simple"  to postpone its ratification until then and to keep Yeltsin  personally in their sights. While extracting in exchange, as a  minimum, a return to June 1994 presidential elections. And then  it will be possible to create a really broad front, if not  antifascist (there is no real threat from there at present),  then an anti-authoritarian front, on the basis of limiting the  president's powers and returning to a majority system in  elections.    The democratic factions themselves have no way of collecting  225 votes for the ratification of the edict, especially since  not everyone in the PRUA or YaBL will vote for it, and the  "independent" is independent, and it is not at all clear what he  can be bought for at the moment. Nor is intimidation really  practicable. Two options remain. Either you buy the votes of  the centrists, up to and including the agrarians -- but in  return they will demand the government, nothing less. Or else  you openly enter into a coalition with Zhirinovskiy, once again  on the basis of renewed constitutionalism. And even then there  might not be enough votes. From the viewpoint of his own  interests, there is no particular reason for Zhirinovskiy to  "tarnish his bright image" in the eyes of the voter through an  open alliance with "Russia's Choice." That could lose him  votes. On this question, it would be better for him to abstain:  After all, he played absolutely no part in the  September-October events, and therefore he need not join in  someone else's fight, he can sit and wait. But the question of  the ratification of Edict 1400 gives him a unique opportunity to  demand, as payment, that presidential elections be called for  June of this year. That step is something that would be very  well understood by his voters. And not only his....    Whatever the president's team may do, the raising of the  question of Edict 1400 in the Duma is inevitable. This will be  voted for both by the centrists, if our analysis is correct and  there are more serious politicians among them today, and by  Zhirinovskiy, because power itself is falling into his hands.  "We will make a deal with the president" -- this man knows what  he is saying. The reformers had better start thinking now who  they would prefer to deal with. They have already started:  Kozyrev observed aloud that the communists were always the  staunchest fighters against fascism. How far Zyuganov can be  counted as one of them, and how far it is reasonable to classify  his party, in its present form, in the tradition of the left,  and specifically the antifascist tradition, is another matter.  But the CPRF clearly does not tolerate crooks, and if it is  going to come to terms, it is only with Chernomyrdin and the  "pragmatic wing" in general, certainly not with fundamentalist  ideologists. It has plenty of its own, within the faction.  Especially since the CPRF has its own favorite complicating  factor -- a coalition government of people's confidence, and it  is clearly going to push that most of all.    But if the barrier of Edict 1400 can somehow be crossed, the  problem of the budget and the government will loom large, mainly  the former, because, whatever Constitution we are to live under  in future, any parliament is going to have a fairly distant  connection with the government, but the Duma will allow the  government to draw up the budget for 1994, so as to be able to  castigate it later (and Fedorov's head alone might not be  enough). As for other avenues of development, there is no point  in talking about them until after this latest fork in the road  has been traversed.</p>

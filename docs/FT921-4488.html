			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Recession slashes trade surplus to just DM50m GERMANY'S foreign trade surplus virtually disappeared in January as recession in the country's main markets caused a slowdown in exports, writes Christopher Parkes. The surplus shrank to just DM50m (Pounds 17.3m) from DM5.1bn in December and DM1.3bn in the comparable month in 1991, and was the lowest since last July's DM200m. At the same time the current account deficit rose to DM6.4bn from DM1.7bn in December and DM2.1bn a year earlier, the federal statistics office said yesterday. Exports and imports of goods were both down on the year, reflecting slowing economic growth. However, overseas sales of DM54.38bn compared with DM57bn, fell more than imports, which dropped DM1.36bn to DM54.33bn. The current account figures included a DM2.2bn deficit in services and one of DM4.1bn in 'other payments'. A breakdown of separate east and west German contributions is expected in the next two weeks. Germany's trade deficit with the Far East, meanwhile, is causing increasing concern. Exports to the region rose only 2.6 per cent last year while imports jumped 25 per cent, according to Mr Edgar Nordmann, president of the East Asia Association, a Hamburg traders' group. Net result was a one-third increase in the deficit to a record DM38.7bn, he said.</p>

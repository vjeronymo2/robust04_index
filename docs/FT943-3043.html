			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Raytheon's UK jet plants set to close Raytheon of the US is to close the corporate jet business it bought from British Aerospace and transfer work to the US with the loss of 850 UK jobs over the next three years. The decision provoked strong protests yesterday after its announcement by the US industrial group which acquired the BAe business for Pounds 250m last year. Union and Labour party representatives called on Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to intervene to stop Raytheon closing its facilities at Broughton, near Chester, and Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Raytheon currently leases both plants from BAe. The US company, which is also suspending production of the Hawker 1000 business jet and slowing production of the smaller Hawker 800 jet, said the move reflected difficulties in the recession-hit corporate jet market. 'The timing of this decision is principally driven by the current weak market conditions and substantiated by the results of a recently completed study by Raytheon after it acquired Corporate Jets from British Aerospace,' the US company said. It added it was immediately cutting 170 out of 550 jobs at Broughton, where Hawker business jets are assembled, and 143 out of 300 jobs at its Hatfield design, engineering and marketing facility. The remaining jobs at both plants will go by 1997, although several UK employees will be offered jobs in the US. Raytheon is also cutting 630 jobs in the US as part of the overall rationalisation of its corporate aircraft activities. The company is merging its Beech Aircraft subsidiary with the former BAe corporate jet activities it acquired last year into the Raytheon Aircraft Company based in Wichita, Kansas. Raytheon said final assembly of Hawker jets would start being moved from Broughton to Wichita next year and be completed in 1997. There were fears yesterday that the decision could also have repercussions on jobs at BAe's Airbus division at Chester, which supplies wings and fuselage sections for Hawker jets. About 470 BAe Airbus staff are employed on Hawker activities. Apart from poor market conditions, Raytheon said its study of its aircraft businesses concluded that merging Hawker and Beech aircraft production would achieve significant cost savings. The company is suspending production of the Hawker 1000 to improve the model and boost its sales prospects. Raytheon renamed the BAe corporate jets Hawker when it took over the company. Since the sale, former BAe employees had worried that Raytheon would transfer production to the US. But the announcement still came as a shock to staff. Mr Tony Lloyd, Labour's employment spokesman, said it was 'outrageous that an American company can move in, buy an order book and then close down forever the plants with the consequences for skilled employment'.</p>

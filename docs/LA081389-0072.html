			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> DAUGHTER OF LAWYERS WED RANCHER, NEW WAY OF LIFE  </P> <P> Annie Debevoise, a granddaughter, daughter and sister of lawyers, thought she  would take some time off to work out West before returning to law school in  Vermont.  </P> <P> In 1987, she hired on as a $9,000-a-year organizer with the Northern Plains  Resource Council, a rural advocacy group based in Billings, Mont.  </P> <P> As a single woman of 26, she took a lot of kidding from the cattlemen and their  wives, who were always trying to fix her up. One day a bunch of cowboys  standing around at the local grain elevator dared her to drive the 16 miles  over back roads to Andy Ostby's house and introduce herself.  </P> <P> She did. Now, at 28, she is Annie Ostby, ranch wife.  </P> <P> Instead of torts and statutes, she has learned how to brand a calf, play  midwife to a cow and load up a pack horse.  </P> <P> There is no vacation in the winter because the cattle have to be fed. In the  spring the calves are being born, and there is no time off in the summer,  either, because the crops have to be harvested.  </P> <P> "Andy's told me we might squeeze in a week in November," she said.  </P> <P> While hundreds of Montana women are seeking employment off the land because  they need earn extra money, Ostby says she feels lucky to be able to stay home  and learn about her new life style.  </P> <P> "I take it one day at a time," she said, sitting on the porch of her  37-year-old husband's family home. The house is surrounded by rolling green  fields of wheat and grass. The nearest neighbors are out of sight, over the  next rise.  </P> <P> "I want to learn everything I can, I want to be Andy's partner, I want to help  make this the best ranch it can be."  </P></p>

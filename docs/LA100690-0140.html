			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS / MEASURE M;  </P> <P> TAX INITIATIVE BACKERS RAISE $222,245 TO ZERO FOR FOES  </P> <P> Supporters of Measure M, the transportation sales tax initiative, have raised  more than $220,000, only about one-third as much as they had raised at this  point during last year's unsuccessful campaign for the measure, according to  campaign finance reports filed Friday.  </P> <P> The pro-Measure M group is planning a lower-key, less-expensive campaign this  year after a glitzy $2-million effort failed during November's off-year  election. Through Sept. 30, the group had raised $222,245, with available cash  of $83,263 and unpaid bills of $140,283, according to the report.  </P> <P> Measure M foes did not file a finance report Friday because they have not  raised any money, said Tom Rogers, one of the leaders of the No on M campaign.  </P> <P> Rogers said the group's only financial activity so far consists of acquiring  about $900 in unpaid legal bills.  </P> <P> The largest contributors to the Yes on M campaign were the Building Industry  Assn., Disneyland, Fieldstone Co., Irvine Co., Rancho Santa Margarita Co. and  Shea Homes, each of which gave at least $25,000. C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons  gave $10,000.  </P> <P> Campaign committees and candidates must file another finance statement Oct. 25,  their last comprehensive report before the Nov. 6 election.  </P> <P> If approved, Measure M would increase the sales tax in the county by half a  cent to pay for county transportation improvements.  </P> <P> In the hotly contested 72nd Assembly District, Democrat Tom Umberg's campaign  staff was still compiling his latest contribution totals Friday night, but  campaign manager George Urch said he has raised about $263,000 this year and  has about $52,000 cash on hand.  </P> <P> "We're doing pretty well. . . , considering Tom is the non-incumbent," Urch  said.  </P> <P> If those estimates prove to be correct, Umberg will be ahead of incumbent  Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) in fund raising. Pringle reported  total contributions for the year of $175,509, with $73,546 in cash on hand.  </P> <P> Pringle said he hopes to raise $350,000 by the time the race is over. "I think  I'm basically on target for what I need to spend," Pringle said. "There is a  possibility I will be outspent."  </P> <P> In the 58th Assembly District, Republican candidate Tom Mays has raised  $170,819, more than four times as much as his opponent, Democrat Luanne W.  Pryor, who has raised $37,357. Mays, the mayor of Huntington Beach, and Pryor,  a Long Beach activist and public relations executive, are hoping to capture the  seat vacated by Assemblyman Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos), who is not running  for reelection.  </P> <P> In the only race for county supervisor, incumbent Harriett M. Wieder was  expected to raise far more than her opponent, Westminster City Councilwoman Joy  L. Neugebauer, but Wieder's campaign declined to make her latest financial  figures available Friday, the postmark deadline.  </P> <P> Neugebauer has raised $23,470 and had $6,895.41 cash on hand as of Sept. 30.  </P> <P> "I'm counting on the grass-roots support I've been getting to carry me  through," Neugebauer said.  </P> <P> In the district attorney's race, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James G. Enright has  bridged the campaign contribution gap considerably against appointed incumbent  Michael R. Capizzi.  </P> <P> Capizzi ran away from his three opponents in campaign contributions in the June  primary, raising three times as much as all of them together. Capizzi raised  $140,541 for the June race; he has since added $81,705 in contributions.  </P> <P> Enright raised just $18,102 for the primary. However, since placing second to  Capizzi in the four-man race and forcing a runoff, he has raised another  $51,324.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Dave Lesher and Jerry Hicks contributed to this report.  </P></p>

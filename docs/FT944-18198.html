			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Iran's leaders try to stay a step ahead of critics: Inflation and debt overshadow economic reform advances Most Iranians tend to subscribe to one of two explanations for their economic plight: that prices are kept deliberately high to keep their minds off politics; or that clerics are incapable of running an economy. Such disaffection is a valuable political weapon in the hands of opposition groups. The latest denunciation of Iran's clerical rulers, headed by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the spiritual leader, came last week from a retired army general. General Azizollah Amir Rahimi, who was made a general after the overthrow of the Shah in 1979, last week called for an end to censorship, the resignation of the government and free elections. Gen Rahimi, a former commander of the Tehran military police, is one of a dwindling band of elderly Tehran-based opposition figures reluctantly tolerated by the regime - although they are arrested from time to time  - mainly because it does not regard them as a serious threat. Opponents of the regime also point to Iran's growing debt burden in recent years. The country had an unblemished payments record until 1992 when an import spree resulted in delays in payment of letters of credit. The man widely held responsible for this and for falls in the value of the rial, Mr Hossein Adeli, stepped down as governor of the central bank three weeks ago, having seen out his five-year term despite fierce criticism by sections of the majlis (parliament) and press. Before leaving office, Mr Adeli managed to organise the rescheduling of at least Dollars 8bn of Iran's total Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn debt. Critics of Mr Adeli's policies will not be heartened by his replacement  - Mr Mohsen Nurbakhsh, economic adviser to Mr Rafsanjani and, until August last year, minister of economics and finance who was unseated after losing a vote of confidence in the majlis. He is returning to an old job - he was governor of the central bank from 1981-86 when he established a reputation as an able administrator. Mr Nurbakhsh stressed that there would be no shift in direction in the central bank's policies and that he would be 'making the least changes in rules and regulations . . . . I think that the changing of rules is an impeding factor in economic growth and development.' An economics graduate of the University of California, he said he intended to establish normal banking ties with other countries and to put banking services at the centre of the financial and business community, so that 'there is little need for referring to unofficial networks and those operating outside the banking system'. Mr Nurbakhsh also said that he aimed to create a single exchange rate and on Sunday, he made a move in this direction by declaring transactions outside banks or authorised exchange houses illegal. Yesterday the Tehran daily, Abrar, reported dozens of arrests of illegal dealers. A short-lived attempt at unifying the three main exchange rate bands was abandoned in May, after a steep fall in the exchange rate towards the end of last year. The free market value of the Iranian rial has fallen to one-fortieth of its value against the dollar since 1979 but the dollar's official exchange rate is 1,750 rials. The fall in the rial's value has made exports more expensive but at the same time prices for oil, on which the state depends for more than 80 per cent of its foreign exchange, remain relatively low. High inflation has been a persistent problem, exacerbated in the late 1980s by the central bank printing money to help the government meet its budget deficit. Last month, Ayatollah Khamenei again drew attention to the problem of inflation: 'High prices have created problems for specific strata. I do not believe this problem is unavoidable. Officials should strive to solve the problems faced by these strata.' Mr Rafsanjani has been trying to shift part of the state's costly economic burden to the private sector. A government coupon system entitling everyone to basic necessities at low prices operates at a high cost to the state. However, Mr Rafsanjani's attempts to phase it out in favour of cash support for the needy are opposed by the majlis, which is worried about the political consequences. Earlier this month, the majlis voted against cutting subsidies on food and medicine costing the government about Dollars 1.7bn a year. However, it approved in principle a rise in petrol and fuel prices, details of which will be debated next month. Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, the oil minister is seeking a fourfold rise in petrol prices from 50 rials a litre (about 3 US cents at the official exchange rate) to 220 rials. The government says that oil subsidies cost it Dollars 11bn a year - almost as much as it expects to earn in oil revenues this year. Attempts to attract foreign investment have been largely unsuccessful because of continually changing economic measures and shifts in economic direction. However, late last month Nestle, the Swiss food manufacturer, signed a joint venture agreement with a private Iranian company to establish a baby formula and infant cereal factory at a cost of SFr60m (Pounds 29.7m).</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEALING FROM IMMIGRANTS  </P> <P> To help pay for President Bush's war on drugs and other worthy federal  programs, the Senate recently raided a fund created to help newly legalized  immigrants. Such shortsighted budgeting will adversely affect many California  residents and local governments. It must be reversed by the House of  Representatives.  </P> <P> When Congress passed the landmark Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986,  one of the key provisions was a legalization program, commonly referred to as  an amnesty, for immigrants who had been living illegally in the United States.  Almost everyone involved in the debate over illegal immigration agreed that it  would be inhumane to deport people who had lived in this country long enough to  establish ties here. What did become controversial, however, was precisely who  should pay for providing government services to these people and their families  once they came out of hiding and began using public hospitals, schools and  other facilities.  </P> <P> Officials for cities and counties with large immigrant populations successfully  argued that since immigration is a federal responsibility, Congress should  reimburse them for part of the cost of serving newly legalized residents. So  when the immigration reform bill was enacted, a little-noted section of that  law set aside $1 billion each year, for four years, to reimburse local  governments. These so-called State Legalization Impact Assistance Grants  (SLIAG) are important to counties like Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego that  have large populations of immigrants legalizing their status under the reform  act.  </P> <P> It was this year's $1-billion appropriation for immigrant aid that was raided  by the Senate last week, with the encouragement of the Bush Administration.  Claiming a surplus in the fund, Administration officials asked that $400  million be redirected to drug programs, and the Senate took out another $155  million for health research. The so-called surplus in SLIAG exists because the  funds accumulated while the federal government has been slow in reimbursing  local governments and not because there is no demand for the money. For  instance, Los Angeles County, with the largest number of immigration amnesty  applicants of any local jurisdiction in the nation, has asked for $230 million  from the federal government in the current fiscal year and gotten only $28  million back so far. San Diego County is seeking a more modest $2 million, but  has received only $300,000.  </P> <P> And, because of other provisions of the immigration reform act, the need for  that money will increase in the next few months rather than diminish. In order  to complete the amnesty process, for example, immigrants must complete study  courses in basic English and civics by late next year. There won't be enough  classes to meet the demand if public school districts don't get money from the  federal government to pay for them.  </P> <P> In an effort to reduce the negative impact the cutbacks in SLIAG will have,  Sen. Bob Graham (R-Fla.) introduced an amendment to restore the missing $555  million in 1991. But that will be too late to help many local governments and  school districts. Besides, as Rep. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles) points out,  there is no guarantee that money will actually be available for Congress to  hand out in 1991. So, rather than undermine the process of immigration reform,  the House should restore the SLIAG money and tell the Senate to find its  "surplus" funds elsewhere in the budget.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Dan </F> Margalit in the studio -- live]    [Text] [Margalit] We have just heard on IDF Radio that  the delegation leaving for Cairo consists of only Major General  Amnon Shahaq's group. Does this mean the Palestinians want to  slow down the negotiations on Gaza-Jericho First?    [Peres] I am not certain this report is correct or official.  The delegation will be able to deal with the issue of Hebron as  well as the issue of resuming the negotiations on Gaza and  Jericho. It has been decided that the parties will first  discuss the issue of security in Hebron and, if they reach  agreement, they will immediately move on to the issue of Gaza  and Jericho. I hope they will reach an agreement.    [Margalit] How many Palestinian policemen are we willing to  allow into Gaza, Jericho, and Hebron; and how many Norwegian  observers, for example?    [Peres] This is precisely what we will tell the Palestinians  tomorrow. I would not like to state it on television now.    [Margalit] What does it really matter whether there will be  20 or 200 Norwegians? Either we trust them, or we do not.    [Peres] Basically, we trust the IDF [Israel Defense Forces].  It is in charge of security in Hebron. We make supreme efforts  to prevent friction, to take the other side's needs into  consideration as well. We would not really want to set up three  equal forces in Hebron. At the same time, we agree to bring in  an international presence -- as we pledged in the Declaration of  Principles with regard to Gaza and Jericho. The figure is  important. It will determine whether it is a presence or more  than that.    [Margalit] Who will command the Palestinian policemen in  Hebron, for example?    [Peres] Overall and supreme responsibility over issues of  security will remain in the hands of the IDF.    [Margalit] But, there will be situations, such as the one we  saw on television, in which settlers fire their guns. Can  Palestinian policemen fire at them, or will they first have to  ask the permission of Gen. Mufaz?    [Peres] It is not as simple as that. We want to prevent  contact between the two altogether. I suppose that the  Palestinian police will guard Muslim and Arab sites, and there  will also be joint patrols. As a whole, the IDF will have the  overall and supreme responsibility.    [Margalit] If you want to prevent friction, you must ban the  settlers from going to the marketplace in Hebron, because it is  not clear whether we should protect them or protect other people  from them.    [Peres] This is not the only alternative; you can have two  access routes, one for the settlers, the other for the Arabs.  We seek solutions for the complicated situation, as you pointed  out.    [Margalit] Speaking on this issue, are you for or against  the settlers staging a march in Hebron [on 30 April]?    [Peres] I certainly oppose it. Who needs it?    [Margalit] How about a rally?    [Peres] Look, one of the worst things to have happened,  other than the Cave of the Patriarchs incident, is the incessant  appearances of the those people on the international media. One  may have the impression that the Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza  settlers control the State of Israel. They use extremist  language, painting a picture of an nearly unrecognizable Israel.  The situation is incredibly tense; there is enormous anger;  nothing has calmed yet. Who needs this rally? What for?  Against what? What does it serve?    [Margalit] It is against the government policy, which is  their democratic right.    [Peres] You can stage demonstrations against the government  policy in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. You do not stage  demonstrations in tense and hurting places. There is a limit.  Look, everything is allowed; I could come into your house and  pull you out [as heard]. The question is what do we do when the  situation is very tense; when there is a lot of friction; when  some people use their arms illegally; what do we do to reduce  the tension?    [Margalit] Would the friction not have been better reduced  by pulling out the settlers from the heart of Hebron, not Qiryat  Arba', but Bet Hadassah and Tal al-Rumaythah?    [Peres] I do not know. I will not say anything on this  matter outside the cabinet sessions. We are in the midst of  negotiations, not only with ourselves. Anything you say  immediately turns into a concession before negotiations were  even held. Being a member of the cabinet, I believe that the  only place for me to discuss such issues is the cabinet session.  I suggest that we do not task the IDF with this matter. I  expect the members of the cabinet to have the courage to ask how  to construct a situation which would minimize friction and  clashes, while securing the life of people of all sides,  settlers as well as Arabs.    [Margalit] Assuming that the, so called, security package is  wrapped up -- that is, the first stage of the Palestinian police  and Norwegian observers entry into three regions in the  territories -- when do you believe, will the Gaza and Jericho  stage of the negotiations be over?    [Peres] It depends. If we reach the agreement on providing  a feeling of security in Hebron tomorrow and begin discussing  Gaza and Jericho the next day, and if the delegates sit all next  week -- day and night -- in an accelerated process of  negotiations, we can finish the whole thing in two to three  weeks.    [Margalit] But, as we just heard, the PLO wants negotiations  to start only when the security package is wrapped up.    [Peres] I hope they will end it tomorrow.    [Margalit] Are we that close?    [Peres] I believe so. The gaps are such that I believe they  could be bridged. We can end discussing the issue of Hebron  tomorrow evening or night, and make an agreement. Then, we will  be able to immediately begin discussing Gaza and Jericho the  very next day. At the same time, we were to begin discussing  economic issues, but the PLO announced that it wants to begin  discussing this next Sunday. Let me tell you: Any delay in the  beginning of the discussions, will naturally lead to a delayed  conclusion.    [Margalit] Finance Minister Shohat said today, however, that  the economic agreement is ready, and if it was not for the Cave  of the Patriarchs massacre, it would have been signed by now.    [Peres] I believe there are some issues that need to be  agreed on; there is agreement on some things, and disagreement  on others. Negotiations are still called for.    [Margalit] Would it not have been more convenient had we  been in the midst of negotiations with Syria?    [Peres] I believe that we must first end the matter of Gaza  and Jericho. We must first crate a piece of new Palestinian  reality. Nothing will change the situation in the Middle East  more than a change in the physical reality. Making another  declaration, statement, or appearance is unimportant. We are  pretty close, I believe, to turning the Oslo agreement into a  new political reality. After this, we will have to start the  Syrian issue.    [Margalit] Not before? Not at the same time? Last week we  heard al-Asad saying that if Rabin wants peace in the north, he  should come and make an arrangement.    [Peres] I do not know where he was quoted....    [Margalit] It made the headlines.    [Peres] Another headline.... If he opens the negotiations,  they will open and right now. We are putting off nothing. It  should be understood that peace is not made between leaders  only; it is peace between peoples. Negotiations involve both  nations. In any event, our people have to see, in no uncertain  terms, that the Syrians are really willing to enter full  negotiations for full peace.    [Margalit] Mr. Peres, do you agree with the prime minister  that, in its deliberations, the Shamgar commission causes damage  to the IDF?    [Peres] It certainly causes problems. I would not like to  reach conclusions about the commission before it reaches its own  conclusions about what happened, but it is very problematic.  The Army officers must prepare and be ready for their  appearances, explain, worry, and convince others. This is very  difficult.</p>

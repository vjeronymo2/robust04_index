			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KADAFI SEES IRAQ AS FUTURE U.S. FRIEND  </P> <P> Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi, comparing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to  Egypt's slain leader Anwar Sadat, said Sunday that Iraq might emerge from the  Persian Gulf crisis a friend of the United States and Israel.  </P> <P> "History always repeats itself," Kadafi said in a speech to political science  students at Fatah University in Tripoli.  </P> <P> He said President Sadat, gunned down by Muslim zealots in 1981, entered the  1973 Arab-Israeli War a sworn enemy of the United States and Israel, as Iraq is  now. "He (Sadat) emerged from the war their closest friend," he said.  </P> <P> Sadat and Kadafi became arch-enemies shortly after that war because of  ideological and other issues.  </P> <P> "Iraq can one day be another Egypt . . . whether the confrontation over Kuwait  ends peacefully or through war," said Kadafi, quoted by the official Libyan  news agency Jana.  </P></p>

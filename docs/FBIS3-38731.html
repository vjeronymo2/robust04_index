It is "a scandal" that the Croatian  Government is not keeping its promise, Kohl said today in an  interview with the private television channel SAT.1. This must  be met with "the strongest rejection." At the same time,  however, the chancellor defended the fact that the German  Government had pressed for the speedy recognition of Croatia and  Slovenia. Developments in Slovenia are a "success," he said.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Parkland reduces loss to Pounds 519,000 PARKLAND Textile cut its pre-tax loss from Pounds 2.17m to Pounds 519,000 in the year ended February 28, after exceptional charges of Pounds 286,000. Withdrawal from garment manufacturing cost an extraordinary Pounds 1.04m, but allows the group to develop its more competitive activities of woollen spinning and worsted weaving, with strong emphasis on the dyeing of both yarn and fabric, said Mr Denis Greenwood, chairman. The group also terminated its direct involvement in weaving fabric for the motor industry by selling its interest in Guilford Europe. Turnover rose from Pounds 49.4m to Pounds 58.9m. Exports increased 58 per cent to Pounds 11.9m and represented over 20 per cent of total sales, against 15 per cent. Mr Greenwood looked optimistically on plans for export growth to create a better balance in the business. Exchange rates would be crucial, he stressed. In the yarn division Knoll Spinning experienced strong order books with significant increases in exports. Yorkshire Yarn Dyeing saw rises in volume throughput but pressure on prices and margins. Fabric losses were eliminated with further improvement in the order book and margins in home and export markets. Losses per share were 8p (19.9p). The final dividend is 1p for an unchanged total of 2p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava Jan 5 (CTK) -- A public rally of several  hundred citizens of the southern Slovak town of Komarno,  convened by the Slovak cultural organisation Matica Slovenska in  its Komarno House today, supported a petition drive for the  resignation of Komarno Mayor Isztvan Pasztor, a leader of the  Hungarian minority in southern Slovakia.    Pasztor is a chairman of the Council of the Association of  Towns and Villages of Zitny Island, which has called a meeting  of deputies and mayors from southern Slovakia designed to  establish a Hungarian "region with special legal status" in the  area populated mostly by ethnic Hungarians.    Yesterday, a group of Komarno citizens started a petition  drive for the dismissal of Pasztor, putting up petitions at many  places in the town. Zdenka Anettova, director of the Komarno  Matica Slovenska House, told CTK that about 2,000 citizens have  already signed the petitions, while some 5,000 people are  required for the mayor to be dismissed.    A resolution adopted by the public rally condemned the  Komarno meeting scheduled for this Saturday [8 January],  describing it as the "first frank move towards the violation of  the Slovak Republic's integrity, with the final aim being to  join Slovakia to Greater Hungary."    At the same time, participants appealed to Slovak President  Michal Kovac to initiate a change in the law on elections to  local offices. The amended law should guarantee citizens of  Slovak nationality the right to participate in administration of  all towns and villages in the Slovak Republic, including in the  regions where they are the minority.    They also called on the Slovak Government to rapidly work  out  a "concept of a definitive solution to ethnic minority problems"  and to submit it to the Council of Europe as a proposal for a  European norm on the national minority position.</p>

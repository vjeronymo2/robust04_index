			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 9 -- Leader of the Democratic Union  (UD) Tadeusz Mazowiecki said in Warsaw on Saturday the UD would  not contribute to the destabilization of the state by vetoing  the 1994 budget. Mazowiecki was addressing a congress of  Warsaw's branch of the party.    The leader of the UD expressed the opinion that the present  government is "the government of stagnation and not of reforms".  He explained that the UD had supported the presidential veto  concerning the law on new wage-control measures because the veto  had been concordant with the party's previous stand on the  issue. Mazowiecki simultaneously stressed that the party's being  in opposition cannot mean that it contributes to the  destabilization of state structures by backing the possible  presidential rejection of the budget.    On Saturday, members of the UD warsaw branch elected 31  additional delegates to the unification congress of the party  with the Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD) to be held on April  23 and 24. Similar by-elections in all regions were necessary to  maintain at the unification congress the agreed statistical  proportion of 2.7 UD delegates to 1 KLD delegate.    The establishment of the new party will not mean that "the  (Democratic) Union is beginning from scratch", Mazowiecki said.  It is a process of continuation, a transition to a new stage of  our party's development, he added.    According to Mazowiecki, one of the most important problems  facing the new party is an answer to the question how one should  reconcile economic reforms with the necessity to meet public  expectations.    Draft statutes of the new party envisage that the first term  of the new grouping's authorities will last for a year, the  second one - two years. A 100-strong national council of the  party is to be composed of 73 present ud members and 27  liberals. The party's presidium is to be made up of 8 UD  members and 3 liberals.    The new party is to have only one deputy chairman. Under the  statutes, all members of the new party holding ministerial posts  must join the national council.    National secretaries of the party would be elected by the  national council to implement "the current policy of the party"  in various spheres of the economy and public life.</p>

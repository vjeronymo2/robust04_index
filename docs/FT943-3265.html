			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / US 'committed to occupation of Haiti': Clinton assails junta as 'most brutal, most violent' in the hemisphere The US is committed to leading a temporary multinational occupation of Haiti even if the military junta in Port-au-Prince agrees to leave the island immediately, according to a senior administration official yesterday. Ahead of President Bill Clinton's pivotal televised address to the nation tonight, Mr Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary of state, said the presence of such a force would be required to establish 'basic civic order' before the restoration of the ousted government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Mr Clinton himself accused the junta of rampant human rights abuses and vowed to oust them by force if necessary but said they still had a chance to leave voluntarily. 'We have literally exhausted every available alternative and the time has come for those people to get out. They can still leave. They do not have to push this to a confrontation,' he told wire service reporters. He said Haiti's dictators were the 'most brutal, most violent regime anywhere in our hemisphere', responsible for 3,000 political murders since they took power in 1991. Sifting through pictures of blood-spattered victims, he blamed the military for the deaths of orphans, church people and others and accused them of using rape as a political weapon. Earlier, Mr Talbott was asked if anything could now prevent the invasion of Haiti, and replied that even if 'belatedly the three principal dictators get the message and leave, it will still be necessary for an international force to be deployed anyway'. Mr Clinton's challenge tonight is severe, given the extent of political and public doubts about the wisdom of US involvement in a country whose intrinsic importance to the US is doubted. Other officials, including Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, and Mr Leon Panetta, White House chief of staff, have given interviews preparing the ground for Mr Clinton. But there is no substitute for the president, as commander-in-chief, to make the case for despatching US forces into danger, even when, as in Haiti, the strength of military opposition is probably nugatory. Mr Talbott was intent on minimising the longer-term US exposure and maximising international support for the operation. He repeated that, after the initial invasion, the multinational force from 20 or more countries would comprise about 6,000 personnel, less than half of them American. But the prevailing mood in Washington, reinforced by Mr Talbott's comments, was that a decision to invade, spearheaded by a 20,000-strong US amphibian force, had been made and that only the question of timing remained in doubt. Yesterday another US aircraft carrier, the Eisenhower, left for Haitian waters to join the America, which sailed on Tuesday.</p>

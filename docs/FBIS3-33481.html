The document was  signed for Panama by Foreign Minister Jose Mulino and for the  Russian Federation by Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov,  who arrived in Panama on 20 February and returned home yesterday.    In the protocol the sides agreed to periodically consult and  exchange opinions with each other on bilateral issues, common  problems, and topics that are discussed at international forums.    Mamedov said the signing of the document "constitutes a  historic moment for relations between Panama and Russia,  especially with regard to both country's political and  commercial prospects." The diplomat, whose words were  officially translated into Spanish, asserted that Panama plays  "a very important role" in his country's foreign policy, and  added that this event "marks the beginning of our political  relationship."    Panama and Russia established consular relations on 29 March  1991.    Meanwhile, Mulino said the Russian diplomat's visit "is an  unprecedented event in the history of Panamanian international  policy because, among other things, it is the first time a  ranking Russian official has visited our country." Mulino said  he is certain that relations between the two countries will  prove to be very beneficial. Regarding his meeting with Mamedov  and President Guillermo Endara, Mulino explained that they  discussed both countries' complex and difficult transitions to  democracy.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PATIENT RABBI;  </P> <P> HOSPITAL HELPS PASADENA GET A TRANSFUSION OF FAITH  </P> <P> Virtually every Saturday morning, the new rabbi for Pasadena Jewish Temple  rises from his bed at St. Luke Medical Center and walks a block to the  synagogue where he leads the Sabbath rites.  </P> <P> "I'm so dedicated that I get out of my hospital bed to conduct services," Rabbi  Gilbert Kollin said with a laugh, describing his weekly routine.  </P> <P> Since July, Kollin has had a private room in St. Luke's fourth-floor ambulatory  unit, where he is a familiar sight to doctors and nurses during the Jewish  Sabbath from Friday evening to Saturday afternoon.  </P> <P> "I sometimes worry," he said half-seriously, "whether someone will make a  mistake and plug a needle in me, cart me away and remove a vital organ."  </P> <P> Make no mistake, Pasadena Temple didn't hire a sick man -- Rabbi Kollin hikes  halfway up Mt. Wilson each weekend with several temple members. However, an  ailing housing market did leave Kollin in a dilemma.  </P> <P> Previously the rabbi for nine years at Hollywood Beth El, Kollin this year  accepted the pulpit position in Pasadena, assuming that he would soon sell his  home in the Beverly-Fairfax area and move with his wife and youngest son near  the temple. But house sales have fallen off sharply in recent months because of  a glut of listings.  </P> <P> "That was a problem for me because I don't drive on the Sabbath," Kollin said.  As a rabbi affiliated with the Conservative movement, Kollin is not required to  follow Jewish law prohibiting driving on the Sabbath as rigorously as his  Orthodox brethren.  </P> <P> "But I just never have driven on the Sabbath," he explained. "The core of the  Sabbath means 'stop,' 'slow down,' 'stay where you are.' "  </P> <P> Kollin commutes by car from his home other days and drives to Pasadena on  Friday afternoon before dusk. The problem was what to do after conducting the  Friday night service for the 475-family congregation.  </P> <P> "But there is no hotel or motel near here, and I didn't want to impose on  temple families who live nearby," he said.  </P> <P> Because St. Luke Medical Center was so close to the synagogue, Kollin went to  the hospital's executive director, Samuel W. Pangburn. "I made a discreet  inquiry about any available rooms on the weekend," Kollin said.  </P> <P> Pangburn, also a new resident in the area, was sympathetic with the rabbi's  problem in selling his house. "I had just gone through the same thing,"  Pangburn said.  </P> <P> Since a room was usually available on the weekend, Pangburn came up with a  plan. He offered free accommodations in exchange for the rabbi's chaplaincy  services. "He calls on patients who have need of some support," the  administrator explained.  </P> <P> Kollin broke his Sabbath routine only on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year,  when he stayed with a family that belongs to the temple.  </P> <P> But Kollin returned to Room 402 at the hospital last weekend and he expects to  keep checking in weekly until the housing market improves.  </P> <P> "It's perfect for the situation," he said. The room comes with a bathroom and a  cushioned, adjustable chair, and he is permitted to use the doctors' shower  room.  </P> <P> Kollin observes Jewish strictures against handling money during the 24-hour  Sabbath by using a meal card in the hospital cafeteria. It's not a kosher  kitchen, but the rabbi says he manages by sticking to fruits, cereal and the  salad bar.  </P> <P> Kollin does not follow the Orthodox tradition of avoiding turning on lights or  electrical gadgets. And so, he can enjoy the television in his room.  </P> <P> "I go back to my room Saturday afternoon for a little nap, then return to the  temple for our 5 p.m. study group," he said.  </P> <P> How is the bed?  </P> <P> "Hard as a rock," the rabbi confessed, "but you're not going to hear me  complain."  </P></p>

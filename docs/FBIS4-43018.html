			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Solbes Denies `Formal Agreement' To </F> Delay Single Currency, But Admits That There Have Been Talks"]    [Text] Economy Minister Pedro Solbes acknowledged  yesterday that Felipe Gonzalez, Francois Mitterrand, and Helmut  Kohl have held talks on the advisability of forgoing the  European single currency in 1997, as EL PAIS reported Sunday [29  May]. "The three men have been able to talk, analyze this  situation, and take the view that it must be left until 1999,"  Solbes told the Servimedia agency. However, in Solbes' opinion,  it is not a matter of a "formal agreement." "It is an exchange  of views," he specified. German Finance Minister Theo Waigel was  more laconic, but did not deny the talks' existence. Asked  about this, he confined himself to stating: "I cannot confirm  it."    The Spanish economy minister pointed out that it is  "enormously complicated" for some countries to achieve the aims  set in the Maastricht Treaty. "We will have to implement  Maastricht in accordance with the circumstances," stated Solbes,  in whose opinion the decision to undertake or delay monetary  union will have to be taken in 1996. That year, "there will be  a major political discussion on Europe's future," he said.    However, French President Francois Mitterrand and German  head  of government Helmut Kohl have assured Felipe Gonzalez that the  European Union (EU) will not set the third stage of monetary  union under way in 1997, as European officials connected with  the Economic and Monetary Union [EMU] process confirmed to EL  PAIS.    German Finance Minister Theo Waigel, who took part in a  Franco-German summit in the French city of Mulhouse yesterday,  displayed a more ambiguous stance on the talks between the three  European leaders, according to REUTER. Asked about this by  journalists attending the summit, Waigel did not deny the  report, which was also carried by the German FRANKFURTER  ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG newspaper, and simply stated: "I cannot  confirm it."  <H5>  Unlikely Date </H5>   The Maastricht Treaty envisages that the third stage of EMU,  which entails the adoption of the single currency, will begin in  1997, provided that there is a minimum of seven countries that  fulfill the convergence criteria required. Mitterrand and Kohl  promised Gonzalez not to take this step, even if there were that  minimum number of countries able to do so.    On the French side, Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery, who  is also taking part in the Franco-German meeting in Mulhouse,  asserted that he has no knowledge of any agreement between  France, Germany, and Spain to delay the adoption of the single  currency.    However, senior French officials made it clear that they  regard the date of 1997 as unlikely for adopting the single  currency, in view of many Community states' problems in reducing  their public deficits.    Also during the meeting with Germany in Mulhouse, French  Minister Alphandery rejected the conclusions on the future of  the Community's labor market drawn up by a Franco-German  committee of labor experts, in which they recommend extensive  deregulation. Alphandery said that the text is provisional and  does not commit the Paris and Bonn governments.    In addition, Secretary of State for Finance Enrique Martinez  Robles stated yesterday that Spain will not need to make a  budgetary adjustment this year in order to reduce the public  deficit, unlike in the past few fiscal years.    Martinez Robles, who delivered a lecture on public finance  in  El Escorial, stated that the deficit performed better than  forecast in the first four months of this year, and that it has  fallen by almost 20 percent. In his opinion, the state budget  for 1995 will maintain social expenditure and investment in  infrastructures without increasing the tax burden.</p>

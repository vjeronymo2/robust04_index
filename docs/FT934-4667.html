			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farm exit bonds 'could save EU Pounds 3.8bn a year' The European Union could save about Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.8bn) a year in agricultural spending in the short-term under a bond scheme that would replace open-ended subsidies for farmers, according to a study published today. The study, published by the European Policy Forum, a London-based think-tank, examines options for so-called exit bonds, which would guarantee farmers a sum equivalent to the subsidies they replace, but only for a fixed period, in this case 15 years. After that, all financial support would end and farmers would be subject to market forces. Barclays Bank economist Mr Philip Poole, who wrote the report, said recent reforms of the common agricultural policy did not go far enough. 'Medium term budgetary savings are unlikely, particularly in view of the prospects for (EU) enlargement to include agricultural producers in central and eastern Europe,' he said. 'Reconciling the revamped CAP regime with global trading rules is also problematic under existing plans for reform.' His report draws on proposals put forward by Prof Stefan Tangermann, applying them to a specific sector - UK wheat production - in order to examine their likely impact. Mr Poole suggests that farmers could choose between two kinds of exit bonds. The first, income-only bond, would pay interest in the form of a coupon for a fixed term, while the second would provide no income but grow in value until maturity. The bonds would be tradeable on a secondary market, so that farmers who wanted to leave the industry could sell them and re-invest in some other activity, such as leisure facilities. Alternatively, farmers could use the bond as collateral for a loan to restructure their holdings, for example by cutting food production and diversifying into a non-farm business. 'The only rationale for continuing the subsidisation of agriculture is that farmers have invested over an extended period on the basis of previous EC policy and you need to give them time to readjust,' said Mr Poole. 'This gives them that opportunity with a guaranteed period of subsidy but then they have to live with the market.' Mr Poole suggests that the near-term annual savings to the CAP budget, standing at Ecu35bn this year, would be about Ecu5bn, assuming that 15 per cent of farmers choose the second bond option to take advantage of its higher sale value in order to leave the industry. This is because subsidies to those farmers would end immediately and the EU would not have to pay out on the bond for 15 years. Exit bonds would also remove the need for set-aside, since they would bring about the shrinkage in arable production which set-aside is designed to achieve, Mr Poole said.

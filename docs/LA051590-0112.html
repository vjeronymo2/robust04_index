			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA WOMEN ROW TO ACCLAIM ON A SHOESTRING;  </P> <P> CREW: SALONITES BUILDS NATIONAL PROGRAM, BUT SHE IS CRITICAL OF SCHOOL'S  DECREASING FUNDING.  </P> <P> Kelly Salonites, the women's crew coach at UCLA, was not having a great  morning. It was barely daybreak at the university's Marina del Rey boathouse,  and Salonites had just told her team that, because of tight money, they would  not race at Oxnard that weekend. Sending 35 women, plus boats, there for two  days would cost several thousand dollars.  </P> <P> Now, as she took her varsity women for a workout in two boats of four rowers  each, the engine on her coaching launch threatened to quit. Using her blue UCLA  megaphone, she told the athletes to carry on without her if she could not make  it up Ballona Creek to the turnaround point at the Lincoln Boulevard bridge.  </P> <P> Sure enough, a quarter mile up the creek, the old 25-horsepower engine wheezed,  coughed and stopped cold, enveloping Salonites in a cloud of noxious white  smoke.  </P> <P> The coach, oarless, calmly started paddling with her megaphone.  </P> <P> "It's my life," she shrugged, displaying a measure of the stoicism she gets  from her Cherokee father.  </P> <P> "Luckily we're drifting backwards," she said. "This has been a good year. I've  only broken down eight times."  </P> <P> Eventually, the shells came back. One was maneuvered into position to tow  Salonites to the dock. She directed the rest of the workout from a bicycle on  the bike path parallel to the waterway.  </P> <P> It was perhaps fitting that rowers dragged the helpless launch and its disabled  engine to safety. The human element is what keeps the UCLA women's -- and men's  -- crew programs afloat.  </P> <P> Supporters of crew at UCLA believe that the university's athletic department  has a faint-hearted commitment to rowing.  </P> <P> The program has been building since Friends of UCLA Rowing (FOUR) hired Polish  defector Zenon Babraj as coach in 1986, and, judging by results, UCLA crew has  made it to the big leagues. Except for the University of Washington and  occasionally California, West Coast crews have never been taken seriously by  Eastern schools.  </P> <P> But now, UCLA's men and women are ranked second or third in the nation; both  are threats to win West Coast championships at Sacramento's Lake Natoma this  weekend -- it would be the fourth consecutive year for the men -- and national  titles.  </P> <P> The women need a victory at Sacramento to earn a trip to the national  championships in Madison, Wis., June 2-3, since the regatta organizers will pay  expenses only for the Pac-10 winner. Other boats pay their own way.  </P> <P> "If we don't win, we don't go," Salonites said. "UCLA isn't providing any money  for us to go the national championships."  </P> <P> Besides success in collegiate crew, UCLA is adding to the pool of Olympic level  rowers.  </P> <P> "What they don't understand in the athletic department is that we are producing  world-class elite athletes here," Salonites said.  </P> <P> Kris Korzeniowski, national technical director of U.S. Rowing, spotted several  new candidates for the national team in Salonites' boats and has invited them  to development camps.  </P> <P> In the varsity eight, besides stroke Cathie Heacox, a member of the national  team, are two U.S. Olympic Festival medalists -- Catriona Fallon of Burlingame  and Leslie Lewis of Torrance. Coxswain Katy McMahon of San Francisco competed  in the World Championships as a member of the U.S. junior national team.  Leilani Johnson of Malibu attended the U.S. pre-elite camp in 1989.  </P> <P> A lightweight four is training under Salonites as well. Leslie Lewis of  Torrance, Kim Cramer of Clayton, Heacox of Agoura and Kerry Conway of South San  Francisco hope to earn the right to compete at the Goodwill Games or at the  World Championships next fall in Tasmania.  </P> <P> Korzeniowski also said he would like to recruit Salonites to coach a national  team boat.  </P> <P> "I think she's a rising coaching star," he said, noting that all rowers in her  boats use the same technique.  </P> <P> "It's not a fluke," he said. "It's the sign of good coaching."  </P> <P> But just as the effort is paying off, the UCLA athletic department is backing  off.  </P> <P> "We've moved the machine to the level of make or break," Babraj said. "The  profile of athletes has changed. There's tremendous momentum."  </P> <P> Salonites' husband, Robert, a former UCLA oarsman and a fund-raiser for the  program, said: "Kelly and Zenon will need double next year to sustain what  they're doing here. The game's changing."  </P> <P> Both coaches said it isn't fair to expect the athletes to put out the kind of  effort they do to support the program -- some work three jobs -- while training  at such a high level and going to school.  </P> <P> Said Judith Holland, assistant athletic director in charge of 23 sports, among  them crew: "We will continue with the core funding for rowing. It will not be  (downgraded to) a club sport. It will not be discontinued. We will try to find  ways to help. But our hands are tied."  </P> <P> Such sentiments don't impress Salonites, who feels strongly that UCLA should  encourage and support the program.  </P> <P> "The chancellor said he wanted to maintain the integrity of the athletic  department, that education is the most important thing." Salonites said. "But  small sports are suffering, not just rowing.  </P> <P> "Nobody wants to hear about rowing. But how many sports is it going to take to  become extinct before people notice what's going on at universities?  </P> <P> "The money is there," she said. "They choose to put it somewhere else. It's a  policy decision. UCLA rowing is getting less than UC Davis and other California  schools. We have developed the program to one of the best in the country.  </P> <P> "And we don't ask for scholarships or any special help. It is not fair to place  the burden on the athletes, their parents, the coaches and the alumni. We do  all the work and the athletic department is taking all the credit when we do  well."  </P> <P> Rowing is not an NCAA sport. It is not a revenue sport. Except in the Ivy  League and at the Division III level, it generally is low profile. And women's  crew, at most schools in existence not more than 15 years, is even less  visible.  </P> <P> Of the $1.6 million designated for sports from student registration fees, the  UCLA crew program receives $55,000 a year from the athletic department --  $25,000 of which is for the women. Four years ago, the figure was $150,000 for  men alone.  </P> <P> During a recent regatta at UCLA, Salonites could be seen dashing from her  coaching duties on the launching dock to hawking wares at the T-shirt stand to  checking yogurt supplies at the refreshment table.  </P> <P> Alumni groups, parents, rowers and coaches make up what the university fails to  provide.  </P> <P> The men's allotment from the athletic department goes strictly to support the  boathouse. Salonites is paid $12,000 from the women's allotment and $8,500 from  FOUR. She raises the money to pay her freshman-novice coach, Marisa Hurtado,  $6,000 for travel, insurance, gas and supplies.  </P> <P> Among the expenses the crew program sustains is the rental of trucks from UCLA  to tow the boat trailer. The women pay their own expenses at regattas, buy  their own uniforms and pay their air fare.  </P> <P> Still, Salonites, despite spending 70% of her time raising money for the  women's program, has produced a first-class crew.  </P> <P> On April 7 the varsity eight won the prestigious Whittier Cup at the San Diego  Crew Classic, outclassing Cal, Stanford, Washington, Wisconsin and  Pennsylvania. The women's junior varsity boat also won.  </P> <P> "They were so busy celebrating it took a week for them to settle down,"  Salonites said of her crew.  </P> <P> Several weeks later, at Redwood Shores near San Francisco, UCLA added Radcliffe  to its hit list. Then, facing Princeton in the final, the Bruin women suffered  their only defeat of the season.  </P> <P> Princeton Coach Curtis Jordan, who is also U.S. national team men's coach,  later wrote to Salonites:  </P> <P> "I was truly impressed with your crews' rowing and more importantly their  racing. . . . I was envious of the style you have taught them. It is a bold and  powerful stroke that I think is very effective with women. It is difficult to  teach properly, but you have done it. It took some courage to even try.  Congratulations."  </P> <P> Salonites, 28, is a bit overwhelmed by such accolades, since she is rather new  to coaching. A 1985 graduate of UCLA with a degree in psychobiology, she rowed  under coach Jean Riley, later training with national team coach Bob Ernst of  the University of Washington. She won a gold medal at the U.S. Olympic Festival  in Baton Rouge, 1985, in a pair with Heidi Hook.  </P> <P> She was assisting Riley and had been accepted to graduate school when Babraj  asked her to coach the women.  </P> <P> "She had instinct," Babraj said. "And trust from the athletes. She was  energetic and willing to learn."  </P> <P> Salonites said that Babraj taught her almost everything she knows about  coaching.  </P> <P> "He's always been very generous with his time, whenever I have a question," she  said. "He's my encyclopedia of rowing."  </P> <P> Salonites was named Pac-10 women's coach of the year in 1989.  </P> <P> But as one of her athletes said: "They said if we won, things would change.  Well, we're winning, and things are the same."  </P></p>

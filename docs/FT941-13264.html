			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Dean Witter jumps ahead to Dollars 604m Dean Witter, Discover, the US financial services group, reported a 47 per cent jump in net income for last year to Dollars 604m, or Dollars 3.66 a share, as its securities and credit card businesses reported strong advances. Buoyed by the same surge in US underwriting and record commission income that have pushed earnings at other securities houses to new highs, the company's securities business reported net income in the last quarter of Dollars 75m, and Dollars 284m for the year as a whole. During the latest period, commission income at Dollars 237m was 28 per cent higher than a year before, while revenues from principal trading fell 13 per cent to Dollars 90m. After-tax profits from the Discover card, which has more account holders in the US than any other payment card, rose to Dollars 63.6m in the quarter, from Dollars 35.6m the year before, as revenue growth of 22 per cent outpaced a slower rise in costs. The card, launched in 1985, first came into profit in 1988 and has continued to grow strongly since. Revenues in the latest quarter were helped by a 31 per cent increase in fees from merchants and cardholders, mainly due to higher transaction volumes on existing cards.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Good first half at Sankyo SANKYO, the Japanese drugs maker, boosted its non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the first six months to September on brisk sales of its anti-cholesterol drug. Pre-tax profits for the first six months advanced by 27.8 per cent to Y35.8bn (Dollars 291m) on a 13.1 per cent rise in sales to Y200.7bn. After-tax profits rose 2.8 per cent to Y13.5bn. Expanding sales of Mevalotin, Sankyo's mainstay, plus insecticides helped in the company's strong performance, while sales of health drinks slumped on a fall in consumer demand. Sankyo will raise its interim dividend to Y5 per share from Y3.75. For the full year to March, the company forecasts a 25.4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y65bn on a 8.5 per cent increase in sales. After-tax profits are expected to rise 10.5 per cent to Y25bn.</p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / German Bonds: D-Mark's strength provides support AFTER last week's 'rate cut that wasn't', German government bonds are expected to stay supported in the short term by the D-Mark's continuing strength. Moreover, slow economic growth and the government's restrictive fiscal stance are expected to keep a lid on inflationary pressures, allowing the Bundesbank to cut rates further - albeit slowly - and supporting bunds in the longer term. While the Bundesbank last week cut its discount and Lombard rates by a half point, to 6 1/4 and 7 1/4 per cent respectively, it lowered its more important repo rate by only 10 basis points, to 6.70 per cent, reaffirming its cautious easing stance. Bund yields rose on the news on profit-taking after the recent rally. Ten-year yields have fallen some 110 basis points since the beginning of the year. In the past month alone, they dropped by 25 basis points to 6.12 per cent. However, last week's modest repo easing has capped long yields and boosted the D-Mark against the dollar and most European currencies. Most analysts say this scenario is likely to continue supporting bunds in coming weeks. According to Mr George Magnus, chief international economist with SG Warburg, a reversal of the D-Mark's strength is unlikely. For one, European central banks will continue buying D-Marks to shore up their foreign reserves, which were depleted by heavy currency intervention during the recent crisis in Europe's exchange rate mechanism. Moreover, as Germany's neighbours start exploiting their wider ERM fluctuation bands to cut rates independently, their currencies may weaken further against the D-Mark, he says. Lastly, Mr Magnus points out that German real short-term rates are unlikely to fall much as their decline will go hand-in-hand with a decline in inflation. The Bundesbank justified its latest rate cuts with ebbing inflation, lower-than-expected money supply growth, and the D-Mark's strength. In western Germany headline inflation is currently running at 4.2 per cent, but economists expect the rate to fall to around 3.5 per cent by the year end, and well below 3 per cent in 1994. M3 money supply, which grew by an annualised 7.4 per cent in July, is set to rise further in August, bloated by that month's heavy currency intervention. However Bundesbank president Mr Helmut Schlesinger said recently he expected M3 to return to its 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target later this year. The Bundesbank regards M3 as an indicator of future inflation. Meanwhile, Bonn's plans for a tighter fiscal stance indicate the total public-sector deficit as a percentage of GDP will fall in coming years from some 8 per cent in 1993. All this will support bunds in coming months, and analysts see 10-year yields falling to around 6 per cent by the year end, and as low as 5 1/4 per cent in 1994. Continued rate cuts by the Bundesbank would enable investors to make quick profits by placing their money at the short end of the yield curve. But longer-term investors are still best off at the long end, most analysts concur. 'When the Bundesbank starts easing again, the shorter maturities should perform well,' said Mr Rainer Back, bond strategist at DB Research, a Deutsche Bank subsidiary. 'But over the longer term, the long end offers the best total returns.'</p>

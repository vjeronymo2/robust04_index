			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "India's nuclear battle-cry"] </F>   [Text] In total disregard of the need for establishing  peace in the region and improving the socio-economic conditions  of the people inhabiting it, Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao  has once again said that his country would not give up the  nuclear option "under any circumstances". Speaking in the Rajya  Sabha, he categorically stated that India will not sign the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) nor will it accept any  "regional arrangement" on the issue under pressure from any  quarter. He also reiterated his Government's commitment not to  cap the missile programme. Referring to the just concluded  official talks in London with the United States, the Indian  Prime Minister said that no special significance should be  attached to them as these would have no impact on the country's  nuclear policy.    Statements emanating from India at the highest level  indicate  that it is determined to unleash a nuclear arms race in South  Asia. At present India operates eight nuclear reactors and has  atomic research centres all over the country. In addition, six  more reactors are under construction and another 14 have been  planned for the next 20 years. There are confirmed reports that  at the moment India possesses 40 to 60 nuclear warheads.  Through its Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme  initiated in 1983, India has developed five missile systems. It  has successfully tested its intermediate range  surface-to-surface missile, Agni, which has a range of 2500  kilometres which would ultimately be increased to 5000  kilometres. To keep all this hidden from the outside world,  questions about India's nuclear programme cannot be asked in its  Parliament under the Nuclear Energy act of 1962.    It is only because of the threat posed by its bigger  neighbour that Pakistan was forced to embark on its own nuclear  programme. However, in the interest of peace in the region and  to save it from a nuclear holocaust, Pakistan has offered seven  different proposals to curb regional proliferation. All of  these have been rejected by India on the pretext that it  believes only in global nuclear disarmament. This is only a  self-serving stance and an excuse for not signing the NPT. In  an address to the Indian Defence Policy Forum in 1992, former US  Secretary of Defence, Robert McNamara asserted that "by its  refusal to accept the NPT, India is isolating itself and is now  seen as a major barrier to further progress toward reduction of  the nuclear danger". In January 1993, the Washington Post  wrote: "There is growing consensus that it makes little sense  to penalise Pakistan but not India, a far bigger power whose  indigenous development of both nuclear and ballistic missile  capacity continues unabated. In her address at the Command and  Staff College, Quetta the other day, Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto highlighted the same point: "The nuclear and missile  threat to Pakistan is real and immediate. It is, therefore  unrealistic and illogical to expect Pakistan to take unilateral  steps. Sanity and reality demands regional nuclear solution".  It is unfortunate that by pursuing a policy of benign neglect  towards India's nuclear Programme, the West has complicated the  region's nuclear tangle. The international community has to play  its role in this connection and exert pressure on New Delhi to  see reason and accept the imperative of a regional approach to  dealing with the nuclear issue -- a potential threat to the  existence of more than a billion people in the sub continent.</p>

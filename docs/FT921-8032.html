			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Beer sales up at Kirin Brewery KIRIN Brewery, Japan's largest brewer, posted record non-consolidated pre-tax profits for 1991. The company attributed the result to strong sales in its premium-priced luxury beer, Ichibanshibori. Unconsolidated pre-tax profit rose 1.8 per cent to Y86.4bn (Dollars 680m), while after-tax profit increased by 2.4 per cent to Y36.7bn. Overall sales, however, fell 3 per cent to Y1,315.7bn due to the separation of Kirin's soft drink division in January last year to a Tokyo-based joint venture with Tropicana Products of the US. The venture, Kirin Beverage, markets orange juice and other Tropicana products. If the soft drink division had remained and contributed to the latest earnings, it would have added some Y120bn to Kirin's sales. Last year, Kirin recovered its 50 per cent share of the Japanese beer market thanks to brisk sales of its lager and premium beers. Sales of the beer division - the group's largest earner, accounting for 98 per cent of overall turnover - rose 6.4 per cent to Y1,284bn, on a 5.2 per cent rise in volume to 3.4m kilolitres. For the current year, Kirin expects a 0.6 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, to Y87bn, on a 4.9 per cent increase in sales to Y1,380bn. The company expects rising costs to squeeze profit margins. Kirin said it expected to increase capital spending by 6.4 per cent to Y79bn. It said it would draw down internal reserves to cover redemption of Y54.3bn in warrant bonds.</p>

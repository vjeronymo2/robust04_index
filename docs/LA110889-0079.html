			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BO REMAINS NONPLUSSED BY HIS OWN FEATS;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: RUNNING BACK DISMISSES HIS ROLE IN THE RAIDER RENAISSANCE. BUT  MOST EVERYONE ELSE HAS TAKEN PROPER NOTICE.  </P> <P> The great ones rarely are impressed by their own feats, so excuse Bo Jackson if  he fails to understand all the ruckus people are making over his 303 yards  rushing the last two weeks, his 73-yard run against the Washington Redskins and  his 92-yard run here Sunday against the Cincinnati Bengals.  </P> <P> "My grandmother could have run that play," he said of the 92-yard, team  record-setting touchdown run. He may believe that, but, truth is, there are few  backs in the history of pro football who are capable of doing what he has done  the last two weeks, after just finishing a baseball season in which he hit 32  home runs and drove in 105 runs.  </P> <P> Cincinnati Bengals Coach Sam Wyche, a difficult-to-impress man, was nearly in  disbelief after watching Jackson rush for 159 yards and two touchdowns in just  13 carries. "Bo is as advertised," Wyche said. "He's one of the rare ones to  come along. I just hope that he'll be appreciated as long as he's here,  especially while he's still a healthy, young, frisky back. He's going to be  talked about as one of the legends of the game, believe you me."  </P> <P> Despite having played only four games and averaging only 16 carries, Jackson is  on a pace to gain 1,284 yards and is averaging 7.4 yards per carry. By halftime  against the defending AFC champion Bengals, he had rushed 127 yards. Because  the Raiders were so far ahead -- they led 28-0 on their way to a 28-7 victory  at Memorial Stadium -- Jackson carried only four times the second half.  </P> <P> "He was the MVP of the (baseball) all-star game," Raiders cornerback Mike  Haynes said. "I think this year he's trying to get to be MVP of the Pro Bowl  and become the answer to a trivia question. He just seems to be possessed this  year."  </P> <P> The 92-yard run was the crown jewel -- so far. Many great runs involve players  such as Earl Campbell and Larry Csonka trampling defenders, Jim Brown and  Walter Payton stiff-arming men to the ground, O.J. Simpson weaving and cutting  through traffic. Jackson's run didn't have any of that drama because nobody  touched him. He assumed a Carl Lewis pose and sprinted to the goal line. The  run was so breathtaking the Raiders were fighting each other to retell the  story.  </P> <P> "I had a great view," quarterback Jay Schroeder said. "Turned around, flipped  him the ball, made sure there was nobody coming from the back side. By the time  I turned around again, he's running down the sideline. So I put my hands up  (signaling touchdown). There's one defensive guy crossing the field to make it  look good. He's not going to catch Bo. So I put my hands up. Turned around,  started slapping hands with the offensive linemen. Bo is probably about their  20-yard line by now."  </P> <P> Even what Bo didn't do was impressive. On the first play from scrimmage,  Schroeder faked a pitch to Jackson, a move that drew the entire defense toward  Jackson. Schroeder then threw 63 yards to Willie Gault. Al Davis, the Raiders'  managing partner, studied film all week and knew it would work. "It was  incredible," guard John Gesek said. "We talked about that play for four days."  </P> <P> Afterward, the Raiders and Bengals lined up to praise Jackson. Even after he  pointed his fingers like imaginary six-shooters, the Bengals had no qualms.  "Bo'd probably be the best back in the league if he played football full-time  -- if he isn't already," Bengals cornerback Eric Thomas said. "All I can say  is, 'More power to him.' "  </P> <P> Raiders defensive end Howie Long said Jackson will only flourish under new  coach Art Shell, whose offense is simple and whose personality is a lot like  Jackson's.  </P> <P> "Last year (when Jackson averaged 4.3 yards per carry) the offense was a lot  more complicated (under recently fired Mike Shanahan) and it would have been  too complicated for any halfback to come in at mid-season and pick it up  perfectly," Long said. "We're basically lining up and running the ball down  your throat now.  </P> <P> "Bo and Art are the same kind of people. Mild-natured, people who produce,  people who believe strongly in what they do. It's not someone who is verbose or  loud about it. They're quiet men who get things done."  </P> <P> "I'm afraid to sit down and rest as a defensive player," nose tackle Bob Golic  said. "Thank God for that new replay scoreboard. Now, I can just sit back and  catch whatever I miss if I turn my head."  </P> <P> Haynes, a 14-year veteran, was asked if there is there is anybody he played  with or against with whom he would compare Jackson. "O.J.," Hayne said. "But he  didn't weigh 235. You start watching closely over the course of a game and guys  are hoping somebody else gets to him first."  </P> <P> Long thought about two of the league's best, including injured teammate Marcus  Allen. "Marcus has the ability to change a game," he said, "but Bo has  Herschel's speed, plus Bo athletic ability. That's what I think Herschel lacks,  ... that notch-above athleticism."  </P> <P> Jackson could hear all the talk around him, and said: "The way I look at what I  do is that it's not physical. Everything is mental. If I put my mind to  anything, I can usually do it."  </P> <P> In another corner of the room, Shell was trying to make sense of this 6-foot-1,  230-pound marvel, who has averaged 11.7 yards per carry the last two weeks and  helped the Raiders to a 3-1 record since joining the team.  </P> <P> "Bo is a combination of so many backs," Shell said. "He's got the power of Earl  Campbell, the speed of Eric Dickerson. He's a fullback in the body of a  tailback, or is it the tailback in the body of a fullback? Whatever he is, he  explodes and whatever he is, he's tremendous."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Liberal Democratic Union of 12 December in the </F> "Document" rubric, dated 12 May]    [Text] On 11 May, the Russian Federation State Duma passed  in the first reading by a small majority of votes a draft  federal budget for 1994 submitted by the government, and  confirmed its main indicators: outlays, revenues, and the  maximum level of budget deficit.    Our faction jointly spoke for passing this decision whereby  it decided the outcome of the voting to a considerable extent.    We realize that the structure of the submitted draft budget  only preserves the position that prevails today in the national  economy, and suggests no radical changes in its sorry condition.  Clearly insufficient funds are set aside for education and  science, the outlays for the maintenance of the state apparatus  are too high, and so on.    We are convinced that the size of the confirmed maximum  level  of budget deficit is on the verge of the so-called "controlled"  inflation, whereas the amount of fiscal pressure allows for no  invigoration of the economy whatever, suppresses private  initiative, and prevents the possibility of creating new jobs on  a large scale in conditions of growing unemployment.    We did realize, however, that all delays in the Duma's  discussion of the draft budget would have led only to additional  government concessions to various lobby groups and a further  bloating of the size of the budget deficit, which would have  triggered a sharp deepening of the economic crisis.    We realized that we could not have expected a better budget  from the current Russian Federation Government (we could have  expected a much worse one), and the finally passed draft still  considerably limits the appetites of those agencies and sectors  in the business of wasting the taxpayers' money, and puts the  entire blame for the almost inevitable breaches of the confirmed  budgetary indicators on the government. A nonacceptance of the  budget would have amounted to raising the question of the  government's resignation, something that is politically  unrealistic today.    We see our decision as a show of political responsibility  and  we do not share the stance of some of the factions that voted  against the passing of the budget for other, purely political  reasons.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / C&amp;G plays democratic numbers game: The pitfalls facing the building society's revised deal with Lloyds It is one of the oddities of democracy in building societies that the board of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society should be encouraging even those who oppose its plan to join the Lloyds Bank group to express their views by voting. The C&amp;G board is right to do so - in the interests of its plans to accept the Pounds 1.8bn cash offer from Lloyds as well as the proper exercise of rights in a mutually owned organisation. Its revised scheme for sharing out the cash which was published yesterday is more likely to hit the hurdle of stringent requirements on the turnout among investing members approving the deal than it is to fall at the necessary majorities of those voting. In terms of borrowing members, a simple majority of those voting is all that is required. If only three of the 370,000 or so borrowers voted, and two were in favour, that would be enough. But the position of investing members causes more problems, particularly since the High Court ruled in June that the original proposals were unlawful. The investors' resolution must be approved by at least 75 per cent of those who vote. It must also be approved by at least half of the number of investors eligible to vote, or investors holding 90 per cent of the total balances of those eligible to vote. So if opposition to the plan appears almost non-existent many investors who favour the Lloyds bid could conclude that the deal will go through without their bothering to vote. This would carry the risk that the resolution would fall not because the majority was too low among those voting, but because too few supporters cast their votes. C&amp;G's original scheme addressed this by giving a cash handout to every member which would have acted as an incentive to vote. Investors could have received up to Pounds 10,000 each and borrowers would have received Pounds 500 cash. But the ruling by Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, that cash could be paid neither to investors of less than two years' standing at the qualifying date nor to any borrowers has made members' reaction to the current scheme more doubtful than if the first plan had not been put forward. First, borrowers who thought they were going to get a cash sum will now have to be content with hints about the good life they will enjoy as part of Lloyds Bank. But the absence of a turnout requirement makes this less significant than it would otherwise be. Second, investors who became members of the society after the end of 1992 will have had the prospect of cash payments snatched from them, but will still be entitled to vote. Even if they blame the law rather than the society, they may think it is worth trying to stymie the deal on the basis that by the time another one comes along they are likely to have been members long enough to qualify for cash. But this group of disappointed C&amp;G members will not be anything like as big as the 27 per cent it would have been had the original cut-off point of the end of 1991 been retained. It may amount to less than 10 per cent of the potential electorate. If that is so, they would not be able to stop the deal on their own. There is, however, a third aspect which may cause C&amp;G to pause for thought. The months of discussion about the offer have been a consciousness-raising experience for C&amp;G members. There are those who believe that the offer undervalues the society and who would like to see a competing bid, or who want more discussion of floating the society as an alternative strategy. Mr Paul Rivlin and Mr Peter Nicholson, who organise a group of C&amp;G members wanting to consider an alternative to the Lloyds offer, are seeking the support of 100 members to call a special general meeting. Mr Nicholson said yesterday that at such a meeting they would demand further information from C&amp;G - including the number of members who were not eligible for cash but could vote, and the length of the 'shut-out' period during which C&amp;G has agreed not to talk to other potential bidders. Yesterday's announcement may give the group enough impetus to force a general meeting by October. But the history of building society members' quiescent involvement in the organisations they own suggests that even this would be a hiccup in the process rather than a hammer blow to the deal.</p>

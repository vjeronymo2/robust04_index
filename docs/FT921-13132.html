			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Inchcape pays Pounds 32m to expand activites in the Middle East INCHCAPE, the international services and marketing group, has expanded its operations in the Middle East by paying Pounds 32.1m for Spinneys, a group of marketing and retail companies. Spinneys distributes consumer goods, foodstuffs and household products in eight Middle East states, and owns 12 supermarkets. The group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.8m last year and had net assets of Pounds 8.9m at the year-end. Mr Charles Mackay, Inchcape's chief executive, said the deal underlined the group's long-term commitment to the Middle East. He believed that the outlook for stability in the region was more positive than it had been for many years. Inchcape is buying Spinneys from Bricom Group, formerly part of the collapsed British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings but now owned by a group of investors led by Gamlestaden, a Swedish company. This acquisition maintains the pace of activity at Inchcape since Mr Mackay took over from Sir George Turnbull in November. Shortly afterwards, Inchcape announced a Pounds 376m rights issue to fund the acquisition of Tozer Kemsley &amp; Millbourn, the motor distribution and retailing subsidiary of Brierley Investments, the New Zealand trading group. Inchcape said that following its investment in an important Bahrain marketing operation last year, the cash acquisition of Spinneys significantly advanced the group's strategy of becoming the leading marketing company in each of its chosen territories. Both Spinneys and Gray Mackenzie, Inchcape's existing Gulf operation, have long histories in the region. To maintain their separate identities and management, Inchcape is establishing Inchcape Middle East, which will incorporate all of its marketing operations. The chairman of Inchcape Middle East will be Mr David John, a director of Inchcape, and the chief executive will be Mr Alan Davies, currently chief executive of the group's operations in the region. Mr Michael Hemery, managing director of Spinneys, will become Spinneys' chief executive and will join the board of Inchcape Middle East.</p>

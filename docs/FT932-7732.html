			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Production to be doubled at Amazonian gold mine COMPANHIA VALE do Rio Doce, the state-controlled Brazilian mining group, is investing Dollars 20m to double gold production at its Igarape Bahia mine in the Carajas region of the Amazonian state of Para. Last year, output from the site was 4.9 tonnes. When the new facilities come on line in mid-1994, CVRD's annual gold production capacity will stand at 17 tonnes. The company produced 11.3 tonnes in 1992. Brazil's overall production will probably remain about the same as last year's 76.5 tonnes, however, predicted Mr Peter Rich, a consultant based in Rio de Janeiro. CVRD's growth is likely to be offset by a drop off from other mining companies. Some older sites are nearing depletion, and other inefficient operations will be unviable unless the metal's current price recovery becomes even more bullish, said Mr Rich. Multinationals cannot be expected to invest unless there is a change in the constitutional restriction on foreign majority ownership of mining operations, he added. The expansion of Igarape Bahia is part of a programme designed to boost annual production to about 30 tonnes by the year 2000, said Mr Francisco Viveiros, CVRD superintendent of gold operations. That would make the company 'part of the club of the world's biggest producers,' he noted. If that sounds ambitious, it must be remembered that CVRD produced just 1.7 tonnes as recently as 1989. 'Brazil doesn't have a tradition of hard rock mining, but they've performed miracles,' said Mr Rich. To reach its goal, CVRD is investing about Dollars 40m this year for prospecting and geological surveys, according Mr Viveiros. About Dollars 25m of that is specifically earmarked for potential gold discoveries, with the other Dollars 15m part of the general prospecting budget where gold is one of several minerals sought, said the company official. Some analysts are sceptical about the investment figures, but if they are accurate, CVRD is spending twice as much this year in Brazil as all other mining companies combined. The company, the world's biggest exporter of iron ore, has been able to gamble with gold and maintain satisfactory margins in an era of low prices thanks to low production costs. It spent Dollars 200 to produce an ounce of metal, less than the most efficient US and Australian producers, said Mr Viveiros. Factors helping to reduce costs are Igarape Bahia's proximity to infrastructure at the nearby Carajas iron ore site, and competitively priced hydroelectric power. Mr Viveiros stressed the benefits of a 'fly in-fly out' labour scheme, whereby miners and their families maintain their permanent homes away from the jungle site, decreasing infrastructure outlays, and cost-cutting negotiations with suppliers of processing chemicals and other inputs.</p>

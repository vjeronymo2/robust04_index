			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Asda chief says halcyon days are over MR ARCHIE Norman, chief executive of Asda, the food retailer, said yesterday the industry was set for a less profitable future, after the golden age of the last five years. Addressing the Marketing Society, he said last year was the annum mirabilis for grocery retailers when profits exploded. However, the industry now faced 'saturation.' Mr Norman, who joined Asda 11 months ago from Kingfisher, the non-food retail conglomerate, where he was finance director, said that as a newcomer to the industry 'it is hard to understand why people believe the current situation is sustainable'. But he said 'the halcyon days are over'. Lower inflation, slower growth in demand and 'dog eats dog expansion' were now affecting food retailers. Discount retailers were 'only at the first stage of development' in Britain. In his first public speech about how Asda is being revamped, he said the chain was being recreated as a retail brand. Asda would aim to meet the needs of ordinary working people who demand value.</p>

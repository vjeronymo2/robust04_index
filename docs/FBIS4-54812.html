			<p>BFN     [Text] Today President Iliescu received Hort  Waffenschmidt, parliamentary state secretary in the German  Interior Ministry of the Federal Government in charge of  problems of expatriates, at Cotroceni Palace.    The guest stated to the press that on this occasion the  sides  discussed issues referring to cooperation between Romania and  Germany and he showed satisfaction with the development of  economic relations in the past months. Waffenschmidt said that  the German minority in Romania represents a connecting bridge  between the two countries and he expressed thanks for every  positive action taken for the ethnic Germans.    However, he did voice some claims, such as exemption from  German taxes for humanitarian aid from Germany, a better  selection of television programs in the German language, and the  implementation of the land law, and called for a public  declaration to be issued that refers to discrimination after  World War II in Romania and the new cooperation between Romania  and Germany. He also stressed that Germany and Romania should  cooperate in Europe and see to it that people on this continent  live in peace and freedom, which is an essential requirement of  a united Europe.    In turn, President Ion Iliescu, answering a question on  customs duties on humanitarian aid and on the implementation of  the land law, said that these problems concern the Romanian  state and its citizens and they will be examined with interest;  however, they are part and parcel of a larger group of problems  that our country is currently facing.    Iliescu also said that he believes that the Deutsche Welle  radio station presents the realities of Romania in a malicious  and subjective manner and added that what disturbs us is not  fair criticism but the distortion of reality, our correspondent  Sorin Croitorescu informed us.</p>

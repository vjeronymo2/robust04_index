			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> F RULE FOR CHEERLEADERS -- UNFAIR AND DISCRIMINATORY  </P> <P> In response to letters (April 15) regarding our opposition to the school's  policies regarding cheerleaders, our request was not just to make our daughter  Melissa the exception but to change the rules for all girls who wish to be  cheerleaders. If everyone objects so stringently to exceptions, why is it OK to  make the cheerleaders an exception and have different rules for them?  </P> <P> As to comments about our role as parents, let me assure you we did interface  with Melissa, she did interface with her teacher and counselors and our role as  parents is also to support our child when the system has failed her.  </P> <P> I fail to see why a single "F" in a class equates with irresponsibility and  total academic failure. I am not concerned about my daughter who even with the  "F" in chemistry has a 2.9 GPA for three years of high school, who has been  responsible and mature enough to be co-captain of her squad both years, who is  acknowledged by the teachers and administrators to be a respectful, outstanding  student with a positive and supportive attitude.  </P> <P> I am much more concerned about my child as a whole person, her well being, her  happiness; the pursuit of her own goals and agenda, the fulfillment of her  spirit and yes, her education. The idea that grades are indicative of an  education is pure fallacy, the position that one "F" signifies some  overwhelming failure is a myopic perspective, and by the way, the real issue is  "discrimination." Why doesn't all the rationale that apply to cheerleaders also  apply to all other activities?  </P> <P> As for the lesson, this is teaching Melissa, she has learned that  administrators, teachers and the school board will go to any lengths to protect  their policy; when one stands up to challenge rules that are discriminatory,  she will be criticized and many friends won't stand with her. As Einstein so  aptly phrased it: "Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition  from mediocre minds."  </P> <P> VICTOR PASSY  </P> <P> PATRICIA PASSY  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Students and IG Metall protest Token strikes by tens of thousands of German engineering workers spread across northern Germany yesterday, in a fourth day of protests in support of their pay claim. At the same time, thousands of students continued protest actions against the government's decision to impose a freeze on their grants until 1996, instead of increasing them annually by the inflation rate, and to introduce limits on the length of time they can receive public finance for their studies. The action by the engineering workers, members of the IG Metall trade union, was centred on the industrial heartland of North Rhine-Westphalia and north Germany. Among the enterprises which suffered work stoppages were the Ford and Opel car plants in Cologne and Bochum. Both union leaders and the employers expect negotiations on the union's 5.5 per cent pay claim to begin again next week, although the employers remain adamant that real cost cuts must be achieved in the current pay round. The students yesterday won support from the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) in Bonn, which promised to introduce a proposal in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, for grants to be increased after all. Mr Rainer Ortleb, the federal minister of education, resigned his post yesterday on the grounds of ill-health. An east German from the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and member of the minority Free Democratic Party in the ruling coalition, he had been ill since last November.</p>

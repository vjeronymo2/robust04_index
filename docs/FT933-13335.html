			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Spirit of the entrepreneur - The solicitor-client relationship is under review Lawyers are becoming aware that the high fee-charging of the past is on its way out. This was one of the messages at a recent conference for senior solicitors, Creating the Client-Driven Law Firm, organised by Nottingham Law School's Centre for Law Firm Management. The conference had some blunt words for lawyers and some useful ammunition for finance directors. Lord Alexander of Weedon, QC, chairman of National Westminster Bank, opened proceedings with a speech packed with home truths. He started with an attack on hourly rates (the standard method of charging, where solicitors charge by the hour), which he called 'a charter for overcharging and inefficiency'. He warmed up with an accusation that solicitors thought marketing was about creating relationships: they should not be seeking to create 'a warm glow, but striving for a productive and profitable relationship', he said. Finally, Lord Alexander asked the lawyers listening to raise their hands if they would enter into litigation on their own account if they had to fund it personally. Not one did. 'The cost of litigation is not worth it,' he agreed. After Lord Alexander had set the tone, eminent in-house lawyers and legal management consultants joined in. Even the lawyers admitted things had to change. Mr Peter Cole, a member of the management committee of Eversheds, the national law firm, said: 'You can't say to a client that you don't know how much it will cost. They will say: 'You say you are an expert - you must have done this before.' ' One speaker said the logical consequence was that lawyers would have their income reduced. That, however, was an idea lawyers could not countenance, although they could contemplate cutting their fees. Mr Andrew Simkin of Pannone &amp; Partners, a London and Manchester law firm, said that he had suggested telling clients that, owing to increased efficiency, the firm would be cutting its fees the following financial year. His partners thought the clients' reaction would be that they had previously been overcharged. This approach to commercial realities proved to be a theme of the conference. Lawyers, it seemed, were extraordinarily lacking in basic business sense when it came to their own affairs. Tough and astute managers of large London practices were enthralled when a young man from a small Hertfordshire law firm told them how effective hiring a credit controller at his firm had been. His partners had tried to veto the idea, because they had feared that chasing the client for money owed would damage the relationship. In fact, he explained, the controller dealt with the client's accounts department, not at the director level at which the lawyer was operating. It was ironic that lawyers should be coming to terms with line management techniques just as the world was beginning to adopt the knowledge-based skills of the professional, said Professor Tom Cannon of Manchester Business School. In his vision of the future, the law firm would be a group of experts, mainly at partner level, who would be aware that their value to a client was the value they added to the client's transaction. To many of the lawyers in the audience that sounded like a platitude, but two important points sprang from it. The first was that clients were no longer prepared to pay for the services of junior lawyers who were in effect learning their trade on the job at the client's expense. 'We are not going to pay Pounds 200 an hour to train your assistants,' as Ms Katherine Gurun of Bechtel, the engineering and construction group, put it. The second was that there needed to be a cultural change, to dissuade lawyers from doing a perfect job regardless of the time it took and the cost. This latter idea, which would be anathema to most lawyers, could be imposed only by clients. It did not mean clients wanted shoddy work. They simply wanted lawyers to retain a sense of proportion about what was likely to be essential. Mr John Boyd, QC, legal services director of Digital Equipment, the computer company, explained: 'For core work (mainly intellectual property work) we expect the highest quality work and are happy to pay very large bills. But for routine things - property, some litigation, debt - we go for a satisfactory service at a reasonable price.' While Mr Boyd knew what he wanted from his outside lawyers, many clients did not. Conference speakers, both in-house lawyers and management consultants, made it plain that, in future, lawyers would have to be more entrepreneurial about assessing the client's wants and needs. This brought the conference to the issue of marketing - something lawyers have been allowed to do only for the past five or six years. At one conference workshop, a managing partner was asked how to ensure that he retained a corporate client. He said: 'First find out who the Master of the finance director's (Masonic) Lodge is.' Although clearly meant as a joke, some did not take it as such. One managing partner told the conference that the day of the general law practice was over. He said that, as in other spheres, the market would divide into 'brand leaders' and 'niche traders'. Agreement came from two lawyers at opposite ends of the spectrum: Mr Michael Brown, the managing partner of Waltons &amp; Morse, a small London firm specialising in shipping and insurance law; and Mr Stuart Benson, of Leeds-based Dibb Lupton Broomhead, a general commercial law practice with offices in most of the main commercial centres in England. Mr Brown asked the conference: 'How often does a client ring up and say: 'I have a litigation problem'? They don't. They say: 'I have an insurance problem', 'I have a shipping dispute.' ' He had split his firm into industry-specific teams, and the generalists were being absorbed into them. Mr Benson said his dream was to create a law firm based on the categories of the FT share indices. His reasoning was that 'when people are focused on specific areas, they automatically market their services'. All this suggested that many lawyers were beginning to grasp the basics of management and business development. Delegates to the conference included senior people from leading UK firms: Clifford Chance and Linklaters &amp; Paines in the City of London, Osborne Clarke and Eversheds from the regions, for example. Nevertheless, only 40 of the country's 8,000 law firms had sent anyone to the conference. Professor Philip Brown of Nottingham Law School put a brave face on it, saying the conference was two years ahead of its time. But so small a number of attendees suggested that lawyers are still not aware of the depth of client resistance to their profession's old ways.

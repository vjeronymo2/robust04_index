			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: AlliedSignal buys engine maker AlliedSignal, the US high-technology group, is to buy Lycoming Turbine Engine, a manufacturer of engines for regional aircraft, from Textron for Dollars 375m in cash. The deal solidifies its position as a leading global manufacturer of small turbine engines. The purchase is the largest of several acquisitions by AlliedSignal since Mr Lawrence Bossidy took over as chairman in 1991 and began a restructuring which has greatly improved the group's financial and share-price performance. Mr Bossidy said the deal was a 'major step forward in the growth of our aerospace business and furthers our strategy to increase the sales of our core businesses and strengthen them with top quality acquisitions'. AlliedSignal's aerospace division claims to be the largest producer of engines for business jets and small regional aircraft. It had sales last year of around Dollars 1.3bn. Lycoming, with 1993 sales of around Dollars 620m, makes turbofan engines for larger regional aircraft - the fastest growing part of the airline industry  -as well as for helicopters, tanks and hovercraft. Its engines are used on aircraft such as the British Aerospace BAe 146 regional aircraft and Textron's Bell AH-1S Cobra helicopter. It has 2,900 employees and plants in Connecticut, Texas, and Luton, England. The acquisition will extend AlliedSignal's products into the 70- to 115-seat regional aircraft market, and the company says it will make it the leading global supplier in this sector, as well as engines for heavy helicopters, tanks and light vessels. Mr Daniel Burnham, president of AlliedSignal's aerospace division, said the two businesses were complementary, with no product overlap, and that significant cost-reductions would be possible through rationalisation of duplicate operations. The new business would also have a broader research and development base. Lycoming suffered a 'significant' decline in both revenue and income last year, according to Textron's annual report. It blamed lower US government and commercial business. However, Mr Burnham said the company would contribute immediately to AlliedSignal earnings and would not be dilutive. Textron, which makes aircraft and automotive components, said the sale was in line with its strategy of aggressively managing its systems and components business. Mr James Hardymon, chairman, said its focus would continue to be on expansion of its commercial and industrial manufacturing operations. The proceeds of the sale would go to general corporate purposes, including debt-reduction, equity repurchases and new acquisitions.</p>

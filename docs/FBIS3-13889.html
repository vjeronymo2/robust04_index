Meanwhile, Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj Muhammad, the official spokesman  for the government delegation to the peace negotiations, has  revealed that some elements of the so-called national democratic  alliance have arrived in Nairobi with the aim of aborting the  IGADD initiative. During a press conference he held yesterday  he said he had apprised the Kenyan authorities of this negative  development, saying that the members of the alliance, who  represent the opposition parties, aimed at bringing about the  overthrow of the government and wanted to exploit the issue of  the south to bring their ambitions to realization, while the  issue of peace in Sudan was of no concern to them.    His excellency appealed to the Kenyan Government to take the  necessary steps to ensure that the current peace efforts did not  fail and that the solution should be purely an African one. His  excellency said that the members of the alliance who had arrived  in Nairobi were Mubarak al-Fadil al-Mahdi, 'Abd al-Rahman Ahmad  Sa'id and al-Harith Idris. Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj Hassan said the  government delegation did not object to their presence provided  they did so as part of the delegation of the rebel movement.    Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj said the entry of foreign quarters or of a  foreign dimension had always been at the root of failure to  arrive at an agreement with the rebel movement. His excellency  appealed to John Garang to throw off foreign hegemony. He said  the purpose of his convening a press conference was to inform  the outside world of the facts of what was happening and to  confirm the eagerness of the government delegation that the  negotiations should succeed.</p>

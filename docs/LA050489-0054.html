			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET TRADE UNIONS TO GET RIGHT TO STRIKE UNDER DRAFT LAW  </P> <P> Soviet trade unions, long closely controlled by Communist authorities, will be  given the right to strike under a draft law to be adopted in the next few  months, union leader Stepan Shalayev said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The draft law follows sporadic reports from across the country of wildcat  strikes by miners, bus drivers and carpet weavers demanding better pay and  conditions.  </P> <P> Leningrad police officers demonstrated in the city center April 9 to back a  series of demands, according to the newspaper Socialist Industry.  </P> <P> Stoppages linked with nationalist unrest have paralyzed industry in Georgia,  Armenia and Azerbaijan several times in recent months.  </P> <P> "The right (to strike) is being considered a means to press management to speed  up the resolution of labor disputes," Shalayev said in an interview with the  trade union paper Trud.  </P> <P> "But it is an extreme measure which should be applied only in exceptional  cases," he added.  </P> <P> The draft law says: "A trade union committee . . . has the right to stop work  at an enterprise in an organization when the procedure, established by law, of  considering a labor dispute is being violated or when management does not live  up to an agreement that has been reached."  </P></p>

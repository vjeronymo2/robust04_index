			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (12): Rain and work in Vancouver VANCOUVER is a city of water and mountains, where the breathtaking views on a sunny day can steal a visitor's heart forever. It could be for just that reason that it rains most days in the city. Residents say the 'permagrey' weather allows them to get some work done in this relentlessly beautiful outdoor metropolis. Bring an umbrella, but expect more moderate temperatures than interior regions at similar latitudes. Vancouver's coastal positioning makes it a jumping-off point for ferries to the island cities of Victoria and Nanaimo, a host of smaller ports, and Alaska. Vancouver International Airport is located 8 miles south of the city, and is served by most of the world's major airlines. The airport is small enough to be navigated simply, with green-jacketed volunteers on hand to answer travellers' inquiries. Car rentals are available, but if your business is mostly downtown, consider leaving the car behind. A cab ride downtown costs about Dollars 20, while a less-expensive alternative is is the Airport Express bus. It runs regularly and serves the major downtown hotels. (Buses from the airport will also whisk a visitor to Whistler, about three hours north of the city on the aptly-named Sea-to-Sky highway. Whistler is a world-class mountain resort with conference facilities, a golf course and skiing nearly year-round.) Public transit is clean and efficient, offering choices of the automated SkyTrain, the SeaBus, which ferries commuters to north and west sections of the city, and land-bound but pleasant buses. Free transit guides are available and worth asking for. Vancouver's downtown is compact, with its trade and convention centre housed in Canada Place, a be-sailed architectural curiosity which sits on a peninsula in Burrard Inlet. It houses the Japanese-owned Pan Pacific Hotel. The Waterfront Center hotel, built in 1991, is just across the street. For vintage charm, try the Hotel Georgia, in the heart of downtown, or the Hotel Vancouver. The Sheraton, Ramada and Holiday Inn hotel chains offer well-located, more moderately-priced rooms, often with great mountain views. For night-life, try strolling down Robson Street, a lively mix of coffee houses, galleries, shops and open-air markets. The city's Asian cultures are visible everywhere, but Chinatown offers delightfully varied cuisines. Gastown, near the juncture of Cambie and Water Streets, also boasts trendy restaurants and cafes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "While Trying To Rectify a </F> Situation..." -- punctuation as published]    [Text] The question as to whether or not NATO should place  Eastern Europe under its protection was the most important  subject on the agenda of the NATO summit. Could the countries  in Eastern Europe become NATO members?    The main aspect of that question was either ignored or  pushed  aside... Considering the fact that NATO is a defense alliance,  it has to defend its members. However, against which enemy will  it do so?    Obviously, the agreement for the North Atlantic alliance  clearly defined the enemy when it was first drawn up. However,  it is common knowledge that many changes have taken place since  then. The effort that was made to define the new enemy after  the Soviet Union disintegrated failed to yield results. The  Statements on the situation by the NATO secretary general have  not sufficiently clarified the situation. It is a fact that a  state of confusion still exists in NATO.    Undoubtedly, the desire of the countries in Eastern Europe  to  join NATO to establish security against Russia for themselves in  today's uncertain world has created a two-sided problem. On the  one hand, Washington deemed it useful to have NATO under its  hand; on the other hand, it felt the need to consider the  problems that may be created if NATO moved to place the  countries in Eastern Europe under its protection against Russia.  A middle way had to be found. Consequently, the concept of a  Partnership for Peace was proposed. It opened NATO's door to the  countries in Eastern Europe. A decision was adopted in Brussels  to begin a new process that will eventually allow those  countries to become NATO members.    How would Russia react to that state of affairs, however? In  a statement to CUMHURIYET, Albert Chernyshev, Russians  ambassador to Turkey, replied as follows: "We do not want the  new NATO structure. If a new security system is to be drawn up  for Europe, then we should do it together. In principle, the  CIS may adopt a firm approach if NATO is enlarged."    Considering the matter from the point of view of  international politics, Ambassador Chernyshev may be described  as justified. That is because the countries in Eastern Europe  have been observed to prepare to join the restructured NATO  against Russia.    The point that has drawn Turkey's attention is this:  Chernyshev has mentioned the CIS as a force to counter NATO.  Obviously, he regards Russia as being integrated with the  republics in Central Asia. How the Turkic republics in Central  Asia will react to his opinion is an interesting question.    It seems that the NATO summit in Brussels will make a  serious  blunder while trying to rectify the situation. Obviously, the  main reason for that is NATO's inability to define the new  enemy. The Western world headed by the United States seems to  have found itself confronted with a problem of principle in the  "new world order." Washington used the UN organization and the  UN Security Council in the Gulf War. However, neither that  organization nor NATO have been effective in Bosnia.    Considering all that, will NATO be the military force in the  new world order? It is a fact that NATO regarded the Soviet  Union as an enemy force in the past. Will it regard the CIS in  the same way now? Many questions can be asked on that subject.  However, it is a fact that the participants in the NATO summit  did not represent the entire world. Not only does it not  represent the entire world, NATO has been unable to represent  all of Europe. That is because its door to Eastern Europe is  neither open nor closed. Furthermore, Europe's borders cannot  be drawn up without Russia being included in the process.</p>

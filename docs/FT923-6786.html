			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: BHP stock falls sharply on Foster's stake offer SHARES in Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) fell 16 cents to ADollars 13 (USDollars 9) on the Australian Stock Exchange yesterday as the market reacted to the group's offer to pay more than ADollars 1.5bn (USDollars 1.15bn) for a 32 per cent stake in Foster's Brewing Group. Analysts said the decline reflected concern that BHP may have to hold the shares for several years before being able to sell without making a loss. Foster's shares closed 7 cents higher at ADollars 1.80, suggesting BHP may have succeeded in removing the uncertainty which has surrounded the group for two years. However, Foster's shares could come under pressure because of speculation that the group will announce a ADollars 1bn rights issue to cover forecast write-downs in the value of non-brewing assets. Foster's is expected to reveal substantial write-downs next month when it announces results for the year to the end of June. Most of the write-downs are expected to relate to revisions to the loan book of the group's Elders Finance subsidiary.</p>

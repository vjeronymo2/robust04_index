			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Stance on opt-out schools hardens MRS ANN TAYLOR, shadow education secretary, committed herself yesterday to a much harder line on grant-maintained schools than her predecessor, Mr Jack Straw. Mr Straw had softened the party's opposition to the opting-out of schools and had accepted that Labour might not be able to return them all to council control. During yesterday's education debate on the last day of Labour's conference in Blackpool Mrs Taylor said: 'We oppose opt-out in principle because it is wrong.' 'It is wrong in principle to set school against school. It is wrong in principle to reintroduce selection by the back door.' Other speakers pointed to the limited popularity of opting out. 'They have spent millions bribing schools to opt out, but less than 1 per cent have been tempted,' Ms Joanna Tait of the Socialist Education Association said. Mrs Taylor said: 'There are more schools opting out in Tory Kent and Tory Essex than in all Labour authorities put together. It is clear which political party schools want to escape from.' She led attacks on the government's white paper on education, Choice and Diversity, published this summer. 'All it does is set the scene for more chaos,' she said. Strong support by the conference for the unification of Ireland set back the hopes of a vociferous minority in the party who want Labour to organise in Northern Ireland, Ralph Atkins writes. Labour has close ties with the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party in the province. The conference also called for a European dimension to talks on the province's political future.</p>

A local official in charge of transport said that building  work on the 580-kilometer-long four-lane expressway will start  next year.    Scheduled for completion in about ten years, the whole  project will be built in three phases.    The first construction phase includes a 78-kilometer-long  section from Nanchang, the provincial capital, to Zhangshu,  costing 1.6 billion yuan. Construction will begin next spring  and be completed in the end of 1997.    The second expressway section from Zhangshu to Jian will be  completed before the year 2000, and the third from Jian to  Longnan, bordering on Guangdong Province, by the year 2005.    When finished, the official noted, Jiangxi will have a  transport network, which is expected to help the province to  boost its local economy and open wider to the outside world.</p>

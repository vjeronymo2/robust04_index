			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Buried treasure It is not hard to see why the market was rattled by Unilever's full-year figures yesterday. Of the whopping Pounds 490m restructuring charge, Pounds 280m relates to Europe, just three years after the company wrote off Pounds 305m in preparation for the single market. In underlying terms, restructuring costs worldwide are running at around Pounds 120m a year into the dateless future. Meanwhile, advertising expenditure last year rose by 20 per cent, the reward being sales up 7 per cent and volume up 1.5 per cent, or almost zero in the final quarter. Plainly, Unilever's world is slowing down. But neither is it hard to construct a case for the defence. Unilever is a formidable cash machine, whose relentless investment in brands and production efficiency in the depths of recession cannot be matched by its regional competitors. It thus represents a store of value waiting to be unlocked by economic recovery. It also has enviable exposure to the developing world, where sales and profits grew last year by almost a quarter, even at constant exchange rates. And if it has fouled up in US detergents lately, that is a matter of swings and roundabouts. Indeed, the fact that it is breaking even on several billions of dollars of sales could be seen as an opportunity. The question is how long it will take for all this value to be realised, and how sharp the earnings recovery will be when it comes. In the meantime, however humble the earnings multiple, the yield is a meagre 2.7 per cent. The 17 per cent increase in the PLC dividend is deceptive, since it is driven by an NV dividend up only in line with Dutch inflation of 1.7 per cent. The stock is plainly out of fashion, and may stay that way for a while.</p>

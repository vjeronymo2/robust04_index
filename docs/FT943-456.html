			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / People: A welcome for Coats' Walls Wellcome has found a finance director almost four months after the last man in the job, John Precious, said he was leaving 'to pursue other opportunities'. The new incumbent is Russell Walls from Coats Viyella. Walls has been group finance director at Coats for four years during which time he helped transform the reputation of the company in the City by adding an unprecedented level of openness to the company's accounts. Earlier this summer he and Coats swept the board at the first Investor Relations awards for best results presentations. Walls leaves the textiles industry after almost 30 years. After graduating from Glasgow University in pure science, he joined Coats Paton in 1966 at the age of 22. He held a variety of posts in the UK and overseas before joining the main board in 1990. He joins Wellcome at a tricky time; chairman and chief executive John Robb has come under pressure for holding both posts, and the com-pany's second biggest product, Aids drug Retrovir, has had mixed fortunes in long-term clinical trials.</p>

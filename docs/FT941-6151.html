			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Red Star shake-up will cost 500 jobs Red Star, British Rail's express parcels service, is to shed 40 per cent of its workforce and more than 30 per cent of its activities in an attempt to make it more attractive to possible buyers. The company, which lost Pounds 9m last year on turnover of Pounds 43m, was put up for sale in June 1993 but withdrawn in December because no satisfactory offer had been made. BR now hopes to complete its restructuring by the end of May and sell the business off later this year. Red Star will shed about 500 of its 1,280 staff, mostly by voluntary redundancy and natural wastage but also by the offer of alternative jobs. When the company was first put up for sale 450 staff said they were interested in voluntary redundancy. Most of the staff to go will be in administrative and management positions. Red Star said it had already consulted the unions. Red Star will drop two of its high-volume but low-value services which promise next-day delivery by 12 noon and 5.30pm. It will concentrate on its same-day and early-next-day delivery services which are more profitable. As part of the restructuring Red Star will simplify its regional organisation, replacing the existing three regions and 11 areas with five newly created districts. Railtrack, the state-owned company set up to take over responsibility for BR's track and signalling in April, will inherit Pounds 2bn worth of BR debt, Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, said yesterday. Railtrack will have to achieve a return on its Pounds 6.5bn of assets which will allow it to service that debt, Mr Horton told a conference of the Bow Group, a Conservative think-tank. It has already been set a target by the government of a 5.6 per cent return, rising to 8 per cent after four years. Railtrack has yet to decide whether to continue to service the debt or make an early repayment, the company said. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, last month said Railtrack expected to levy track charges of Pounds 2.2bn on train operating companies. That would be matched by Treasury subsidies.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CONGRESS MOVES TO DELAY BUDGET CUTS; WHITE HOUSE VOWS FIGHT  </P> <P> Congress today took the first step to delay $85 billion in imminent spending  cuts, while the White House said it would rather "negotiate into the night"  than accept a delay.  </P> <P> Republicans were almost unanimous in opposition as the House Appropriations  Committee approved, 32 to 20, a catchall bill that would keep government  operations going for an additional 20 days -- until Oct. 20 -- to provide more  time for negotiators to reach an agreement on deficit reduction.  </P> <P> In an effort to discourage President Bush's promised veto, the committee  attached to the bill an additional $2.1 billion to finance U.S. participation  in Operation Desert Shield in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> The committee sidestepped another foreign policy question, Bush's proposal to  forgive $6.7 billion of Egypt's debt in appreciation of Cairo's assistance in  the gulf.  </P> <P> White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater repeated today that Bush would veto any  legislation that would delay across-the-board spending reductions.  </P> <P> The cuts -- called a sequester -- will take place unless the targets of the  Gramm-Rudman law are modified or delayed and will mean reductions of up to 40%  throughout the government.  </P> <P> "We want to avoid a sequester. We are willing to negotiate into the night,"  Fitzwater said.  </P></p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Survey of Seattle and Puget Sound (6): Host of small companies in Software City - Thriving Dollars 3bn-a-year business IN THE computer industry, Seattle is 'Software City'. Home to Microsoft, the largest computer software company in the world, Seattle has also become a centre for software entrepreneurs who have founded hundreds of small companies in the region over the past decade. Washington state's software industry is now a thriving Dollars 3bn-a-year business and the computer software industry is the fastest growing segment of the state's economy. In 1980, 14 software companies employed 566 people in the state, according to the Washington state department of trade and economic development. By 1990, there were more than 500 software companies in Washington employing 9,600 people and the numbers have continued to rise. The growth of Seattle's software industry begs comparison with California's Silicon Valley with its burgeoning electronics and computer industries. Indeed there are many similarities between the two West Coast regions that point to the key elements of a seedbed for high-technology industry growth. Washington and California have strong reputations for good 'quality of life'; a significant draw for young talented people. Even the geographies of the San Francisco peninsula and the Puget Sound are alike, both being virtually surrounded by water. Equally significant, perhaps, is the established infrastructure of both regions providing all the services that an emerging high-technology company might need. In Seattle, these range from freelance programmers to disk duplicating services; package designers and courier companies; lawyers and venture capitalists. Also like Silicon Valley, Seattle has a few large established companies that form the core of the region's growth industry. In Seattle these are Boeing Computer Services, Microsoft and Aldus. In Silicon Valley companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Intel have spawned hundreds of 'spin-off' companies formed by former employees. To date, the spin-off phenomenon has been relatively limited in Seattle. There have been only a dozen or so spin-offs from Microsoft, for example, according to local industry officials. Nonetheless, the largest software companies provide a prime source of talent for new ventures. Universities also play a key role in the high-technology infrastructure. However, in this regard Seattle lacks the abundance of the Silicon Valley. The University of Washington, in Seattle, has close links with local software companies, but it can provide only a fraction of the graduates that the industry needs. The software industry's growth has outstripped the supply of qualified graduates from Washington state's universities and colleges, according to the Washington Software Association, an industry group representing software developers in the state, and vocational schools. Future growth of the industry will be constrained by the limited supply of candidates in technical, marketing and management fields, a study performed by the industry group concluded. To address the need for increased numbers of graduates, the WSA has launched programmes to link the educational community with the software industry. All economic indicators for the software industry show opportunities for continued growth and expansion. 'Our job is to be globally competitive. To do this, we must have a trained, skilled workforce, and there is no better way to find that workforce than by growing it at home, through Washington state's educational system,' says Paul Brainerd, president of Aldus, a leader in the field of desktop publishing software based near Seattle, and chairman of the Washington industry group's education committee. WSA aims to encourage Washington high school students to consider a career in the software industry and is also sponsoring scholarships at Washington University. Yet for Microsoft, the flagship of Washington's software industry, attracting talent is hardly a problem. Last year the company was inundated with more than 10,000 job applications a month. From these the company chose about 4,000 new employees, bringing its world-wide workforce to about 11,000 including about 4,400 at its Redmond headquarters in an 'East Side' suburb of Seattle. Moreover, 64 per cent of Microsoft's recruits last year came from the state of Washington, suggesting that the leading software company gets the lion's share of new graduates in the state with computer science and related disciplines. Indeed , Microsoft is so much bigger than any other software company in Washington that its fortunes drive the growth trend in the state's software industry. Last year, Microsoft's revenues more than doubled to Dollars 1.8bn. For fiscal 1992, ending this June, analysts expect Microsoft's revenues to jump to Dollars 2.7bn. Microsoft's presence in Seattle is highly visible. The company occupies a 260-acre campus with some 22 buildings in addition to its manufacturing operations and other offices throughout the region. Microsoft's growth over the past year has been based largely upon the success of 'Windows', a program that gives IBM-compatible personal computers a graphical interface similar to that of Apple Computer's Macintosh. Since the introduction of Windows 3.0 in June 1990, more than 9m copies have been sold. This month, Microsoft launched a new version of Windows. The Seattle company is now, however, facing a significant challenge from International Business Machines, a former software development partner, which last month introduced its own personal computer operating system software to compete directly with Windows. Microsoft is also involved in a potentially serious legal dispute with Apple Computer, which claims that Windows infringes copyrights on its Macintosh computer software. And in addition, Microsoft is the focus of an anti-trust investigation being conducted by the US Justice Department. Nonetheless, Microsoft is expected to maintain its leadership role in the personal computer software market. With the growth of Microsoft, and the rising value of the company's stock, many of the company's employees have become paper millionaires. Bill Gates, chairman and co-founder of Microsoft, is now reckoned to be the richest man in the United States, based upon his substantial shareholdings in the company. Feeding some of this wealth back into the Seattle economy, Microsoft's several millionaires are said to be a ready source of venture capital funds for new companies in the region.</p>

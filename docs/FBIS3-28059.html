			<p>Language: <F P=105> Malay </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] 1994 should indeed be the year of elections with  the Sabah government's decision to dissolve the State  Legislative Assembly 18 months earlier than scheduled. The move  to dissolve the assembly by Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Pairin  Kitingan did not surprise anybody because it had been the talk  of the town for some time. It is still interesting, however, to  discuss the timing behind Pairin's move to dissolve the assembly  and gain a new mandate from the people. [passage omitted]    Politically speaking, Pairin might have believed that the  earlier-than-scheduled elections would serve as the most  effective weapon against the 17 January court ruling. But  looking at the current situation, the wellbeing of the Sabah  people seems to be a more urgent matter which requires more  attention than Pairin's fate on that day. Having experienced  lengthy political upheavals in the past few years, the Sabah  people now have the opportunity to think again and ask  themselves what they really want from the coming state elections.    The Sabah people should also ask themselves what they want  to  achieve, namely development and life's prosperity or a struggle  still shrouded by irrelevant elements after 30 years of  independence. They should be aware of the fact that blind  faith and loyalty will bring about dire consequences to their  grandchildren's wellbeing.    The Sabah people naturally do not want to live an uncertain  life, devoid of political stability and in constant hostility  with the central government. They certainly do not want to lag  behind other states which are making rapid progress in  development programs. We have no idea of Pairin's plan for  himself -- whether he wants to retire from politics and transfer  the party leadership to another person or whether he wants to  take part in the coming elections and continue his political  life.    In the current situation, the Sabah United Party apparently  wants to test the waters and gauge its own strength, described  by many observers as declining, before making noises as to  whether it wants to rejoin the National Front, which it  abandoned in 1990 in a truly unfavorable situation.    Being the backbone of the National Front, UMNO [United  Malays  National Organization] is certainly very enthusiastic about  taking part in the coming Sabah elections as a means to measure  its strength in Sabah after it first entered the state in 1991.    Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir's remarks that the National  Front  is ready to run in all the 48 state constituencies shows that  the ruling coalition not only wants to test the waters, but also  to wrest Sabah back from the Sabah United Party, which won the  elections in 1985. This is not an impossible task.</p>

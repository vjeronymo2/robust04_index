			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (13): Growth potential is huge - The insurance industry The scope for growth in the Greek insurance industry is enormous: only one in six Greeks has insurance cover. Outlay per head on insurance in 1992 was just Dr28,500 (Dollars 103). Total premium income that year amounted to Dr287.8bn - equivalent to 1.9 per cent of gross domestic product. This compares with a European average of 5 per cent of GDP. The largest Greek insurers are subsidiaries of the state-controlled banks, while the larger private sector companies are linked to insurance concerns in northern Europe. Allianz, for example, is connected both with Ergobank, the private Greek bank, and with Dresdner Bank. Inter-American is linked with Interbank, which is controlled by a UAP subsidiary, Banque Worms. Greek companies - 105 out of the country's 161 insurance concerns - will not necessarily be threatened by the arrival of the single European market in insurance in July. Mr Ieronymos Delendas, chairman of Allianz, says: 'The majors are already here and local service is important.' Although insurance companies will be able to operate in any EU member state under a licence granted and controls exercised in its home country, some restrictions will be continued in Greece. With some exceptions for life insurers, foreign insurance companies will still have to form technical reserves in Greece and will have to provide information to the commerce ministry on tariffs and policy conditions. Life insurance is the fastest-growing sector in Greece, accounting for 45.6 per cent of premium income in 1992, compared to 10 per cent a decade earlier. Most of this new business has gone to the private sector, which has proved more innovative. However, both private and public sector companies are moving into 'banc-assurance', providing packages which include banking and mortgage facilities, together with life and non-life insurance cover. Under current legislation, the banking and insurance arms must be separate companies with separate managers, although the insurance companies are permitted to have an agent in the bank. Nevertheless, until recently it was not uncommon for a bank manager to refuse a loan unless the cover was placed within his group. The boom in private life cover was partly triggered by reforms now under way in the state insurance sector. Greece's insurance system offers basic cover through the state social insurance fund (IKA), which provides pensions, health care and other benefits such as maternity allowances. Auxiliary funds, which are comparable to occupational schemes elsewhere in the EU, are mixed up with the state sector because they have been part-financed by special levies, such as a tax on all doctors' prescriptions, destined for the pharmacists' pension fund. Until recently, private cover was an option taken up by only a few Greeks. Now, however, the inequitable auxiliary funds - which provided top-up ratios ranging from just 3 per cent to 200 per cent - are being phased out. With tight regulations in force in the life market, competition is confined to ancillary products, where the private insurers have an edge. Companies are required to use common mortality tables, based on French statistics, and a common guaranteed technical interest rate. There are controls, too, on administrative and commission costs. Health cover is the principal ancillary, with most companies offering clients health cards allowing them to go into hospital without laying out cash. Education policies for children are also a growth product. But tax-free allowances on premiums are limited to four per cent of income, with the maximum allowance set at Dr200,000. While this sum is large in relation to current per capita outlays on insurance, it is meant to cover an entire family. For Greece's burgeoning middle class, it is no longer adequate. 'I don't see why there should be any cap. The limit should be a percentage of total income, say 10 per cent. It would help the economy draw funds away from consumption into long-term investment,' says Mr Dimitris Kondominas, chairman of InterAmerican, Greece's largest life insurance company. The phasing-out of the auxiliary funds has also brought an increase in group insurance schemes, where the law is more accommodating, permitting unlimited deductions as operating expenses on both insurance and pension premiums. It is a sector of the market that seems set to grow, although companies claim that profits are slim because of strong competition. The bane of general insurers is motor insurance, a loss-making sector in a country where car ownership has grown rapidly and there are many inexperienced drivers. The sector's losses amounted to Dr16bn in 1992. While companies are legally obliged to write motor business, many try to avoid it, to the extent of not advertising the facility. Companies have also managed to postpone implementing new EU regulations, raising third party liability cover to Dr7m for material damage and Dr35m for bodily injury, which would have doubled premiums overnight.</p>

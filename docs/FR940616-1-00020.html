			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Donovan  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Hotel, Motel &amp; Restaurant Employees Local 19, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  700 F.2d 539 (9th Cir. 1983), however, the court held, after examining the legislative history of the Act, that the LMRDA does not authorize the Secretary to bring civil action against a union for failure to follow its concededly adequate officer removal procedure.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  rejected the Secretary's reliance on section 402(a) as a basis for extending his authority under section 401(h) to intervene in officer removal proceedings where an adequate removal procedure exists. The court concluded that those regulations found in subpart B of 29 CFR part 417 which purport to give the Secretary general authority to intervene in union affairs upon a finding that a union has failed to follow its adequate removal procedures are void for lack of statutory authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is the only judicial decision that addresses this issue, and the Department has determined, upon review, that the holding of the court in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is correct. The Department therefore proposes to delete the language in subpart B of 29 CFR part 417 granting the Secretary authority to file suit against a union for failure to follow its adequate officer removal procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative Notices <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Labor has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined in section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 in that it will not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities, (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency, (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof, or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency Head has certified that this proposed rule, if issued, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The proposed rule will only apply to local labor organizations and would decrease the regulation of such labor organizations. However, the Department has determined that labor organizations regulated pursuant to the statutory authority granted under the LMRDA do not constitute small entities. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule contains no information collection requirements. Therefore, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended, is not applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Clinton may renew China MFN today President Bill Clinton is expected to announce a renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation status, either today or tomorrow, despite Beijing's minimal efforts to meet the conditions of an executive order which ties trade with human rights. The president is likely to revoke MFN - which allows for the lowest tariff rates available - for guns and ammunition produced by the People's Liberation Army. Mr Clinton is scheduled to make his announcement today, though threats by Congressional Democrats that a minimal punishment would bring a fight in both houses may delay it until tomorrow. High level discussions were under way in the White House yesterday on a face-saving package which would allow US companies to preserve their markets in China, while the US displays its ire over China's human rights record. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, one of the leaders in the battle to tie MFN and human rights, said yesterday China was still exporting products made by prison labour and thus has failed to fulfil one of the two mandatory conditions set out in the president's executive order.</p>

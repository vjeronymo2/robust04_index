A survey shows that 94.6 percent of the senior middle  schools  in Shanghai have opened computer courses, and 80 junior middle  schools are also running such courses on an experimental basis.    Shanghai began to spread general knowledge of computers  among  students in 1986 to meet the needs of its high-tech development.    Middle schools now have a total of 8,000 micro-computers,  with 600 lecturers and 140 managerial workers.    They have compiled and published four series of computer  teaching materials.    Altogether 165,000 students have obtained computer  certificates over the past six years.</p>

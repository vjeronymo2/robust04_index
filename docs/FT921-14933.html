			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / German set to head EC parliament A GERMAN Christian Democrat looks set to win election today as president of the European parliament, which is to get new law-making powers under last month's Maastricht agreement, writes David Buchan in Brussels. Mr Egon Klepsch, 61, heads the Christian Democrat group, the second largest in the 518-member parliament, and is sure to win through a deal cut with the Socialists, the largest group, who have filled the presidential chair with Mr Enrique Baron for the past two and a half years. As nominations closed yesterday evening, no major figure had come forward to challenge the middle-of-the-road Mr Klepsch, a close ally of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. But he may not win an absolute majority of the 518 members on the first ballot this morning, because he faces minor challenges from an Italian communist, a Belgian liberal and a Belgian right-winger. Some means of settling future legal disputes arising from the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement creating a 19-nation common economic zone is essential, said Mr Jon Hannibalsson, foreign minister of Iceland which is the current president of the European Free Trade Association (Efta). He was speaking after talks in Brussels revealed that the European Commission still had no proposal for breaking a legal impasse over the EEA accord. EC-Efta talks are due later this week.</p>

The ceasefire agreed Sunday between President Pascal  Lissouba's ruling party and the main opposition party of Bernard  Kolelas was still holding, military sources added.    A fourth railway worker died Wednesday night from his wounds  following a machine-gun attack Tuesday as they tried to reopen  the key rail route between Brazzaville and the main port Pointe  Noire. Politicians said rebel forces had not received word of  the ceasefire.    The date for reopening the railway was put back to February  8  following the attack.</p>

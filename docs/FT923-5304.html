			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Taiwan acts on liquor TAIWAN yesterday liberalised its import regime on brandy, vodka, gin and other spirits, allowing the private sector to import liquor - previously a government monopoly. The move came into force the day after Baroness Thatcher, former UK prime minister, called in Taipei on the Taiwan government to scrap remaining trade barriers. UK and French trade officials have complained to Taipei of discriminatory taxes on Scotch and Irish whiskies and French armagnac and cognac. As the private guest of Citibank and a Taiwan newspaper, Baroness Thatcher said: 'You now have an obligation to open your markets to the goods and services of others, and get rid of restrictions of all sorts.' Taiwan let private companies import whisky in April last year, when whisky sales topped Dollars 200m. Scotch and Irish whiskies are subject to a monopoly sales tax of Dollars 17 a litre; 'other whiskies', mainly US, are taxed at Dollars 8. French armagnacs and cognacs are taxed twice as much as other brandies, at Dollars 40 per litre. Officials say higher taxes are levied on EC liquor for its quality and matching price. So far, private imports of spirits have been limited to the US and EC.</p>

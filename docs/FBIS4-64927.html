			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Henrik Qvortrup: "Liberals and Conservatives </F> Court Mimi and Jelved"]    [Text] The Liberals and the Conservatives have come to  realize that they need the support of the center parties, even  if the outcome of the coming election is a  Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party coalition.    Lesson number one in Danish politics: The way to power and  influence is through the goodwill of the small center parties.    This is how it has always been, how it is now, and  apparently  how it will be after the coming election.    Just ask Poul Schlueter or Poul Nyrup Rasmussen what they  would have done without the blessing of the Christian Party, the  Radical Liberals, or the Center Democrats.    The leaders of the current nonsocialist opposition, Hans  Engell (Conservative) and Uffe Ellemann-Jensen (Liberal), appear  to have drawn similar conclusions as to the indispensability of  the small center parties.    Even with a straight Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party  coalition on the horizon, the two dominant nonsocialist  political figures are in a hurry to invite the Radical Liberals,  Christian Party, and Center Democrats to join the coalition  after the next election.    There are promises of big influence on policy.    Why all this? Once the election is over, would it not be  simpler for Ellemann-Jensen and Engell to make the central  parties pay the price for their governmental romance with Nyrup  -- and then conduct pure nonsocialist policy together with the  Progress Party?    The answer is that the more the  Liberal-Conservative-Progress  Party coalition evolves from a hypothetical fantasy into an  entirely plausible outcome of the next Folketing election, the  more Engell and Ellemann-Jensen have had to accept the  unvarnished reality: A majority government with the Progress  Party has limited potential.    Tax policy, employment policy, and social policy are the  only  areas in which the Conservatives and the Liberals are likely to  have sufficient common ground with the Progress Party to be able  to patch together a government program.    And what of those issues where they and the Progress Party  are miles apart? In other words, what will a  Liberal-Conservative government do after the election when it  comes time to agree on European policy, immigration, legal  issues, and military policy?    Ellemann and Engell know they can hardly depend upon the  Progress Party on these issues. But they also know that even a  major victory will not give the Liberals and Conservatives an  absolute majority without the Progress Party. And finally, the  two leaders are very much aware that the Social Democrats, once  they have forfeited their power, will not be easy to deal with.    Moreover, the Progress Party -- no matter how presentable or  power-hungry the party is -- still has some anarchical elements  left in it. No Liberal or Conservative politician today would  dare to rely 100 percent upon Pia Kjaersgaard's troops.    Ergo: A future Liberal-Conservative government has no choice  but to seek support from the center parties.    The preparations have begun and can be studied like a  textbook case in subtle political maneuvering. On the one hand,  the Liberals and the Conservatives are interested in projecting  themselves as the purebred nonsocialist alternative to the  present government. On the other hand, they must not seem wholly  nonsocialist.    It is in this light that Engell's relaxation on pension fund  investment in Danish industry should be viewed. Ellemann-Jensen  has also been busy sowing seeds among the center parties,  including the Radical Liberals.    The reaction from Party Leader Marianne Jelved was prompt:  Thanks, but no thanks.    If the outcome is a Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party  coalition, the Radical Liberals will step back and let the  nonsocialist majority sail on its merry way, Jelved told  BERLINGSKE TIDENDE in no uncertain terms last Sunday [20 March].    Jelved's rejection should be interpreted largely as a  tactical move -- many things look different after an election.  After all, the Radical Liberals did take part in an earlier  nonsocialist government that was partially built upon the  Progress Party.    The Radical Liberals will hardly have been endeared by the  fact that the invitation was tendered by none other than  Ellemann-Jensen. In recent months he has roundly rebuked the  Radical Liberals for their alleged betrayal of the voters.    This leaves the fact that Ellemann-Jensen and Engell can  certainly not count on the Radical Liberals. The question  remains whether the situation is any different in the case of  the Center Democrats, who also have been courted by the Liberals.    The situation here is somewhat different. Everything  suggests  that the ranks of the Center Democrats will be severely  decimated in the upcoming election. This is because the voters,  from all indications, are not in the mood to reward the party  for its participation in Nyrup Rasmussen's government. In this  event, it will be difficult for Mimi Jakobsen to refuse to  release her votes to the nonsocialist wing.    At the same time, the Center Democrats could turn out to be  the deciding factor in determining whether Denmark gets a  nonsocialist or a Social Democratic-led government after the  next election. That will happen if neither camp achieves an  absolute majority. However, the Center Democrats would hardly  support a Social Democratic government that had to depend upon  Socialist People's Party votes.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Perez demands decision VENEZUELAN President Carlos Andres Perez has urged the Supreme Court to end uncertainty over his political future, and over the national economy, by deciding immediately whether sufficient cause exists to impeach him. Since March 11, the court has been studying a petition filed by the attorney-general to impeach Mr Perez over alleged improper use of Dollars 17m in government funds. The matter came to a head this week when the press revealed that Chief Justice Gonzalo Rodrguez Corro had drafted a pro-impeachment opinion and sent copies to the other 14 members of the court. The full court has not yet issued a ruling - it has about two weeks in which to do so - but publication of the chief justice's opinion pushed the president to write to the court. News of the chief justice's letter had appeared in the press on Wednesday, pushing the Caracas stock exchange down more than 5 per cent. Venezuela's external debt bonds also weakened on international markets. If a president cannot perform his duties, the chairman of Congress becomes acting president for up to 30 days. Mr Octavio Lepage, the chairman, lost to Mr Perez in the 1988 race for the ruling Democratic Action party's presidential nomination. Mr Lepage has opposed the president's free market policies over the past four years.</p>

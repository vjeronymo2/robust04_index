			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Mirror row with Paul Foot grows THE ROW between Daily Mirror columnist Mr Paul Foot and the Mirror management intensified yesterday after Mr David Banks, the paper's editor issued a statement saying Mr Foot had been offered a period of sick leave to rest. The offer, which Mr Foot denied he had received, was the management's response to the Mirror journalist's decision to stand outside the paper's headquarters yesterday morning handing out copies of his unpublished regular weekly column. Mr Banks had refused to print the column which was devoted entirely to criticisms of Mirror Group Newspapers' management and directors. The Mirror editor's statement said: 'Paul Foot has been offered sick leave so he can have a period of rest. We sincerely hope he seeks professional help during this time and MGN will continue to pay his Pounds 55,000 salary. All of us at the Mirror are very sympathetic towards Paul's condition.' Last night Mr Foot, a nephew of Mr Michael Foot the former Labour leader, reacted angrily to the editor's statement. He said: 'I am not sick. I have not been offered sick leave. I have had no contact, verbal or written, with David Banks or anyone else from the Mirror management today.' Instead of replying to factual criticisms in his unpublished column, Mr Foot said that the management had resorted to 'the foulest possible personal libel'. Mr Foot has been campaigning against the removal of many long-standing staff. He wrote in his unpublished column that after months 'exposing callous sackings and victimisations across the country' it was time to devote his column to the 'astonishing events' at the Mirror. Mr Banks said last night that he had been depressed and saddened by Mr Foot's behaviour but he was not going to sack him. He added that Mr Foot was 'stressed out' and a period of rest would be beneficial. The Mirror editor said the offer of sick leave was not compulsory and that Mr Foot could come into the office if he chose to do so. While outside the Mirror building Mr Foot said he would present another column next week on the same theme. 'It's up to them whether they print it,' he said. The unpublished article also says that Mr David Montgomery, the paper's chief executive, has been given an option by the group's board to buy 1.475m MGN shares at 61p - they closed at 104p yesterday.</p>

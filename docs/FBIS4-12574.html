			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Assembly today held the first session  of its spring term, which will last two months, under Assembly  Speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih.    The session was started with a reading from the Opening  Chapter of the Koran to evoke God's mercy on the souls of those  who are nobler than all of us, namely, Iraq's righteous martyrs,  who sacrificed their lives in defense of the nation's honor and  dignity.    Then, Assembly Speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih delivered a speech  reviewing the current Arab and international state of affairs in  light of the U.S.-Atlantic-Zionist conspiracy that is targeting  the Iraqi territories, people, and civilization. He said: What  the United States is doing against the Iraqi people (?does not)  reflect an arbitrary policy. Rather, this anti-Iraq U.S.  conduct is the manifestation of an ingrained and deep-seated  malice dwelling within the psyches of Zionist occupiers.    The National Assembly speaker urged Iraqis to double their  efforts and make further sacrifices to thwart the imperialist  conspiracy, which is targeting our homeland and nation. He  added: We must be at the forefront of those advocating harmony,  unity, solidarity, and affection so that we may bring about an  awareness of the importance of unity, patriotism, and loyalty to  the nation, whose values we must uphold.    Afterward, the Assembly members listened to a detailed  report  read out by Deputy Assembly Speaker Ghanim 'Aziz. The report  addressed the activities recently carried out by the permanent  Assembly committees in the political, parliamentary, economic,  social, legal, health, service, and trade spheres.</p>

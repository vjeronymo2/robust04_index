The  sources said Hata will make the call in his talks on Saturday  with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. They said Japan  wants China to "positively engage" in negotiations expected to  get under way this year in Geneva on a comprehensive global ban  on nuclear testing.    Despite Qian's call at the UN General Assembly in September  for early test ban talks, China on October 5 conducted an  underground nuclear test that threatened to unravel a fragile  moratorium on testing by other nuclear powers.    Critics said China's move also undermined efforts for a  renewal this year of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, as  nuclear powers could be seen as practicing a double standard by  calling for nonproliferation while continuing nuclear tests.  China subsequently pledged, however, to work with other  countries to achieve a test ban treaty "no later than 1996."    Hata would also convey Japan's support for China's early  entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),  the sources said.</p>

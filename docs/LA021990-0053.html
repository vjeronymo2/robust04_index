			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> THALASSEMIA TREATED BY TRANSPLANT  </P> <P> Bone marrow transplants may cure many sufferers of beta thalassemia, a fatal  illness of young adults brought on by a genetic defect that cripples the  blood's ability to absorb oxygen, according to new research.  </P> <P> The technique, a radical procedure commonly used to treat some deadly forms of  cancer, was pioneered as a thalassemia treatment in the early 1980s. It  involves destroying all blood-producing cells and injecting new cells from a  donor.  </P> <P> But if the technique fails, the patient usually dies.  </P> <P> In tests of 222 children under 16 who had the defect, Italian researchers led  by Dr. Guido Lucarelli reported that 82% were alive one year after the  transplant, with most experiencing no complications.  </P></p>

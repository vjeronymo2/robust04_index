			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign minister Saudabayev today received Chen Di,  the Chinese ambassador to Kazakhstan. They stressed that the  mechanism of summit contacts is working efficiently. The  forthcoming visit to Almaty by Prime Minister Li Peng testifies  to this fact. In the opinion of both sides, this visit will  play an important role in concrete development and  implementations of agreements reached in October last year  during Nazarbayev's visit to China. The signing of an agreement  on the state border between Kazakhstan and China and other  documents will be of great importance.</p>

In cases where it is not possible to conclude the necessary negotiations successfully, awards will not be made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an award is not made to an applicant whose application is in the initial funding threshold because of an inability to complete successful negotiations, and if funds are available to fund any applications that may have fallen outside the initial funding threshold, HUD will select the next highest ranking applicant and proceed as described in the preceding paragraph. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Funding Instrument <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD expects to award a cost reimbursable or fixed-price cooperative or grant agreement to each successful applicant. HUD reserves the right, however, to use the form of assistance agreement determined to be most appropriate after negotiation with the applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Reduction of Requested Grant Amounts and Special Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD may approve an application for an amount lower than the amount requested, fund only portions of an application, withhold funds after approval, and/or require the grantee to comply with special conditions added to the grant agreement, in accordance with 24 CFR 85.12, the requirements of this NOFA, or where: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) HUD determines the amount requested for one or more eligible activities is unreasonable or unnecessary; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) the application does not otherwise meet applicable cost limitations established for the program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The applicant has requested an ineligible activity; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Insufficient amounts remain in that funding round to fund the full amount requested in the application and HUD determines that partial funding is a viable option; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The applicant has demonstrated an inability to manage HUD grants, particularly Fair Housing Initiatives Program grants; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) For any other reason where good cause exists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Performance Sanctions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A recipient failing to comply with the procedures set forth in its grant agreement will be liable for such sanctions as may be authorized by law, including repayment of improperly used funds, termination of further participation in the FHIP, reduction or limitation of further funding for administrative enforcement activities, and denial of further participation in programs of the Department or of any Federal agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Application Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An application kit is required as the formal submission to apply for funding. The kit includes information on the Management Work Plan and Budget for activities proposed by the applicant. An application may be obtained by writing the Fair Housing Information Clearinghouse, Post Office Box 6091, Rockville, MD 20850, or by calling the toll free number 1&hyph;800&hyph;343&hyph;3442. To ensure a prompt response, it is suggested that requests for application kits be made by telephone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Completed applications are to be submitted to Aztec Jacobs, Funded Programs Division, Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 5234, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The application due date will be specified in the application kit. However, applicants will be given at least 60 days from today's date, until July 15, 1994, to submit their applications. Applications will be accepted if they are received on or before the application due date, or are received within 7 days after the application due date, but with a U.S. postmark or receipt from a private commercial delivery service (such as, Federal Express or DHL) that is dated on or before the application due date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The application deadline is firm as to date. In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, the Department will treat as ineligible for consideration any application that is received after the deadline. Applicants should take this practice into account and make early submission of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility brought about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related problems. A transmission by facsimile machine (``FAX'') will not constitute delivery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An applicant may apply for funding for more than one project or activity, but a separate application must be submitted for each of the following categories of funding: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Administrative Enforcement Initiative activities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) National programs under the Education and Outreach Initiative; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) National Fair Housing Month activities under the Education and Outreach Initiative; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Regional or local activities under the Education and Outreach Initiative; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Community-based activities under the Education and Outreach Initiative; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) One-year projects under the Private Enforcement Initiative; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Two-year projects under the Private Enforcement Initiative; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Continued Development of Existing Organizations activities under the Fair Housing Organizations Initiative; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Establishing New Organizations activities under the Fair Housing Organizations Initiative. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

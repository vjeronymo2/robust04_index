			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / India worries as export drive misses target SHRINKING markets in the former Soviet bloc and a spate of violence at home has dented India's plans to boost exports as part of its new economic strategy. Allowing for some recovery after the recent riots, the commerce ministry says it now expects India to record export growth of 3.5 to 4.0 per cent for the year to the end of March 1993, compared with a target of 15-16 per cent. Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the Indian commerce minister, yesterday expressed growing concern at the country's faltering rate of export growth, as he announced details of new measures to liberalise trade and promote exports, notably in agricultural products. The Indian government, which is trying to reform the economy and integrate India into the global trading system, sees exports as a vital element in economic growth. But growth has been held back by a slump in sales to countries of the former Soviet Union and eastern bloc, once important trading partners. The riots that followed the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque in November last year have also seriously disrupted trade. After increasing steadily in the late summer and autumn of 1992, export growth has faded. Exports fell 12.5 per cent in December and 6.9 per cent in January, compared with the same months a year earlier. Slower than expected growth in industrial exports is a major reason for the trade package announced this week, which concentrates on measures to promote agricultural exports. In a wide-ranging liberalisation of agricultural trade, India is to encourage the establishment of export-oriented farms and food processing units. It is also removing bans on the export of a host of staple products, including cereals and sugar. Altogether 144 items are being removed from a list of goods banned for export, leaving 190 still on the list. The ministry believes that agricultural and fisheries exports could rise from an estimated Dollars 2.47bn (Pounds 1.64bn) in 1992-93 to Dollars 3bn next year and Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn by 1997-98. These figures exclude exports of plantation products such as tea and coffee, which are separately classified by the ministry and which total about a further Dollars 1bn a year. Mr Mukherjee said flowers, fruits and vegetables were all areas in which India had 'immense potential', but success in exporting to developed countries would partly depend on the outcome of the Uruguay Round of Gatt trade talks.</p>

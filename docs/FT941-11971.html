			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall sharply amid rumours of Fed move US Treasury bond prices fell sharply yesterday amid growing suspicions that the Federal Reserve would boost short-term interest rates this week or next. By midday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  31/32 lower at 99 7/32 , with the yield rising about 7 basis points to 6.304 per cent. On the short end, the two-year note was down  1/8 to 99 5/8 , to yield 4.181 per cent. Longer-dated securities were hit hard by a double shot of unfavourable news from the National Association of Purchasing Management. Its January index of business conditions, a closely watched leading indicator, came in at 57.7 per cent, against 57.1 per cent in December, suggesting the economy was still gathering pace. But traders were even more troubled by a sharp increase in the prices-paid portion on the report, which appeared to confirm fears of higher inflation. The Commerce Department further dampened spirits by reporting December construction spending had risen 2.6 per cent, much stronger than the consensus forecast of a 1.5 per cent gain. Against this backdrop, the unexpected resignation of Mr David Mullins, the Fed's vice-chairman, caused concern. Traders were worried that President Bill Clinton would replace him with someone less oriented to fighting inflation, a prospect that was even more disconcerting than early action by the Fed. The sell-off in New York spilled over into Europe yesterday, prompting most government bond markets to give up the gains they had made earlier in the day. Some traders also attributed the afternoon decline in the UK government bond market to rumours that a large line of stock, unrelated to last week's auction, had come on the market. The March long gilt future broke through several chart support levels as it fell from the day's high of 119 3/8 to trade at 118 5/8 in the late afternoon, down  19/32 on the day. By contrast, short-dated gilts were mostly unchanged on continued hopes of an early interest rate cut. However, few traders expected any hints to emerge from today's monthly meeting between the chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke, and the Bank of England governor, Mr Eddie George. German government bonds and futures traded in a fairly narrow range as the market trod water before the Bundesbank's regular council meeting tomorrow and the impending release of M3 data for December. The March bund future on Liffe came off an intraday high of 100.63 to stand at 100.42 in the late afternoon, down 0.09 on the day. Traders said that activity was fairly limited although they reported some buying of seven and eight-year paper which had underperformed the rest of the market recently. Ecu bonds and futures lost less ground than many European markets as the Republic of Portugal's new Ecu750m 10-year global bond provided the market with fresh liquidity. Dealers reported some switching out of the 6 per cent Ecu OAT due 2004 into the new Portuguese bond by investors who were not put off by the tight pricing. The Ecu OAT due 2004 was quoted at 100.17, down 0.09 point from Monday's closing price while the March Ecu bond future settled 0.08 point lower at 121.46. Japanese government bonds and futures were boosted in Tokyo trading after comments by finance minister Mr Hirohisa Fujii calmed market worries about oversupply. He said the government should avoid issuing deficit-financing bonds to fund its economic package. The key March contract rose 0.85 point to 114.10 in Tokyo and firmed further in London trading to 114.53. The yield on the benchmark No 157 JGB eased to 3.47 per cent in Tokyo, 0.065 lower than its Monday close, and touched 3.42 per cent in London. Mr Graham Turner, at Sumitomo Finance in London, said that although Mr Fujii had reassured the market that it would not all be 'spend, spend, spend' he warned that the recent rally had all the hallmarks of a bear market correction.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Dong Pei (5516 1014): "Qinghai Provincial </F> Statistical Bureau Director Song Xiuyan Says at a News  Conference That the Province's Economy Enjoys Sustained and  Rapid Growth and Healthy Development"]    [Text] Our province's economy in 1993 scored the  achievement of moving in a healthy direction amid sustained and  rapid growth. At a news conference held on 20 January by the  provincial statistical bureau, bureau director Song Xiuyan said  that in 1993, our province achieved three breakthroughs in  economic operations: Total industrial and agricultural output  value topped 10 billion yuan, GDP 10 billion yuan, and financial  revenue 1.1 billion yuan.    Initial calculations by the provincial statistical bureau  estimated that the province's GDP in 1993 could hit 10.1 billion  yuan, up 9.5 percent from 1992 on comparable prices and  achieving the provincial party and government's goal of  "maintaining 8 percent growth and fighting for 9 percent  growth." Total social demand could exceed total supply by 3.97  percent, which would be within reasonable control. The  following are developments in various areas:    Industrial production maintained its relatively high-speed  growth, with parallel growth in production and sales and slight  improvement in economic returns. According to  progress-indicating figures, in 1993, manufacturing enterprises  of all the province's counties and localities above the county  level produced industrial output value of 7.67 billion yuan, up  13.4 percent from 1992, and scored 6.804 billion yuan in sales  value, up 13.5 percent. Our province's ongoing economic  development is distinguished by: 1) strong indications of  investment-pulled growth; 2) government industry as the main  force of the province's industrial development, though its  growth rate is lower than that of nongovernment industry; 3)  large and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises as the keel of  the province's industry, playing a decisive role; 4) the value  of completed exports and deliveries has continued to be good;  and 5) there has been an improvement in economic efficiency.  Initial calculations estimate that overall economic return  indicators could reach 69.5 percent, an increase of about 5  percentage points from 1992 on a comparable basis. Of this, 265  state-owned budgetary manufacturing enterprises saw their total  profits and remitted tax increase by 25.1 percent to 272 million  yuan, which did not include the profits and taxes generated by  the Qinghai Petroleum Bureau. Industrial development, however,  remained beset by problems such as sluggish growth in light  industry and low economic returns.    The status of agriculture as the foundation of the  province's  economy continued to be reinforced and consolidated. The output  of grain and oil-bearing crops hit record high levels. Animal  husbandry output dropped as a result of natural disasters, but  not as badly as had been predicted. Total grain output for the  whole province was 1,186,300 tonnes, slightly higher than 1992  and an all-time high. The total output of oil-bearing crops was  152,100 tonnes, up 8.4 percent from 1992 and also an all-time  high. Grazing livestock in the whole province increased by a  total of 16.6 percent, with a year-end estimate of 22.1 million  head, down 2.67 percent from 1992.    Construction has expanded in scale, and key projects have  progressed well. State-owned units of the whole province  completed fixed-asset investment of 3.455 billion yuan, up 33.8  percent from the same period of [as published] 1992, of which  investment in infrastructure projects and in renovation and  transformation were up respectively 65.1 percent and 46.9  percent. The characteristics of fixed-asset investment were:  Infrastructure investment was concentrated on central projects,  and renovation and transformation investment on local projects;  production investment increased faster than nonproduction  investment; key construction projects went well; construction  funds reached where they were needed; and there were relatively  bigger increases in newly installed fixed assets.    The situation in transport has improved, and there was  growth  in post and telecommunications services. The Xining Railway  Sub-Bureau halted a 10-month fall and pushed the cargo transport  volume back up to a level 2.1 percent higher than that in 1992.  The road cargo transport volume was down 7.9 percent from 1992.  Post and telecommunications services of the whole province rose  24 percent from 1992.    Market sales were stable; foreign trade improved; new  headway  was made in opening up to the outside world; and prices rose by  greater margins. The total commodity retail sales of the whole  province were up 13.6 percent from 1992, or 1.2 percent allowing  for price rises. The pattern in commodity retail markets was:  Retail sales in consumer goods were relatively brisk; corporate  spending was brought under control; markets in urban areas were  prosperous and vibrant; sales in rural markets were sluggish;  increases in the retail volumes of state-owned commercial units  slowed and retail sales decreased in proportion. Foreign trade  reversed the falling trend in the fourth quarter and rose 19.71  percent from 1992 in annual import and export value; of which  exports grew 12.51 percent. In 1993, our province registered 53  companies as foreign-invested enterprises and imported $17.6  million of foreign capital. It was the year in which  foreign-invested enterprises developed the fastest since reform  and opening up. The provincial market price index in 1993 rose  from 107.9 in January to 116.6 in December. Initial  calculations estimated that the overall retail price level would  rise 12.3 percent from 1992.    Local financial revenue increased and financial order  improved further. Local financial revenue for the whole  province amounted to 1.135 billion yuan, up 39.1 percent from  1992. By the end of 1993, the total savings balance of all  banks was 8.531 billion yuan, 17.86 percent higher than early in  the year. Cash income for banks of the whole province increased  44.7 percent from 1992, while cash expenditure was up 45.1  percent.    Income for urban and rural residents increased. A survey of  a sample of urban residents showed that the per-capita income  for living expenses of the province's urban residents was  1,879.29 yuan, up 19.77 percent, while per-capita consumption  expenditure was 1,817.68 yuan, up 22.1 percent. The per-capita  net income of the province's peasants and herdsmen was 672.33  yuan, up 11.4 percent from 1992.</p>

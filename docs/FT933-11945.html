			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Greggs rises 26% to Pounds 2.9m GREGGS, the manufacturer and retailer of bread, confectionery and savoury products, lifted pre-tax profits by 26 per cent, from Pounds 2.29m to Pounds 2.89m, in the 24 weeks to June 12. Turnover improved to Pounds 48.3m (Pounds 45.3m); the 6.8 per cent rise included a small increase in volumes through existing outlets. Mr Mike Darrington, managing director, said the results reflected the company's belief that the recession had ended but he was seeking steady, long term growth rather than a boom. Gross margins had increased slightly and the wage percentage of costs had reduced, reflecting both improved volumes and tighter operational costs. The sandwich business grew strongly but bread sales were relatively disappointing. Earnings per share were ahead 27 per cent to 17p (13.4p), and the interim dividend goes up to to 6p (5p). Mr Ian Gregg, chairman, said because the second half of last year was much stronger than the first, he did not anticipate comparative profit growth in the second half of 1993 to be as pronounced as in the first half. Mr Gregg announced he intended to 'formalise' existing arrangements by becoming non-executive chairman. The company had 492 outlets at June 12; it plans to open up to 10 more in the remainder of 1993. In 1994 it plans record capital investment of Pounds 12m, half of it in London and the West Midlands. Net cash now stands at Pounds 9m, almost Pounds 4m higher than this time last year.</p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Index futures trigger selling pressure in equities - Market Report Share prices were hit hard in London yesterday in what was clearly a turning point for the stock market, at least in the short term. Pre-market trade saw the FT-SE Index 18.8 up at a new intra day peak of 3,480.8, but sellers immediately appeared, alerted by developments in the derivatives markets. The UK stock market paid no heed to the continued firmness in continental European bourses. Trading volume jumped sharply as dealers decided not to wait for today's half session, which is the last day of a three week equity account as well as the final share trading day of 1993. Dealing books were cut yesterday in preparation for a fresh start on January 4, when the market re-opens after the new year holiday. Downward pressure increased as the day proceeded, and with Wall Street weak at the opening of the new session, London ended at the day's low. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index down 33.2 at 3,428. Although a bout of profit-taking had been expected, dealers admitted to being taken by surprise by the force of selling yesterday. The market's initial gain reflected strength overnight in other global markets, with Hong Kong providing the lead. UK traders hoped that profit-takers might hold their hands until the new year. The rug was pulled from under equities by weakness in stock index futures as it appeared that the powerful technical position which has been driving the futures ahead had been unwound. Suggestions that another, similar, futures position might surface, kept equities subdued throughout the session. The fall in shares spread across the range of the market, taking the FT-Mid 250 Index down 20.4 to 3,786.6. Non-Footsie stocks made up around 63 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 554.1m shares, up from 479.3m in the previous session. A sell programme from a leading Swiss securities house completed the tale of woe and, with most traders already writing off today's curtailed session, the final picture was gloomy. Bank stocks, which have dominated the advance in the stock market over the past month gave ground - the exception being HSBC which was responding to the influence of its home stock market. Store and retail shares were easier as the market remained uncertain of the outcome of the Christmas selling season on which reports continue to vary. The international blue chips, many of which were involved in the unravelling of positions in futures, moved more narrowly than the rest of the market. Pharmaceuticals were mixed, with Zeneca the best feature. Market analysts refused to be depressed by the setback which has dashed the hopes of some super-optimists who had been looking for a Footsie close in the 3,500 area on New Year's Eve. One characterised yesterday's performance as 'the partial unwinding of a technical squeeze,' and doubted if UK equities would fall far while they continued to offer significant attractions by comparison with the alternatives, including cash. But traders were more wary, foreseeing a 'choppy market' ahead, especially if any more futures pressures appear. However, marketmakers welcomed the chance to take stock on to their trading books which have been feeling the pressure during the market's powerful pre-Christmas advance.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Pest control for antiques Pest-infested antiques and textiles are usually fumigated using poisonous solvents or gases. A less toxic treatment, which does not leave the item in need of restoration, is being introduced into the UK by Thermo Lignum, a London-based company. The process involves slowly heating the article up to a maximum of 55'C, which destroys the pests. The procedure takes a few hours for fabrics and eight to 20 hours for wooden objects. Although the principle underlying the technique is simple, it needs sophisticated computerised controls of temperature and humidity to prevent the articles suffering structural damage.

Ozark estimates that it will cost $34,000 to construct the proposed facilities, to be financed with equity funds and aid-in-construction funding from NOARK. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ozark explains that becasue the location of the proposed delivery point expansion is in Township 9N, Range 26W in western Arkansas, it is required to obtain a Section 7(c) certificate in accordance with a Stipulation and Consent Agreement approved by the Commission in 1983, 22 FERC &para; 61,324 at p. 61,578, instead of qualifying under Ozark's blanket construction certificate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before July 6, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10).

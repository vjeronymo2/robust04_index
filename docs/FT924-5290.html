			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Letter: Finance, not a name, to blame Sir, With regard to your article 'Ice cream ambitions take a licking' (November 21), I would like to put the record straight concerning Clarke Foods' purchase of Lyons Maid. The article stated that 'arguments over the use of the Lyons name delayed the deal by five months until February 1992'. Not so. The delay was caused by the time needed for Clarke Foods to put in place its financing arrangements. Tony Pratt, director of corporate affairs, Allied-Lyons, 24 Portland Place, London W1N 4BB</p>

Korea Must Be Held Responsible for Abortive Exchange of </F> Special Envoys" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- The South side has  driven the working contact for the exchange of presidential  envoys between the North and the South of Korea to a rupture,  leading the North-South relations to an all the more acute and  perilous phase. This will be recorded in history as another  crime of the blackest dye to be a target of denunciation from  the entire fellow countrymen.    MINJU CHOSON says this in a commentary today.    The analyst says:    The South side came out to the working contact, motivated by  a premeditated scheme to veil the ugly color of the  anti-democratic, anti-reunification "civilian" regime, boost his  daily descending popularity and balk the DPRK-U.S. talks.    It got frenzied in solicitation diplomacy with foreign  forces  outside the conference hall in a bid to reverse the agreed  conclusions reached between the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea and the United States at the New York contact, while  showing an insincere and dishonest attitude at the talks,  intentionally laying obstacles to the discussion of working  matters.    Prior to the eighth working contact, the South side held "a  high-level strategic meeting" and openly cried for "a tough  reaction" to its dialogue partner. It also provocatively blared  that it would resume the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises,  push ahead with the plan to introduce patriot missiles in South  Korea and join in "international sanctions" against the North.    This was obviously a declaration that it negates the  exchange  of special envoys and a declaration of confrontation and war.    All the facts prove that the South side has used the working  contact as a means of casting a chill over the DPRK-U.S. talks  and hampering it.    The South side can never evade its responsibility for the  collapse of the working contact.    It must clearly know what grave consequences its criminal  acts will entail.</p>

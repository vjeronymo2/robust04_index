			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Reed merger terms adjusted - Pound's fall fails to deflect proposed links with Elsevier STERLING'S plunge since Britain left the ERM has altered the terms of the proposed merger between Reed International and Elsevier of the Netherlands, which will create one of the world's biggest publishers. Reed's indirect interest in the Dutch group, granted to reflect the UK group's larger market value, will now be 5.8 per cent, rather than the 11.5 per cent suggested when the deal was first announced on September 17 . Mr Peter Davis, chairman of Reed, said neither group had been deflected by the recent currency volatility: 'We just kept our nerve, kept our heads down and got on with it.' The combined group, Reed Elsevier, will have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 6bn. The merger, to take effect on January 1, will be on a 50-50 basis without any premium to either set of shareholders, and both Reed and Elsevier will keep separate stock exchange listings. The market welcomed yesterday's announcement, with Reed shares advancing 7p to 582p, and Elsevier's shares closing in Amsterdam up Fl 2 to Fl 112. The change in the size of the cross-holding means that for income purposes one Elsevier share will have equivalent economic benefits to 7.69 Reed shares, rather than the initial figure of 6.86. Both companies will pay gross dividends on this 1:7.69 equalisation ratio. A bleary-eyed Mr Davis said the final terms of the deal had been settled yesterday 'after complex analysis by the professionals and then  - at the end - a bit of horse-trading in the middle of the night'. The merged group is forecast to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 430m in the year to December 31 on turnover of Pounds 2.46bn, and have interest cover of 16 times. Strong cashflow of Pounds 442m and low borrowings will allow Reed Elsevier to make acquisitions. The merged company could have Pounds 1bn available and potential purchases are already being jointly studied. A bid will be submitted for Official Airline Guides, the business bought by Mr Robert Maxwell from Dun &amp; Bradstreet for Dollars 750m in 1988, although this is seen as a useful addition to the merged group's existing travel information businesses rather than a strategic necessity. Reed International has already identified business and professional publishing as its top priority for the future, an emphasis which will fit well with the Elsevier approach. Acquisitions in professional areas such as the law in continental Europe are now likely. In the past Reed has looked at such expansion but drawn back because of lack of knowledge of particular European markets. Reed said the merger would cost between Pounds 30m and Pounds 35m in advisers' and listings fees, reflecting the fact that the enlarged group will operate in the 43 countries. However, the group believes that a combination of operational and tax savings will recoup that amount within 18 months. The merged group will set up a combined treasury and finance operation in Switzerland, although Reed will continue a significant operation in London. Mr Nigel Stapleton, Reed's finance director, said he was confident that the effect of the merger would be to reduce the group's tax rate by between 0.5 percentage point and 1 percentage point a year. Mr Davis said there was scope for some cost savings, but emphasised that the merger was not driven by these considerations. Areas of overlap which are likely to be combined into single divisions are in US business magazines, UK scientific publications and medical publishing. Management links between the two companies are already increasing in number in advance of formal confirmation of the merger and Mr Davis believes Reed and Elsevier are similar in approach and culture. 'We are 85 per cent there in terms of culture, style and temperament,' Mr Davis said yesterday. As the shareholders of both Reed and Elsevier start to digest their merger circulars the intensity of two-way traffic between London and Amsterdam is already increasing. 'There will be contact at all levels. It's already much more than we thought,' Mr Davis said. See Lex</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis will send a letter to UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali outlining the positions of  the Greek Cypriot side. Government spokesman Ioannis  Kasoulidhis today said the letter is being prepared and must be  sent by tomorrow. President Kliridhis informed the National  Council of its content yesterday.    In light of developments, the political party leaders  outlined their positions in statements to the Cyprus  Broadcasting Corporation.    DISI [Democratic Rally] Chairman Ioannis Matsis said our  side  should turn toward discussing the substance of the Cyprus issue.  He also said that the security issue should come at the  beginning, which Rauf Denktas raised in his letter to the  secretary general. Using the issue of security, Matsis said, we  should turn toward international organizations and Europe and  undertake initiatives and promote them at international  decisionmaking centers.    AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] General  Secretary Dhimitrios Khristofias said his party would be happy  if in the end, our side's handling of policy results in  disengagement from the discussion on the confidence-building  measures with no political cost. Khristofias criticized our  side, saying its handling of policy has led to many impasses and  wasted time. Answering a question, he said he does not believe  the secretary general will propose to return to a discussion of  the substance of the Cyprus issue following the receipt of  Kliridhis' letter. This, he said, should have been done a few  months ago to achieve a specific result.    DIKO [Democratic Party] Chairman Spiros Kiprianou said that  as things stand today, the only way out is to begin a dialogue  on the substance of the Cyprus issue, putting forward issues  relating to security and demilitarization. He also said he is  optimistic for the long term on condition that we follow the  correct policy and struggle in the right way. He added that  this is subject to full cooperation with Athens. Kiprianou said  that now is the time to hold a conference in Athens and added  that he will raise the issue of a trip to Athens, even if it is  only for the members of the National Council.    Socialist EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] Chairman  Vasos Lissaridhis noted that with is stance since Kliridhis  accepted the confidence-building measures and his recent letter  suggesting that every measure be included in an overall  discussion of the Cyprus issue, Denktas had offered a golden  opportunity. Let us grasp what Denktas says and let us ask,  finally, for a discussion of the substance of the Cyprus issue,  Lissaridhis said. He added that he does not believe the  secretary general or any country will say that our demand to  discuss the substance of the Cyprus issue is illogical.    Konstandinos Themistokleous, vice president of the  Democratic  Socialist Renewal Movement [ADISOK], said our side should  reaffirm its position that it accepts no regulation that would  imply recognition of the pseudostate and will discuss all the  other issues connected with the three documents [on the  confidence-building measures]. Themistokleous said we cannot  appear to be negative in our effort to discuss the  confidence-building measures, because the United Nations  considers that both sides now accept the measures in principle.  He also said that the confidence-building measures are valid as  a single package and cannot be implemented in stages.    Free Democrats Movement Chairman Yeoryios Vasiliou said the  procedure being formulated now is dangerous. He said Turkey  aims to maintain the status quo and if we enter a continuing  dialogue on what Denktas does and does not mean, Turkey will be  very happy. He said we cannot overcome the impasse by  retreating or give the impression that we are retreating,  because it will lead us into conflict with the United Nations  and create a negative picture of our side for the world.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Decline in new car sales goes on with 15% fall in March UK NEW car sales plunged by 15.2 per cent in March, dispelling motor industry hopes that last month's favourable Budget would bring an end to the 2 1/2 -year recession. New car sales have been in decline for 29 consecutive months as carmakers have suffered the steepest decline into recession since 1945. According to figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, new car sales fell to 143,115 in March from 168,854 in the same month a year ago. New car registrations in March were 35.3 per cent lower than in the same month three years ago. In the first three months of this year new car sales totalled 406,211, a fall of 11.1 per cent from the same period a year ago and 35.6 per cent lower than in the corresponding period of 1989. Carmakers remain uncertain about the underlying trend. Within the overall depressed market Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, has emerged as one of the main losers. Last month alone its sales plunged by 45.2 per cent from the same month a year ago, resulting in a precipitous drop in its market share to only 10.0 per cent from 15.5 per cent a year ago. For the first three months Rover has slipped into fourth place in the UK new car sales league after being overtaken by the Peugeot group of France, which includes Citroen. Rover's new car sales in the first three months were 32.1 per cent lower than in the same period a year ago. Its market share has fallen to 12.0 per cent from 15.7 per cent a year ago. The Peugeot group and Renault, the two French car makers, as well as BMW of Germany have gained significant ground in the first three months. The Peugeot group boosted the combined share of its Peugeot and Citroen marques to 12.2 per cent from 10.2 per cent a year ago, helped by a 6.1 per cent increase in sales volume. The pattern of UK new car sales was also distorted last month by Ford, the UK market leader, which launched a fresh price war in the wake of the Budget and also pushed through an abnormally high level of registrations in the final days of the month with the climax of a special sales incentive scheme. Ford registered 41.6 per cent of last month's sales in the last five days of the month. For the whole of the month it gained a share of 24.9 per cent, but in the last five days its daily share rose rapidly from 24.1 per cent to 30.3 per cent, 35.8 per cent, 44.0 per cent and 43.3 per cent. However, in spite of its costly marketing incentives, Ford still fell far short of its 30 per cent market share target for March. The company is under severe pressure after running up record financial losses last year.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Recovery to be 'patchy' survey says A WARNING that the expected recovery will be 'patchy' has come from a survey conducted by Trade Indemnity, a credit insurance group, Peter Marsh writes. Out of 728 companies, 46 per cent said they expected an upturn. Ten per cent expected activity to continue to decline. The companies said sales were higher in the first quarter of this year than in any of the quarters last year. Only 5 per cent said cancelled orders had declined in the quarter compared with the final three months of 1992. Trade Indemnity said the survey contained some 'positive signals' but business failures and bad debts 'will continue to plague the economy for some time'. Quarterly Financial Trends Survey, Trade Indemnity, 12 Great Eastern St, London EC2A 3AX. Annual subscription Pounds 80.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: 'Red route' network to be widened THE government yesterday announced plans for a 300-mile network of 'red routes' for London, designed to improve traffic flow in the capital. Mr Steve Norris, junior transport minister, told the Commons of proposals for the schemes after 18-month pilot projects in north and east London. The announcement could pave the way for similar plans in other cities, with Birmingham, Belfast, Hull and Leeds studying the capital's trials. Edinburgh is also understood to be interested. Red routes, officially known as priority routes, curb stopping by vehicles to allow easy passage for through traffic. Restricted areas are shown by prominent red kerbside markings and 'no stopping' lines. Fears that businesses will suffer through the extension of the red route network were discounted by Mr Norris. His view was strongly disputed by Labour MPs representing constituencies in north and east London, and questioned by Mr Peter Brooke, Tory MP for City of London and Westminster south and a former cabinet minister. Mr Norris insisted that there was 'no demonstrable link whatever' between red routes and reduction in business for local shops and other establishments. Mr Brooke said: 'The perception of my constituency is very much in the opposite direction.' He called for an assurance that, if necessary, amendments would be made to the roads designated as red routes. Mr Norris promised that 'if the department is wrong it will change its mind'. He accused some Labour critics of persisting with tactics that had been employed during the general election, when the issue of red routes was used 'as a stick to beat Conservative candidates'. Highlighting the benefits he said had been revealed by the pilot scheme, Mr Norris added that overall journey times had improved by 25 per cent, while road casualties fell by more than 200 in 1991 - a fall of some 36 per cent compared with 12 per cent in London as a whole. Mr Norris stressed that the journey times of buses had been cut by more than 10 per cent and their reliability improved by a third, resulting in wider use of them. Dealing with the traffic problems in the centre of London, he explained that initially the designated red route would be virtually confined to the inner ring road, roughly encompassing the area around the main railway stations. As traffic using Tower Bridge, which formed part of the inner ring road, was subject to a weight restriction a route via London Bridge would also be designated. Mr Norris said the main objectives in the centre of London were to help the movement of buses and local commercial traffic rather than to serve longer-distance movements. He expected the first of the new red routes to be in operation by the end of next year. Road traffic increased by 1 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period of 1991, according to figures issued yesterday by the Department of Transport. However, the increase was mainly due to the leap-year quarter being one day longer.</p>

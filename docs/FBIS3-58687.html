			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Munich (DPA) -- The Ifo Institute for Economic  Research believes that a recovery is in sight following the  sharp downturn in investments in German industry. "There are  increasing signs that the rapid decline in industrial  investments is coming to an end," the Munich-based institute  writes in its latest analysis.    In the more probable event of a clear acceleration in the  export sector and further more pronounced interest rate  reductions, a real increase of 3 percent (following minus 3  percent in 1993) in plant investment could be expected in 1994.  If, however, the pressures of the domestic economic situation  were to increase, a further slight decline of 1 per cent was  possible.    In either case the negative development in investment  expenditure in industry was likely to continue, in the more  favourable scenario by minus 6 per cent, in the unfavourable one  by minus 11 per cent (following the minus 12 per cent calculated  for 1993). In 1992 investment expenditure in industry was DM127  billion and DM721 billion for all economic sectors. Investment  in the former east German states continues to rise, whereby the  mining, energy and services sectors as well as -- in the  medium-term -- transportation predominate.    Investment in the former east Germany increased by around 15  per cent despite the recession in 1993. In broad sectors of the  west German economy, however, the downturn in investment was  much more pronounced than even in the most unfavourable  scenario, for example in trade, transport, in industry and also  in agriculture, according to the Ifo. In the medium-term, the  high investment level of the early 1990's could be regained in  1996 at the earliest. In the purchase of capital goods, data  processing equipment and office machinery are likely to remain  key areas of growth until 1998.    The Ifo Institute warned against hoping for overly large  economic impulses from the GATT agreement on the liberalization  of world trade, reached in mid-December 1993. A definitive  assessment of the outcome was not yet possible. The agreement  was basically positive, although only a partial success had been  achieved in some areas. Failure had only been prevented by  excluding some areas or giving compensation. To describe the  agreement as a "huge" or "mega economic programme" was certainly  an exaggeration, the Ifo Institute writes.    It should be borne in mind that the liberalisation would  begin in early 1995 at the earliest and would be completed  gradually in five or more stages. "At least some economic  impulses can peter out as a result. In addition, it cannot be  assumed that the tendency to solve structural problems through  protectionist measures no longer existed." Sanctions were still  not envisaged. The main reasons for the prolonged nature of the  GATT negotiations -- the great conflict of interests between  industrialized and developing countries in some areas and the  large number of negotiating partners -- continued to exist and  would continue in future to make multilateral liberalization  steps more difficult. The discussion on a GATT with several  speeds could therefore remain topical.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Romanian human rights move Romania has signed a European convention giving its citizens the right of final redress at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Mr Teodor Melescanu, the foreign minister, described the signing of the 11th protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights as an important step in Romania's moves towards European standards of democracy. Romania has a controversial human rights record, becoming the last of central Europe's former communist countries to join the Council of Europe last October. The country's treatment of its 1.7m ethnic Hungarian and 2m gypsy minorities, as well as its ban on homosexuality, delayed the restoration of most favoured nation trading status by the US until last autumn.</p>

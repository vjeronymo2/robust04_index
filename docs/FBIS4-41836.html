			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- Pavel Medvedev, chairman of  the Russian State Duma sub-committee for banking legislation,  admitted on Monday that perhaps foreign banks should be allowed  limited operations on Russian territory.    "In that question we, as legislators, have no disagreements  with the Central Bank's position", he announced at a  press-conference held in the Duma. Medvedev explained that  limited penetration of the Russian financial market by foreign  banks "would help our banking system to become more stable and  civilized".    The sub-committee head showed reporters the draft of a new  edition of the acting law "On Banks and Banking Activity". The  sub- committee hopes to submit the new draft to the full chamber  for its first reading at the beginning of this June.    Medvedev stressed that the changes to the law are designed  to  eliminate the contradictions which industrialists and financiers  now constantly encounter in the banking business. In  particular, banks will be required to offer clients full  information, which is often not done now, since the law on that  topic is not fully clear. "Therefore, the banking system will  become more transparent", he explained.    Commenting on the fact that there are a significant number  of  organisations in Russia who are carrying out banking operations  without the appropriate license to do so, Medvedev reported that  the new version of the banking law contains an amendment which  would protect depositors' savings and clearly indicate which  banks have the necessary licenses and what will happen to those  banks which ignore the law. The chairman said that the Russian  Government's decision to tax the interest which citizen's  receive on their bank deposits was "politically shortsighted".    Medvedev also underlined that the new version of the banking  law included provisions to make money-laundering more difficult  and establish stricter control over the origin of funds which  are deposited in banks. In accordance with these goals, some  depositors will have to submit declarations proving that the  money they would like to deposit is really their own.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> LAW TO TAP BUILDERS FOR PARKS IS REBUILT  </P> <P> Anaheim's parks are about to receive a boost under a new ordinance that  restores the city's power to require developers to set aside land or money for  parks.  </P> <P> The parkland requirement had been in place for years.  </P> <P> However, a 1988 revision of the park ordinance inadvertently removed the city's  ability to enforce the parkland provision.  </P> <P> The City Council unveiled the revised ordinance this week and it is likely to  be approved next week.  </P> <P> The law says that developers of residential projects must dedicate a portion of  the land for park space, or be charged a fee. All developers of projects having  50 or more units must also provide the city with funding to build the park.  </P> <P> These requirements must be met before the developer can be granted a building  permit. Specific acreage and funding amounts are determined according to the  size of the project. LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

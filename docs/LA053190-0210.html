			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR BACKS MEASURES TO AID CRIME VICTIMS  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian, pledging his support for two crime measures scheduled  to go before the voters this year, stressed Wednesday that crime victims need  to be given as much attention as criminal defendants.  </P> <P> "When one hears the cries of sorrow of these innocent people, plus the cries of  those others who have suffered at the hands of criminals, it is hard to imagine  any group of people more deserving of our attention," Deukmejian said at the  Governor's Conference on Victims' Services and Public Safety at the Anaheim  Hilton and Towers.  </P> <P> The governor told a group of 2,000 law enforcement officers, volunteers and  people who work with crime victims that passing the Crime Victims Justice  Reform Act would be one step toward addressing the problem.  </P> <P> The act, which will appear as Proposition 115 on Tuesday's ballot, proposes  increasing the jail penalties for crimes such as torture and murder and  speeding up the criminal trial process.  </P> <P> "The mindless prolongation of judicial proceedings destroys the integrity of  our criminal justice system and destroys the lives of victims and their  families," the governor said.  </P> <P> The other initiative, called the Prison Inmate Initiative of 1990, would give  the state the authority to make convicted criminals work to help offset what it  costs to keep them in prison. The initiative, scheduled to appear on the  November ballot, would also allow a portion of the wages earned by inmates to  be set aside as compensation to their victims.  </P> <P> Following his speech, Deukmejian presented 30 people with the 1990 Governor's  Victim Services and Public Safety Awards. The awards recognize individuals and  programs that have made significant contributions in the areas of victim  services and public safety. Recipients were chosen from more than 200  nominations submitted by community-based organizations, law enforcement  agencies and victim services providers.  </P> <P> Since 1984, the state has sponsored an annual program recognizing providers of  victim services.  </P></p>

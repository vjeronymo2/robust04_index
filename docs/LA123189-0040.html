			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A 1989 RETROSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> HEROES  </P> <P> When his mother began to choke on a lozenge in their Van Nuys condominium,  3-year-old Jameson Rodgers remembered what his parents had trained him to do.  He dialed 911. "My mom's on the floor. She can't breathe," the tot told a Fire  Department dispatcher in a calm, articulate voice. Minutes later, paramedics  arrived and found Peggy Rodgers on her hands and knees, on the verge of  unconsciousness. After two tries, they managed to dislodge the lozenge. Leonard  Washington of Pomona reacted decisively when he noticed a group of black-booted  "skinheads" accosting a Middle Eastern family in a La Verne parking lot.  Washington, 34, stopped his car and proceeded to hold off the quartet of  attackers, one of whom had menacingly waved a baseball bat, until police  arrived. Nineteen other heroes received awards ranging from $250 to $10,388  from the county Board of Supervisors for their roles in bringing Night Stalker  Richard Ramirez to justice. "It was my biggest experience, to know that I  confronted him face-to-face and knew that it was him," said Edgardo Molinar of  Covina, who helped chase Ramirez through East Los Angeles on the day of his  capture in August, 1985.  </P></p>

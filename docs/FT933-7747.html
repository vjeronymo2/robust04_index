			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): New Zealand accelerates to a 3 1/2-year high EQUITY prices fluctuated as investors waited for a statement by Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, and the Nikkei average closed moderately lower, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average was finally down 68.80 at 20,773.18 after moving between a range of 20,732 and 20,964. Share prices were also supported by arbitrage buying, but met heavy profit-taking later by investors who had purchased stocks around the 21,000 level. Volume contracted to 280m shares from 320m. Declines led rises by 595 to 362, with 197 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 5.89 to 1,675.86. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 1.58 at 1,276.65. After the market had closed, Mr Mieno denied that there were plans for a discount rate cut, adding that the mechanism for a recovery was in place. Meanwhile, the yen took a breather from its record-breaking rise, trading narrowly between Y101.32 and Y101.70. Profit-taking continued to depress steels and shipbuilders, with financial institutions selling stock. Nippon Steel dipped Y10 to Y380 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries receded Y13 to Y687. Cosmo Securities, which will become a subsidiary of Daiwa Bank, closed at an offered price of Y549, down by its daily limit from Friday's close of Y649. The stock was suspended from trading on Monday and Tuesday after the company had announced losses of Y68.9bn due to irregular shifting of clients' accounts. The broker said that it will allocate 243.75m new shares to Daiwa at Y320 per share. However, other brokers firmed on bargain hunting, with Nikko Securities improving Y20 to Y1,370 and Daiwa Securities Y40 to Y1,480. High-technology issues were mixed: Toshiba fell Y13 to Y677 and Sony lost Y10 to Y4,340 but Matsushita Electric Industrial advanced Y10 to Y1,370. Housing shares were higher on hopes raised by the new government's measures to boost housing starts. Daikyo rose Y10 to Y1,330. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 45.12 easier at 22,673.37 in volume of 60m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, retreated Y300 to Y9,250 as investors took profits. Roundup CLOSING highs were almost the order of the day around the Pacific Rim. NEW ZEALAND was catapulted to its best close in more than 3 1/2 years by a turnround from loss into profits at Fletcher Challenge, the forestry company. Fletcher shot up 47 cents, or nearly 16 per cent, to NZDollars 3.47, helping the NZSE-40 index to close 63.80, or 3.4 per cent, stronger at 1,957.24. Brokers estimated turnover in excess of NZDollars 90m, its highest since the 1987 crash, with half of that volume in Fletcher shares. AUSTRALIA closed at its highest level since 1987, shrugging off a tax-laden federal budget to end 20 ahead at 1,894.7. Brokers said low inflation and perceptions that the economy was on the mend also stoked the rise. HONG KONG chalked up its third straight record high on overseas buying of blue chips, the Hang Seng index adding 32.18 at 7,560.97. Turnover fell from HKDollars 5.69bn to HKDollars 4.63bn. Investors were also optimistic about corporate results due from Hang Seng Bank, Hutchison and Cheung Kong today, although each of these underperformed on the day with falls of 50 cents to HKDollars 61.50, and 10 cents apiece to HKDollars 22.90 and HKDollars 27.80 respectively. SINGAPORE's fourth consecutive peak left the Straits Times Industrial index up a further 23.06, or 1.2 per cent, at 1,951.40. KUALA LUMPUR hit a new high with the KLSE composite index gaining 6.11 at 791.02 as institutional funds continued to mop up quality stocks led by Tanjong and Telekom Malaysia, which firmed 40 and 20 cents to MDollars 15.10 and MDollars 15.90. SEOUL's recovery from the false names trading ban continued on bargain hunting, optimism that the government will come up with market-boosting measures, and an inflow of funds. The composite index rose 24.24 to 713.18. BOMBAY advanced in spite of higher margins on sales and purchases imposed by the stock exchange authorities to keep a check on continuously rising prices. The BSE-30 index put on 55.81 at 2,631.39.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Observer: Last bite? The decision to privatise Pro Ned, which specialises in finding non-executive directors, is rather sad. It may be a rather sleepy organisation but it did provide a sizeable reservoir of non-executive directors where small companies could fish without being charged exorbitant fees by the big headhunters. Sir Adrian Cadbury, who chaired the committee on corporate governance, will continue as chairman of the new venture, a partnership with Egon Zehnder International. But he is only going to stay for a year or so and after that he says he is severing his ties with the City. His term as a director of the Bank of England, where he has been since 1970, expires at the end of next month. Sir Adrian's impending departure from City life perhaps explains the timing of Pro Ned's latest move.</p>

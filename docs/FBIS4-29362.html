			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Trade Minister Eijiro Hata  on Thursday [16 June] requested the power industry to continue  the temporary rate cut beyond September.    Hata made the request, the first of its kind to be done  formally, during a breakfast meeting with power industry  leaders, including Kohei Abe, head of the Federation of Electric  Power Companies.    Hata said the power industry should reflect "anticipation of  the Japanese people" in its rate policy.    Abe said the industry will decide whether or not to extend  the rate cut by considering economic conditions like crude oil  prices.    In November 1993, power and gas utilities implemented a  temporary cut in their rates, valid until Sept. 30, to pass on  to consumers the benefits of the yen's appreciation against the  dollar.    On construction of nuclear power plants, Abe, president of  Chubu Electric Power Co., said the industry will give priority  to safety and environmental protection in selecting new  locations.    Large-lot industrial power demand is still slack amid the  overall economic slump, Abe said.    But he added power demand will turn up in a long-term,  increasing the importance of nuclear power plants.</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Observer: Thinking chaps Britain's think-tank industry, like the rest of the country, has not escaped the recession. Money has been tight, Big Ideas have been in short supply, and existing output has been hit by theoretical disputes. Hence, this week's launch of Demos, the first new think-tank of 1993, is a welcome event. At first sight it might look like a Marxism Today conspiracy. After all Demos' chairman is Martin Jacques, 47, a former editor of the magazine and once described as the most prominent British communist of his generation. Director Geoff Mulgan, 30, is an old buddy of Jacques' and there are plenty of old Marxism Today buffs on the advisory council. However, the presence of successful business folk such as Courtaulds Textiles' Martin Taylor, Northern Foods' Chris Haskins, and Dennis Stevenson, who is chairman of the Tate Gallery and a member of the City Takeover Panel, suggests that it is not going to be dominated by the loony left or the nutty right. Its membership comes from a surprisingly broad church. That said, its list of aims is a bit long-winded. Any think tank which cannot sum up its purpose in one sentence is going to find it hard to get its message across.</p>

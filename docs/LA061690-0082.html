			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SILBERMAN'S LAUNDERING CASE GOES TO JURY  </P> <P> Driven by greed, Richard T. Silberman led a "secret life of crime" and  laundered $300,000 he believed was Colombian cocaine money, a federal  prosecutor said Friday in urging a jury to convict the San Diego financier of  seven felony counts.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys, however, argued that Silberman is innocent and maintained  that the FBI should be held accountable -- for not making it clear that the two  deals in the case involved purported drug money and for using a "very scary"  informer whom they allege threatened Silberman's family.  </P> <P> After the conflicting closing arguments in the complex case, U.S. District  Judge J. Lawrence Irving told the jury the case was theirs. The panel is  expected to begin deliberations Tuesday.  </P> <P> Silberman, 61, who once served as a top aide to former Gov. Jerry Brown, said  Friday that he felt "great." The courtroom was packed with his supporters and  relatives -- including his wife, San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding --  and he said, "There's a lot of strength in love and family and friends."  </P> <P> The prominent San Diego businessman is charged with laundering money portrayed  to him by an undercover FBI agent as the proceeds of Colombian drug deals. If  convicted on all seven counts, he could be sentenced to up to 75 years in  prison.  </P> <P> Silberman was arrested in April, 1989, moments after leaving a San Diego hotel  room where, according to prosecutors, he was negotiating a third  money-laundering deal.  </P> <P> His character emerged as a central theme in the closing arguments presented  Friday.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr., the lead prosecutor in the case,  said Silberman had "all the advantages society could bestow." The prosecutor  said Silberman "had a lot" but "wanted more," and showed a constant pattern of  "lying to obtain an advantage in financial deals."  </P> <P> Lead defense attorney James J. Brosnahan, however, called Silberman a "decent  man." The FBI decided to "get him," and Silberman has been "pushed to the  jailhouse door," Brosnahan said.  </P> <P> Four other men were indicted with Silberman, but he is being tried alone. Two  of the other four have pleaded guilty to felony charges connected to the case.  The two remaining men, including reputed mobster Chris Petti, are scheduled to  stand trial Sept. 25.  </P> <P> Silberman's arrest came after a lengthy FBI investigation that focused  initially on Petti and mob interest in gaming operations at the Rincon Indian  reservation.  </P> <P> The probe turned to Silberman after he called Petti, whom he had known from a  San Diego barbershop, in October, 1988, to discuss a potential business  arrangement. It's what that arrangement developed into that is at the center of  the case.  </P> <P> The trial revolved around two transactions. The first was a November, 1988,  swap of $100,000 -- supplied by the undercover FBI agent -- for stock in a  Silberman gold-mining company. The second was an exchange of $200,000 for U.S.  Treasury bonds.  </P> <P> Silberman maintains that the first deal was nothing more than a legitimate  stock sale. Prosecutors contend that he was told -- and understood -- that the  cash supposedly came from Colombian drug trafficking.  </P> <P> The defense contends that Silberman was coerced into the second deal by threats  aimed at his family by informer Robert Benjamin, an eight-time convicted felon.  Gorder said Friday that assertion was a "red herring."  </P> <P> The key issue in the case, both Gorder and Brosnahan said Friday, was whether  undercover FBI agent Peter Ahearn -- who posed as Pete Carmassi, a front man  for Colombian drug lords -- conveyed to Silberman that the cash in the two  deals came from drug deals.  </P> <P> Though the case involves some 450 secretly recorded tapes of phone calls and  meetings, Brosnahan said the tapes are bare of any explicit reference to the  words "drug money" or "money laundering." That is a flaw requiring acquittal,  he said.  </P> <P> According to the defense lawyer, the FBI was required to say to Silberman, "  'This is drug money, this is criminality. Throw it all over, Silberman your  life is changed.' " Brosnahan added, "They had an obligation to do it, and they  did not do it."  </P> <P> Gorder, however, said that Ahearn made it clear the very first time he met  Silberman, at a Nov. 9, 1988, meeting at a San Diego hotel coffee shop, that  the money came from Colombian drug dealers. At various times over the next six  months, Ahearn reminded Silberman for whom he supposedly worked, Gorder said.  </P> <P> For instance, on Nov. 12, Ahearn said in a phone call to Silberman that "all  they know is the coke." In December, Ahearn referred to the "drug types."  </P> <P> In February, 1989, Ahearn said the "money came from a bunch of . . . Colombian  cocaine drug lords."  </P> <P> Gorder asked Friday, "How much more explicit do you have to get?"  </P> <P> As for Benjamin, Brosnahan said that it was an outrageous error for the FBI to  use him in the case. He contended that Benjamin, who was paid $124,558 by the  FBI during the investigation of Petti and Silberman -- largely for an  apartment, car and spending money -- had a financial motive to keep it going.  </P> <P> It was through Benjamin that Ahearn was introduced to Petti and, subsequently,  to Silberman.  </P> <P> Gorder replied that the only testimony that there had been threats came from  Silberman, who had every reason to make them up. Benjamin assuredly had a  criminal record, Gorder said. But, he asked, "Who else do you expect to be  hanging around with the likes of Chris Petti?"  </P> <P> "All this stuff" about Benjamin "is a distraction," Gorder said. "The real  question is whether (Silberman) is guilty -- not whether anyone in this  courtroom would go to dinner with Robert Benjamin."  </P> <P> The defense contends Silberman earned nothing in either of the two  transactions. But Gorder returned repeatedly to the notion that, if anyone had  a financial motivation to keep the deals going, it was Silberman.  </P> <P> Gorder detailed Friday how, in the first deal, $90,000 of the $100,000 was  wired in December, 1988, to a Hong Kong bank account -- that prosecutors  contend Silberman controlled -- and then to a Swiss bank.  </P> <P> Within a week of the time the cash reached Switzerland, two checks totaling  $80,000 were wired from the same Swiss bank to an investment account Silberman  maintained in New York, Gorder said.  </P> <P> "Now you know why (Silberman) was so eager to do another . . . stock deal,"  Gorder said.  </P> <P> The bond deal offered not an 80% rate of return, but one of only 4% to 6%,  Gorder said.  </P></p>

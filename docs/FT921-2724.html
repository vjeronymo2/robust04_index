			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Rising commissions bring surplus to Osaka exchange THE Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) announced yesterday it would distribute Y1.6bn to member-brokerages due to a surplus in revenues. The OSE projects a surplus for the year to end-March due to a rise in commission revenue from active trading in the Nikkei stock index futures and options. The surplus contrasts with a Y9.2bn deficit for the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), which has been hit by faltering trading volume on the cash stock market. The differences in revenue may increase pressure on the OSE to implement stricter rules on derivatives trading. Heavy activity on the OSE's derivative markets, which are based on the TSE's cash stock average, has been blamed for creating price volatility on underlying cash shares. The worried TSE raised margins on arbitrage trading between the futures and cash stock markets three times last year, and the OSE also announced plans to double commissions on futures and options trading. The OSE said it would refund members by reducing fixed-rate membership fees for cash stocks, and index futures and options trading by 25 per cent. For the current year, revenues are projected at Y20bn against expenses of Y19.9bn.</p>

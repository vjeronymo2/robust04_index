			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / London likely to bear brunt of today's rail strike London commuters prepared to bear the brunt of today's 24-hour rail strike as it emerged last night that the government was understood to have blocked a 5.7 per cent pay offer for the 4,600 signal staff at the centre of the dispute. Railtrack, which runs the network, is believed to have put forward the offer in talks with the RMT union earlier this week. But the company was later told by the Transport Department - backed by the Treasury - that the government would block any pay increase unless it was fully funded by productivity. The prospect of an above-inflation pay offer is said to have horrified ministers, and Railtrack was told to demonstrate that staff were still working in the public sector and must abide by government pay policy. Ministers decided to intervene after concluding that Railtrack's 'inexperienced' negotiators were likely to concede too much to the RMT in an attempt to keep the trains running. RMT leader Mr Jimmy Knapp last night accused Railtrack of 'reneging' on a 5.7 per cent pay offer. He had earlier suggested that the government may have been behind Railtrack withdrawing the offer and replacing it with one for 2.5 per cent. 'Railtrack have dealt a body blow to industrial relations and the integrity of the company is in tatters,' he said. Labour's transport spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, accused the government of 'gross irresponsibility' in 'sabotaging' the prospect of a settlement to the dispute. However, Mr Chris Leah, Railtrack's chief negotiator, denied that the company had offered 5.7 per cent. Railtrack added last night: 'This decision was taken by the board alone. We are a commercial company and we have to live with commercial realities.' In the Commons, Mr John Major condemned the strike and said extra parking would be made available in London. The Department of Transport said there would be 10,000 more spaces at locations such as Hyde Park and Regents Park. In spite of the strike, most of London's Underground system will be running. Police and motoring organisations advised people to share cars or stagger journeys. The London Weather Centre has forecast another sunny day today which could persuade people to stay away from work. Only 15 underground stations will be affected out of a total of 273. London Transport said there would be no Tube services on the northern stretch of the Bakerloo Line from Queens Park to Harrow and Wealdstone or in south London on the District Line between Turnham Green and Richmond and East Putney and Wimbledon. Out of London's two main airports, Gatwick is expected to be hit hardest, as its main service into the capital is a Railtrack line to Victoria. It is expecting 54,000 arrivals today, of which 24 per cent would normally travel on the Gatwick Express. Heathrow will be less affected as it is connected to London by underground. Today's strike is the first serious challenge to the new railway system which is being fashioned from the framework of British Rail.

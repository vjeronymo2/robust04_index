			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Kragujevac, Yugoslavia, June 26 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav  Vice-Premier Zeljko Simic on Sunday hoped that normalization of  relations between Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) and Croatia  would shortly be resumed.    Simic based his optimism on "the political reality that  relations between Belgrade and Zagreb will have the decisive  influence on the outcome of the crisis which is rocking the  lands of former Yugoslavia and the Balkans as a whole." He was  speaking for the local radio in Kragujevac, central Serbia.    "Therefore, I am not inclined to speak of a halt in the  normalization process, but rather of a lull which I expect will  be followed by progress in political dialogue which will reflect  positively on the Bosnian civil war," said Simic, who chairs the  Yugoslav Commission on Normalization of Relations between  Yugoslavia and Croatia.    Yugoslavia is ready to make the utmost contribution to  improving bilateral relations in accordance with the 1993 Geneva  Declaration, he added.    Speaking about the breakdown in talks on normalizing  economic  relations between the republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) and  Croatia, Simic said this was giving rise to apprehensions,  especially in view of extremely immoderate and war-mongering  statements by Croatian officials.    The R.S.K. was proclaimed in late 1991 by the local Serbs in  their ancestral lands within the arbitrary Communist-era borders  of Croatia in response to Croatia's violent secession form  former Yugoslavia and trampling on their rights.    The R.S.K. was placed under U.N. protection in early 1992,  which has, however, failed to deter Croatia from launching four  offensives on the territory, killing a thousand Serbs, mostly  civilians, in the process.    Simic said that a comprehensive settlement for the problems  between the R.S.K. and Croatia was possible only with full  respect for the political reality. The implementation of such a  settlement must be phased -- unconditional peace should be  established first, followed by the resumption of communications  and economic and other ties, with political normalisation coming  last, he explained.    He dismissed as unfounded the insistence of Croatian  officials that the key to the R.S.K.-Croatia problem lies in  Belgrade, and explained that Yugoslavia had been taking pains to  strengthen equality-based dialogue between the R.S.K. and  Croatia.    Simic denied allegations that he was to blame for the delay  in a meeting of Yugoslav and Croatian intellectuals in Belgrade.  Yugoslavia is a free, democratic country which guarantees full  safety and freedom of speech to all visitors, he stressed.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Bankers prepare to scrap the grouse shoot: Bronwen Maddox and David Wighton ask whether Warburg's strategy is to blame for its situation, or whether it reflects a downturn in investment banking fortunes Shares in UK investment banks slid this week after warnings from SG Warburg and Hambros Bank that first-half profits would be sharply lower. Wall Street is braced for US banks' third-quarter results to show sharp earnings falls. Warburg's rivals did their best this week to be discreet about taking pleasure in its discomfort. One leading London banker said: 'I don't want to be seen to criticise them, because it could be us next.' That question - whether the UK's biggest investment bank is simply the first of the pack to acknowledge the impact of difficult conditions - is at the forefront of bankers' minds. This week's announcements startled the markets because they came just months after City and Wall Street houses doled out glittering bonuses. After years of belt-tightening bankers as well as proprietors of wine bars, estate agents for the most fashionable parts of London and Manhattan, and even the sporting agents for grouse shooting in Scotland had started to believe the good times were back. They are not the only ones concerned about the prospect of another lean period. Banking regulators have been casting an increasingly sharp eye on banks' exposure to risky activities. A new directive on capital adequacy - the amount of capital banks are required to have in proportion to their level of activity - has emerged from Brussels. In the US the Federal Reserve is considering if banks' exposure to some of the riskiest financial instruments should be more tightly monitored. In Warburg's case it is clear that some of the disappointment stems from its own circumstances. To a much greater degree than its UK rivals, it has modelled itself for the past seven years on the US integrated investment banks, offering a range of trading services as well as fee-based advice to its clients. Its ambitious expansion, particularly into the US, has pushed up costs, but revenues in some regions have followed more slowly. While it has established a strong reputation for research and equity sales on Wall Street, particularly for selling non-US stocks to US investment houses, it has found it much harder to peel prized corporate clients away from the blue-chip US houses. One Wall Street observer from a rival house attributed this to Warburg's 'British, gentlemanly' approach, although Mr Nick Verey, chairman of Warburg Securities, retorted that the US operations are staffed mainly by Americans. He said rising costs played only a small part in the half-year downturn, and instead blamed most of the fall on the turbulence in world bond markets since the Federal Reserve began to raise US interest rates on February 4. Some observers believe Warburg may have suffered from its relative inexperience in large-scale trading. Mr Martin Hughes, banking analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said: 'I think we will see that the banks that are losing money are those that are less familiar with risk control methods.' That is an argument which Mr Verey rejected. 'It is not the case that we have lost large sums on trades, just that we have not been making enough profit.' He added that he was satisfied with the risk-management systems on which the bank spent millions of pounds a year. His argument that Warburg's troubles reflect a wider phenomenon is borne out by Hambros' report of a deterioration in profits in bond trading during the first half. Analysts expect that other UK investment banks which have traded on a smaller scale than Warburg, such as Kleinwort Benson, will have suffered correspondingly less. The pattern is repeated in the US, where the biggest traders have suffered most. Goldman Sachs' profits are believed to have fallen from Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 750m) to Dollars 446m in the six months to May 27 because of a fall in bond trading income. First-half net profits fell 44 per cent at Morgan Stanley, 28 per cent at Bankers Trust and 19 per cent at J P Morgan. Salomon Brothers recorded a first-half loss of Dollars 138m. At first glance many of these banks appear to have suffered less than Warburg, even though they are larger traders. Nor do they enjoy as healthy an injection of profits from asset management as Warburg does. Timing is partly to blame, however. Most US banks have so far reported only on profits up to June, whereas Warburg's warning covered July, August and September, when trading volumes shrivelled. Analysts fear that third-quarter results from US banks, just starting to trickle out, will show a further plunge. This week Salomon announced that its third quarter would show an after-tax loss of Dollars 100m, and last month Lehman Brothers, which announced that it was cutting free lunches for its staff, saw third-quarter profits plunge 80 per cent to just Dollars 22m. As many bankers stressed this week, trading is risky. Mr Verey said: 'There is no perfect hedge against the risk - you have to take a risk to earn a return.' In spite of this collective suffering, however, there are no signs that leading integrated investment banks intend to rethink their strategy and reduce their exposure to trading. They still hold to the principle that they need a strong trading presence in order to compete for higher-margin business of underwriting, placing blocks of securities, and giving corporate advice. But competition for big international corporate clients is increasing, as demonstrated by the current scramble for a share of the partial-privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the telecommunications giant. The result, one leading London banker said this week, was that investment banking would become an ever more volatile business, in which banks would be forced into increasingly risky activities, such as trading in derivatives. That trend could deal a powerful advantage to the largest banks, which are better able to withstand the markets' volatility. Analysts warn that it could also put severe pressure on the smaller ones, such as Warburg. Mr David Poutney, banking analyst at brokers Collins Stewart said: 'They (Warburg's) are just going to get killed in the US every time.' Although Mr Simon Leathes, Warburg group finance director, said that the bank was not constrained by lack of capital, it is clearly dwarfed by its US rivals. As the biggest of the UK merchant banks it has shareholders' funds of Pounds 1bn and total capital resources of Pounds 1.5bn. However, Morgan Stanley, Salomon and Bankers Trust are about three times the size while J P Morgan's shareholders' funds are six times bigger. Analysts predict that questions of capitalisation may eventually force some banks to merge and others to withdraw from the most competitive sectors. But for the moment radical strategic changes are unlikely. Mr Leathes said: 'You do not tear up the script after a few difficult months.' Some smaller tweaks to strategy can be expected. Warburg itself will look harder at whether some advisory work should be subcontracted to law firms, and at whether competing for small company business is worthwhile. For Goldman's part, its senior partner elect, Mr Jon Corzine, said recently: 'There are lessons to be learned. You get overly optimistic in the bountiful environment of bull markets. It was very easy in 1993 to think you ought to have a presence in every capital market in every major country in the world.' Some bankers are also reconciled to the prospect of job cuts. Mr Verey, who has announced a hiring freeze at Warburg, said: 'We will look to see whether people need to be replaced when they leave.' But in spite of these adjustments the message from both sides of the Atlantic at the end of a sobering week was that the markets should not have been surprised by the news. When markets are tough, banks will suffer. In the course of economic cycles their profits will fluctuate. The markets may have forgotten those facts in the heady atmosphere of last year, but this week's news was a reminder that the path trodden by the world's sleek-suited cohorts of investment bankers can be a rough one.</p>

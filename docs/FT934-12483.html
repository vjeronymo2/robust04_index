			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dixons rallies In a strong stores sector, Dixons recovered from Friday's weak session as the market digested an analysts visit to the electrical retailer's South Wales operations. The stock had been rocked on Friday by revelations that Tandy Corp, of the US, planned to take on Dixons' PC World stores, with plans to open on several sites in the UK. However, analysts said yesterday that Dixons' management made light of the threat, advancing its own expansion plans and also telling analysts that the Pounds 3.5bn UK PC market was likely to see a huge leap in retail margins as its out-of-town computer store concept increased market share. Dixons added 2 1/2 at 279p. There was some talk that Dixons was eyeing some of the sites being earmarked for disposal by Do It All, the loss-making home improvement venture of WH Smith and Boots. Do It All is also said to be negotiating with other electrical retailers besides Dixons to share floor space in some unprofitable sites. WH Smith 'A' rose 8 to 487p and Boots 2 to 517p. Some nervousness set in around Wellcome ahead of its results on Thursday and the shares slipped 11 1/2 to 834p. The stock was not helped by the advice of Nomura to switch from Wellcome into SmithKline Beecham, but the latter also had a poor day, falling 8 to 440p. Glaxo lost 1 1/2 to 714p, holding a little resilience with Swedish and Canadian approval for two of its drugs. EC approval of Amersham International's heart imaging agent Myoview put vigour into its shares, which advanced 25 to 906p. The decision by the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products came a little earlier than expected, although the approval was anticipated. That, coupled with a tight stock, sent the price climbing. Further movements in the break-up of British Gas were partly behind the high activity in the stock. While it was reported that the government may move more quickly to end the gas monopoly, there is also a belief that there may be less pressure for a proposed break-up of the company. In volume of 14m the shares edged ahead a half-penny to 347p. Profit-takers continued to dog Enterprise Oil, which fell 12 to 481p, while Pittencrieff, still enjoying buoyancy from its telecommunications interests, moved up 9 to 381p. International conglomerate Hanson shed 3 to 270p in average trading of 4.5m after US investment bank Goldman Sachs downgraded profits expectations. Goldman now expects profits for the year to September 1993 will be Pounds 20m lower than its previous forecast at Pounds 1.04bn. A more substantial downgrading was made to the current year's figure, reducing it by Pounds 80m to Pounds 1.275bn. Mr Jack Kelly at Goldman Sachs in New York also believes Hanson may dispose of assets in both the UK and US in the next few months. He said: 'The closing of the Quantum deal and its associated debt of Pounds 1.66bn will encourage management to trim its non-core businesses.' Among financials, National Westminster Bank relinquished 12 1/2 to 572 1/2 p, with James Capel and Kleinwort Benson said to be negative on the stock. Royal Bank of Scotland eased 2 to 359p after stating that its US subsidiary is to acquire Boston-based New World Bancorp for Dollars 144.3m. Profit-taking marked the day's performance among composite insurers. Royal Insurance receded 7 to 319p, while Guardian Royal Exchange eased 5 to 219p. The consolidation of its television interests excited interest in Pearson and there was strong trade of 1.5m shares, considerably above average for the stock. The price edged up a penny to 570p. Yield factors were said to have proved the attraction in United Newspapers, which moved forward 3 to 557p. A lower than expected dividend and a cautious interim results statement from business services group BET saw the shares retreat 8 to 128 1/2 p. Profits improved 24 per cent to Pounds 46.1m, in line with expectations, but the dividend was halved to 1p, against predictions of a figure around 1.25p. Volume was 4.9m at the close. Investors remained unimpressed by the boardroom squabble at international trading group Lonrho and the shares eased 2 1/2 to 128p. Tobacco and financial services group BAT Industries, up 4 at 490p, was in demand ahead of next week's third-quarter figures. Inchcape tumbled 13 to 505p after Robert Fleming downgraded profits estimates and reiterated its sell recomm-endation to investors. The broker shaved its current year estimate by Pounds 8m to Pounds 270m, to take account of a 'shift in currencies'. The news that troubled container leasing group Tiphook was splitting the role of chairman and chief executive and that it had won approval for a higher borrowing limit cheered the market. The shares strengthened 11 to 127p. The appointment of Mr Roberto Quarto as the new chief executive of BBA was well received by the market and the shares advanced 9 to 167p. Mr Quarto is currently a director at BTR and his departure from the international conglomerate saw its shares dip 2 to 373 1/2 p. In a quiet leisure sector, catering outfit Compass Group was helped by a positive note from NatWest Securities. The shares added 6 at 564p. Second line stores stocks showed gains. Alexon put on 3 at 73p, Country Casuals 2 at 173p, Moss Brothers - reporting figures yesterday - 7 at 245p and Stylo 5 at 210p.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Head of US mint faces FBI probe THE US treasurer, the official heading the Bureau of the Mint, is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on charges of influence peddling and accepting payment from her former employer after taking up her government post. Ms Catalina Vasquez Villalpando, appointed treasurer by President George Bush in 1989, was placed on administrative leave, the Treasury said. Her signature appears on US dollar bills alongside that of Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. Her only other appearance in the limelight was at the Republican convention in August, when she had to apologise for calling Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, a 'skirt-chaser'. The investigation is the latest in a series of increasingly bizarre probes and counterprobes involving the FBI. It is investigating the Justice Department's handling of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro prosecution in Atlanta, and also recently mounted a operation to see if the head of the Bush re-election campaign in Texas would sign up for a wiretap on the telephones of independent presidential candidate Ross Perot. At the same time, Mr William Sessions, director of the FBI, is himself under investigation by the Justice Department for possible ethics violations. The FBI said its agents two days ago carried out searches in the Washington area and in Georgia in connection with the Villalpandoinvestigation. It said the raids were conducted to look for evidence of fraud, bribery of public officials, racketeering, conspiracy, conspiracy to defraud the government, fraudulent claims and false statements. Affidavits in support of the search warrants and detailing the alleged criminal activity have been sealed by federal courts, the FBI said, preventing public disclosure.</p>

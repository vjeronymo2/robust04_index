			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> You can't pull the wool over Bob Barker's eyes. When the longtime host of "The  Price Is Right" was asked to make promotional spots with Vanna White in  connection with "Wheel of Fortune's" upcoming daytime move from NBC to CBS, he  initially declined. Barker, a staunch animal rights activist, remembered that  White has been photographed wearing fur coats and that "Wheel" has given fur  coats as prizes. "CBS knows how I feel about furs," Barker said Thursday,  explaining that he finally agreed to do the promos after the network assured  him that there will be no more fur coats on the daytime "Wheel of Fortune."  Added Barker: "There is no reason for a woman to wear a fur coat. The only  reason she does is to demonstrate her affluence. She can just pin money to a  cloth coat and accomplish the same thing." "Wheel" moves to CBS on July 17 and  will be the lead-in show for "Price Is Right." ALEENE MACMINN  </P></p>

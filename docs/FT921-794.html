			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Pittard Garnar progress continues with Pounds 2.1m PITTARD GARNAR, the leather company, continued its progress in the second half and reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.1m for the year to December 31. This compared with losses of Pounds 5.75m last time and with profits of Pounds 1.04m at the interim stage. Mr David Macdonald, chairman, said the advance had been achieved in a worsening market, and against this background the outcome could be regarded as reasonably creditable. Turnover declined by 23 per cent, from Pounds 128.3m to Pounds 98m. The reduction in sales volumes reflected poor retail demand in the US and UK, coupled with the imposition by the company of tight credit controls. Sales in the gloving division were maintained throughout the year, though margins were somewhat lower, he said. The clothing and chamois division had another extremely difficult year. By contrast, the shoe and leather goods side showed a modest improvement. After continuing losses at the Odell Wilson &amp; Tilt tannery, the company decided to withdraw from this business, and Pounds 1.5m of this year's extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.8m represented a provision for the costs of this withdrawal. However, Mr Macdonald added, borrowings had been reduced to Pounds 17.4m at the year end, cutting gearing by 12 percentage points to 55 per cent. The net interest charge fell from Pounds 4.79m to Pounds 2.2m. Earnings per share came out at 6.4p (25.3p losses) and the company is returning to the dividend list with a proposed 1.5p final.</p>

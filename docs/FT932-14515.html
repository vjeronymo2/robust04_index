			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Spotlight on LA's social problems after King trial: Fears of riots abate as two policemen are found guilty and two acquitted of beating a black motorist LOS ANGELES is looking hard at its social problems after the verdicts in the Rodney King case brought some relief to the city's tension and lessened, at least for the time being, its fear of new riots. Politicians welcomed the peaceful end to the federal court trial, in which a jury found two policemen guilty and acquitted two others of violating the rights of Mr King, a black motorist, whose beating by officers was videotaped and shown on television. Appealing for action on the city's problems, the Rev Jesse Jackson, the black leader, said the real question was not how to relieve fears but how to raise people's hopes. 'Hopes come in the form of jobs, and health care and education and justice,' he said. 'If we can have a plan to rebuild Russia, it is time to have a plan to rebuild Los Angeles.' Some 40,000-50,000 people were left unemployed by last year's riots, sparked off when the four police officers were acquitted in a state court. 'Hundreds and hundreds of small latino and black-owned businesses remain nothing but ashes and ruins,' said Mr Fernando Oaxaca of the Latino Coalition for a New LA. Police blanketed city streets yesterday to guard against trouble as defence lawyers charged that the two officers convicted were sacrificed to prevent rioting. The jury found Sergeant Stacey Koon, who directed Mr King's beating, and Officer Laurence Powell, who delivered most of the baton blows, guilty. Their lawyers claimed they were convicted because jurors feared acquitting them would plunge the city into another wave of violence. However, a juror, who was not identified, denied on television that this had played any part in their deliberations. In the event, no riots occurred. But many fear that unless social problems are tackled they will lead to new violence - perhaps this year when an appeal by the convicted officers is heard or when black youths face trial over the beating of a truck driver during last year's riots, in which 53 people died and nearly Dollars 1bn in damage was caused. LA voters will go to the polls tomorrow to elect a new mayor to replace Mr Tom Bradley, who is retiring after 20 years in office. Also on tomorrow's ballots is a measure that would raise property taxes to pay for 1,000 additional police officers. However, the turnout is expected to be extremely low, with the election all but eclipsed by the trial. Two dozen candidates are registered, and a run-off vote in June is likely. President Bill Clinton, speaking in Pittsburgh, praised the verdicts of the federal court jury, saying they 'confirmed what many felt in their hearts'. At the First African Methodist Episcopal Church, a rallying point for the black community in Los Angeles since the riots, Reverend Cecil Murray concluded: 'We are not going to have peace at last, but peace for the moment.'</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / A bloody battle that leaves few traces: Hugh Dickinson, the Dean of Salisbury, says that science cuts itself off from the more profound questions that religion, at its best, seeks to address IN HIS article on page I, AC Grayling strives to draw our attention to a dastardly attack on the holy citadel of science by the evil forces of religion. But it is an interesting exercise to swap 'religion' for 'science' throughout his article and see how much sense it might make. I read it with great interest, having just returned from a library where I had been searching for a book in a section listed as 'religion and science' and containing several hundred titles. There was no blood dripping from the shelves. Most of them are thoughtful and reflective dialogues between highly intelligent scholars, philosophers, scientists and theologians. Of Grayling's bloody battle, there is little trace. What is going on? I am not so concerned about the present state of play between scientists and theologians or philosophers. I am intrigued to know what is going on when such passion erupts suddenly to paint a picture of heightened drama worthy of Goya himself. Some years ago, Liam Hudson suggested in Contrary Imaginations that the human imagination can be divided broadly into two distinct types, convergent and divergent. Convergers tend to see things in black and white. They are either/or people and believe there is One Right Answer. They get things done, looking neither to right nor left. They analyse, sort and list. Divergers tend to be lateral thinkers. They make connections, thrive on metaphor, are tolerant of ambiguity and tend to see things in shades of grey. They invent but cannot finish the washing-up. Fundamentalism is convergence driven by passion. It is a highly effective weapon, as Mrs Thatcher and the Ayatollah Khomeini both demonstrated so ably. Driven by passion, it trips over into fanaticism and become an ideology. Soon, the ideological map becomes more important than the actual terrain. Reality is distorted or simplified by theory. Mercator's Projection flattens out a three-dimensional globe on to a two-dimensional page and then, at the top and the bottom of the old atlas, the Arctic and Antarctic were rent asunder. What is the passion which drives the ideological cartographer of human knowledge, the human mind? Marxism, monetarism, religious fundamentalism (Islam or Christian) and scientism all are driven by passions which can be just as destructive as Grayling suggests. Religious fanaticism has done some dreadful things. Worshippers of the absolute tend to adopt absolutist positions towards their opponent (yes, there are always enemies]) and favour absolute solutions, including burning heretics and anathematising unwelcome truths. I can only concur with Grayling's detestation of such attitudes and actions. But distortion or over-simplification seems to be creeping in when he proceeds to dump all the values created and fostered, at least in Europe, by the Christian faith into the same cesspit with the ayatollahs. He accepts that science has not always been the friend of our race. But that, he claims, is not the fault of scientists, but of the baser race of politicians and merchants who have misused it or sold it for 30 pieces of silver. Science's reductionist and dehumanising attitudes to human values and other modes of knowledge are not the responsibility of scientists, of course - but of scientism, for which science has no responsibility. But swap 'science' for 'religion' and a mirror image of the same defence appears immediately. Religion is not to blame - it is those mad fanatics. Either way, I am inclined to think there is no such thing as religion or science. Science is what scientists hold provisionally to be true as a community; it is what they write and the disciplines of their art. It can go grotesquely astray - witness the sorry history of plate tectonics between 1900 and 1960. But scientists, like theologians, are men and women, many of them deeply religious and finding deep religious significance in their scientific work. Professor John Polkinghorne is not a solitary swallow but, if the bookshelf is any evidence of recent trends, one of an increasing flock of highly intelligent men and women who migrate easily across two hemispheres which make a single globe. They resist its polarisation into hostile camps. Fundamentalism is, essentially, paranoid. It thrives on the fear that there are Enemies Out There bent on destroying the Holy of Holies. In the heyday of its imperial glory, Islam was far more tolerant than its beleaguered people can bear to be today. It seems strange that some scientists should be feeling like that, too. I have acknowledged the shameful pages of Christian history but, for all that, I cannot abandon the moral and spiritual profundities of this faith which address the motivations of the human heart in a way that science never can. If scientific knowledge has been misused to poison the ecosphere and massacre large chunks of the human race, is the remedy more likely to be found with Francis or Schweitzer, with Bishop Tutu and Martin Luther King, with Gandhi and Jesus - or with the Cavendish Laboratory or MIT? In its aggressively materialist mode, science cuts itself off from what Polanyi urged so eloquently upon it: the acceptance and valuing of personal, moral and spiritual knowledge as essential parts of our humanity. I am deeply grateful for my microwave oven and for penicillin, without which I would not be alive; but even if Stephen Hawking, the Cambridge physicist, comes up with a Big Toe (Theory of Everything), it would not answer those more profound questions about the Mysterium Tremendum which religion, at its best, seeks to address.</p>

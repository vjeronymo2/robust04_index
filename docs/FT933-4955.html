			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / California plans earlier primary ballots CALIFORNIA plans to hold its presidential primary ballot earlier in the year, heralding a profound change in the shape of future US elections. The state senate last week voted for a bill that would move the primary to March from June, and both the assembly and Governor Pete Wilson are expected to give their approval this week. Although by far the most populous state, California has had relatively little impact on the selection of presidential candidates in recent years, because its primary has been one of the last to take place, usually after each party already has a clear winner. 'The truth is California has essentially been left out of the presidential nominating process since 1972. It's the biggest, most diverse and arguably the most important state, and it would certainly diminish anything else happening in March,' said Mr Bill Carrick, a Democratic political strategist who has worked on both presidential and Californian campaigns. The March 26 date chosen for 1996 would probably still put California's primary later than the Super Tuesday cluster of southern states, and later than Illinois and Michigan, but before several important states such as New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio. 'Two weeks after Super Tuesday and one week before New York - it'll be big,' said one California state Republican party official. Mr Bob Mulholland, of the state Democratic party, believes other states will follow California's lead and hold their primaries earlier, effectively compressing the entire nominating process into three months. 'If in 1996 we have a primary season running from February to early April, I think that's good for everybody, and especially the contributors,' he said.</p>

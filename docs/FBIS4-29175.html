			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 16 Jun Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] One of the sanctions against the DPRK (North Korea)  for its suspected nuclear arms development is to suspend  remittance. Concerning this measure, a government source stated  on the evening of 15 June: "According to the Finance Ministry,  it will be difficult to take this measures without a UN  resolution. In saying it is difficult, the ministry means such  a measure cannot be taken."    It is speculated that in the Foreign Exchange and Foreign  Trade Control Law that restrictions can be imposed on payment  "for the purpose of faithfully fulfilling international treaties  that our country has concluded or other international  commitments." According to the same source, the judgment seems  to indicate that a UN resolution can be taken as an  "international commitment" but this regulation cannot be applied  to "multilateral-type" sanctions.</p>

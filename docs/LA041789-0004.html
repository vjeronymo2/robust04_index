			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A strike of supermarket workers in Northern California still is possible,  despite a settlement between management and a big Sacramento local, union  leaders say. Phil Tucker, a spokesman for 11 locals of the United Food and  Commercial Workers Union in the Bay Area and in the Central Valley, said:  "We're no closer to a contract than we were a week ago. There is a negotiated  settlement that is going to be recommended to the Sacramento membership, but  there are still 30,000 workers who could go out on strike if we don't reach a  settlement." Local 588, representing about 9,700 workers, reached a tentative  agreement with management, calling for wage increases, bonuses for all  employees and increased benefits. President Jack Loveall was cautiously  optimistic that Local 588's pact would serve as a model for other UFCW  negotiations. But Tucker said, "We still have many hurdles to overcome."  </P></p>

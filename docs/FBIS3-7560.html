			<p>Article   Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan and the United States Should Strengthen </F> Cooperative Relations From a Global Viewpoint"]    [Text] Serious economic friction is increasing mutual  distrust between Japan and the United States. Washington  asserts that "Japan does not take actions unless external  pressure is applied," while Tokyo retorts that "the U.S. method  of seeking concessions with a threat of sanctions is  unacceptable."    Intensifying friction between Japan and the United States,  two economic giants in the world, is not good for the growth of  the world economy. Japan should propose concrete market-opening  measures in trade negotiations with the United States.  Meanwhile, the U.S. policy of seeking "results-oriented"  economic goals is not advantageous to future relations. The two  countries will be able to cooperate in areas of common interest  and expand scope of cooperation.    Since he took office, U.S. President Bill Clinton has listed  the reconstruction of the U.S. economy as his top priority task.  In accordance with this policy, the United States has taken a  hardline stand in negotiations with Japan. After the breakdown  of the Japan-U.S. summit in February, Washington reinstated the  Super 301 provision of the trade act (which outlines steps for  retaliation against trade partners' unfair practices). The  United States reinstated the provision apparently because it  thought Super 301 was "an effective tool" to press Japan to open  its market wider.    However, some Americans say there are problems with the  Clinton administration's policy toward Japan. They say that  there are some U.S. Government officials and negotiators who  "regard Japan as a peculiar country" and assert that a hardline  policy toward Japan is effective. They also point out that the  administration's decisionmaking process toward Japan is not  transparent.    Glen Fukushima, formerly in charge of Japanese affairs in  the  Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, said: "The U.S.  administration does not have a clear, consistent, and harmonious  trade policy toward Japan."    The Clinton administration weighs economic interests heavily  in its policy toward Japan and in its Asia policy. But some  Asian countries are concerned about U.S. ways of handling trade  and human rights issues.    With midterm elections set for this autumn, Clinton is  expected to continue a policy that emphasizes economic  interests. However, the U.S. "results-oriented" approach of  seeking concessions from its trading partners could prove  disadvantageous in the long run.    Of course, Japan needs to reflect on its passive response  and  delays in decisionmaking that eventually resulted in criticism  from trading partners. The European Union and Asian countries  are critical of the reinstatement of the Super 301 clause. But  at the same time, they urge Japan to open its market wider.  French Industry Minister Gerard Longuet said: "Japan's huge  current- account and trade surplus poses a problem for the  entire world."    To ease trade friction with the United States, Japan is  urged  to open its market wider and take measures to increase domestic  demand. At the same time, it is necessary for both countries to  expand the scope of cooperation in tackling various issues of  common interest in the Asia-Pacific region and the world.    In cooperation with the United States, Japan can play a  greater role in promoting political and economic cooperation and  establishing a relationship of trust in the Asia-Pacific region.  Japan and the United States are currently cooperating in  tackling global issues such as the environment and  overpopulation and yielding desired results.    Now is the time for both countries to strengthen their  cooperative relations from a global viewpoint to reinvigorate  the world economy and stabilize the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

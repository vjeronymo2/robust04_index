			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (34): Those barefoot millionaires - Third World The Third World of soccer is not the same as the economic Third World. Football's backward nations include prosperous Japan, while impoverished Latin America joins wealthy Europe among the game's aristocrats, writes Emmanuel Maradas Nowhere will the unfolding drama in the US be followed more closely than in football's Third World, where whole countries will grind to a halt to follow the national team's fortunes in Dallas, San Francisco or New York. In reality, there are two football Third Worlds. The first is the economic Third World, embracing the city slums of Latin America, Africa and the Far East. The symbolic power of possibly the world's greatest ever footballer, Brazil's Pele, resides not so much in his skills on the pitch, however startling, as in his rise from favela to international stage. In nations such as Cameroon, football excellence is a chance to forget the misery of everyday existence and assert a presence on the world stage. Look at us,' such countries say. We can barely afford to eat, but in one area at least, we are better than the richest of you.' Hence too, the palpable sense of brotherhood across national boundaries. All Africa supported Cameroon during the 1990 World Cup in Italy; if the African sides are knocked out, their loyalty will always go to Brazil, Colombia or Argentina, rather than Germany or Italy. For individual players, who for the most part learned their football barefoot in the empty lots of Third World cities, soccer offers one of the few escape routes - barring a life of crime - from a life of drudgery. The golden window opens for only a very few, but those who squeeze through it to a life as professional players in Europe or elsewhere return home as heroes, educate their children and live in a style unattainable by any other means. So much for the economic Third World. On the pitch, economics are tipped partly on their heads. Here, Latin America stands alongside Europe among the elite, while the Third World embraces the rising football continents of Africa and Asia. In this topsy-turvy world, economic superstars Japan and South Korea, where football is still finding its feet, in many ways have more in common with Morocco, Cameroon or Nigeria than with the rich nations of the West. In world football politics, Asia and Africa almost invariably vote as a bloc, struggling to make their voices heard against the European and Latin American barons. Africa fought long and hard to win its third place in the World Cup finals; Asia is still trying to catch up. Europe dominates, with 13 of the 24 teams in contention in the US, and retains its stranglehold over decisions shaping the future of the world game. Will the Africans and Asians make an impact in the US? This will be the the first World Cup in which Africa has had three representatives, thanks mainly to Cameroon's brilliant showing in Italy four years ago. Asia keeps its two places, filled by newcomers Saudi Arabia and third-time qualifiers South Korea. In Africa, standards have improved massively since Morocco became the continent's first regular participant in the finals in 1970, and Zaire were humiliated 9-0 by Yugoslavia four years later. The continent already sets the standard at junior and youth levels: together, Nigeria and Ghana have won three out of the five Under-17 world championships held under Fifa auspices and come second twice; the same two countries respectively took silver at Under-20 level in 1989 and 1993. Many of the youngsters given international exposure at this level have gone on to successful careers in the European professional game, gaining a depth of experience which means they can face the best of Europe and Latin America on equal terms. Locally-based players continue to lag behind. In few African countries do they receive a regular salary; many national stadiums would be a disgrace to an English third division club, and physiotherapy and training facilities are almost non-existent. All three African squads for the US are thus built around a core of overseas-based professionals. In Asia, the equation is reversed. Local championships in countries such as Japan and Saudi Arabia are awash with money and the facilities are as good as anywhere in the world. As a result, there is little incentive for Asian professionals to look abroad. Add the fact that Asian players are generally not as robust or as skilful as the Africans, and it is not surprising that the world's most populous continent has so far made such a feeble impact on global football. All that could yet change as China, the sleeping giant of world soccer, finally awakes under a plan launched last year to develop the sport from school level upwards. In the meantime, however, Saudi Arabia and South Korea seem cast in the role of also-rans in the US. The Saudis, in Group F, will do well to snatch a single point against Belgium, Netherlands and Morocco. Group C, meanwhile, sees the Koreans lined up against reigning champions Germany, as well as strong sides from Spain and Bolivia. The Africans, on the other hand, have high expectations of USA 1994. All three have taken their preparations much more seriously than before, taking part in a merry-go-round of friendlies across the globe. Nigeria's Super Eagles, fresh from their victory in the African championships in Tunisia this April, boast an attacking combination to put fear into any opponent. Cameroon have appalling money troubles, and the administrators have probably spent twice as much energy squabbling among themselves over the past year as preparing for the tournament. But nobody will underestimate the Indomitable Lions' potential to cause havoc, and they - like Morocco - have a good deal of national pride at stake. As to Latin America, might 1994 be Brazil's year? The green-and-golds have never missed a World Cup finals, and after a decade in the wilderness they might just be in shape to regain their place at the summit of the world game. Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Bolivia will also be there, banging at the door. Barring miracles from the African and Asian sides, the Third World will be rooting for a Brazilian victory. The day that Romario, Rai, Jorginho and colleagues hold up the World Cup trophy, it will be the proof that every child, whatever the continent, can rise out of the dust and make his mark on the world.

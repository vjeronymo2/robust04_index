			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Property company sues council SLOUGH Estates, the property company that owns the Howard shopping centre in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, is suing Welwyn Hatfield Council for more than Pounds 20m, The dispute involves the Gallerias, a rival shopping centre at Hatfield. The council said it would vigorously defend the action. Slough says that in 1987 the council deliberately concealed plans to relax restrictions on the type of tenants at the Gallerias. This complex was originally intended to be a specialist leisure centre, with no fashion, convenience or food shops, but the developer persuaded the council to allow it greater flexibility. Slough says it would not have built the Howard centre if it had known the Gallerias would be able to attract similar tenants. The Gallerias went into receivership last September.</p>

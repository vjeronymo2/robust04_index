			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / International Company News: Investors to put Dollars 350m into Continental Air A BANKRUPTCY court hearing has been set for July 22, at which a proposal from an investor group, headed by Charles Hurwitz, to invest Dollars 350m in Continental Airlines, when the carrier emerges from bankruptcy, will be considered. The proposal would give the investor group a 72 per cent equity stake in return for the capital infusion. Mr Hurwitz heads Maxxam group, a Houston-based company which acquired a range of industrial interests with the help of junk bond financing in the 1980s. The proposal to help finance a reorganisation of the heavily-indebted airline is being made in conjunction with Kidder, Peabody, the Wall Street investment bank, and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the New York brokerage. The Hurwitz proposal has the backing of Continental's creditors committee, but must still overcome various other hurdles. It could be topped by better bids - Continental has had talks with numerous US and foreign airlines in recent months - and requires bankruptcy court approval. Continental must also resolve difficulties with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency which has argued that Continental is responsible for Dollars 700m of unfunded pension liabilities at Eastern Airlines. Eastern, now defunct, was Continental's sister airline, both being previously owned by Mr Frank Lorenzo. Continental sought bankruptcy protection in late-1990, and filed a reorganisation plan earlier this year.</p>

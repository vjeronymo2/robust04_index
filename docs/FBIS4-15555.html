			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 11 TASS -- Fighters of the Russian  airforce forced to land an Israeli "Gulfstream-159" plane flying  from Tbilisi, Georgia, to Tel Aviv after it had violated the  rules of crossing the Russian border and using the national  airspace, spokesman of the Russian Air Defence Leonid Shirobokov  told TASS on Monday.    The incident occurred on Saturday when the plane entered the  Russian airspace to the south-east of the city of Mineralnye  Vody without a preliminary request and permission from  authorities.    The plane ignored the demands of Russian authorities to  return back to the airport of departure and continued the  flight. Russian airforce fighters then intercepted the plane  and forced it to land in Adler, the airport of Sochi.</p>

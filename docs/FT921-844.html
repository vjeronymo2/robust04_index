			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Electronics companies deny infringement of US patents JAPANESE electronics companies yesterday denied they had violated patents related to charge coupled devices - a basic component of video cameras and photocopy machines - held by Loral Fairchild, subsidiary of the US defence electronics company Loral. Loral has brought a suit in the US against a range of Japanese and Korean companies, including market leaders such as Sony, Matsushita and Canon, over alleged patent infringements. Loral is claiming billions of dollars in damages. Charge coupled devices (CCDs) are electronic eyes that sense visual images and translate them into electronic signals. The suit is reminiscent of a recent action by Honeywell of the US against Minolta, the camera-maker, over auto-focus cameras which led to an out-of-court settlement for Dollars 127.5m after the court ruled against Minolta. Honeywell has also filed suits against other camera makers. The Japanese companies appeared unclear yesterday precisely why Loral Fairchild believed its patents had been infringed. They said the technology for CCDs was based on licences from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, and said they had no case to answer.</p>

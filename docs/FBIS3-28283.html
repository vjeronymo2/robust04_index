			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] ASAHI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide telephone  poll on 30 and 31 January on the public's attitude toward the  enactment of the political reform bills and future directions of  party regrouping. As a result, 57 percent said the political  reform package is "no good" on the point that it failed in  ruling out the business sector's political donations to  individual politicians while 66 percent welcomed the enactment  of the reform package as a whole. Nevertheless, only 23 percent  said "the Japanese politics will be made better by the package,"  and 63 percent said "no change will happen." The majority said  the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] "had better break up," and 59 percent  think moves toward further regrouping of political circles "will  be accelerated." The support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet was  74 percent.    The telephone survey was conducted immediately after the  enactment of the political bills at the last moment of the  extraordinary Diet session which closed on 29 January. ASAHI  SHIMBUN interviewed 2,000 eligible voters all over the country,  and obtained responses from 56 percent of them.    On the fact that the reform bills did not prohibit the  business sector's donations to individual politicians, only 25  percent showed positive responses to that. Even among the  pro-LDP group, 49 percent were against such donations, compared  with 39-percent support for the practice.    Regarding the new election system for the lower house, 39  percent said the system which gives 300 seats to single-seat  constituencies and 200 to proportional representation  constituencies is "favorable," and 23 percent said it is  "unfavorable." It appeared many voters cannot judge whether the  new election system is good or bad, as 38 percent gave no answer  or said they do not know.    Differing opinions were also seen in a question asking if  the  respondent thinks politics would become less expensive under the  new election system. In response to the question, 36 percent  said "politics would become less expensive," 36 percent said  "politics would become more expensive," and 30 percent were in  the "other answers or no answer" category.    When asked if the political reform package is valuable as a  whole, 5 percent said "very valuable," 61 percent said  "valuable," 21 percent said "not very valuable," and 4 percent  said "valueless." As a result, 66 percent showed positive  responses toward the package, while 25 percent were against it.    Nevertheless, only 23 percent said Japanese politics would  "become better" under the new political system. It appears the  public is showing favorable responses to the Diet decision on  political reform, but is coolly watching future development.    In connection with the LDP's and the SDPJ's internal  struggles over the political reform issue, 51 percent said "the  LDP had better break up," and 56 percent said "the SDPJ had  better break up." While only 25 percent of the pro-LDP group  called for the LDP breakup, 41 percent of the SDPJ supporters  called for a breakup of the party.    The degree of expectations for future regrouping of  political  parties varies depending on the respondents' political stances.  The percentage of those who answered party regrouping would be  "further accelerated" was around 50 percent among the LDP and  SDPJ supporters, but the number exceeded 70 percent among  Komeito and Shinsento [Japan Renewal Party] supporters.    To conduct general elections under the new election system,  the Diet has to work out some frameworks, such as redesigning of  election constituencies. But 61 percent of the respondents  showed cautious stances toward an early dissolution of the lower  house and general elections.    The support rate for the Hosokawa cabinet was 74 percent,  and  the non-support rate was 12 percent. In our telephone poll in  September, the support and non-support rates were 73 and 11  percent, respectively. The latest survey showed the support  rate remains high.    In our interview surveys (of 3,000 eligible voters), the  support rates for the Hosokawa cabinet were 71 percent in  September, 70 percent in November, and 60 percent in December.  Although the data from different surveys cannot be compared  with our latest survey result, the support rate is probably  picking up after the decline in December.</p>

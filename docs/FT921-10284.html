			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Indo-Russian trade stuck in credit trap / A report on life after barter THE delegation from Moscow that arrives in New Delhi tomorrow to discuss the future pattern of Indo-Russian trade must attempt to tackle the growing problem of Russian indebtedness to India as a result of Moscow's failure to export sufficient goods. Trade between India and the former Soviet Union, conducted through annual agreements to provide balanced trade, has been badly disrupted following the collapse of Soviet communism. This has left Moscow owing Rs32bn (Pounds 690m) in 'technical credits'. The Russians plan to switch to dollar-denominated trade with India, ending the 30-year-old rupee trade, a complex system of balancing two-way exports and imports. Enthusiasm for rupee trade has already waned in eastern Europe, where some countries have already changed to convertible currencies for trading with India. The Soviet Union has long been an important trading partner with India, with the latter's exports to the former at one stage accounting for a fifth of India's total exports. This approved-in-advance trade enabled India to finance machinery exports and to service the credits extended for import of Soviet armaments and military aircraft. In what were effectively barter deals, the country which failed to export sufficient goods gave technical credits. The increasing decline in Soviet exports left Indian imports from what is now the Russian-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States running at only Rs15bn, far below the Rs40bn envisaged in last year's Indo-Soviet protocol. The technical credits India gave to Moscow reached a record Rs21bn, with another Rs8bn-worth of Russian orders left in the Indian pipeline. The Indo-Soviet trade protocol provides for annual technical credit of Rs1.5bn, which is to be adjusted by exports the following year to balance trade. Moscow wants New Delhi to roll over the credits, to ask its banks to accept letters of credit already opened, and to resume consumer goods exports. But the Indians say that they can ill-afford to roll over nearly Rs30bn of credit because of budgetary problems. This has created many problems. Last year, for instance, India received only 3m tonnes of crude oil from Russia, just two-thirds of the agreed level. Steel imports were negligible, and supplies of non-ferrous metals stopped altogether. These had to be made good by imports from hard currency areas, adding to India's concern over its balance of payments. Exports from India were also down by more than 50 per cent on protocol levels, causing surpluses in the Indian factories that had for years geared for the Soviet market. Traditional industries such as jute, tea, textiles and shoes were all badly affected. The budgetary problems are also serious for India, which has promised the International Monetary Fund that it will cut its fiscal deficit for 1991-92 to 6.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Technical credits are charged to the Indian government for budgetary purposes and could become an important reason why IMF requirements will not be met. Moscow is not reneging on the debt but it not liquidating it immediately as India wants. For India, technical credits earn only 4.5 per cent interest, and Russia indicated recently that it will take at least three years to liquidate the debt. Meanwhile, the 1992 protocol has not been signed, and Moscow's desire to switch from barter to convertible-currency trade is being complicated by a disagreement over the rupee-rouble exchange rate, heavily weighted in favour of Moscow. India wants this revalued. In the interim, both countries have agreed to value their goods in dollars for at least two years. Another thorny issue relates to the fixing in rupees of the value of outstanding Soviet credits for military equipment supplies, which is now denominated in roubles. The Russians estimate these credits at Rs8-9bn, but no official figure is available. And, even while this trade was in rupees, the two countries had multiple rouble-rupee exchange rates: one for tourists, another for merchandise trade settled annually, a third for military equipment credits. India also feels that there are contractual obligations from which Moscow, as the successor to the Soviet Union, cannot back out. India thinks that Russian commitments in four areas ' defence equipment, aid to power projects, coal and steel ' must be paid in rupees. Indo-Russian trade will in all probability switch over from barter to convertible-currency trade. Moscow has said that trade, unlike in the past, when a pact could be drawn up with a central Soviet authority, will have to be through agreement with individual enterprises. Moscow is also proposing that 40 per cent of the value of Russian exports to India should be used for purchases from India and the balance remitted in hard currency within 30 days if the private enterprises do not want to use it to buy Indian goods. Whatever the outcome of the talks starting this weekend, there will still be difficult times ahead.</p>

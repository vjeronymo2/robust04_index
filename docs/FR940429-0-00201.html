			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 498(c)(5) of the HEA requires that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions maintain a minimum cash reserve. The requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for an institution to maintain a cash reserve does not apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions which reside in a State that has a tuition recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fund if that state's tuition recovery fund is acceptable to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary. As discussed above, under certain situations an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution may be able to demonstrate that the State tuition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery fund to which it contributes will supplant the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's requirement to maintain a separate cash reserve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In such an instance, the institution will not be able to treat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its contributions to the State tuition recovery fund as a portion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its current assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter believed that the requirement for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to demonstrate a positive tangible net worth would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discourage employee ownership of institutions because amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invested in employee stock ownership plans (ESOP's) are treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as intangibles and would be excluded from the calculation of net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> worth. Furthermore, the commenter believed that this particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision was retroactive because intangibles that may have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acquired several years ago would still appear on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's balance sheet. The same commenter believed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the expense item representing amortization of intangibles should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be excluded from the calculation of operating loss in view of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's exclusion of intangible assets from the calculation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of tangible net worth. Another commenter requested that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary consider the market value of assets purchased years ago  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and carried at depreciated book value on the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial statement. One commenter believed that intangibles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be excluded only if the Secretary has reason to believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the value of these assets does not reflect an arm's length  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valuation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In general, an intangible asset has no physical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existence and depends on some expected future benefit to derive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its value. While the Secretary believes that the presence of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intangible on an institution's balance sheet can, and often does,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imply some future economic benefit to the institution, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary does not believe that such an asset should be included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the institution's net worth calculation to determine whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution demonstrates financial responsibility for HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program purposes. The Secretary does not believe that it would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be necessary to exclude the expense item in the calculation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating losses. Generally accepted accounting principles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that an institution show asset values at historical cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less accumulated depreciation. In the ordinary course of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business, it would not be possible for the Secretary to make a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination regarding the current market value of any asset  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unless that asset was actually sold in an arm's length  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transaction or an actuarial valuation was obtained in a manner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable to the Secretary. Administrative efficiency and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preference for certainty as documented through the audited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial statements warrant the exclusion of such items.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Documentation of financial responsibility. Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters felt that audited financial statements should be submitted only once every four years, when most institutions are recertified. The commenters believed that the statute allows for this limited reporting. A few commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that the submission of an audited financial statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be accepted by the Secretary as sufficient evidence to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish an institution's financial responsibility without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regard to the content of the statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The statute is clear in making annual audited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial statements a requirement. Further, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that the Department has a responsibility to verify on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual basis that institutions have sufficient financial strength  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide the educational services for which its students are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracting. The Secretary has prescribed an acid test ratio in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with &sect;498(c)(2) of the HEA. The calculation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acid test ratio is based on information contained in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's audited financial statement as prescribed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;498(4). The Secretary believes that the acid test ratio provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reliable information about the financial condition of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter believed that the requirement that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution submit a financial statement for its two most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recently complete fiscal years should be clarified by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary to require two years of financial information in only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the first year following the implementation of the regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because annual financial statements would be required thereafter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary requires the submission of two years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of financial data on an annual basis. To be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financially responsible, an institution must demonstrate that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has not experienced operating losses in either or both of its two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most recently completed fiscal years that in sum total more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ten percent of the institution's total net worth at the beginning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the first year in the two year period. The Secretary shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make this determination on the basis of financial information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted by the institution in the form of an audited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparative financial statement representing each of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's two most recently completed fiscal years or by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparing information provided by the institution in the form of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two individual audited financial statements, each representing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one of the institution's two most recently completed fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters believed that the requirement for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to submit an audited financial statement within four  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months of the institution's fiscal year end was burdensome  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because institutions were also required to perform compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audits during the year at points that did not necessarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coincide with the institution's fiscal year end. As a result the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution would be required to incur additional audit costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would be unnecessary if both audits could be performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simultaneously. To accomplish this, the commenters requested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary extend the period in which audits are due from four  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months to within six months of the institution's fiscal year end.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters believed that the requirement for an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to submit an audited financial statement within four months of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fiscal year end contradicted the objectives of the Single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Audit Act, and OMB circular A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133, because timing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differences related to the availability of information would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in an institution being required perform both a financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit and a compliance audit. Another commenter noted that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audits prepared in accordance with the Single Audit Act were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable under 34 CFR 668.23(f), and suggested that an audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared in accordance with the Single Audit Act ought to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable to the Secretary in other sections of the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> HEPBURN SUES OVER PROPERTY TAX  </P> <P> Actress Katharine Hepburn and many of her neighbors are suing the town of Old  Saybrook because of property tax bills.  </P> <P> Hepburn and 45 neighbors in the Old Saybrook borough of Fenwick claim in a  lawsuit against the town assessor and the Board of Tax Review that the town  unfairly assessed their properties.  </P> <P> The lawsuit was filed Monday in Middletown Superior Court.  </P> <P> According to the suit, Hepburn owns three building lots in Fenwick, totaling  about 3.5 acres, including wetlands, assessed at $1.17 million and a house  originally assessed at $373,100.  </P> <P> Hepburn appealed her tax bills to the Board of Tax Review in February and her  house assessment was lowered to $282,100, but the board notified her in May  that it would not reassess her land, the suit said.  </P> <P> A woman who answered the telephone at Hepburn's home and identified herself as  the actress' sister-in-law, said the actress was in New York City and could not  be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Old Saybrook tax assessor Lucille Kelley did not immediately return a telephone  message left by The Associated Press.  </P></p>

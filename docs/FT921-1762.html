			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / People: Street wisdom in insurance Brian Street, one of the UK insurance industry's leading experts on pollution, is changing jobs. A chartered accountant who has worked in insurance for over 30 years, Street developed new products in such exotic areas as 'malicious tamper' during his eight years with American International Group, before turning his attention to environmental matters in 1988. Now, at 54, he is to become director of operations of a new UK venture by ECS Underwriting which acts as an agent for another leading US player, Reliance National. ECS is well known in the US for providing environmental liability insurance products and services and will now seek to expand its market into Europe. An advocate of a more scientific approach to underwriting, Street is highly critical of the approach to pollution adopted by many UK insurers which could eventually leave them with large losses. Indeed, with European environmental law increasingly influenced by legal principles common in the US - such as the 'polluter pays' - Street expects pollution to become a big issue for insurers and policyholders alike in the 1990s.</p>

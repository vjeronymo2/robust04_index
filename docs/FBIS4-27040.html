			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Outgoing Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata today called for extension of the current Diet  (parliament) session beyond its deadline of tomorrow to choose a  new prime minister, the KYODO NEWS SERVICE reported.    "It is inconceivable that the Diet should end its session  before a new cabinet has been formed," Hata was quoted as  saying. He announced Saturday [25 June] his intention to quit  with his entire cabinet.    KYODO said Hata made the comments as his ruling coalition is  stepping up its bid to woo the Social Democratic Party (SDP)  back into its fold to form a stable, majority government.    The Hata cabinet remains in office until a new  administration  is launched.    The House of Representatives is to convene a plenary session  at 10:00 a.m. [0100 GMT] tomorrow.    However, it remains unclear whether the lower house will be  able to vote on a successor to Hata tomorrow in view of  intensifying parliamentary maneuverings by both the coalition  and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to win over  the socialists to their respective camps.    The SDP can swing the balance of power because it holds 74  seats in the powerful 511-member lower house while the LDP has  206, and the governing coalition 183.</p>

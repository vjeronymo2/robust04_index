			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 26 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- General Humberto  Ortega, chief of the Sandinist People's Army, EPS, will retire  by 10 January 1995 at the latest, a source close to the  Nicaraguan Presidency reported today.    The source stated that Ortega, who has held that position  for  the past 14 years, will undergo a "transition" period in the  Armed Forces before his retirement.    Deputy Presidency Minister Tomas Delaney confirmed that  Ortega's departure will be included in a provisional article of  the Military Code agreed upon by the EPS and the Violeta  Chamorro administration, a regulation that will replace the  announced Military Organization Law.    A source close to the executive branch who asked to remain  anonymous confirmed to NOTIMEX that Ortega will abandon his post  "on 10 January 1995 at the latest," the date agreed upon by the  military leadership and President Chamorro after nearly eight  months of discussion.    By changing the draft bill into a Military Code, however,  Ortega managed to "tie" the government's hands and give the  legislative branch a "vote of confidence" as the legislature  will be the only body empowered to introduce reforms, the source  explained.    Joaquin Cuadra, EPS chief of staff of the Commander's  Office,  said the Code "will give stability and security to the Armed  Forces because it cannot be reformed by the executive during the  recess period of the National Assembly."    Under the Code, which will have constitutional status, "the  military will not be subject to the political instability of the  current or future administrations," according to political  sources.    National Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman stated on  Tuesday that he hopes the draft Code of Military Organization,  Jurisdiction, and Military Social Security is sent this week to  the deputies for discussion and approval.    The "final" version of the new military legislation "is  complete but it is the president's prerogative to forward it to  the legislature," Delaney remarked.    Ortega told the press this Monday that "there was a total  consensus" on the Military Code initiative. "It will include  everything, including the permanence of the Army chief," Gen.  Ortega expressed.    The EPS chief admitted that "the art of negotiating is  knowing when to yield," after saying days before that he would  not abandon the Armed Forces under "pressure or at anybody's  whim."    The new military legislation would end a prolonged conflict  that began on 2 September of last year, when Chamorro took the  military leadership by surprise by announcing that Ortega would  retire in 1994.    After the announcement, Gen. Ortega and his brother, former  President Daniel Ortega (1985-1990), had a verbal confrontation  with Chamorro.</p>

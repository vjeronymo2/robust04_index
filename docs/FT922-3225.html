			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: COB inquiry into Schneider dealings FRENCH stock market regulators have opened an inquiry into dealings in the shares of Schneider, the electrical engineering and construction group. The share prices of Schneider and its separately-quoted subsidiaries and holding group fell steeply this week, ahead of a shareholders' meeting at which Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman, cut his profits forecast for this year. Schneider had earlier told a meeting of financial analysts that profits would rise to about FFr400m (Dollars 73.93m) this year, instead of an estimated FFr650m. This compares with a net profit of FFr275m last year, and FFr923.9m in 1990. The readjustment reflects lower-than-expected earnings from Merlin Gerin, an electrical equipment subsidiary, due to its customers' caution over making internal investments. The Commission des Operations de Bourse, the stock exchange watchdog, said it was studying the way in which Schneider released this information as well as the trade in the shares. Schneider's share price stood at FFr670 yesterday afternoon, 12.2 per cent down on the price on Tuesday, the day of the analysts' meeting. Analysts' interest in Schneider is intense, as the group is undergoing fast change.</p>

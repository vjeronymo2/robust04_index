			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIAMI TAKES CHARGE IN SECOND HALF AGAINST IOWA, 48-21  </P> <P> Craig Erickson threw for 360 yards and three touchdowns as 10th-ranked Miami  scored the game's final 24 points and beat Iowa, 48-21, Saturday night.  </P> <P> The victory set up a showdown in the Orange Bowl next Saturday between  defending national champion Miami (2-1) and No. 2 Florida State, which beat  Virginia Tech, 39-28, Saturday.  </P> <P> Iowa (2-1) went into the game averaging 54 points, best in the nation, but  never sustained a running attack that had been potent in the Hawkeyes' first  two games. Tony Stewart was held to 36 yards in 10 carries and Nick Bell gained  26 yards in 10 tries.  </P> <P> Wesley Carroll scored on pass plays from Erickson of 73 and 16 yards and Darryl  Spencer scored on a pass play of 35 yards. Erickson completed 17 of 33 passes  with two interceptions. Carroll had six catches for 146 yards.  </P> <P> The Hawkeyes closed the margin to 24-21 early in the third quarter on a 35-yard  touchdown pass from Matt Rodgers to Sean Smith. The Hurricanes then took  charge.  </P> <P> Miami's Stephen McGuire carried five times for 50 yards and caught a nine-yard  pass to spark a 64-yard scoring drive. The touchdown came on a six-yard run by  McGuire to make it 31-21.  </P> <P> The Hurricanes had to punt on their next possession, but Doug Buch fumbled the  kick and Miami's Darren Krein recovered at the Iowa 19. Three plays later,  Erickson hit Carroll for a 38-21 lead.  </P> <P> The game was Miami's first since the team was ordered by Coach Dennis Erickson  to tone down celebrating after big plays. The Hurricanes responded to the edict  by faking high-fives, thrusting their arms skyward for just an instant or  crossing their arms in mock solemnity.  </P></p>

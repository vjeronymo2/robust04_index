			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE AGREES TO NEGOTIATIONS ON GLOBAL WARMING  </P> <P> The White House, in an apparent softening of its position on a major  environmental problem, has dropped its opposition to a formal  treaty-negotiating process on global warming, it was learned Thursday.  </P> <P> Until now, the United States had been alone among major Western economic powers  in opposing such an initiative.  </P> <P> The change of position was outlined in a cable dispatched Thursday to U.S.  delegates at an environmental conference in Geneva sponsored by the United  Nations.  </P> <P> Saying it was essential for the United States to exercise a leadership role,  the cable said, "We should seek to develop full international consensus on  necessary steps to prepare for a formal treaty-negotiating process."  </P> <P> It said the United States would be willing to host a workshop on global warming  later this year.  </P> <P> The cable, a copy of which was obtained by the Associated Press, was sent by  White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, who earlier had rejected efforts to  put the United States in the lead in establishing an international convention  on global warming.  </P> <P> The convention idea had been supported by Secretary of State James A. Baker III  and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly. But Sununu  had argued that a convention was premature and that more analysis was needed of  economic and other effects of the potentially dramatic actions needed against  global warming, officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Temperatures Could Rise  </P> <P> Scientists believe that global temperatures could rise 4 degrees to 9 degrees  Fahrenheit by the middle of the next century because increasing levels of  carbon dioxide and other man-made gases in the atmosphere will trap and retain  heat from the sun in a process similar to what happens in a greenhouse.  </P> <P> Such a warming trend could melt polar ice caps and cause sea levels to rise,  cause severe droughts and storms and severely disrupt the Earth's biological  systems.  </P> <P> Scientists at a Senate hearing on Monday testified that the problem might be  worse than their own computer programs can predict.  </P> <P> The White House had ordered one of the scientists, James E. Hansen, director of  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space  Studies, to change his testimony to avoid the impression "that there is  unanimity within the government on this issue."  </P> <P> In his cable, Sununu said, "We consider the reported emerging agreement on an  advanced preparatory program to address global climate response issues  comprehensively to be extremely positive.  </P> <P> "To further this process, please make every effort to obtain agreement on a  global warming workshop this fall, hosted by the United States," Sununu said.  </P> <P> He said such a meeting "should be designed to identify the scientific, legal,  technical and economic issues critical to further progress on beginning  negotiations on an international convention on global climate change."  </P></p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: US bank pays Dollars 225m for Chicago options firm NATIONSBANK, the large US regional banking group formed in 1991 by the merger of C &amp; S Sovran and NCNB, yesterday announced a move into the booming financial derivatives market. NationsBank, the fourth-largest US banking group, said it had acquired - for Dollars 225m in cash - Chicago Research &amp; Trading Group, one of the biggest proprietary options market-making and trading firms. Mr Hugh McColl, chairman of NationsBank, said the deal would significantly enhance the bank's ability to serve its corporate and institutional customers. The bank said the acquisition would enable it to offer a broad array of risk-management products. CRT, founded in 1977, has 750 employees and Dollars 250m in capital. It owns more than 150 memberships on 19 futures and options exchanges around the world and trades about 75 different options and futures contracts, and needs to bolster its capital base. The purchase allows CRT to compete directly with the investments banks that dominate over-the-counter trading of derivative products such as interest rate and currency swaps. CRT will also benefit from NationsBank's client list. Mr Philip Hubbard, who runs CRT, said an increasing portion of derivatives trading was now taking place away from exchange trading floors. In 1992 NationsBank recorded Dollars 1.15bn of net earnings, more than five times the previous year's level. The bank's earnings had been held back in 1991 by heavy merger-related restructuring charges and provisions for bad and doubtful debts.</p>

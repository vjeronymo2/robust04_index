			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Rightwing MPs divided over Major's future A split has emerged among rightwing Conservative MPs over how to get the party to adopt their agenda. They are divided between those who want Mr John Major to go and those who think sustaining him in office is their best course of action. The split suggests that all may not yet be lost for the prime minister even if the Tory party does badly in next month's European elections as indicated in the latest Guardian/ICM poll. The poll puts the Conservatives 17 points behind, excluding 'don't knows', with Labour on 44 per cent, the Tories on 27 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 24 per cent. The rightwing Tory split stems partly from a feeling that Mr Michael Portillo - the Thatcherite chief Treasury secretary who is the preferred candidate of many of the right - would be unlikely to beat Mr Michael Heseltine if a leadership contest were staged later this year. However, some rightwingers believe there is a case for a change of leader even if this makes the pro-European Mr Heseltine prime minister. Encouraged by Mr Heseltine's voting record on issues such as the age of consent for homosexuals, they argue that on many subjects he is closer to the right of the party than the left. If he came out in favour of a referendum on the next step of European integration they say they would warm towards him further. A number of rightwingers supported Mr Heseltine against Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd in the last Tory leadership contest in 1990. MPs in this category include Mr John Carlisle, MP for Luton North who recently said he was ready to stand in an autumn leadership contest; Mr Tony Marlow, MP for Northampton North who stunned the Commons in March by demanding Mr Major's resignation; Sir Peter Tapsell, the Euro-sceptic MP for Lindsey East; and Mr David Evans, an executive of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee. The second rightwing camp believes that a Heseltine premiership is to be avoided at virtually any cost. As a leadership contest later this year is therefore best avoided, they reason that their best bet is to promise Mr Major their support while urging him to adopt more rightwing policies and to appoint rightwingers to more prominent cabinet posts in a summer reshuffle. Some of them think Mr Major could in effect be used as an interim leader until Mr Portillo, or an alternative candidate from the right, is ready to mount a winning challenge. There is little or no enthusiasm among rightwingers for a prolonged Major premiership as anything other than a means to an end. According to one MP: 'The big difference between now and 1990 is that no one is going around saying this is a prime minister we have to go to the wall for.'</p>

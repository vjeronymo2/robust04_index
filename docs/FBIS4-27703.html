			<p>BFN     [Text] Officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  [MOFA], the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI],  and other relevant government ministries and agencies are  wracking their brains over the likelihood of Japanese ministers  being absent at the OECD ministerial meeting to be held in Paris  7-8 June. It will be the first time since 1967 that not a  single minister will be present at the meeting. As the 50th  anniversary commemoration of the D-Day, which led to eventual  allied victory in World War II, is scheduled around the same  time, European and U.S. leaders will be gathering in France.  Although Japan has been an OECD member for 30 years this year,  it may end up with receiving cold treatment by other nations.    Japan joined the OECD in 1964. It has sent either a foreign  minister, trade minister, or economics minister to the annual  OECD ministerial meetings from 1968. From 1984, all three  ministers from the MOFA, MITI, and the Economic Planning Agency  have, as a rule, participated in the annual ministerial meetings.    "Employment and Growth" is the major topic in the agenda of  the upcoming ministerial meeting. U.S. cabinet-level economics  officials, including Mickey Kantor, U.S. trade representative,  Lloyd Bentsen, secretary of treasury, Robert Reich, secretary of  labor, and Laura Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic  Advisers, will all gather at the meeting. U.S. President Bill  Clinton is also scheduled to be in France around the same time.  It is expected that a series of meetings will be held, taking  advantage of the OECD forum.</p>

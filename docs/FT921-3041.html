			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Thailand puts air force units on alert Thailand has put air force units on alert and reinforced troops on the border with Burma following incursions into Thai territory by Burmese soldiers pursuing Karen guerrillas, Victor Mallet reports from Bangkok. Border skirmishes have been particularly intense in the last few days as the Burmese military tries to overrun Karen strongholds before the rainy season. Thai officers have rejected demands from their Burmese counterparts to withdraw from the area, and the military-installed government in Bangkok, which enjoys good relations with Burma, has shown no public sign of concern. Further north, the Burmese army's capture of Sleeping Dog Hill at the weekend could lead to the capture of the nearby Karen headquarters at Manerplaw.</p>

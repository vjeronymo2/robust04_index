			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Davy wins record mill export order - UK engineering group to build Pounds 200m South African steel plant DAVY INTERNATIONAL, part of the Trafalgar House engineering-to-hotels group, has won the UK's largest export order to South Africa in recent years with a Pounds 200m contract to supply a complete stainless steel rolling mill. The order, which will be announced today, is a big boost for Britain's heavy engineering sector. Most of the equipment will be bought in the UK from suppliers including GEC in Rugby and Bronx Engineering in the West Midlands. The contract is for the R3.5bn (Pounds 790m) expansion of the Columbus stainless steel plant at Middelburg, which will quadruple South Africa's stainless steel capacity to 500,000 tonnes a year from 1995, and turn it into the world's sixth largest producer. The order was won against strong international competition. Mr Fred Boshoff, chief executive of Columbus, said there had been 'tremendous interest' in the tenders for the project, with bids from companies in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Austria and Japan. Some of the bids had been very keen, indicating the lean state of the international engineering industry. Columbus, for which Davy built the original plant in 1980-1982, is a joint venture between subsidiaries of Anglo American and Gencor, South Africa's two mining giants. The award of the complete hot mill and cold mill facility gives Davy the responsibility for the design, supply, installation and commissioning of equipment which will make strip, coil and plate from slabs produced in the new Columbus melt shop. This will be supplied by Voest Alpine, the Austrian engineering group, while Mannesmann Demag of Germany will supply cranes for the project. In response to local criticism that major contracts were going offshore, Mr Boshoff said in order to compete internationally state-of-the-art plant was required and nobody in South Africa had the capability to supply the integrated steel plant. He noted that Davy and others would be buying many of their parts in South Africa. The contract is Davy's biggest since its takeover in 1991 by Trafalgar House, and comes a month after Davy won a Pounds 100m turnkey contract to build a new coking oven for Bethlehem Steel in the US. Financing for the rolling mill contract was arranged by Kleinwort Benson. The UK merchant bank is raising 15 per cent of the money privately and the rest is being arranged through the UK's Export Credit Guarantee Department.</p>

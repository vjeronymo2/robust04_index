			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today, the heads of the International Reform  Foundation subjected the first stage of Russian privatization to  diverse criticism. This was done at the presentation of a  weighty report which is due tomorrow to land on the desks of the  president, the prime minister, ministers, deputies, heads of  administrations, bankers, and CIS leaders.    In the view of the report's authors, the government's  actions  in the privatization sphere have been justified in the formal  sense but, given the lack of an overall strategy for  development, the haphazard nature of the measures and the fact  that they are even divorced from reality, and given the general  loss of control in the socio-economic sphere, Chubays-style  headlong privatization is having quite the opposite results.  Criminal economic structures are emerging instead of a layer of  private owners. There are no major enterprises which could  boast of success. Investment in industry is falling. There is  no link between economic market processes and federative  relations. The economists demand that the Russian authorities  clarify the objectives of privatization and national priorities.</p>

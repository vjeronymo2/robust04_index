			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by Laurent Gbagbo, secretary </F> general of the FPI in Abidjan on 14 February]    [Text] [Correspondent Jeanne Agnimel] In his address, the  FPI [Ivorian Popular Front] secretary general touched on several  aspects of national life. The FPI, he said, will send 21  delegations or more to all areas of the country to hold  discussions with the people. Concerning the holding of  elections, he sounded a note of warning to the government: He  said that in the case of fraud, he is not sure that the FPI will  be able to contain the anger of its members:    [Gbagbo] I told my listeners clearly that Houphouet is  Houphouet, but that after Houphouet, it is no longer Houphouet.  Since 1990, I have said that Houphouet has cheated, but all the  same, I sent activists go and tell everyone to remain calm, that  this was not serious. I am not sure I can keep the people calm  if it is not Houphouet who is cheating. It is easy to avoid the  risks--by not cheating. We are ready to help any government  hold free and fair elections, so that the winner should be  recognized as the winner and the loser recognized as the loser.  That is why immediately after our December 1992 convention, we  established an electoral committee chaired by our comrade,  Professor Oulai Hubert. This electoral commission completed the  first part of its work on 13 August 1993 and we presented the  document to the then prime minister, Alassan Dramane Ouattara.  We were expecting him to invite us to a meeting with the  Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire, on one hand, and all the  parties interested in the elections, on the other, under the  auspices of the government.    After the change of government, we went back to see the new  prime minister, Daniel Kablan Duncan, and gave him another copy  of the same document, dated 13 August 1993. As of right now, we  are still waiting to be invited to hold a serious and important  session in order to avoid fraud, and hence, trouble.    [Agnimel] Concerning devaluation and its effects, the FPI  secretary general made the following suggestions:    [Gbagbo] By increasing the price of fuel, the government has  run the risk of effecting all the products. On the day of the  devaluation, I spoke to AFP; I wanted to suggest that the  government freeze the prices of some commodities, including  fuel. Then, at the same time, I learned that they had really  drawn up a list of goods, including fuel, whose prices had been  frozen. So I did not make any declaration, because fuel is an  important factor as far as the economy is concerned. Even the  price of onions will increase if you increase the price of fuel.  The price of pepper will increase if you increase the price of  fuel. This is because it is transported from its place of  production to its place of consumption. When they took the risk  of increasing the price of fuel, it is evident that the price of  everything else must increase. Of course, it is not surprising  to see the trade unions meeting here and there to prepare their  fight. I would like to state very clearly that we are not  keeping our flag in our pocket. We will give our active and  unflinching support to all workers who fight to reconquer their  lost purchasing power.</p>

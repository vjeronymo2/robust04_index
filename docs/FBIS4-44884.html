China already has  contacted Japan Technology Transfer Association (JTTAS;  chairman: Mr. Takehiko Matsuda) requesting its cooperation in  the matter.    JTTAS currently is implementing its plans jointly with  [Japan  Management Planning Research Institute], and as early as April,  Commission on Concept of City for Nanjing International City  Technology Exchange will be established so that it can begin  studying the matter. The Chinese plans are to establish an  international industrial city by inviting approximately 500  companies from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the United States to  establish their industrial bases here. The future possibility  will include the expansion of the city by tenfold, indicating a  new opportunity for development of Sino-Japanese cooperation  scheme.    The Nanjing International Airport construction project ranks  high in importance in China, aiming for the end of 1996 as a  target date for the completion of the first phase of the  construction work. Jiang Ning Province's Lu Kou Zhen, where the  airport will be constructed, is positioned at the south shore of  the Chang River approximately 30 km south of Nanjing. Here the  international industrial city, a site of participating  countries' high-tech research industries, will be constructed.  In addition to the industrial zone, commerce, public  administration, and residential zones will be established. As  facilities, international conference halls, trade fair halls,  universities, and management/maintenance buildings can be  considered. China will be responsible for improving  infrastructures. Within from 3 to 5 years' time, foreign  companies will be able to move into the city. In the future,  China is considering expanding the city to cover an area of up  to 6,600 hectares.    JTTAS plans to provide Japanese businesses with information  on the project by June. As for attracting companies from Korea,  Taiwan, the U.S., and Hong Kong, JTTAS will establish a third  sector, fully cooperating with China in this matter.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER SEES 'POTENTIAL' MIDEAST PROGRESS  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III, emerging from an extraordinary 90-minute  meeting with the foreign ministers of Israel and Egypt, said Thursday he sees  "some potential for progress" in the deadlocked Middle East peace process.  </P> <P> Baker and Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmet Abdel Meguid both tried to convince  Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens that Egypt's 10-point peace initiative --  which has the apparent backing of the Palestine Liberation Organization and  gained the public endorsement of France earlier in the day -- is consistent  with Israel's own proposal for Palestinian elections in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip and may be the only way to revive the Israeli plan.  </P> <P> Baker said the meeting, attended by the three men without any aides present,  concentrated on "how we could take practical pragmatic steps to make that  (Israeli election plan) work."  </P> <P> He made it clear that he believes the 10 points put forward by Egyptian  President Hosni Mubarak are the only steps currently under discussion that  could move the Israeli plan forward.  </P> <P> The Mubarak initiative is a subject of a growing controversy in Israel. The  rightist Likud Party of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Arens, rejects the  Egyptian proposals, but the centrist Labor Party of Finance Minister Shimon  Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin accepts it. The Israeli Cabinet will  debate the issue Wednesday.  </P> <P> Baker refused to speculate on the outcome of the Cabinet meeting. But he  emphasized that he saw no reason why Shamir, Arens and others should be  suspicious of the Egyptian plan.  </P> <P> "What is clear from our discussions today is that the United States does not  see it (the Egyptian suggestions) as a competing proposal and Egypt does not  see it as a competing proposal," Baker said. Meguid said in a separate  telephone interview that the Egyptian plan "is not an alternative but a  clarification" of the Israeli proposal.  </P> <P> "There is a debate in Israel about whether to pursue the (peace) process at  all," Baker said. He did not spell out the implications of his remark, but it  seemed to be intended to put additional pressure on the Likud to drop its  opposition to Mubarak's plan.  </P> <P> President Francois Mitterrand of France gave his endorsement to Mubarak's  initiative Thursday. The Egyptian president stopped off in France on his way to  the United States. He is scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly today  and will also meet with Arens.  </P> <P> Mitterrand said Mubarak's proposals are "solid and useful" because they "avoid  setting incompatible preconditions," Reuters news agency reported.  </P> <P> A few hours before he met Baker and Meguid, Arens huddled for an hour and 15  minutes with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, urging Moscow to  support Israel's West Bank and Gaza elections plan. Shevardnadze said the  Soviet Union might do just that -- but only if Israel opened the process to the  PLO, something no mainstream faction in Israel is willing to do.  </P> <P> "We did not exclude as an interim measure this idea of elections," Shevardnadze  said. "There was one very important point which I mentioned to the foreign  minister. If the PLO is ignored in the process of settlement, then the  settlement will never take place. The PLO is a real force."  </P> <P> The Soviet foreign minister said he offered to arrange a meeting between  Israeli officials and representatives of the PLO in the Soviet Union. Israel is  not likely to accept the Soviet initiative. If Israel wanted to talk to the PLO  -- which up to now it has not -- it would have no difficulty finding a meeting  place.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze also urged Israel to accept at least parts of the Egyptian  initiative.  </P> <P> "We noted that there are reasonable elements in the proposal put forward by  Prime Minister Shamir, and there are many interesting elements in the proposals  put forward by President Mubarak," Shevardnadze said. "I do believe we have to  look for reasonable elements in both plans."  </P></p>

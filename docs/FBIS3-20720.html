			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladislav Jovanovic, foreign minister of the </F> FRY, by DJ News Agency; place and date not given: "We Are  Expecting Mate Granic in Belgrade"]    [Text] Representatives of the Republic of Croatia and  the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] have recently signed an  agreement on the normalization of relations in Geneva. The  agreement, apart from the opening of postal communications and  roads, anticipates the opening of the FRY office in the Republic  of Croatia and the office of the Republic of Croatia in the FRY  on 15 February. Vladislav Jovanovic, FRY foreign minister, told  DANAS his view of the new thawing process in Serb-Croat  relations.    [DJ] What does the agreement mean for the signatories, the  FRY and the Republic of Croatia, and what are its starting  points?    [Jovanovic] It means a lot for both sides, as it obliges  them, in resolving the problems that divide them, to employ  political means, and take the peaceful way rather than use  force, which is a great step forward. Moreover, this is a  demonstration of the decisiveness to start the process of  normalization of relations. Our mutual aim is to complete the  process as soon as possible, but naturally it anticipates new  realities, primarily the fact that this is the agreement on  opening official representative offices, and not an agreement on  establishing diplomatic relations or on mutual recognition.  This is a step in that direction, and it is in our interest, at  least in the interest of the FRY, to have the process continue,  develop successfully, and lead to a full normalization of  relations.    [DJ] What do you expect out of the agreement?    [Jovanovic] We expect this agreement to influence the  establishment of a better atmosphere, the creation of conditions  that will enable the issues yet to arise, political issues, to  be solved in conditions of peace, and with the mutual wish to  reach a political solution acceptable to both sides. In the  beginning we will certainly have to solve the simpler issues,  the humanitarian issues that were discussed in Geneva last  Sunday, and in the initial stages of the activities of the  offices a direct communication will be established, which we  hope will make the transfer of information easier, and render a  better understanding of positions, while at the same time serve  as a very reliable channel of communication between the two  governments.    At this moment our great common interest is that peace be  achieved in Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible. The fact  that our positions and interests have become closer in this  peace process has a positive meaning for the process. This  channel of communication will, at least in the beginning, be  used to encourage this peace process and to bring it to an end  successfully.    [DJ] Some analysts in Serbia have interpreted the quoting of  the CSCE and UN principles in the signed agreement -- where the  inviolability of borders is mentioned, which implies that the  "Krajina" is also part of the Republic of Croatia -- as direct  recognition of the Republic of Croatia within its AVNOJ  [Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia]  borders.    [Jovanovic] There is no need to see in the agreement  something that is not there. The agreement clearly states that  it is an agreement between the two governments concerning the  opening of offices, to make communication easier. It says  nothing else. Since it limits its aim to what is said, it does  not prejudice a single open issue, not only of the Krajina, but  also of the division balance, mutual recognition, and even the  establishment of full diplomatic relations. All this should  happen when conditions are favorable. There have been instances  in the past in which it was shown that the opening of an office  in one country does not imply the recognition within the borders  it aspires for. For instance, when the United States opened an  office in China, that did not mean that the United States was  acknowledging Taiwan as an indivisible part of China. The  United States still has a different opinion from China's  regarding its borders. Therefore, relations should not be  unnecessarily complicated by showing wishes as reality, or  rushing reality into assuming the form of the wishes. We must  bear in mind the fact that the issue of the Krajina is connected  to the Vance plan, which says that its political future, its  final status, must be resolved through direct negotiations  between the legitimate representatives of the Krajina and the  Republic of Croatia. This is yet to happen, and with this  agreement we have created favorable conditions for starting it.  Before the negotiations take place, an absolute end should be  put to all hostilities. After that the practical issues will be  resolved, which will provide the conditions for starting  political negotiations. This is reality; as it is, and not as  someone would like to make it.    [DJ] As in Yugoslavia, this agreement was met with  controversial opinions and interpretations in Croatia....    [Jovanovic] Nothing that has not been done has been  acknowledged, and nothing has been written that has not been  said. Therefore, it is a matter of wishes and of the approach to  a document -- interpreting it in one or another way, seeing  various things in it. With much use of political imagination  many things can be seen. After all, we live in the world of  reality, and political imagination should be used more as an  incentive for a constant mending of the world of reality than  for replacing it with something illusory. It is natural to have  criticism, suspicions, and reservations in both countries, which  is probably the consequence of maximalist expectations and  wishes, but the essence of this agreement is of a limited,  modest scope. It is more important as a demonstration of  political will and the decision of the two sides to start, in an  organized way, toward full normalization of relations, which  assumes the previous conclusion of peace, which is near. If it  meant something else, then we would have nothing to deal with;  all the problems would have been solved. Unfortunately, the  agreement means nothing but a first step toward a real, normal  situation, and establishing conditions for general cooperation  between neighbors, which we hope will become reality one day.  The sooner it does, the better it will be for both sides.    [DJ] What is your comment on Mr. Martic's being elected  president of the "Krajina"? Is he someone who could make the  political negotiations on the future of the "Krajina" and the  Serb-Croat relations in general easier or more difficult?    [Jovanovic] Individuals can play a certain role in the  development of political processes, but not a crucial one. The  process will develop within the complex of the relevant  elements, and individuals can only adjust these elements in a  reasonably successful way. I do not know Mr. Martic personally,  and know Mr. Babic only superficially. I think that they are  both of the same generation, they have the same attachment to  the Krajina, its political goals. I do not believe that there  is a great difference between them; Mr. Martic is probably more  composed and is probably able to control his emotions and nerves  better. This is probably one of his advantages in negotiation  processes with any side. According to what I know, he is a man  of principle, a fanatic, and at the same time he is serious in  conversation. I think that his nomination should not be taken  as an additional difficulty in the negotiation process and the  normalization of Croat-Serb relations.    [DJ] The European Community will consider the introduction  of sanctions against the Republic of Croatia, on account of its  alleged involvement in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Jovanovic] We do not support sanctions. The entire  experience of recent history has shown that sanctions have  created more problems than they have solved. This is best seen  by the example of Yugoslavia. The sanctions were supposed to  lead to peace in Bosnia, and they only lead to the escalation of  war, and peace is further away than it was. They also caused  destabilization -- not only in Yugoslavia, but in the wider  area, and became the greatest obstacle to peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. As far as Bosnia-Herzegovina is concerned,  the fact is that the Serbs and Croats there had no significant  dispute, or bitterness, to be more precise. To my knowledge, the  conflicts had a relatively limited scope, and there was a great  amount of mutual responsibility for the consequences of what  they did to each other. This probably resulted in the  preservation of mutual trust, and later served as the basis for  their intra-Bosnian agreement on peace and cooperation. It is  known that they have signed the declaration on stopping the war  and establishing offices parallel with the signing of a similar  statement by the FRY and the Republic of Croatia. This is in  itself a positive fact in all-round Serb-Croat relations, which  can have a constructive role on the entire territory of the  former Yugoslavia, as well as help to find just final solutions  to all the problems that the two most populous south Slavic  nations share, and that complicate their relations and their  lives.    [DJ] What is your comment on the controversies in the  foreign policies of some European countries and the United  States concerning the crisis in the former Yugoslavia,  especially in Bosnia?    [Jovanovic] Relations between the United States and European  countries are not too clear, nor can they be interpreted and  placed in certain categories. There are many changes, and they  alter position frequently, depending on the development of the  crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At this moment it seems that  Europe cares more about peace in Bosnia than about keeping the  sanctions. Italian minister Andreatta has recently said that  the sanctions have turned out to be the main obstacle to peace.    [DJ] There is a thesis that weak Muslims are the aim of both  Europe and the United States, and that by supporting Alija  Izetbegovic's option the United States is in fact paying off its  debt to the Islamic countries, and actually encouraging the  Muslims to fight the war so that they can lose it.    [Jovanovic] The area for speculation is wide open. There  is not enough substance for either statement, but there is  enough space for various assumptions. What you have said is  certain, the United States is trying to pay as much debt to the  Islamic countries as possible through the Bosnian crisis, and it  thus wishes to be rehabilitated in their eyes. On the other  hand, it is in the interest of US politics to divert the  attention of the Islamic world from the Middle East for a while,  and draw it to Bosnia, so that Israel could freely reach a  solution with the PLO that would suit it. These are U.S.  strategic interests. Whether, apart from that, it has a  strategic view of the so-called Muslim presence in Bosnia,  whether it wants to make it weaker, if not destroy it, through  this policy, or make it stronger and dominant, remains to be  speculated on.    The theory of keeping the Muslims in Bosnia, or of  repressing  them, is not a theory we deal with, because it does not  correspond to reality. We even think that it would be wrong if  the politics of any country were to contain such a theory  concerning the Bosnian crisis.    [DJ] How do you see the future of Serb-Croat relations?    [Jovanovic] It is too early to say. The fact is that we  have started the process that increases the chances of there  being mutual political visits and of actualizing political  contacts in a direct way, and not, as until now, through  mediators. This is the natural means that two countries wishing  to settle their relations should employ in order to save time  and to prevent foreign commissioners from organizing their  relations. The upcoming visit of deputy prime minister Zeljko  Simic to Zagreb is a step in that direction. This is a chance  of viewing certain problems that will be brought up by either  side, and it is difficult to say in advance what the plan for  resolving them will be. After that foreign minister Mate Granic  will probably visit Belgrade, and it is possible that there will  be contacts of a different kind, perhaps at a higher level.    [DJ] Apart from the establishing of telephone lines between  the Republic of Croatia and the FRY, the opening of the  Zagreb-Belgrade highway was also announced. This road partly  passes through a "Krajina"-controlled area?    [Jovanovic] As far as the opening of these communications is  concerned, nothing can be done without the consent of the  Krajina and without the Krajina consulting with the Republic of  Croatia. I do not see the Krajina being a problem there. On  the contrary, it has stated that it was prepared to cooperate  with Croatia and Yugoslavia in the opening of these  communications, and this, naturally, implies that both sides  should benefit from it. This benefit is practical and material,  as well as relating to property, which is an advantage of the  policy of small steps, reminiscent as it is of the eternal truth  that success feeds on success, and success in these relations  should mean success for all sides, and not only for one.  <H5>  [Box, p 17] </H5> <H5>  Vladislav Jovanovic on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Statement </H5>   Mr. Zhirinovskiy made a statement about air attacks to Serb  positions in Bosnia being a declaration of war to Russia, and  implying Russia's resignation from the UN, in his  figurative-rhetorical style, probably to thus substantiate the  fact that Russia, the Russian society, is not insensitive to  what is happening in the Balkans, and that it is an area in  which Russia has traditional interest, so it would be very  sensitive to the drastic use of force against one of the nations  that belong to the same Christian faith as the Russian people.  This is the only way I see that statement, rather than as a  literal description of reactions and the form of these  reactions. Therefore, I see it as pointing out the well-known  fact that any drastic use of force by a non-Balkan people would  certainly cause a strong Russian reaction, and that this should  be borne in mind before making inaccurate calculations. This is  the way I took Mr. Zhirinovskiy's statement, and I hope that  others have done the same.</p>

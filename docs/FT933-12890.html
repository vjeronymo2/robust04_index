			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht warning to High Court MISS BETTY Boothroyd, the Speaker, yesterday delivered a stern warning to the High Court not to trespass on the rights of the Commons when dealing with the legal challenge to the Maastricht treaty launched by Lord Rees-Mogg. She stressed that she would 'take with great seriousness any potential questioning of our proceedings in the courts'. But one constitutional expert last night questioned whether the Speaker's statement was relevant to the case brought by Lord Rees-Mogg. Professor Trevor Hartley of the London School of Economics pointed out that Lord Rees-Mogg was not challenging parliament in the courts. The application for a judicial review was on the decision by the government to ratify the treaty when only part of it has been approved by parliament. 'There have been cases when the courts have clashed with parliament,' he said. 'But Lord Rees-Mogg's action is challenging the government, rather than parliament.' Miss Boothroyd made clear her determination to uphold the rights of the Commons by making a public statement in response to a complaint by Mr Tony Benn (Lab Chesterfield) instead of following normal procedure and dealing with the matter by private letter. He suggested that the process of judicial review invoked by Lord Rees-Mogg was being extended with the courts being asked to decide whether parliament as well as the government had exceeded its powers. Miss Boothroyd refused to allow Mr Benn to open a discussion today on whether the High Court had already breached Commons privileges before the start of the debate on the government's refusal to accept the protocol to the treaty on social policy. In refusing to accord precedence today to Mr Benn's motion referring the matter to the committee of privileges, Miss Boothroyd noted that MPs had already approved the Maastricht bill before the High Court dealt with Lord Rees-Mogg's application on Monday. She said the bill was still being considered by the House of Lords at that time so peers had to decide whether their privileges had been breached. To cheers, she cited the protection given to parliament by the Bill of Rights which placed a statutory prohibition on the questioning of its proceedings. Miss Boothroyd said the relevant article stated: 'The freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of parliament.' She emphasised: 'I am sure that the House is entitled to expect, when the case referred to by Mr Benn begins to be heard on Monday, that the bill of rights will require to be fully respected by all those appearing before the Court.' Miss Boothroyd explained that a recent decision made by the House of Lords in its judicial capacity permitted the courts to assess the significance of words spoken in the Commons during the passage of bills in order to assist in the interpretation of statutes. She said: 'This has exposed our proceedings to possible questioning which was previously thought to be impossible.'</p>

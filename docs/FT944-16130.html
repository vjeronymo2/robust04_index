			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Record revenues help Whirlpool to 40% advance Whirlpool, the US-based maker of washing machines and other home appliances, saw a strong increase in earnings in its third quarter in spite of the cost of investing in international expansion. A big increase in profits from its US operations and a smaller increase in profits from Europe helped the company report a 40 per cent rise in net income to Dollars 98m in the three months to September. This figure included a Dollars 15m gain on the recently-completed sale of its minority stake in Matsushita Floor Care, a US vacuum cleaner manufacturer. Leaving aside this and a small restructuring charge in Europe, net income would have been 20 per cent ahead at Dollars 83m. Shipment increases in all four of Whirlpool's main markets - North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia - led to record revenues of Dollars 2.08bn, up from Dollars 1.91bn last time. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.30, or Dollars 1.10 excluding the exceptional gain, compared with 96 cents a year earlier. In North America, Whirlpool increased its prices in all product categories and had to absorb further costs associated with the phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons from refrigerator products. But by maintaining its market share amid rapidly rising industry shipments, it increased operating profits from Dollars 120m to Dollars 137m. In Europe - a big market for Whirlpool since the completion of its Philips Electronics acquisition three years ago - the company suffered lower margins because of a shift in the sales mix towards cheaper appliances. But shipment gains 'significantly better' than the industry average of 2 per cent helped it achieve profits growth. with the reversal of Dollars 3m-Dollars 4m of warranty reserves now deemed unnecessary, it increased operating profits from Dollars 40m to Dollars 49m. Whirlpool added that it was about to announce across-the-board price increases of about 3 per cent on its European products. Total earnings from Latin America, though still relatively small, nearly doubled because of the strong performance of the group's Brazilian affiliates. Asia produced a 30 per cent increase in revenues but turned in a loss.</p>

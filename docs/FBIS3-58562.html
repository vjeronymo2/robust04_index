			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Istanbul, Jan. 15 (A.A) -- Government spokesman  and State Minister Yildirim Aktuna said today that his  government did not approve of the attitude of security forces  against the demonstrating public servants two days ago.    Many public servants were detained when they attempted to  protest the government for not recognizing their union rights  and increasing their salaries very little. The police roughed  up some of the demonstrators, and the scene was aired by a  private TV channel the same day.    In a press conference, Aktuna said security forces who were  on duty all over the country had their lives at stake in every  instance and these were people who were conscious of their job.    However, he said, they did not approve of the attitude of  the  security forces during the demonstrations.    "The importance, seriousness and weight of their duty do not  justify their sadistic and primitive behavior against our  people," he said.    "The government will make it sure that such behavior will  not  be repeated," he said.</p>

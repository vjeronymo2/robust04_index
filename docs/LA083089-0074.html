			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPROMISE ON FAMILY PLANNING MAY BE NEAR  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said Tuesday that counties -- rather than the  state -- may be asked to administer family planning programs under a compromise  plan aimed at restoring $24 million vetoed from the programs by Gov. George  Deukmejian.  </P> <P> But Brown said the governor wants to release the money in such a way that none  of it would be used for abortion counseling.  </P> <P> The San Francisco Democrat, who met later in the day with Deukmejian and other  party leaders from the Assembly and Senate, also disclosed during a Capitol  news conference that a compromise plan aimed at overhauling state solid waste  disposal programs is coming together.  </P> <P> Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) confirmed after the  meeting that the governor and key legislators "seem to be almost at the point  of settlement" on a major plan to meet California's growing problem of solid  waste disposal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> General Agreement  </P> <P> Sources close to the negotiations said there is general agreement on  legislation to revamp the California Waste Management Board and set a goal that  would require local governments to reduce garbage by 25%, in part by placing a  greater emphasis on recycling.  </P> <P> Legislative leaders have been meeting with Deukmejian in an effort to negotiate  agreements on family planning and solid waste disposal, as well as workers  compensation system reform, health insurance and other issues before the  Legislature adjourns for the year on Sept. 15.  </P> <P> As for family planning, Brown's comments confirmed reports circulating in the  Capitol for several weeks that the governor and legislators had warmed up to  the idea of allowing counties to disperse grants to finance family planning  programs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Abortion Counseling  </P> <P> "There seems to be some desire by the governor to restore the family planning  funds, but to do it in such a way that none of the monies can be used for  abortion counseling," Brown said.  </P> <P> Kevin Brett, the governor's press secretary, was noncommittal. "The governor  has indicated he is willing to discuss the subject of additional funds for  family planning but he hasn't made any promises," Brett said.  </P> <P> The family planning programs, administered by nonprofit agencies such as  Planned Parenthood, were set up to dispense birth control information. In  recent years, they have been drawn into the fight over abortion. Critics  contend that along with birth control information some agencies also provide  abortion counseling. In some cases, critics say the money goes to agencies that  also operate clinics that perform abortions.  </P> <P> Supporters say the programs help prevent unwanted pregnancies before women are  faced with a decision on abortion. They also say the clinics provide poor women  with an array of health services, including screening for cancer and sexually  transmitted diseases.  </P> <P> Basically, the idea behind the proposed compromise is to turn a political hot  potato over to counties.  </P> <P> Counties in the past have opposed such proposals. But county officials now  believe that taking responsibility for the programs may be the only way to save  the $24 million.  </P> <P> Larry E. Naake, director of the County Supervisors Assn. of California, said  counties still believe that the state is best suited to administer the program.  But Naake said his agency's executive committee decided Monday to accept  responsibility for the program as long as the family planning funds come to  counties with minimal strings attached. He said counties want to be free to  decide which agencies will receive the family planning grants.  </P> <P> On the question of solid waste disposal, Brown said there were only three major  issues that remained to be resolved -- at least from the perspective of  Assembly Democrats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Issues Identified  </P> <P> The Speaker identified the issues as decisions on the composition of the  proposed new solid waste management board, the levying of additional fees to  finance the new program and who will have overall responsibility for the solid  waste program.  </P> <P> Sources said a legislative task force composed of Republican and Democratic  legislators has basically agreed to eliminate the current nine-member  California Solid Waste Management Board, which lawmakers believe has been  ineffective in dealing with the problem of solid waste disposal. The present  board has been criticized for emphasizing landfills and incinerators for  disposing of garbage, without placing enough importance on recycling.  </P> <P> Deukmejian, however, has talked about placing added emphasis on incineration,  as long as it does not result in a net increase in air pollution.  </P> <P> While lawmakers are talking about requiring local agencies to reduce the amount  of waste by 25%, they are not yet considering a mandatory curbside recycling  program that would force Californians to separate their garbage prior to  collection. Deukmejian has said he would support requiring garbage separation.  Legislators believe that the 25% reduction requirement, in effect, would  require curbside recycling in many areas.  </P></p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / When the going gets tough . . .: Do the tough get going? The art of resignation To go, or not to go? That is the question raised anew by the controversy over the remuneration arrangements for Mr John Birt, director-general of the BBC. Both Mr Birt and Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the BBC board of governors, appear to have survived a chorus of calls for their heads in a manner which must inspire deep envy among others who have recently put their signatures at the bottom of resignation letters. In the UK, the events of the past fortnight will lead to a further round of soul-searching over the apparent failure of public figures to resign no matter what has gone wrong. Mr David Mellor, the arts minister who resigned last summer after an affair with an actress and revelations about a free holiday in Spain as the guest of the daughter of a senior figure within the PLO, might disagree with the common wisdom. So too might Mr Harvey Proctor, the Billericay MP forced to stand down in the 1987 general election after admitting charges of gross indecency. However, both individuals came to grief over their private lives. Not since the departure in 1982 of Lord Carrington, the foreign secretary, and two junior colleagues following the unexpected invasion of the Falklands Islands by Argentina has any minister felt it necessary to resign because of policy failures. So no one's head has rolled over sterling's ignominious departure from the exchange rate mechanism. Nor, yet, has anyone accepted responsibility for the events over the sale of arms to Iraq revealed by the Matrix-Churchill trial. The debacle over the pit closures has resulted in a sideways transfer of one senior civil servant, but the only people who have joined the unemployment register as a result are miners whose pits are to close. The rarity with which top people in British public life resign is in sharp contrast to what goes on in industry. Lord King was last month forced into premature retirement from the chairmanship of British Airways to bring an end to continuing controversy over the airline's dirty tricks campaign against Virgin Atlantic. Mr Bob Horton, chairman and chief executive of British Petroleum, was ousted in June, as profits fell. And last week Mr Christopher Heath, chairman of Baring Securities and once, reputedly, Britain's highest-paid executive, found himself unexpectedly spending more time with his family after a disagreement with the parent company's deputy chairman, Mr Andrew Tuckey. Overall, 1992 saw some 25 British senior executives leaving their companies unexpectedly, usually under the pressure of poor corporate performance. US business has also seen a series of high-level resignations, as investors have girded their loins to oust 'imperial' chief executives who had previously appeared impregnable. Last year, for example, Mr Robert Stempel resigned as chairman and chief executive of General Motors. This year, in one week in January alone, Mr John Akers stepped down as chief executive of IBM, Mr James Robinson left the same job at American Express, Mr Paul Lego went as chief executive of Westinghouse and PetroCanada's chief executive, Mr Wilbert Hopper, was 'relieved of responsibilities'. In Japan, resignation of top executives has become almost ritualised, as a form of penance for companies in trouble. In February, for example, Mr Akio Tanii resigned as president of Matsushita Electric, the world's largest consumer electronics group and owner of MCA, the US film studio. Mr Tanii said he was taking responsibility for the involvement of National Lease, a subsidiary, in a financial scandal that rocked Japan in the summer of 1991. 'I felt it was important to clarify responsibility for certain unfortunate matters that occurred during my presidency,' Mr Tanii said. Japanese politicians also follow this practice, to the extent that the ruling Liberal Democrats were in danger of running out of candidates for top jobs after the recent spate of corruption scandals. Under the presidency of Mr Bill Clinton, resignation among US politicians could also become much more common if the precedent of the confirmation hearings is to be followed. Two female candidates for attorney general resigned before reaching first base at the Justice Department because they had employed illegal immigrants as babysitters. Whatever the country or the job, there can be benefits in tendering a prompt resignation. Bob Horton, for example, has quickly found a new ship of industry to captain: he is chairman-designate of Railtrack, the state-owned body set up to run Britain's railway tracks after privatisation. Lord Callaghan, Britain's last Labour prime minister, is probably the best advertisement for taking the blame quickly and publicly. He resigned as chancellor of the exchequer in 1967, immediately after Britain's Labour government was forced to break a manifesto promise and devalue the pound. Shifted sideways to the post of home secretary, he later became foreign secretary, before reaching Downing Street as the first prime minister this century to have held all three great offices of state. But the BBC episode demonstrates that there is still plenty of scope for avoiding the big R in British public life. In that case, having a divided board has proved a great asset for Mr Birt and Mr Hussey. The failure of the BBC's directors to agree that they should go has been an important reason for their survival. Another valuable security device is the possibility of collective guilt which implicates as many others as possible in the issue in question. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor at the time of sterling's departure from the ERM, could rightly claim that his economic policy had been endorsed by the cabinet in general and the prime minister in particular. If he went, they went, the argument ran. Unsurprisingly, he stayed. Greater openness of government may encourage increased use of this stratagem. The publication of membership of cabinet committees makes it much clearer that responsibilities for bad political decisions is usually shared by several ministers. If all else fails, resignation can often be deferred until everyone has calmed down by setting up an inquiry. The inquiry set up into the arms for the Iraq affair is a case in point. Lord Justice Scott can be expected to apply his noted forensic skills to the inquiry, but his report will appear nine months or more after the events in question. By then, nobody is likely to feel the need to resign. The clear message, in the UK at least, is that people in public life can rarely be forced out if they keep their heads and the backing of the people who appoint them. If these conditions are met, premature departure can be avoided. Even when the press and media are in full pursuit - as in the case of the BBC and Mr Hussey - it is possible to frustrate the pack.</p>

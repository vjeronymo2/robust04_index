			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / How to Spend It: Designers with the future in their hands - A series of exhibitions which show the breadth and vitality of Britain's young talent WHETHER IT is a dining table or a button that you want to buy or commission, the New Designers exhibition promises to be a happy hunting ground. Here is the chance to see work by more than 1,000 of Britain's best graduates, the creme de la creme of designers from some 50 different colleges all over the country. If you want to buy contemporary jewellery, ceramics, glass, cushions, scarves - even furniture or a rug - there will be lots to choose from. Best of all the DTI (through Lady Denton, parliamentary under secretary of state for consumer affairs and small businesses) has invited some 7,000 industrialists to a preview for the first time since the exhibition started 10 years ago. For, though the exhibition is highly popular with consumers (last year about 14,000 people visited it), the response from industrialists has been deeply disappointing. This time the DTI is determined to make sure that those running Britain's manufacturing industries are aware of just how remarkable Britain's pool of design talent is. At the preview on July 14, Lady Denton will present awards worth Pounds 24,000 sponsored by industry and City livery companies. Not everything on display will be for sale - in among the jewellery and the ceramics, the glass and the furniture will be prototypes or paper designs which their designers will be anxiously hoping to sell to manufacturers. On the whole the experience of graduating designers is depressing - few British industrialists seem prepared to invest in employing a designer or in developing new products, in tooling or in the strong marketing that new products require. Over the last few years this has meant increasing numbers of design graduates have had to set up in business themselves, doing everything from sub-contracting the manufacturing and overseeing the development of their products to trying to market them. Many young design businesses founder because they cannot do all these tasks and because they often cannot afford to promote and market their products internationally. To try and help them I started New Designers in Business last year. This informal group of 60 fledgling design businesses with distinctly slim funding (a mere Pounds 15,000 from sponsorship), has already taken part in 11 international trade fairs including New York, Amsterdam, Dubai and Cologne. Petter Southall, a Dorset furniture designer, says: 'Our business owes its existence to NDB's help with exhibitions and press coverage. Last year our turnover increased by 30 per cent and 60 per cent of our total turnover was due directly or indirectly to NDB.' Helen Sayer, a Birmingham textile designer, was spotted at an exhibition by a Japanese company and won a Pounds 6,000 order for banners. A German car manufacturer commissioned Pounds 45,000 worth of chairs from furniture designers Tom Layton and Alan Perks of FiT and Neil Bottle has exported Pounds 45,000 worth of textiles to the Far East and the US. You can see work by these designers at another exhibition, New Designers in Business at Wolff Olins (Regents Wharf, All Saints Street, London N1), by the canal behind Kings Cross five minutes from the Business Design Centre. The NDB collection is open on 15 and 16 July (10am to 5pm) to coincide with the two Business Design Centre exhibitions - and thereafter by appointment. It will have work by 60 new designers who have graduated over the last three years. All the work is in production and it includes a wide range of domestic artefacts from furniture, lighting, ceramics, glass to textiles and metalwork. Also at the Business Design Centre is a second smaller exhibition, 'One Year On', of the work of 25 graduates, some of last year's 'New Designers' who have set up in business. One trend evident at all three exhibitions is experimentation with metals - mild steel, sheet metal, tubular steel, aluminium, bronze, brass, copper, silver, gold and pewter - and with techniques for colouring and patinating. For many years designers have concentrated on casting metal but now they are rediscovering the pleasures of working this malleable material. Sophie Wilkinson, a 'One Year On' exhibitor, says: 'Metal is a substantial material, not easily destroyed which can be worked in many different ways - you can forge, weld, hammer, emboss, bend, cut and decorate it.' Sophie, a Middlesex University graduate, makes decorative bowls from scrap steel. She plasma-cuts old ballcock valves and patinates them in subtle coppers and bronzes, blues and greens. The new metalwork varies enormously. On view at 'New Designers' are fine pieces of jewellery sitting side by side with large scale architectural work. Particularly striking are three large sculptures in forged steel by Peter Clarke, incorporating copper, bronze and gilded metals. They include a weather vane and a bird's station - the bird's nest is in the shape of an egg, and metal leaves act as water collectors for the bird baths. Peter, aged 40, is one of a growing number of mature students. He spent most of his life in the cloth trade. After being made redundant he did a foundation course at Sir John Cass and a 3-D metal course at Camberwell College of Arts. He hopes that through 'New Designers' more people will see and like his work and that more commissions will come his way. By contrast (but illustrating the breadth of the Camberwell course), Eleanor Kearney is developing a range of pewter tableware. She did her own market research on companies which still manufacture pewter and approached Wentworth the Pewterers in Sheffield, who were prepared to make a prototype of her teapot (for sale at Pounds 220). She hopes to batch-produce the teapot, develop a tea service for manufacture and start a mail-order service to bring the price down. Kent Institute of Art &amp; Design's excellent silversmithing course has regularly produced winners of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths' awards at New Designers. Two winners, Steve Ottewill and Justin Richardson, who have just set up in business together, will be exhibiting their magnificent silver tableware, including water jugs and goblets, in the 'One Year On' exhibition. In the same exhibition is a fully operational telephone, encased in a 5 ft tall welded steel man, which encapsulates the philosophy of many new designers - to make every-day objects interesting to look at and a pleasure to use. What a client-catcher in, say, an advertising office] Jane Atfield, who graduated from the RCA last year, is one of the disappointingly few designers currently experimenting with recycled materials - she uses brightly-coloured plastics for her chairs and rags for the upholstery. If the end of the last decade saw an explosion of new metalwork, the 1990s may herald a new product age. Watch out for the product designers on the Brunel, Sheffield and Teeside University stands at 'New Designers.' Perhaps this time next year production Patrick Johnson's fibre-optic cable security system, Sarah Beattie's hand-held sewing machine and Christopher Dumont's portable coffee maker will all be in production. But who will be producing them? New Designers and One Year On are on at the Business Design Centre, 52 Upper Street, Islington, London N1 from 15 to 18 July. Opening hours are from 10am-8pm on July 15, from 10 am to 6 pm on 16 and 17 July and from 10 am to 4 pm on 18 July. New Designers is sponsored and organised by the Business Design Centre. New Designers in Business is at Wolff Olins, 10 Regents Wharf, All Saints Street, London N1 on 15 and 16 July from 10am to 5pm and thereafter by appointment with Peta Levi (fax 071-435-5487). One Year On will go to the Spacex Gallery, 45 Preston Street, Exeter EX1 1DF from 6 August to 4 September where it will be open from Tues-Sat, 10am to 5pm.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Seven-year audit limit proposed for accountancy partners PARTNERS in accountancy firms should not work on the audit of listed and public interest companies for more than seven years at a time, draft guidance from the UK and Irish chartered accountancy bodies suggested yesterday. Firms should rotate partners periodically to maintain objectivity, according to a consultation paper published by the joint ethics committee of the institutes of chartered accountants in England and Wales and of Scotland and Ireland. The proposals echo recommendations made in the Cadbury report on the financial aspects of corporate governance released during the summer. They are open to comment until the end of the year. More radical calls for the audit firm itself to be changed every few years have not been taken up. Auditors strongly opposed this idea, arguing that most fraud occurs just after a change because the new firm is unfamiliar with the company. Previous ethical guidelines have recommended rotation, but have not specified a period. The new guidance makes it mandatory. The committee says involvement with the same client over a long period might lead to continuing acceptance of practices which are no longer acceptable, excessive reliance being placed on directors' assurances and explanations, an unwillingness to face tough issues and reliance on an out-dated approach to audit. It says rotation will provide the client with a fresh, objective scrutiny, promote impartiality and help professional development. The document says 'public interest independence' should be seen to be achieved, rather than just be claimed as a result of professional training, attitudes and procedures. Mr Jock Worsley, chairman of the committee, said he needed 'little convincing of the possible merit of rotation of partners and staff'. In separate proposed guidance the committee lays down strict terms concerning partners in accountancy firms who join a company which is an audit client. It says they should immediately inform their firm of their intentions to move and take no part in the audit of their future employer. They should sever all connections with the firm. It does not suggest a 'quarantine' period between leaving the firm and joining an audit client, but has asked for views on the subject. In a third consultation document on changes in accountancy firms used by clients, the committee says firms must provide accountancy information to their successors even when there is an outstanding dispute on fees.</p>

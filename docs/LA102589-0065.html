			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 WOUNDED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING AT GAS STATION  </P> <P> Two Los Angeles men were shot and wounded Tuesday morning in a gang-related  drive-by shooting in front of a Westchester gas station near the intersection  of Sepulveda Boulevard and Manchester Avenue, police said.  </P> <P> Joe Johnson Jr., 20, and Troy Kimble, 19, were walking along Sepulveda  Boulevard about 10:50 a.m. when two men in a white car pulled up and yelled,  "This is Rolling 60s," the name of a Los Angeles gang, said Lt. Ron Dena of the  Los Angeles Police Department's anti-gang unit.  </P> <P> As the pair tried to run to the Unocal 76 station, Kimble was shot once and  Johnson suffered multiple gunshot wounds, according to Lt. Ron Moen of the  LAPD's Pacific Division.  </P> <P> Johnson was in critical but stable condition after surgery at UCLA Medical  Center, Moen said. Kimble was in good condition at Daniel Freeman-Marina  Hospital with a gunshot wound in the thigh, said a hospital spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Following the shooting, the assailants sped south on Sepulveda Boulevard.  </P> <P> Initially, the victims told police that they were shot in a robbery attempt as  they stood at a bus stop in front of the gas station, according to Moen. The  men also told police that Johnson was in the area job-hunting and that Kimble,  a friend, had accompanied him.  </P> <P> "They later changed their story," Moen said. "Now, I don't know what they were  doing over there."  </P> <P> The manager of the gas station, who witnessed the shooting, said Kimble told  him and other attendants that the assailants were gang members from nearby  Westchester High School.  </P></p>

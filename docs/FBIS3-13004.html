At the meeting, Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Adamishin,  said: Russia seeks to use its good relations with Iran to  resolve regional crises, including the Tajik crisis, because we  do not see any need for a military solution in Tajikistan.  Therefore Iran and Russia are able, through using their  influence, to establish peace and tranquillity in the region.  He added: Iran and Russia have strategic interests in  Tajikistan.    Mr. Velayati, while describing today's meeting of the Tajik  opposition leaders and Russian officials in Tehran as important,  considered it to be a turning point in resolving the Tajik  crisis and said: The Islamic Republic of Iran supports any  solution which will maintain the national interests of the Tajik  people.    He added: The resolution of the Tajik crisis through  military  means is impossible. Therefore the only way to establish a fair  and honorable peace is by peaceful means.    At the meeting, the issue of increasing regional cooperation  -- especially the Organization for the Cooperation of the  Caspian Sea Littoral States -- was discussed and the Russian  deputy foreign minister declared his country's readiness for the  earliest possible convening of a meeting of the Organization's  senior experts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It seems that the scale of comprehensive economic  measures, which the government will announce soon, will reach  some 15.1 trillion yen in total, the largest ever. The package  will consist of 5.7 trillion yen in tax reductions, including  income and resident tax cuts and expansion of housing-related  tax system, and 9.4 trillion yen in public investment and loans,  such as public works projects. A possibility of studying new  measure -- designed to liquidate interest reduction and  exemption bonds payable to nonbank and other companies by  selling them to bond purchasing companies to urge private  financial institutions to deal with bad bonds they have -- will  be incorporated in the package. However, the process of  coordinating views among the ruling parties on the issue of  finding financial sources to cover a shortfall, which will be  created by tax reductions, is experiencing rough sailing.  Because of this, there is a possibility that the total amount of  the package may change depending on the outcome of the  coordination process.    The details of the public investment and loans in the  comprehensive economic measures are: 5 trillion yen for "public  investments," 2.8 trillion yen for purchasing land before  mapping out utilization plans for it to activate land  transactions, and 1.3 trillion yen for helping  small-to-medium-sized enterprises.    Of the 5 trillion yen for public investments, 2.9 trillion  yen will be allocated for additional general public works  projects and public corporations' projects for fiscal 1993.  Regarding expenses for improving facilities, additional 600  billion yen will be earmarked mainly for education, research,  and medical services. The government will ask the  municipalities to increase the amount of public works projects,  which local governments will carry out independently, by about  300 billion yen. Amount of the Housing Loan Corporation's  housing loans will be increased by 1.2 trillion yen, which is  enough to cover loans for 70,000 housing units.    Of the 2.8 trillion yen for purchasing land before mapping  out utilization plans for it, 500 billion yen will be secured  for purchases of new land for general urban development  projects. Land purchases for these projects will be made through  a private [minkan] organization for promotion of urban  development.</p>

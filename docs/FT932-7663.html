			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Japanese trade surplus 'likely to decline' JAPAN'S Ministry of International Trade and Industry has responded to growing criticism of the country's massive trade surplus with a report which argues that it is likely to decline in the long run because of changes in Japanese society and corporate organisations. In its annual white paper on trade submitted to the cabinet yesterday, Japanese trade officials rebut the argument that the country's trade surplus is a result of its closed markets. The report strongly criticises results-oriented approaches to solving trade issues, which it says leads to protectionism, and calls for greater co-operation between countries to promote a multilateral approach to world trade. The Japanese position on its trade surplus and proposals to deal with the problem through a multilateral, free-market approach comes as the Clinton administration has stepped up pressure on Japan to adopt a more 'managed' approach in tackling its trade surplus. The US has recently been showing impatience with its inability to reduce its trade deficit with Japan, which grew for the 28th consecutive month to Dollars 10.25bn (Pounds 6.6bn) from Dollars 7.11bn a year ago. Miti's white paper argues that the common perception of Japan's trade surplus as being due to the closed nature of markets is mistaken. Its recent increase, according to Miti, is due to a number of factors unrelated to the openness of its markets, such as the appreciation of the yen and weaker oil prices, which make up for about half of the rise in the surplus since 1990. At the same time, the recent rise of the surplus is due to the fall in imports resulting from the bursting of the Japanese economic bubble. Miti also argues that Japanese competitiveness in certain industries is what lies behind Japan's surpluses in those specific sectors rather than the closed nature of these markets as claimed by some. The ministry further questions the view that having a trade surplus is damaging to the world economy. It says that in order to tackle the trade imbalance a re-evaluation of the nature and effect of trade surpluses and multi-lateral co-operation in promoting economic growth is needed.</p>

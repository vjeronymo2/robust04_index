			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Steep invalidity payments rise triggers off scrutiny WHILE public spending has increased by half in the past five years, invalidity benefits have doubled. That gives ministers good reason to examine this area of social security as part of the effort to tackle the fiscal deficit - likely to be Pounds 50bn this financial year - without further increases in taxation. In 1992-93 invalidity benefits cost the taxpayer Pounds 6.1bn out of social security spending of Pounds 79.2bn. Five years earlier invalidity payments came to Pounds 3bn compared with total outlays on social security of Pounds 48.9bn. Invalidity benefits now account for nearly 8 per cent of the cost of social security, up from 6 per cent in 1987-88. The number of people receiving these allowances have increased from 1m five years ago to 1.5m last year. On the basis of the most recent Department of Social Security forecasts, the numbers will reach 1.77m by 1995-96. For all the obvious political risks involved, the idea of cutting these payments has some practical advantages. Invalidity benefits add up to one of the larger areas of social security spending, which accounts for almost a third of total government spending. Efforts to reduce state pensions - responsible for nearly half the social security bill - or child benefits would provoke outcries from a wide cross-section of society. Targeting invalidity benefits may be less politically risky. There are three main ways to cut the benefits: make them taxable, crack down on the criteria used when handing them out or cut them. The benefits are typically paid to men in their 50s who have lost their jobs and are seen by social security officials as unfit for work. While a person on unemployment benefit gets about Pounds 45 a week, if he or she can be categorised as unfit for work the sum goes up to Pounds 56. An extra Pounds 12 allowance is available if the man or woman is under 40. Evidence weighed up includes a written assessment from the individual's doctor and, significantly, the likelihood of employers hiring them. During the recession, which has been accompanied by a steep rise in unemployment, individuals with even mild disabilities have been less likely to get jobs. That has been both because of the large numbers of able-bodied people on the jobs market and because employers struggling to cut costs are less prone to make allowances for people capable of working anything less than flat-out. In the 1980s a person on invalidity benefit might after a year or two have been able to find a job and leave the social security register. In recent years this has been far more difficult. Ministers suspect that doctors find it hard to resist pleas to certify patients as unfit to work. They are considering a more rigorous medical test to target the benefit on the genuine sick and disabled. A second reason why the numbers of people on these allowances has risen is probably because they pay more than unemployment benefits.</p>

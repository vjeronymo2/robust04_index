			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Observer: Reprieve for the B-men Whatever a young man's fancy may be turning to this unsettled British spring, the thoughts of top Treasury mandarins are turning inward. Even the recession, which they are under fire for under-estimating, is taking second place to their job security. Labour voices have been direly hinting that, should their party win on Thursday, the axe will fall on those sundry heads at Great George Street that are deemed too closely associated with Conservative rule. And the fiercest speculation centres on three former London Business School economists. One of them, tax expert Bill Robinson who took over last year as a political adviser to Chancellor Lamont, is tipped for the chop instanter - a fate at least a shade unfair, since he has lots of ideas and is not even a Tory supporter. But the outlook seems brighter for the other two: the Treasury's permanent secretary Sir Terry Burns, and his old friend Alan Budd ensconced last September as the government's chief economic adviser. True, both the 'B-men' are regarded with less than total esteem by some of those with a say in Labour's economics strategy who would like Budd, at least, replaced by an economist more overtly sympathetic to the party. Names being bandied around include David Currie, head of the LBS's centre for economic forecasting, and Oxford don Chris Allsop who, besides having worked for the Bank of England, was on the shortlist for the chief adviser's job last year. But the Labour elite has plumped for the view that axing Burns and Budd sharpish would set nerves on edge in financial markets, not to mention the dangers of losing two wise heads Labour might need to see it through choppy waters ahead.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Little supervision for computer games Parents offer surprisingly little guidance to their children over the types of computer games they play, according to a study by Aston University for Elspa, the European Leisure Software Publisher's Association. According to the study only 3 per cent of children reported any parental guidance regarding the type of games they played, compared with 58 per cent who reported that their parents determined the type of television programmes they watched. However, the report showed parents were keen to restrict the time their children play computer games. Elspa: UK, 0386 830642.</p>

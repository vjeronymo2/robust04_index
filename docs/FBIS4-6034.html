			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  editorials carried by ROK vernacular newspapers on 16 April on  the ROK Government's withdrawal of the demand for an exchange of  envoys before the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "Aftermath of the Abandonment of the Proposal  that Special Envoys Be Exchanged Before U.S.-North Korean Talks."    The editorial reports that the exchange of special envoys  was  "not an idea from which one can expect much." It then writes:  "We must be wary of the possibility that U.S.-North Korean  talks will proceed toward the direction of turning a blind eye  to North Korea's possible possession of one or two nuclear  weapons."    The editorial continues: "If U.S.-North Korean talks are  held as a result of the ROK Government's abandonment of the  proposal that special envoys be exchanged before U.S.-North  Korean talks, those talks must provide ways to ensure the  transparency of the North Korean nuclear issue." It concludes:  "We must show North Korea that its efforts toward a military  buildup in the post-cold war era will only hasten its own  destruction."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "Abandonment of the Exchange of Special  Envoys and the Reformulation of Policies."    The editorial reports that from the beginning the special  envoy exchange plan was unrealistic and inefficient and that  even if the North and South had exchanged special envoys, those  envoys would have merely been busy visiting the North and South.    The editorial continues: "The ROK Government must  consolidate cooperative relations with the United States and  propose North-South dialogue to North Korea, separately from  U.S.-North Korean negotiations, to resume the operation of the  North-South Joint Nuclear Control Committee to ensure that the  North and South pursue mutual inspections and achieve the  denuclearization of this region." The editorial continues that  the "ROK Government must boldly allow North-South economic  cooperation" if North Korea accepts inspections from the  International Atomic Energy Agency and special inspections of  its two unreported facilities.    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an  800-word  editorial entitled "We Must Lead North Korea to Dialogue."    The editorial describes the government's abandonment of the  special envoy plan as an "important change" in the policy toward  North Korea. The editorial writes that the abandonment of the  special envoy plan can serve as an "efficient means to pressure  North Korea," adding: "This is because this may warn North  Korea that if it rejects reforms and opening up and pursues its  nuclear program, its system can be shaken entirely. It is  important for us to find means to lead North Korea to beg for  dialogue with South Korea."    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "North Korea Must Take Corresponding  Measures."    The editorial first writes that the government's abandonment  of the special envoy plan can serve as a "breakthrough in  resolving the North Korean nuclear issue." It then asks the  related government ministries to realize that North Korea's  "ultimate goal is to buy time to develop nuclear weapons, rather  than merely using the nuclear card in diplomacy." The editorial  concludes: "As long as the reason we abandoned the exchange of  special envoys is clear, North Korea must take corresponding  measures as a matter of course. It must unconditionally receive  additional inspections by early May as demanded by the UN  Security Council president's statement. It must no longer try  to get concessions from the United States and leave South Korea  out in the cold."</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (15): A pygmy with giant potential - The telephone system is being slowly restructured and widened Residents of India's biggest cities can expect to wait up to five years for a telephone connection to their house. Getting an outside line from an international hotel can sometimes seem as slow. As increasing numbers of people clamour for phones and tire of cross-lines and break downs the Indian Government is getting down to the business of dragging the service into a new age. There is ample evidence around Delhi that foreign and domestic companies believe that the cracks in the government's protective wall are about to widen to expose one of the potentially two biggest markets in the world for telecommunications. International seminars on the industry, visiting delegations to local companies and the creation of new Asian headquarters in Delhi for multinational groups are signals of change. Mr N. Vittal, the chairman of the Telecom Commission, is the man in charge of throwing open the industry to competition by breaking the grip of the protective Department of Telecommunications (DoT). His energetic style and commitment to liberalisation has earned Mr Vittal, during his five months as chairman, the nickname, the 'DoT breaker'. However wide his support is in industry and broad sections of government, the first important test of his authority will come early next month when the government is expected to hand down its decision on his policy review. Although already delayed by two months, Mr Vittal is confident about the chances for his plan. He will not discuss its details but speaks as a man who believes he has the tide of opinion running with him. 'It (his plan) is being considered by the highest level of government and we are waiting for approval,' he says. Industry feels that the government will broadly embrace Mr Vittal's proposals but they will be tempered by opposition from unions and the DoT which want a more gradual and highly regulated entry of private capital. For example, there is a widespread feeling that the companies will, initially at least, be stopped from access to the creation of telephone networks in major population centres. Instead they will be offered opportunities in semi-urban and industrial development areas where infrastructure spending will be higher and the demand less. Mr Sunil Mittal, the managing director of Bharti Telecom which is bidding for a relatively small network licence in the Punjab with New Zealand Telecom, says that the big cities are 'the holy cows of the Department of Telecommunications'. 'Mr Vittal's plans may not go straight through. It may take some time. But there is no doubt that things are happening,' he says. The potential demand and investment requirement are enormous. India lags well behind developing Asian countries in terms of lines per capita. For example, Malaysia has 10 lines per 100 inhabitants and Thailand four while India has 0.68, placing it slightly behind China, India's main rival for foreign investment, with 0.73. India's 200m strong middle class are the target. Servicing the immediate demand of the market would call for a rise in the number of lines from the existing 7m to 20m, according to the government. There are 3m people waiting for telephones, Mr Vittal says. 'It is the DoT's experience that the moment the waiting list is removed, a larger waiting list springs up.' A rise to 20m telephones would call for the investment of Dollars 13bn. The more optimistic in the industry believe that the installation of 23m lines by the turn of the century is achievable. Applications for 23 networks have been received, although some of these are seen as not much more than expressions of interest. In addition to network applications, the liberalisation has opened up the market for parts and equipment in anticipation of expanding installations. Leading domestic groups including RP Goenka, YK Modi, Tata Electronics and Bharti Telecom, are positioning themselves to expand rapidly. While at the same time international groups ranging from Northern Telecom, US West, Motorola, Ericsson, Alcatel, AT&amp;T, France Telecom, British Telecom, Siemens to New Zealand Telecom are also active. In many cases local companies are linking in joint ventures to establish networks with international companies or are forming technological exchange tie ups or direct purchase agreements. US West has made one of the more ambitious proposals to set up a fixed wireless and fibre optic network in non-urban areas of Tamil Nadu, the south eastern state. If approved by the government the bid, made on a non-exclusive basis leaving the door open to other potential operators, would call for a direct investment of Dollars 100m, subject to US West board approval. The role that DoT could play in this new, liberalised climate is unclear and subject to intense speculation. A break-up of the department along regional lines is the most likely first step, perhaps with the disposal of at least part of each segment to private investors. There are indications that the department is boosting its own efficiency. Long seen as one of the most bloated arms of government, productivity has risen during the past three years by holding staff levels down to 480,000 while the number of telephone lines has risen from 4m to 7m. An important first stage of the privatisation of the Indian telecommunications system came with the first sale of a stake in Videsh Sanchar Nigam, the country's international service provider. The government sold a 12 per cent in early 1992 and this could be reduced to 52 per cent by the end of the year. The company is in the process of making a Dollars 1bn international equity issue as part of this plan, the biggest ever made by an India company. To oversee competition in this less regulated atmosphere the government is establishing a Telecommunications Regulatory Authority which will include members from outside the DoT. Mr Vittel points to the promotion of value-added services, in particular cellular telephones and paging services as others signs of deregulation. However, this process as commenced inauspiciously. The granting of the first eight licences for cellular networks, each of which was a joint bid with a foreign partner, in the four biggest cities has landed in the Indian High Court amid allegations from those among the 22 unsuccessful bidders of corruption, mismanagement and nepotism. The long-overdue high court ruling and the government's decision on Mr Vittal's recommendations are keenly awaited.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- TELEPHONE DISTRIBUTION IN INDIA AND OTHER ASIAN STATES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Country        Population (m)       Total main        Lines per 100                                    phones lines        inhabitants  --------------------------------------------------------------------- INDIA             849.64               5,810              0.68 Bangladesh        118.75               249.8              0.21 Indonesia         187.77             1,276.6              0.68 Pakistan          115.52             1,116.1              0.97 Philippines        62.87               647.9              1.03 Thailand           56.92             1,553.2              2.73 Vietnam            68.18                 100              0.15 China           1,150.09               8,451              0.73 Rep of Korea       43.27            14,572.6             33.68 Singapore           2.76             1,101.1             39.85  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: ITU, UN, South Pacific Commission  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

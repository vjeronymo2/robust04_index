			<p>BFN     [Text] On 28 March, the National Army of Democratic  Kampuchea [NADK], in cooperation with the people, launched a  commando attack on the Sala Krau position, killing seven enemy  soldiers and seizing seven AK assault rifles. The remaining  enemy troops were forced to retreat into the jungle.    On 29 March, the NADK attacked the 12th Division, which was  temporarily stationed at Sala Krau. The fighting lasted five  and a half hours. While the NADK was attacking the unit, four  T-54 tanks and 200 ground troops were sent to help their  companions. However, we killed 24 of them and wounded several  others. We also burned two T-54 tanks, captured two others, and  destroyed two military trucks. We also recaptured and reoccupied  the summit of Srang Hill. We will continue to attack and  destroy the remaining enemy troops at Sala Krau.</p>

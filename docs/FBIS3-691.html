Apart from the thousands of people running and toyi-toying  [protest dancing] down the Lucas Mangope Highway, people in  cars, minibuses and others piled on trucks were blaring horns  and displaying the clenched fist black power salute. Police  presence was at an absolute minimum with only three police cars  seen hurrying towards [words indistinct] Bophuthatswana's  reincorporation into South Africa.    Two Bop police Hippos outside the university in Mmabatho  were  all that remained of evidence of the intense confrontation  between students and police in the past three days. The only  policemen at the scene was standing on the armoured police  personnel carrier and using the vehicle's public address system  to repeat over and over: "We want peace".    Thousands of people headng towards an African National  Congress [words indisticnt] were shouting: "We have done it. We  have brought the government to its knees."</p>

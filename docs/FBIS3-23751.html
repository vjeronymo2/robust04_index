Shaymiyev, president of the Republic of </F> Tatarstan, at Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan 19th  Session on 7 February 1994: "The Socioeconomic and Political  Situation in the Republic"]    [Text] Esteemed People's Deputies!    Examining the results of 1993 in the sphere of the economy,  it may be said that together with individual positive changes,  many of the negative trends of 1992 persisted. Stability in the  economy has not, unfortunately, come about. The financial  position of practically all major commodity producers at the  present time is critical.    You all know the detailed results of the operation of the  republic's economy--they have been published in the press. This  January we held a whole number of working meetings with the  directors of enterprises of all sectors, with the participation  of the administration heads and the chairmen of the standing  commissions of the Supreme Soviet, which made a frank analysis  of the state of the economy and an assessment of the progress of  the economic reforms. As a result the government charted paths  of the gradual stabilization of production in particular sectors  of industry.    The results of 1993 show that the decline in industrial  production as a whole compared with 1992 constituted 14.9  percent, which was somewhat better than in the Russian  Federation, where the decline constituted 16.2 percent. It has  to be considered here that the decline in the extractive sectors  (oil and gas) was brought about by objective, natural factors  and had been forecast by us. A telling factor in the decline in  production in machine building was the situation following the  fire at the Kama Truck Plant (the Kama Truck Plant accounts for  3.1 percent of the decline). In a number of sectors here, in the  agro-industrial complex primarily, the decline was halted, as a  result of which an increase in production of 5.7 percent, not  counting alcoholic products, was achieved in 1993 in food  production, and, counting alcoholic products, the growth  constituted 7.3 percent. An appreciable increase in volume was  achieved in sugar (13.8 percent) and meat (1.1) industry and in  the production of animal oil (22.1 percent), cheese (18.6  percent), confectionery (4.7 percent), and nonalcoholic  beverages (21.3 percent). At the same time, on the other hand,  on account of reduced consumer demand there was somewhat of a  decline in the production of whole-milk products and bakery and  macaroni items.    Some 984,000 tonnes of grain, 837,000 tonnes of sugar beet,  122,000 tonnes of potatoes, 82,000 tonnes of vegetables, 1.149  million tonnes of milk, 232,000 tonnes of livestock and poultry,  and 752 million eggs were procured for state resources, which  was considerably in excess of the volume of purchases in the  preceding year. The volume of production and procurements which  was achieved makes it possible to preserve the current level of  consumption of the basic foodstuffs in the republic. It should  be noted here that only two or three regions of Russia achieved  an increase in the production and procurements of farming and  animal husbandry products.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rate of Growth of Purchases of Animal Husbandry Products in 1993 (as a Per-|  |centage of 1992)                                                           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Livestock and pou-|Milk              |Eggs              |  |                  |ltry              |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Russia            |85                |94                |99.5              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Republic of Tatar-|107               |109               |104               |  |stan              |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Samara Oblast     |86                |96                |101               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ulyanovsk Oblast  |100.9             |107               |108               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Republic of Mari  |88                |103               |106               |  |El                |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chuvash Republic  |83                |105               |90                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kirov Oblast      |88                |95                |96                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Udmurt Oblast     |91                |97                |113               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Republic of Bashk-|104               |106               |104               |  |ortostan          |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      The positive results in the agrarian sector were achieved  primarily thanks to the labor of our villagers and the active  assistance of the state. The budget assumed half the expenditure  on an increase in the fertility of the land and the outlays on  reclamation, the construction of facilities of the social  infrastructure of the countryside, the support of seed growing  and pedigree breeding, the building of enterprises of food and  processing industry, the development of science, and certain  other measures. Some R156 billion of budget appropriations were  channeled to this end in the past year. As a result a gross  product 2 percent greater than in 1992 was produced. Meat, milk,  and egg production increased. The biggest harvest of grain crops  in the republic's history (approximately 23 quintals per  hectare) was obtained. Seeds and forage were laid in in the full  requirement, and the requisite quantity of grain for food was  sold on account of remuneration of the kolkhoz members and  sovkhoz workers. Thus the efforts of the government and many  outfits in the past year produced certain positive results in  respect to the stabilization of the economic situation in a  number of life-sustaining sectors of the republic.    Sociopolitical stability, the basis of which is the active  policy of social protection of the populace, which has been in  effect since the start of the reforms and which has recently  been specially targeted and perfected, has been preserved in the  republic. Our approaches to these problems are being studied by  many regions and are being perceived positively.    The two years of radical reforms have shown that the course  chosen by the federal authorities is incapable of extricating  the economy from crisis, which has led everyone to the  conclusion of the need for certain corrections. Now, as we all  know, a new course is being devised. Whatever the corrections,  it is clear that the reforms begun in 1992 have reached a depth  at which they have become irreversible. And we must regard this  as a positive result.    What are the main landmarks of the reforms?    First, a partial price liberalization was undertaken. The  abandonment of government regulation of prices switched  inflation from a concealed state to an open form, which afforded  an opportunity for correctly evaluating the state of the economy  at the macro- and micro-levels.    Second, partial convertibility of the ruble was introduced.  The fluctuations in the ruble exchange rate became an indicator  and an actual instrument regulating the movement of capital and,  partially, the dynamics of prices.    Third, the privatization process began. A basic package of  laws of primary privatization was prepared and began to operate.  Approximately one-half of property has already been privatized,  in fact. It is still too early to speak of the efficiency of the  activity of the privatized enterprises on account of the short  amount of time they have been operating under the new  conditions. But it may be affirmed even now that neither price  liberalization nor privatization will in themselves resolve the  problems of efficiency and that they should merely create the  conditions and motives for the change and adaptation of the  structure of production to market conditions of functioning. The  following additional conditions are essential for this, in turn:  financial stabilization and the possibility of the unrestricted  transfer of capital. But we do not have this yet. It is  essential, therefore, to create a secondary securities market,  expand the circulation of bills, and so forth.    At the same time appreciable flaws have been discerned in  the  reforms: the reforms have been implemented mainly via  instruments of macroeconomic policy, which has proven entirely  insufficient, and have led merely to fragmentary changes in the  conditions of the functioning of the economy, which has  engendered a number of new problems. Thus it has become  increasingly obvious that financial stabilization will not be  achieved while the current policy is preserved since the  struggle has been conducted not against the main causes of  inflation but against its secondary factors. Inflation has  assumed a steady, self-reproducing nature so that even were  there a general mutual offsetting of arrears, the situation  would in a very short space of time be what it was formerly,  only at a new twist of the inflation spiral. Although there  needs to be financial support for the priority areas even now,  otherwise a severe recession and increased unemployment await us.    Reality itself has brought about an understanding of the  truth that without the profound structural reorganization of the  entire economy it will be impossible to emerge from the crisis  slump. Whence also another conclusion: A structural  reorganization of the cumbersome monopolized economic system  that has taken shape over many decades cannot be undertaken  rapidly, by radical measures, with the use merely of financial  instruments at the macroeconomic level.    An escape from the impasse and real stabilization under the  conditions of the evolved economy require an entirely different  level of work of the state organs of administration. A  surmounting of the cost-no-object nature of the economy and  arrival at a sufficient level of competitiveness are possible  only with the painstaking, persevering, and quite long-term work  of the state at the macro- and micro-economic levels. The  development of market reforms thus requires not a weakening but  a strengthening of state influence on the economy, and it is  production that is in need of this first and foremost.    A certain amount of work is being performed in this  direction  in Tatarstan. A concept of structural transformations of the  economy of the republic has been devised. True, it also requires  considerable modification. Even today we can speak about certain  experience of the interaction of the government authorities on  the structural reorientation of enterprises of the  military-industrial complex of the Republic of Tatarstan based  on the competitive selection and realization of business  projects for specific areas encompassing sectors of the  agro-industrial complex, the construction complex, the  production of health-care equipment, and certain others. We  attempted for the first time to link structural changes in the  republic's economy with work at the level of specific  enterprises with regard to the economic expediency of the  projects and the timeframe of their cost recovery and the return  of invested capital.    All these efforts made by the government of the republic  unilaterally are undoubtedly insufficient for compensating for  the wholesale reduction in government contracts for enterprises  of the military-industrial complex. The reduction has proceeded  at an increasing tempo: 22 percent in 1991, 44 percent in 1992,  and 41 percent in 1993. The federal authorities have constantly  reneged on their commitments pertaining to the funding of  conversion measures. Use has been made even of a highly original  method of "combating" inflation--the Government of the Russian  Federation has simply not paid for the defense hardware product  which it had ordered and which has been manufactured. The total  arrears on the manufactured product in 1993 amount to more than  R33 billion.    We are at the present time continuing to work with the  Government of the Russian Federation at various levels to  resolve the accumulated urgent problems. In January 1994 the  government of the republic concluded an agreement with the  Mashinoeksport Association, which had expressed a readiness to  invest and participate in the realization of 18 innovation and  conversion projects. The agreement determined over 70 items of  interest for sale on the external market. All this is  exceptionally important for the survival of our major  enterprises and design bureaus under the conditions of  transition to the market.    Market reforms have spotlighted the low efficiency of many  industries. Thus the attempt to approximate the price of energy  to the world price brought the price of oil to the present  R50,000-60,000 a tonne. This is still less than half the average  world price. But even here the price of the finished product of  many sectors consuming energy as raw material is either very  approximate to the world price or has already surpassed it. The  main reasons for this phenomenon are low productivity and high  unproductive outlays.    It should be observed that there has been practically no  growth in productivity since the start of the reforms and that  it has declined even at many enterprises. In the republic's  industry as a whole the level of productivity in 1993  constituted 89.7 percent of the 1992 level.    Many people are preferring not to recall this indicator  even.  Yet only a replacement of fixed capital with higher productivity  can ensure a way out of the crisis under the conditions of the  market. Nature has simply not devised any other mechanisms of  the economy reaching the phase of upturn. The sooner, therefore,  that we abandon illusions in the mythical expectation of  everything being "resolved of its own accord," the sooner the  prerequisites of the start of an escape from the impasse will be  created. The situation will not start to improve before  enterprises learn to introduce more productive capital and can  on the basis of increased efficiency really reduce costs and,  accordingly, prices. Whence the competitiveness of the  manufactured commodity.    A difficult situation has come about at enterprises of the  republic's oil and petroleum-refining industry. The  Nizhnekamskneftekhim and Kazorgsintez stock companies and the  S.M. Kirov Zavod S.K. Association are operating on the verge of  the stoppage of individual works. This has been caused on the  one hand by the crisis of arrears, the reduction in sales  markets, the difficulties in purchasing raw material, and the  further increase in the price of energy and, on the other, by  the fact that the price of individual products has approached  and even reached the world price. Even today the production of  latex and ethylene oxide (stage one) has been terminated, and  phenol, acetone, and divinyl will be next. One-third of the oil  wells are unprofitable, and many of them are standing idle.  This, in turn, is creating additional difficulties in the work  of related sectors (the Kvart Stock Company, the  Nizhnekamskshina Production Association, the Kazan Iskozh Plant,  and so forth).    For the purpose of stabilizing the production activity of  these outfits the government of the republic has been forced to  adopt temporary measures to regulate the price of oil and the  tariffs on the electric and thermal power which they consume.    Significant efforts are also being made by the work force of  enterprises of the republic's petrochemical complex itself.  Structural changes are being actively undertaken to reduce  energy-consuming processes in the Tatneft Association and the  Nizhnekamskneftekhim and Orgsintez stock companies. The creation  of the Tatneftekhiminvestkholding financial and industrial group  and the assistance of the government of the republic should  contribute to the creation of the conditions for the assurance  of normal reproduction for the entire complex. This is vitally  important for the republic because it is they that provide the  budget with the lion's share of revenue and that are  life-supporting sectors.    The financial and economic situation that has taken shape in  the republic requires a careful selection of facilities for  funding, in-depth expert evaluation of the projects which are  submitted, and subsequent on-the-spot supervision of the  targeted use of the allocated funds.    The efficient functioning of the economy of enterprises and  organizations under reform conditions demands a prompt and  flexible response to the constantly changing requirements of the  market. Where this has been understood and the conclusions have  been drawn, there is evidence of positive results. We may  include in this category the Kazan Terminal Production  Association, where conversion is being undertaken successfully.  At the end of 1992 even approximately 90 percent of the  manufactured product here was composed of military orders, which  were dropped practically simultaneously. But thanks to the  presence of unique technology and powerful and multilevel  production potential, the association rapidly switched to the  manufacture of a variety of peaceful products which the public  needs, has recovered from the shock of conversion, it may be  said, and is getting back on its feet. It is gratifying that  these are not just isolated examples. The experience of the work  of the Vakuummash Enterprise, the Kvart, Elekon, and KMIZ stock  companies, the Almetyevsk Submersible Pump Plant, and certain  others shows how it is possible to organize the assimilation and  production of new products in a short space of time. It is  essential that the managers of the republic's enterprises study  their experience and adopt vigorous measures for the  restructuring of their production with regard to the demands of  the market.    Proceeding from the current situation, the forecast for 1994  is oriented toward selective support of the life-sustaining  sectors of production: Support will be rendered to the  agro-industrial complex and also the enterprises that are  prepared to provide for the rapid recovery of resources invested  in the interests of the republic's economy.    A certain reduction in the production of oil and gas is  planned--90.8 percent of the 1993 level. The output of a number  of petrochemical products is to increase: polyethylene (104.2  percent), rubber (108.8 percent), and building materials (103.8  percent), including bricks (104.6 percent).    We are expecting a certain growth in the production of  consumer goods, both of the nonfood group and food, which is to  contribute to the preservation of political stability in the  republic.    The Kama Truck Plant Stock Company is to be standing on its  own two feet in the current year, and we are hoping for an  appreciable growth in motor-vehicle production.    As we all know, on 16 April 1993 the Kama Truck Plant Stock  Company Engines Plant was destroyed as a result of a fire and  shut down. Within two weeks following the accident the board of  directors of the Kama Truck Plant and the KamGESenergostroy  Concern had concentrated at this site more than 100 heavy cranes  and more than 10,000 workers and had organized people's  around-the-clock flexible-shift work without weekends or  holidays. Within three months the mounds of metal structures  with a total weight of 90,000 tonnes had been pulled apart and  the replacement installation of the housing of the engine plant  had begun. Despite difficulties over financing, the installation  of part of the block with an area of 220,000 square meters had  been completed, heating had been supplied and the manufacture of  components had begun, and the manufacture of the power unit of  the KamAZ vehicle had been resumed by 1 November 1993, and the  final block of the roof at the engine plant with a total area of  420,000 square meters was installed on 25 January 1994. It would  be unfair not to commend with gratitude today the work of these  splendid outfits.    Targeted development programs of various levels: interstate,  interregional, republic, and so forth, could be a direction of  the stabilization of the economy. Studies are currently being  conducted with the Government of Russia on participation in the  financing of a number of large-scale programs such as  maintenance of the level of oil production, a resolution of the  environmental and social problems of the oil regions, and the  reconstruction of the petrochemical works, the Zainskaya and  Urussinskaya state regional electric power stations, the Kama  Truck Plant Heat and Electric Power Plant, and a number of  others.    I would like to make particular mention of the YelAZ. Its  fate has been difficult since the disintegration of the USSR.  The consistent steps adopted by the leadership of Tatarstan and  the Russian Federation could produce positive results. The  concept of the further construction of the YelAZ and the  unification to this end of the efforts of Russia and the former  Union republics is gradually being put into practice. The  intergovernmental agreement "Joint Creation of a Complex of  Machinery of the Automotive Plant in the City of Yelabug" was  signed and the share of the contributions of each party was  determined in April 1993 in Minsk. The participants included the  Russian Federation, Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, and Ukraine and  the republics of Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan,  Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. The YelAZ-invest Consortium, whose  main purpose is the concentration of the investors' resources  for this large-scale construction project, was formed and  registered last September in Tatarstan. The parties' first  contributions to the original capital have now been made, and it  is contemplated in the current year forming the capital fund in  full.    The government support for the YelAZ has revived interest in  the project on the part of national business circles and foreign  capital. Numerous proposals concerning participation in the  creation of the automotive plant, on the part of the world's  biggest automotive companies (DEU of South Korea, General Motors  of the United States, Renault of France, and Volkswagen of  Germany) included, are being received. All this affords an  opportunity for a start on the creation of modern, competitive  motor-vehicle production, and this opportunity needs to be  realized.    I would like to say a few words also about the procedure of  the purchases of agricultural products and raw material in 1994.  The point being that the Edict of the President of Russia of 27  October 1993 "On Regulation of Land Relations and the  Development of Agrarian Reform in Russia" abolishes as of 1994  the compulsory supplies and other forms of the compulsory  confiscation of agricultural products for state resources. We  believe that such an approach corresponds to the requirements of  normal market relations. But in agriculture, for a variety of  reasons, market relations are taking shape extremely slowly as  yet, and the conditions have not been created for the production  of competitive products. Considering these circumstances, it  would be expedient to preserve for the current year the system  of procurements of agricultural products based on forward  contracting agreements between the commodity producers and the  procurement officers in the amounts of the 1993 level.    I consider impermissible the formulation of the question of  a  reduction in the amount of the commodity product on the part of  individual leaders of rayons and kolkhozes and sovkhozes since  this would lead primarily to a reduction in the income of the  rural population and also of purchasing power.    In 1993 the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan raised  the purchase price of agricultural products repeatedly, ensuring  the minimum profitability of the sector here. At the same time,  on the other hand, it is essential to emphasize that a  sufficient level for realizing expanded reproduction was not  secured. And in the future it will be necessary to  systematically revise the level of procurement prices and  subsidies for agricultural products with regard to the reduction  in the extent of the direct allocation to agriculture of capital  investments from the republic budget.    Realization of land reform will continue in 1994. The number  of peasant (private) farms will have reached more than 1,000 in  the year. It is essential that the Ministry of Agriculture and  Food complete reform of the kolkhozes and sovkhozes with regard  to accumulated experience, with the allocation to all members of  the work force of a property share and allotments of land. This  will interest the villagers to a considerable extent in the end  results of production.  <H5>  State of Affairs in the Republic's Construction Complex </H5>   A decisive role in the accumulation not only of the  production potential but also the entire national wealth of the  republic belongs to the construction complex. It encompasses 615  construction organizations and 65 enterprises of construction  materials industry. Its share of generated national income  constitutes more than 10 percent, and it employs approximately  200,000 persons. Here, as in other sectors, changes are under  way, and a transition to market relations is being effected.    The privatization of enterprises and the formation of new  structures have contributed to a redistribution of investment  volumes. Thus the share of the investments of state-owned  enterprises in the sum total declined from 78 percent in 1992 to  67 percent in 1993. At the same time there was an increase in  the share of investments of stock companies--from 6 to 20  percent respectively--and it grew somewhat for individual  builders also.    The ratio of the amounts of capital investments in the  construction of facilities for production and nonproduction  purposes changed in favor of the latter from 25 percent of the  total volume in 1985 to 35 percent in 1993.    The volume of capital investments in 1993 declined 5.5  percent compared with the 1992. The decline occurred because of  the reduction in capital investments in respect to production  facilities (90.3 percent of the 1992 level). There was  growth--103.2 percent--in terms of nonproduction facilities, and  investments in housing construction remained at the 1992 level.    The reduction in investments is occurring because of the  decline in the investment activity of builders of all forms of  property (on account of the high degree of inflation,  evidently). A precise government program in respect to the most  important investment projects, in which it is necessary to  specify measures for their protection against inflation, should  be adopted in this connection.    The shortage of capital for investments is being made worse  by the inadequate efficiency in the organization of construction.    In 1993 builders of all forms of property commissioned R337  billion of fixed capital, which was almost R400 billion less  than utilized capital investments. There are only 46 kopeks of  fixed capital introduced per R1 of invested assets (99 kopeks in  1985).    Market mechanisms in capital construction have yet to begin  to operate to the full extent. As previously also, facilities  are mainly introduced at the end of the year, the construction  front remains, as before, extraordinarily wide, and capital  investments are dispersed around a large number of construction  projects.    According to a preliminary estimate, the extent of  incomplete  construction as of the start of 1994 will have increased by a  factor of 1.5 and will have exceeded the amount of utilized  capital by 42 percent.    Some R258 billion of capital investments were used for the  construction of facilities of the social sphere in  January-December 1993.    The commissioning of nonproduction facilities exceeded the  indicators of the preceding year as follows: by 13 percent for  hospitals (beds) and by 15 percent for clubhouses and houses of  culture.    In terms of general schools, preschools, and  outpatient-clinic establishments there was a reduction in  introduction compared with the 1992 level of 37, 27, and 4  percent respectively.    Of the total amount of nonproduction capital investments, 59  percent (R151.8 billion) were channeled into housing  construction. Some 1.275 million square meters of total living  space were introduced in 1993, which constitutes 88 percent of  the amount introduced in 1992. Despite the repeated criticisms,  the government proved incapable of rectifying matters in the  construction complex, and the situation continues to  deteriorate, what is more. In the course of preparation of this  report the construction workers and their sponsors gave me, in  my view, specialist material containing recommendations as to  how matters may be rectified rapidly in construction under the  conditions of transition to the market. Approving your advice, I  would simultaneously ask you to put it into practice in the  current year. There will very shortly be a republic construction  conference, at which a detailed analysis will be made and at  which measures to increase the efficiency of the construction  complex are to be formulated.  <H5>  Progress of Privatization </H5>   The progress of privatization in the republic was examined  and the new tasks were determined recently with the  participation of administration heads, the leaders of ministries  and departments and major enterprises, and people's deputies of  the republic.    Some 43 percent of enterprises in industry, 35 percent in  the  construction complex, and 32.3 percent in the agro-industrial  complex have been privatized at the present time. Plans for the  privatization of 360 large and medium-sized enterprises with a  total capital fund of more than R500 billion have been approved.  They include such giants as the Tatneft, the  Nizhnekamskneftekhim, Organicheskiy sintez, the KMPO, the KVPO,  the Tatstroy, the Tatmyasoagroprom, and others. A further 1,200  enterprises approximately are in a privatization mode.    As we can see, there are certain results. But small-scale  privatization in the republic is proceeding markedly behind  schedule, unfortunately. Whereas the large stores and wholesale  depots retained as state property have already been converted,  in the main, the privatization of small enterprises of trade,  public catering, and consumer service is only at the start of  the route.    I would like once more to call your attention, that of  administration heads primarily, to the need for the most  decisive and assertive action to be taken, and no less than  60-70 percent of small cafes, restaurants, workshops,  hairdressers, and stores should find new owners in the current  year.    A few words about IPV (registered privatization deposits).  It  is necessary that this mechanism of the noncompensable transfer  of property to our citizens operate with precision. On the  whole, there is firm confidence that all 100 percent of the IPV  will be "materialized." The task locally is to describe and  explain persuasively and intelligibly to everyone how to  competently dispose of the privatization deposit.    Today we are faced with one further task of enormous state  importance--the privatization of housing. Two months have  elapsed since this law took effect. In the majority of cities  and districts of the republic this work has begun in organized  fashion, precisely, and without red tape. But there are  shortcomings also, unfortunately. Attempts are being made in  places to complicate the process of the privatization of  housing, and various restrictions are being invented and  artificially devised in addition to the law, which is  categorically prohibited. There have been instances of the  citizens' lack of knowledgeability and of their having been kept  in the dark both as to the essence of the law and the benefits  accruing to an owner who has privatized his residence. It seems  to many inhabitants of the republic for some reason or other  that if they privatize their apartment, they are immediately  inundated with incredibly high expenses for its upkeep and so  forth. And such disinformation is coming from certain government  officials, who are in this way simply attempting to intimidate  people.    The task of the local organs of power and administration is  to do everything for the rapid transfer of housing to the public  strictly in accordance with the law. A housing market has to be  created.    Concluding this part of my speech, I will say that  privatization is a most important area of our activity in the  current year. And we intend to implement it decisively.  <H3>  Execution of the Consolidated and Republic Budgets of the  Republic of Tatarstan </H3>   The republic budget for 1993 was executed in revenue terms  to  the extent of 284 percent of the plan voted by the Supreme  Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan. The indicators of the  consolidated budget, in respect to which execution for the year  constituted 311 percent, were somewhat better.    The excess of revenue over expenditure in terms of the  republic budget constituted R2.6 billion or 0.5 percent of the  overall budget. In respect to the local budgets these indicators  are somewhat higher and constitute R9.6 billion or 2 percent of  total revenue respectively.    The plans were overfulfilled thanks, in the main, to  unpredictable price factors. At the same time, on the other  hand, the absence of a mechanism for curbing inflation brought  about a slowdown in settlements in the economy, which, in turn,  led to a growth of reciprocal arrears, a complication of the  financial situation of many enterprises, and, as a result, to a  budget revenue shortfall.    In terms of the year's results, on account of the continuing  trend of the growth of nonpayments, there was a budget revenue  shortfall of more than R200 billion of value-added tax and  profits tax in respect to four most important taxpayers  (Tatneft, Tatenergo, Nizhnekamskshina, and Nizhnekamskneftekhim)  alone.    The problem of payment discipline remains acute. The basic  tax arrears as of 1 January 1994 amounted to more than R42  billion.    Budget expenditure grew at a more rapid pace (compared with  revenue). Practically the entire overfulfillment of the revenue  side was channeled into the sectors' growing need for financial  resources. In this connection the expenditure of the republic  and consolidated budgets was executed for 1993 at 256 and 264  percent respectively.    There was supplementary expenditure from the republic budget  in 1993 totaling over R300 billion, of which more than half was  channeled into covering expenses connected with the pay  increases in the nonproduction sphere.    At the same time the budget was not drawn up or executed  with  the maximum austerity, nor was full account taken of the  economic possibilities of the republic.    The carryover indebtedness of the republic budget for 1993  in  respect to sectors of the economy, capital investments, and  other measures constituted more than R50 billion.    In terms of the year's results the majority of local budgets  (certain municipal budgets constitute the sole exception) failed  to create a sufficient reserve of financial resources for the  financing in full of pay, which was raised as of 1 December, and  facilities of capital construction (aside from housing) and the  creation of stocks of fuel and materials.    This was caused mainly by the diversion of budget resources  by the leaders of districts and cities for nonpriority  expenditure and also the financing of activities and sectors  which are not a part of the budget system, without regard to  forthcoming budget expenditure.    According to preliminary calculations, approximately R50  billion in terms of local budgets were diverted for expenditure  not connected with a budget classification. Thus in Bugulminskiy  and Tukayevskiy districts and the cities of Almetyevsk, Bugulm,  and Nizhnekamsk substantial budget resources were invested in  bank deposits, and credit was granted to various enterprises and  organizations, some of which has still not been returned to the  budget.    A substantial amount of the revenue of the local budgets  which had been obtained additionally was channeled into the  purchase of automobiles, furniture, computers, and the provision  of the district centers with amenities in Mamalyshskiy,  Zainskiy, Bavlinskiy, and Mustyumovskiy districts.    In addition, according to data of the Ministry of  Agriculture  and Food, budget resources allocated for gas supply in  Alkeyevskiy, Aktanyshskiy, Spasskiy, Tetyushskiy,  Tyulyachinskiy, and Pestrechinskiy districts were used for  purposes other than those specifically intended.    The concept of the formation of the system of the budget of  the republic for 1994 should be geared mainly to the  survivability of the current network of social and cultural  institutions, the social protection of the population, the  completion of the construction, which has begun, of housing and  other facilities of the social sphere due for introduction, and  maintenance at the requisite level of sectors of the economy,  prices and tariffs in which are regulated by the state.    Preliminary calculations do not afford grounds for  forecasting a marked improvement in the condition of the budget  in the first quarter of the current year compared with the  fourth quarter of last year, and despite the most modest  expenditure, therefore, the budget deficit will reach 40 percent  of revenue.    In this connection it is essential, in addition to the  accomplishment of the paramount task of reducing enterprise  arrears, to take decisive steps for a reduction in unproductive  expenditure and the economical and targeted use of budget  resources. A further release of tariffs and a revision of  allowances in housing and municipal service and transport are  required.    It would be expedient to adopt, on the basis of budget  possibilities, a realistic program of capital construction for  1994 and to take the path of the restriction of the funding of  particular large-scale projects and programs, adopted by the  Supreme Soviet of Republic of Tatarstan included.  <H5>  Social Policy </H5>   A principal task in social policy is that of a rise in  personal income.    In December the living standard in Tatarstan had practically  reached the mark of approximately 3 (2.92, to be precise), and  in the Russian Federation, 2 (more precisely, 1.89). This means  that the per capita income of the inhabitants our republic is  almost three times higher than the value of the subsistence  minimum (per capita income in Tatarstan in December was R72,771,  and the subsistence minimum, R24,918; in Russia per capita  income was R84,000, the subsistence minimum, R44,352). I have to  mention here that we need subsequently to take as the basis not  the subsistence minimum but the minimum budget or some other  concept with a higher expenditure plank.    The average wage in the republic in December constituted  R128,000 (R130,000 in the Russian Federation). A pretty good  level, although December is not all that regular a month when it  comes to monetary payments in connection with the annual and  quarterly bonuses (the average monthly wage in 1993 in the  Republic of Tatarstan was R52,600, in the Russian Federation,  R58,600). As we can see, the gap has been narrowed.    At the previous session we adopted a responsible  decision--laws on the subsistence minimum and the minimum wage,  on the basis of which minimum remuneration could not be below  the subsistence minimum. In February the subsistence minimum is  forecast at the level of R30,000, and this means that minimum  remuneration also must be the same. I believe that this session  will adopt such a decision.    An increase in pay in 1993 was observed in all spheres of  the  economy, but the rate thereof differed considerably in both the  sectoral and territorial respects.    The situation involving the income of those working at many  industrial enterprises, particularly at enterprises of the  military-industrial complex, is causing serious concern. In  comparable values, the living standard in terms of these  enterprises is considerably below the republic average. And the  average wage at some of them (not the most unfortunate, what is  more) is approximately 60 percent of the average wage in the  republic. Consequently, employees of industrial enterprises  enjoy more compensation from the Social Support Fund. Enterprise  managers are of the view that an increase in the minimum wage  would entail a multiple increase in the price of their products.  An analysis has shown that this would bring about an increase in  price of no more than 11 percent, but would permit an increase  in the employees' income.    We are at the present time seriously reconsidering the  policy  of subsidies to a number of sectors. A phased transfer of the  subsidies of housing and municipal services and transport to  personal income has begun. An interesting picture is taking  shape in these sectors, incidentally. That same indicator of the  living standard of employees of these sectors is far higher than  the republic average, not to mention that of industry. But to  return to the problem of subsidies, as of the situation in  February, with a value of the subsistence minimum for the  populace of approximately R30,000, each urban resident is  subsidized a further R39,000. Of these, 18 percent are composed  of subsidies for food, 58 percent, for housing and municipal  services, 23 percent, for transport, and the rest, for medicinal  support. That is, transport is subsidized more than food, and  the subsidies for housing and municipal services are almost  equal to the entire value of the subsistence minimum. This is  food for thought. It is necessary, evidently, to analyze the  entire system of norms contained in the package of services of  this sector. An example: There is an established norm of the  consumption of cold water per person of 200 liters a day. That  is, if there is central water supply, it is considered that a  person consumes this quantity daily! But this is impossible. The  norms obviously contain the entire actual consumption of the  sector. But the interests of the residents need to be protected  also, we cannot shift onto them payment for all expenditure,  unsubstantiated expenditure included.    An analysis shows that foodstuffs, and they are consumed by  all inhabitants, are subsidized least of all currently. In  addition, as I have already said, housing and municipal services  are subsidized, yet they are enjoyed to a greater extent by  those who live in apartments with conveniences. And the  "slum-dwellers" are socially oppressed here also. We are  continuing to direct huge subsidy resources haphazardly. It is  essential that the government look into this and adopt the  appropriate decisions as quickly as possible.    There are many questions concerning preschools. The measures  adopted at the federal level for the protection of the family  and children are being transformed here in the republic with  regard to the current program of targeted social protection.  What is the situation here? In connection with the increase in  the price of energy resources there has been a considerable  increase in the cost of keeping children in preschool  institutions (keeping one child in February will cost more than  R50,000). The support of preschools is a heavy burden on the  enterprises, which many of them cannot sustain. The government  has adopted a number of measures to preserve the network of  preschools, for example, approximately 500 preschool  institutions catering for approximately 70,000 children will in  the current year be taken onto the books of the local soviets.  But some will, as before, remain on the books of the  enterprises, and, lest we destroy the preschool system, we need  to adopt a decision on the support of enterprises when it comes  to maintaining preschool institutions by way of compensation  from the budget for the cost of children's meals.    The protection of our citizens against the inferior quality  of goods and services is a cause for concern. There is now a  need for the creation of a state committee to coordinate policy  in the sphere of quality and the protection of consumers'  rights. This committee would be entrusted with the coordination  of activity in the solution of questions connected with the  quality of goods and services, an analysis of the state and  prospects of the development of the production of products which  are environmentally clean and noninjurious to one's health,  pricing, and the protection of consumers' rights. This must not  be a toothless body. We need to accord the committee  wide-ranging powers, including the right of inspections and the  application of strict economic and administrative sanctions, the  right to remove from production and withdraw from circulation  substandard goods and services and to terminate operations, and  the possibility of preparing and forwarding to the public  prosecutor's office and the courts documents with the object of  the institution of proceedings against the producers of  substandard goods and services, including formulation of the  question of their closure and liquidation. In connection with a  tightening of the demands on the quality of goods and services  problems of the development of medium-sized and small business  require special attention, and the adoption of the corresponding  prescriptive enactments in support of them needs to be speeded  up here.    Health care is in a transitional phase at this time in  connection with the Medical Insurance Act taking effect. The  concern of a number of deputies proposing alternatives of the  activity of the medical insurances funds in the immediate period  is understandable. I believe it necessary to study the  experience of health care of Moscow and Moscow Oblast, which  have retained questions of protection of the health of mother  and child as publicly funded for 1994-1995. We should, possibly,  do the same.  <H5>  State of the Fight Against Crime </H5>   Considering that in January at an enlarged meeting of the  collegium of the MVD and the Public Prosecutor's Office these  problems were examined in detail, I would like to emphasize once  again that the fight against crime has been and remains a  principal direction in the activity of the president and all  organs of state power called on to deal with this. While  evaluating positively the efforts of all law enforcement  authorities of the Republic of Tatarstan for realization of the  Law "On Special Measures To Fight Crime" which we have adopted,  we have agreed at the meetings that have been held to step up  this fight even more and make it more effective. The main thing  is that the law enforcement authorities are now confident that  it is possible to curb this evil. I refer to the results of  1993. The crime detection rate increased from 52 to 64 percent.  The growth of crime declined. It is very important that 11,000  more criminal cases were sent to the courts here than in 1992.  The struggle to unmask top crime groupings is being intensified.  The replacement and, I would say, improvement of the personnel  composition in the law enforcement authorities themselves  continue. The public demands protection of us, and we are  required to provide it.  <H5>  Political Situation in the Republic </H5>   Esteemed People's Deputies! The political development of the  Republic of Tatarstan in the past year was marked by a number of  important trends. They included continuation of the building of  the new statehood of Tatarstan on the basis of the Constitution  and laws of the Republic of Tatarstan; the formation of its own  legal system and the creation of a multiparty system and a wide  field for the interaction of various parties and movements; the  effect of the mechanism of negotiations and consultations with  the Russian Federation; the stimulation of international  cooperation; and so forth.    In our opinion, these will remain the priority directions in  1994 also. The most important task for us undoubtedly was and  remains political and economic stability in Tatarstan, the  infusion of its sovereignty with actual content with an  orientation toward observance of human rights and liberties,  economic reforms, and the formation of political and managerial  structures in keeping with the requirements of the times. Much  work has to be done. But the accomplishment of this task is not  only essential but realistic also. The right to speak this way  is accorded by the main, evolved factor of the republic's  civilized development, development which is, I would say,  conscious and has a sense of its own dignity. We are talking  about civil peace and social accord, respect for the working  man, and the harmony of the general and the national. For it is  no accident that the words "Tatarstan is our common home" and  "Tatarstan is my home" are today being spoken with pride by the  representatives of all nationalities that live in the republic.  And we see this as a guarantee that this home will in the future  be more stable and richer both materially and spiritually. Yes,  this home has, we know, its difficulties, its complexities,  which home does not at this time? But the main thing is that we  not only know our own problems but are resolving them also.  This, most likely, explains the growing authority of Tatarstan  in Russia, among the CIS countries, and in the far abroad.    Esteemed Comrades! Present-day political life, with all its  complexities and problems, requires that each of us be a  pragmatist and realist and see things as they really are, not as  we would like them to be. There are objective processes and  phenomena, and they cannot be ignored. We are guided by such an  approach when tackling problems of the building and reform of  the relations of the Republic of Tatarstan and the Russian  Federation. It is no secret that these problems are central  problems in the political life of Tatarstan and that, owing to  their special significance, they will remain such in the future  also.    The Supreme Soviet and the entire community of the republic  have constant information on the progress of the negotiations of  official delegations of the Republic of Tatarstan and the  Russian Federation on the concept of a future treaty on the  delineation of terms of reference and the mutual delegation of  authority by organs of state power of the Republic of Tatarstan  and the Russian Federation built on the harmonization of the two  constitutions and unconditional respect for the rights of the  individual, regardless of his nationality, sex, or religious  belief.    The break in the treaty process, which had been protracted  under the influence of a number of social events in Russia, is  now over. At our January meeting with B.N. Yeltsin, president of  the Russian Federation, aside from the consideration of a number  of questions of the economy and the problem of oil production  and the ecological situation in the oil regions of the republic,  agreement was reached on the completion of the preparation of  the treaty and intergovernmental agreements on foreign economic  activity, the fight against crime, the budget and taxes,  military organizational development, and the banks. The official  delegations of the parties and their leaders (V.N. Likhachev and  M.G. Saburov and S.M. Shakhray and Yu.F. Yarov) obtained  specific recommendations.    It may be said as a preliminary evaluation that an entirely  new document, practically unprecedented, which proclaims the  primacy of human rights and the principles of Tatarstan's  relations with the Russian Federation, foreign states, and  international organizations, is being engendered. Particular  attention will be paid to the sphere of the joint competence of  the parties' organs of state power. The formation of  plenipotentiary missions of Russia and Tatarstan in Kazan and  Moscow respectively is contemplated.    The majority of articles have been harmonized and many  questions that had previously given rise to arguments and  different positions have been dropped now. I have to mention  something else also. The atmosphere that reigns at the  negotiations is cordial, and one senses a desire of the parties  to understand one another and find a compromise. The entire work  undoubtedly requires patience and intellectual effort.    I believe there will soon be a treaty, on which we have  worked for so long. It will be evidence of the reform of Russia  and a renewal of the Federation on a democratic basis and will  be a guarantor of the statehood of our republic. I am sure that  this treaty will be accepted not only in the Russian Federation  and in Tatarstan but by the international community also.    Knowing all this, one is for the umpteenth time perplexed at  how certain forces in the republic perceive the work that is  being done. Some terms of individual publications of the  so-called "democratic" press are something else: "haggling,"  "conspiracy against the people," "undermining of human rights,"  and some even more scathing. What is this--naivete or political  calculation aimed at sowing confusion and introducing doubt in  people's minds? Both, most likely. But how long is it possible  to go on living according to the principle: "the worse, the  better"? Speaking on behalf of the people, and many social and  political movements are guilty of this currently, incidentally,  we are entitled only to creation in the interests of our people.  Nor can other types of statements coming from so-called  national-radical groups be overlooked. Their meaning is clear,  and you could not call them constructive. Truly, how is it  possible to call for official relations or contacts with Russia  and the political structures that operate there to be ignored,  knowing that citizens of Tatarstan have citizenship of the  Russian Federation and that a common economic space with the  Russian Federation is preserved? There is a mass (I repeat,  mass) of questions, which may be solved only with the closest  connection and cooperation of Russia and Tatarstan for the good  of their peoples.    One has the impression that certain politicians, political  intriguers more like, have been left here without subjects of  political struggle and are attempting, once again not to  people's benefit, to create them artificially.    Such are certain political reference points of the Republic  of Tatarstan. They have proven their relevance and will remain  such in the future also. Grounded in reality, they demand  strenuous work of all of us.    Proceeding from the progress of the negotiations and the  need  for the realization subsequently of mutual relations with the  Russian Federation established on the basis of a treaty, I  consider essential the participation of plenipotentiary  representatives of Tatarstan both in the State Duma and in the  Federation Council of Russia. While paying tribute to the  efforts of the organs of state power of the Republic of  Tatarstan in the establishment of civilized democratic relations  with the Russian Federation in the interests of our peoples, I  am sure that the population of the republic will demonstrate  support for this policy by actively participating in the repeat  elections on 13 March.    Speaking once again about the reform of the representative  and executive authorities, I may emphasize yet again the need  for reform via elections on a multiparty basis. As the progress  of the reform of the representative bodies in a number of  republics shows, the principles of the form of government which  I have proposed and the procedure of elections set forth at the  first sitting of the 18th session remain the most acceptable.  This is, I believe, our ultimate destination.    Esteemed People's Deputies! There was a considerable  expansion and intensification of the Republic of Tatarstan's  relations in the sphere of the economy, culture, education,  agriculture, health care, and so forth in 1993 with countries of  the far and near abroad. Just recently we could not have dreamed  even that Tatarstan could have established direct contacts with  foreign states or have concluded agreements and treaties  oriented not toward ideological precepts and political or some  other predilections but toward goals of vital importance to the  republic and its citizens.    The Republic of Tatarstan is becoming an object of close  attention on the part of authoritative international  organizations such as the European Parliament, UNESCO, OPEC, and  so forth. And of considerable importance in this connection, in  our view, is the fact that these organizations not only  understand our republic's role and position in the current  period but also approve many of the steps we have taken geared  to the stabilization of the situation both in the Republic of  Tatarstan and in the Russian Federation as a whole.</p>

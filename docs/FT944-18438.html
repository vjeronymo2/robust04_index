			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: US to be lobbied on aircraft job cuts Union officials plan to visit the US to try to persuade President Clinton to help save almost 1,000 aerospace jobs, Roland Rudd writes. The jobs will be lost at the Raytheon aircraft plants in Broughton near Chester and Hatfield, Hertfordshire, when work is moved to Arkansas. The company bought the corporate jets business from British Aerospace a year ago but has decided to switch production to its US base to save money. Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU engineering union, said: 'It is my intention to contact the president to stress to him what a devastating blow this relocation will be to communities of skilled people in the UK. It is asset-stripping of the worst kind.' The closures were raised at the conference yesterday when the government was urged to intervene to help save the jobs. Mr Jack Dromey, national secretary of the TGWU general union, referring to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, asked: 'Where was the man who promised to intervene before every meal? The silence was deafening.' Mr John Weakley, an executive council member of the AEEU, said 4,000 workers depended on Raytheon. 'Closure would be a further hammer blow for areas already suffering the harsh effects of massive job cuts in the aerospace sector,' Union leaders urged Mr Heseltine, to intervene to reverse the 'catastrophic' closure proposals.</p>

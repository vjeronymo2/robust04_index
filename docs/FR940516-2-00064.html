			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The characteristics of homicides indicate a clear and consistent pattern of friend and family violence. Half of the yearly 23,000 homicide victims in the United States die at the hands of an acquaintance. For example, family members are responsible for 20 percent of the deaths whereas casual acquaintances are responsible for 30 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During 1985, the Surgeon General and the U.S. Public Health Service provided a national focus on violence as a leading public health problem in the United States. Since that time, public health perspectives in preventing death and disability due to violent and abusive behavior have emerged across the country. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Violence in America is a public health problem that takes its greatest toll on young minority males. Minority males have the highest rates of contact with the criminal justice system of any group in the nation. In 1987, more than half of all prison inmates in the nation were Black or Hispanic males. Problems confronting minority males are those particularly associated with poverty, violence, single parent households, school drop-out rates, delinquency, unemployment, access to higher education and health status. The American Council on Education recently reported that African American Male enrollment in colleges and universities declined by five percent, while the enrollment among Hispanic males remained constant, between 1990&hyph;1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to design, implement, and assess the use of a consortium to conduct model centers for the development and demonstration of interventions related to minority male, family and community violence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Program Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The consortium will design, implement, and assess Minority Male, Family and Community Violence Prevention Models which maximize the leadership of minority institutions of higher education in: (1) Organizing a total ``town and gown'' initiative with respect to both their own functions and responsibilities and those of entities to be involved throughout the community, e.g., primary/secondary schools, churches, public agencies; (2) The life centers should at a minimum conduct the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Assess local community resources dedicated to address problems of family and community violence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Coordinate with local violence efforts currently in place to minimize duplication of efforts and to maximize use of local resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Specifically, though not exclusively, address the problem of interpersonal family violence by designing and implementing an educational/prevention intervention. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Design and implement a student assessment project to identify students from dysfunctional families and to delineate positive and negative coping strategies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) developing educational experiences, preventive measures and therapeutic interventions designed to address the issues of dysfunctional males and families; and (4) formulating methods and strategies for execution of the initiatives through a variety of avenues within the minority institutions of higher education and throughout the community. This initiative seeks to address the escalating national problems experienced by dysfunctional families and individuals in the minority community. These national problems are precipitated by such conditions as breakdowns in family structures, alcoholism and drug abuse, educational deficiencies, poverty, crime, and violence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The consortium will establish a maximum of sixteen (16) Family Life Centers on the campuses of minority institutions of higher education. A complete organizational structure will be developed for initiatives to be executed through this program with respect to both the minority institutions of higher education and community components involved including methodologies and strategies for their operation. The consortium will develop and test the interventions and other programmatic content for all facets of the program that are internal and external to the minority institutions of higher education. These include, methods of their delivery and the competencies necessary for all students and professionals involved (mentor, counselors, faculty, etc.) in carrying out the interventions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Use of Cooperative Agreement: A cooperative agreement will be awarded because of the anticipated substantial programmatic involvement by OMH staff. OMH will take the lead programmatic responsibility for this activity and will work in collaboration with other PHS and DHHS co-sponsoring entities. Substantial programmatic involvement is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

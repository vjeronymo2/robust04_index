			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Escape for employers - A pension ruling by the European Court MEN AND women may have been created equal but their pensions have not. Earlier this week, the European Court of Justice underscored its landmark May 1990 ruling - known as Barber v. Guardian Royal Exchange - that pension benefits for men and women had to be equal. But it also said that no employer should be liable for equality before May 1990. The case decided this week - known by the name of its plaintiff, Ten Oever - asked if employers who paid survivors' pensions to widows must also do so for widowers. The court said yes, but not for those employed before the Barber judgement took effect. The court, however, must still adjudicate on a number of other equally vexing cases. One of the most complex and far-reaching has been brought by pension scheme members at Coloroll, the UK home furnishings company now in liquidation. In short, it asks just how far employers must go towards providing equal pensions. The tricky part of the question rests on the fact that women live longer than men. Therefore, it costs more to support a woman to the end of her natural life than it does for a man, even if both retire at the same age. So, if an employer provides a female employee with a larger lump sum upon retirement to buy an annuity to give her the same benefits as a male employee, does that constitute an unequal pension benefit? Indications from the advocate-general, who advises the court, are that the answer is yes. But if the employer gives her the same sum as a man, and she can buy only a lower monthly stream of payments, does that not also constitute an unequal provision? Part of the problem lies with the European insurance industry; as yet, its actuaries have not devised what are known as 'unisex' actuarial tables. These are rates which both men and women have to pay to achieve the same stream of benefits, and have been common in the US for years. The final Coloroll ruling is not expected until late this year or early in 1994.</p>

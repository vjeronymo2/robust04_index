Almaty is proposing the formation of a joint command. Moscow  has rejected this idea, because it would be a violation of its  international commitments.    There is general satisfaction that the Ukrainian option of  "privatization" of strategic missiles did not start a trend.  The Kazakh parliament, at its recent session, ratified the  Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons.    At the same time Russia looked on jealously at the  U.S.-Kazakh agreement, signed 13 December, on the safe  dismantling of nuclear warheads belonging to the strategic  arsenal of the former USSR. Washington promised to grant Almaty  $84 million out of the total sum of $1.2 billion allocated by  the U.S. Congress to the CIS countries for these purposes.  Russia, which has great experience in such operations, had  expected to find a common language with Kazakhstan and do the  dismantling itself.    In formal terms, all 108 SS-18 missiles stationed in  Kazakhstan, and the 1,400 warheads, are Russia's property. The  total value of their nuclear contents, after dismantling and  reprocessing, will amount to about $1 billion. The world  uranium market is strictly limited by IAEA [International Atomic  Energy Agency] guidelines. But the Americans would like to buy  all the uranium left after the warheads are dismantled, and have  made it clear to Kazakhstan that money is no object.    Almaty, having willingly renounced the status of a nuclear  power, expects to receive compensation for the missiles.  Nursultan Nazarbayev's edict banning the exportation from the  republic of anything that is on its territory applies not only  to missiles, but also to weapons [zaryady] that have been  removed from alert status. Kazakhstan's storage facilities are  packed with nuclear ammunition.    Russia is willing to share, but insists that the dismantling  and the uranium reprocessing takes place at its own plants.  Ukraine's uncompromising position cannot but influence  Kazakhstan's behavior. Kiev has decided, by the end of this  year, to remove all the warheads from 20 SS-24 ICBM's, and to  keep them. But Ukraine also does not have the plants and  technology for reprocessing the uranium, which it could use as  fuel for its five nuclear power stations.    After the Russian elections, the former certainty that the  safest course is to ship all the former USSR's nuclear weapons  to Russia's territory is not shared by everyone. Russia may  come up against more persistent claims from Ukraine and  Kazakhstan to keep the nuclear weapons.    It has yet to be decided how Kazakhstan's warheads will be  dismantled and by what means their uranium content will be sold.</p>

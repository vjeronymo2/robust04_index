			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: THEY LEAVE, CHAMPIONS OF THE SPIRIT  </P> <P> I typed this first line left-handed.  </P> <P> Just a little gesture for a little basketball team from a little school down  the lane. Bye, guys. Thanks for all the Loyola merriment. You lived, you died,  you laughed, you cried. You got through the worst and gave it your best.  Thanks, Paul, Bo, Jeff, Per, Tony, Terrell, Tom, Chris, everybody. Many a tear  has to fall, but it's all in the game.  </P> <P> As of tipoff Sunday, only five universities in America had shots at the  national championship -- Arkansas, Duke, Georgia Tech, Nevada Las Vegas and a  3,700-pupil, parochial institute in LAX's flight path that was known as "Los  Angeles College" when the Jesuit fathers joined the faculty in 1911. Not too  shabby, Loyola Marymount. There were 292 Division I schools with basketball  teams. You made the final five.  </P> <P> Just not, alas, the capital-F, registered-trademark Final Four. The knockout  punch came Sunday, before 14,298 sympathetic witnesses at Oakland Coliseum  Arena, when an NBA farm club from Nevada that opened Loyola's schedule came  full circle to close it. The season's final final score, 131-101, leaves  precious little room for complaint about bad calls or bad luck. The better side  won. Viva Las Vegas.  </P> <P> The Lions took it hard. Tom Peabody, the battle-scarred, bloody-kneed scrapper  from Santa Ana who embodied this team's inexhaustible hustle, kept his upper  lip stiff as long as he could. Finally, everything caught up with him. He broke  down. Peabody felt the pang of what he and his teammates had been feeling all  along, the private fears, the well-hidden secret.  </P> <P> "We've been running scared," he said.  </P> <P> Had the players convinced their ever-expanding audience that they had put the  horror of Hank Gathers' sudden death behind them? Yes, they had. But it was all  an act. A brave front. Their facade was cracked Sunday, when Paul Westhead  second-guessed himself for not preparing his players properly, revealing that  he simply couldn't bring himself to show them films of Loyola's season-opening  game against UNLV because Gathers was in them.  </P> <P> The coach thought about taking a team vote. His conscience balked even at that.  </P> <P> "I may have made a technical mistake," Westhead said, wearing a look of guilt.  </P> <P> If so, it was certainly a human mistake.  </P> <P> And, if it means anything, no game film, no scouting report of any kind could  have dramatically altered the course of this West Regional championship game,  in which the Runnin' Rebels of Jerry Tarkanian just kept runnin' and runnin'  and runnin'. The score was 16-4 before the referees got their whistles wet.  Stacey Augmon, Anderson Hunt, Larry Johnson, Greg Anthony, David Butler . . .  Well, let's just say Las Vegas definitely plays five-stud poker.  </P> <P> To lose to such a team is no disgrace. Loyola's Bo Kimble spoke of "going out  with class," and risked doing otherwise only by drawing technical fouls in each  of his last two games. This was hardly the Bo we had come to know. He, too,  must have been having more trouble than was visible, keeping his private demons  at bay.  </P> <P> It was exactly three weeks ago Sunday that Gathers collapsed, and so much had  happened since then. Emotions became askew, and we don't mean only those of the  players. Others got carried away. "Experts" gave opinions on talk shows,  proclaiming that Kimble had easily turned himself into an NBA lottery pick,  that Jeff Fryer had surely shot his way into the draft's first round. Neither  thing is necessarily true. Fryer can shoot, sure, but he might be fortunate to  be drafted at all. Shooters of his size and speed are hardly uncommon.  </P> <P> It wasn't a Loyola bandwagon that people climbed onto so much as it was a  wish-upon-a-star. This was a little made-for-TV-movie of a story, one that  touched a number of hearts. Loyola Marymount acquired the public sentiment of  an orphanage. It was more than some happy-go-lucky little underdog. It was a  basketball team distressed and depressed, showing courage, slaying giants.  </P> <P> Las Vegas was not a villain here -- this wasn't one of those  Catholics-vs.-convicts bits -- and warrants whatever further success comes its  way. OK, so none of Tarkanian's players have yet been nominated for sainthood.  Said Augmon, the junior from Pasadena who grew up nearer Loyola than most of  the Lions did: "Remember, they called the Detroit Pistons bad boys, too."  </P> <P> Kimble doesn't think of the Rebels as bad. He thinks of them as good. "Since  you beat us, you'd better win it all now," Kimble told a couple of them at  day's end.  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount won just about everything else there was to win. Won games.  Won respect. Won friends. The whole team should put the season to rest with a  peaceful, easy feeling. Let somebody else run scared for a while. Let the Lions  sleep tonight.  </P></p>

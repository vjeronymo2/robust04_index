			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Rover increases output by 26% Rover increased car production by 26 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, according to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Overall UK car output was virtually unchanged in the first three months at 362,536, a decline of 0.5 per cent from the corresponding period a year ago. Higher output by Rover, the leading UK vehicle maker and a subsidiary of BMW of Germany, together with the rapid build-up of production by Toyota and Honda at their UK assembly plants, helped to offset declines at Ford and Vauxhall and a sharp fall at Nissan. The rise in Rover output has been driven by the introduction of its Rover 600 executive car range, launched last spring, as well as by rising sales of the Land Rover Discovery and the Rover 200/400. The company recently introduced a Sunday shift to increase output of the 200/400. Production at Nissan's Pounds 900m Sunderland plant fell by 45 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter. The company was forced to halve production for nearly four months until early March in order to cut stocks and bring output into line with lower demand in continental Europe. The luxury carmaker Jaguar, a Ford subsidiary, and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, a subsidiary of Vickers, are both regaining ground lost during the US and UK recessions. Jaguar, which increased output by 43.5 per cent last year, raised production by 11 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, while the maker of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars - whose sales worldwide more than halved between 1990 and 1992 - raised output 44 per cent in the first three months. Production of commercial vehicles has begun to rise slowly, albeit from a very low level. Output in the first four months was 5 per cent higher than a year before. The two vehicle sectors are experiencing sharply contrasting production fortunes. Car output rose last year by 6.5 per cent to 1.376m, the highest level since 1974, and is forecast to exceed 2m for the first time towards the end of the decade. By contrast, commercial vehicle production fell by 22.2 per cent last year to only 193,414, the lowest level of output since 1948. Rover Cars is halving the dealers' profit margin on its flagship executive car range, the Rover 800, to 5 per cent, John Griffiths writes. The move, which takes immediate effect, brings Rover into line with Vauxhall and Ford, its main rivals in the executive sector, which have introduced similar margins on their respective Omega and Granada/Scorpio executive models. Rover acknowledged yesterday that its action was intended mainly to reduce list prices, making the cars more attractive to company car drivers under the new tax regime. Transaction prices - the amount actually paid for cars - are unlikely to change. Rover said yesterday there were no plans to halve the profit margin on other models.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Nissan, Ford and Vauxhall decline sharply  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                1994        1993      1994/93                             Jan-March   Jan-March    % Change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CARS Total                         362,536     364,521        -0.5 Rover (BMW)                   126,209     100,269       +25.9  -cars++                      110,536      87,571       +26.2  -Range Rover/Discovery        15,673      12,698       +23.4 General Motors group           73,668      79,896        -7.8  -Vauxhall                     61,510      69,082       -11.0  -IBC Vehicles (GM/Isuzu)**    12,158      10,814       +12.4 Ford group                     73,045      82,744       -11.7  -Ford                         65,041      75,561       -13.9  -Jaguar                        8,004       7,183       +11.4 Nissan                         38,438      70,058       -45.1 Peugeot                        20,683      20,383        +1.5 Toyota                         18,482       4,808      +284.4 Honda                          10,445       5,199      +100.9 Rolls-Royce (Vickers)             379         263       +44.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMMERCIAL VEHICLES Total                          60,357      59,215        +1.9 Ford                           41,106      41,205        -0.2 Rover (BMW)                     6,864       5,158       +33.1  -car-derived vans              1,015         354      +186.7  -Land Rover Defender           5,849       4,804       +21.8 General Motors group            4,886       6,444       -24.2  -Vauxhall                      3,328       3,760       -11.5  -IBC Vehicles (GM/Isuzu)*      1,558       2,684       -42.0 LDV                             2,940       2,755        +6.7 Leyland Trucks                  1,698       1,395       +21.7 Iveco-Ford (Fiat)               1,023         679       +50.7 ERF                               680         562       +21.0 Dennis (Trinity Holdings)         420         329       +27.7 Seddon Atkinson (Fiat)            263         196       +34.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Medium vans sold in Europe variously under Vauxhall, Isuzu, GME and Bedford names. **Opel/Vauxhall Frontera. ++Includes Honda Concerto.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

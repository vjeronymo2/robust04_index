The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, made the remark at a weekly press  conference held here this afternoon when asked to comment on the  "Radio Free Asia" bill passed by the U.S. Senate.    "The real motive behind the setting up of this radio is to  interfere in the internal affairs of China and other Asian  countries and create confusion through news media," Wu said.    Wu stressed that the affairs of Asian countries should be  handled by their own people.    When the setting up of this radio station was under  consideration, he noted, China and many other Asian countries  voiced their strong opposition to it.    By taking the action, Wu said, the United States has  trampled  upon the universally acknowledged norms governing international  relations and violated the basic principles laid down in the  three joint communiques between China and the United States.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE . . . : CHOICE OF CHOICE SAUCES HEATS UP COLD TREAT  </P> <P> Now's the time to rustle up a repertoire of ice cream toppers so that the kids  can have fun concocting their favorite splits and sundaes.  </P> <P> And so that you, too, can have an elegant dessert "on ice" -- a Peach Melba,  for example. It's nothing more than a fresh peach half topped by a scoop of  vanilla ice cream that's crowned by a blush of Melba Sauce that microwaves to  perfection -- in an instant -- and can be made ahead of time.  </P> <P> Because microwaving is a moist method of cooking, all of the just-picked flavor  of the berries used in the Melba Sauce is preserved. Indeed, it seems to be  heightened through some feat of culinary alchemy.  </P> <P> Let the kids lend a hand in microwaving other culinary feats that make  delicious ice cream toppers such as Hot Fudge Sauce.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MELBA SAUCE  </P> <P> 2 cups pureed raspberries, strawberries or loganberries  </P> <P> 1/3 cup sugar, about  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon cornstarch  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons cold water  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon lemon juice  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons framboise or Chambord liqueur or red currant jelly  </P> <P> Mix puree and 1/3 cup sugar in microwave-safe 6-cup measure. Cover with wax  paper and microwave on HIGH (100% power) 3 minutes.  </P> <P> Blend cornstarch with water. Whisk cornstarch mixture and lemon juice into  puree and microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until sauce boils  and thickens slightly.  </P> <P> Stir in framboise, cool, taste for sweetness and add more sugar, if needed. If  too thick, thin with small amount of water. Makes 2 cups.  </P> <P> Note: Use as sauce for Peach Melba or ladle over plain ice cream.  </P> <P> Variation: For Apricot or Peach Sauce, prepare as directed substituting pureed  apricots or peaches for berries and peach brandy for framboise.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOT FUDGE SAUCE  </P> <P> 1 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1 (5-ounce) can evaporated milk  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon freeze-dried coffee crystals  </P> <P> Dash salt  </P> <P> 2 (1-ounce) envelopes unsweetened chocolate  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons butter or margarine, at room temperature  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons vanilla  </P> <P> Cake or ice cream  </P> <P> Mix sugar, milk, coffee crystals and salt in microwave-safe 6-cup measure.  Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) 2 to 2 1/2 minutes, stirring at half  time, until bubbling.  </P> <P> Whisk in chocolate, butter and vanilla, beating until smooth. Serve warm or at  room temperature over cake or ice cream. Makes about 1 2/3 cups sauce.  </P></p>

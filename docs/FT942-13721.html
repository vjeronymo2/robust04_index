			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Men in the News: Duo hits the high notes - Andrew Longhurst and Brian Pitman The 17-year-old in the photograph of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's mortgage accounts department in 1950 looks like any building society clerk, in tie and woollen jacket. Brian Pitman had just left school, choosing a career in banking, rather than one playing the trombone. This week, the unexceptional youth who turned into the most admired British banker of his generation, capped his career by bidding Pounds 1.8bn to absorb his old employer into Lloyds Bank. He had been offered the deal by Andrew Long hurst, who had transformed C&amp;G into the society Pitman coveted. The bid on Thursday came unexpectedly, a year before 62-year-old Pitman may retire, confounding speculation that he might tarnish his record by wasting cash on the wrong target. That concern was left behind as Lloyds' shares rose 11 per cent to close at 597p yesterday. The bid proved the danger of underestimating a man whose Gloucestershire accent and talent for explaining finance in simple terms - he recently compared UK and New Zealand inflation in terms of lamb prices - conceal a formidable capacity for strategic thought. Lloyds has made a series of moves - such as pulling out of retail banking overseas, and holding on to third world debt while it rose in price - which others envy. A new generation has been pushed to the helm of the UK's other big banks as shareholders have demanded performance to match Lloyds' profits record. Yet Barclays' Martin Taylor and National Westminster's Derek Wanless have to show they can match Pitman. The Lloyds' boss attributes a year spent working in continental Europe in his early 20s and another in the US later for helping him to develop analytical skills. 'I was surrounded by strategic thinking in US banks at a time when British ones did not even have budgets, and did not disclose profits,' he says. As chief executive, he brought a business-like ethic to a bureaucratic bank which had been indifferently managed. He shed Lloyds' poor operations, and cut costs. He was helped by a natural curiosity about numbers: he is happiest when explaining a chart of financial ratios to analysts. But beyond making some good big decisions, he displayed the sheer doggedness needed to change a big bank. A conversation with Pitman always includes a lengthy rumination on his latest topic of interest. He had talked for more than year about how to respond to low inflation before the C&amp;G bid. 'He is very tenacious, and when he gets an idea in his head he goes on and on about it until we're worn down, and we just have to accept it,' says one Lloyds executive. Although he enjoys a debate, his natural confidence means he can appear patronising even to chief executives of other banks. As befits a career banker, his pastimes remain resolutely ordinary. This weekend, he starts his annual golf holiday with his wife Barbara, who is ladies captain of their local golf club in Weybridge, Surrey. He retains his interest in music, nurtured from his youth playing trombone with a school friend. When he returns, the succession question will still be unsettled. The lack of an obvious heir-apparent after the departure of Michael Hepher, the former chief executive of Lloyds Abbey Life, the bank's life insurance arm, to British Telecom, has already led to one postponement of his retirement. Some bank executives doubt whether he will depart next year, the date originally set by Lloyds' board. None of the bank's senior directors has emerged as his heir-apparent, one reason why Andrew Longhurst has been suggested as a possibility as a result of the C&amp;G bid this week. Longhurst, who at 54 could be too old to succeed even if he were considered a serious contender, has some of the iconoclasm of Pitman. He also has some of the vision, creating a group which manages to sell more mortgages and savings accounts through fewer branches than any other medium-sized UK society. Longhurst was appointed chief executive of C&amp;G in 1982, a year before Pitman's accession at Lloyds. He has more formal education than Pitman, holding a mathematics and statistics degree. But he has pursued a similar crusade, preaching ideas of 'shareholder value' even in a mutually-owned group. He can be charming, achieving an easy informality with outsiders to the gossipy and enclosed world of building societies. But he has made little secret of his intellectual disdain for the world that he may now leave behind. At the C&amp;G's last annual results, he was discussing the quality of the buffet refreshments when it was suggested that the topic should turn to the industry. 'Oh, I don't know,' replied the head of the UK's sixth-largest society, 'cheese straws are more interesting than societies.' Other society chief executives were already speculating privately yesterday as to whether two domineering personalities would clash after the merger. C&amp;G set conditions for being bought, including a bar on Lloyds selling products to C&amp;G members, which could eventually lead to friction. 'Both he (Longhurst) and Brian Pitman are very strong personalities. It will be interesting to see how they get on,' said one society chief executive tartly. An obvious motive for Longhurst to forge a good relationship with Pitman would be to increase his chances of being appointed his successor. Longhurst denies there is even a faint prospect of him becoming chief executive of Lloyds, and the bank's executives dismiss the idea. As the retirement of C&amp;G's former mortgage clerk looms, his place in British banking seems increasingly hard to fill.</p>

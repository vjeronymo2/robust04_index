			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Arts: Claudio Abbado fights back - Richard Fairman reviews the Berlin Philharmonic Just as the Berlin Philharmonic was arriving in London, a torpedo was fired across its bows. The attack came from an unexpected source and had nothing to do with national pique that a German orchestra had been invited to take pride of place in the Proms' 100th season. In fact, this is not the first time that criticism has been levelled at Claudio Abbado since he became the orchestra's music director. At the end of last year Der Spiegel published a controversial article, accusing him of allowing standards at Berlin's cultural flagship to sink. Now an interview with a rival German conductor in The Times has repeated the accusations that Abbado's rehearsal technique and his relationship with musicians leave something to be desired. On top of that, he added, 'the players know that Abbado will conduct from memory, but that his memory is not as reliable as Maazel's'. Ouch] There are still people in Berlin who mourn the passing of Herbert von Karajan and cannot see in his successor the same all-powerful musical dictator that they worshipped before. Unfortunately, we never heard Karajan conduct Mahler's Ninth Symphony in London, but a live recording has preserved it for us. Karajan came late in life to Mahler's music and its hypersensitive neuroses were alien to his character, but he found subtle colours in the orchestral writing that no other conductor has the finesse to equal - for example, violins and solo low flute forming a delicate shade of misty, tear-laden grey. It was a bold statement on Abbado's part to schedule this symphony as the first of his two concerts at the Proms. One of the barbs fired his way most often is that the Berlin Philharmonic has lost its unique sound since he took over. Certainly it is no longer Karajan's orchestra. After years of being blended into a homogeneous whole, either rich or simply congealed depending on one's taste, the Berlin sound is undergoing a process of separation. In this Mahler, the orchestra was audibly made up of distinct sections - well-knit strings, assertive wind and cultured brass (despite a few low growls from the trombones). Although his experience of conducting Mahler is both longer and broader than Karajan's, I would hesitate to say that Abbado is any more of a Mahler specialist. In the long opening movement of the Ninth Symphony (by far the symphony's most challenging for the performers) the insights did not come thick and fast. The keenest grasp of Mahler's very personal idiom seemed to belong to some of the solo musicians, as when the flute and nimble, trilling horn joined for their strange little meandering duet. This was all at the opposite pole from a subjective conductor like Bernstein. Christoph von Dohnanyi (for it was he who poured out his acid observations to The Times) had harsh words to say about Bernstein as well, declaring that his Mahler was 'totally wrong'. This is unfair: Bernstein's performance of the Ninth Symphony may have been exaggerated, but it probed important parts of the composer's psyche, such as his instability and his Jewishness. Abbado does not have a hot-line to emotions like these. His Prom performance was streamlined. Where the music seems to demand abrupt changes of mood or detours to investigate passing feelings, he kept his eyes fixed straight ahead. Each movement worked towards a single climax, the first its mighty collapse into seminal thematic germs, the third its headlong rush to the closing bars. Perhaps there is such a thing as Italian Mahler, which counts urgency, clarity of structure and flowing warmth of lyricism as its main concerns - as Toscanini probably would have done, if he had conducted any. If each of the first three movements left something unsaid, that is because Abbado also sees the symphony itself as a whole. The finale, marvellously played by the strings, built to one overwhelming affirmation of the main theme. Then, having made its ascent, it reached a plateau of intense slowness and quiet for the last ten minutes: a place of endless vistas and cloudless skies, of absolute peace and stillness. At some points the music came close to inaudibility. After the last note faded away, there was a silence that nobody wanted to break, even by breathing. The orchestra was due to follow with a second concert featuring Russian showpieces on Friday, but that could hardly have seemed more out of mind at the time. If anybody in Berlin is still thinking of trying to elbow Abbado out of his post after a performance like this finale, he too would be wise to hold his breath. Sponsored by Deutsche Bank AG</p>

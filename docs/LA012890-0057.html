			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARGAIN CORNER: TAKING FLIGHT ON INDIA AIR PASSES  </P> <P> If India is in your 1990 travel plans, you might consider some air passes being  offered by Indian Airlines, a domestic carrier. Its 21-day "Discover India"  pass, for example, allows unlimited flights throughout the country for $400.  </P> <P> The airline also has regional seven-day "India Wonderfare" passes, one for each  of four regions -- north, south, east and west. Each pass, priced at $200,  allows unlimited travel within its region.  </P> <P> A condition of both the national and regional passes is that you can't return  to any city you've already flown to unless it's for a connecting flight. You  have a year from the date of purchase in which to start using each pass, which  are all on a consecutive-day basis.  </P> <P> The passes can be bought in the United States or in India, but must be paid for  in U.S. dollars.  </P> <P> Indian Railways offers an Indrail pass for seven to 90 days, which allows  unlimited rail travel.  </P> <P> The Indrail pass is available with three classes of service: Air-conditioned  with sleeper, air-conditioned with seat, and non-air-conditioned, second-class.  On this basis, the pass costs $190, $95 and $45 for seven days; $230, $115 and  $55 for 15 days; $280, $140 and $65 for 21 days; $350, $175 and $75 for 30  days; $520, $260 and $120 for 60 days, and $690, $345 and $150 for 90 days.  </P> <P> Children under 5 travel free, while those 5 to 12 years are entitled to a  child's pass, which costs about half the adult fare.  </P> <P> You can buy these rail passes in the United States or in India. If bought in  India, you still have to pay in U.S. currency.  </P> <P> For more information on travel to India, contact travel agents or the  Government of India Tourist Office, 3550 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 204, Los Angeles  90010, (213) 380-8855.

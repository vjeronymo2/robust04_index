			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Letter: Education and the skills gap Sir, I have to agree With Professor Desai's views (Letters, April 24) upon the neglect of education being at the root of Britain's structural problems. The notion of a skills gap in the UK is not a distant prospect; it is a current reality. Only education, in the broadest sense, can close this gap. The approach that supports the belief that qualifications do not matter is one that also sponsors long-term decline. As marketplaces become more competitive and the challenges facing managers more complex so the debates about solutions have to be conducted at a higher level. The laudable desire to involve as much of the workforce as possible in problem-solving inevitably necessitates discussion at the lowest common level of education. The lower this level is, the less efficient the debate and the solution. As they say at IBM. . .'If you think training is expensive, try incompetence.'

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Delors makes a hit by aiming lower HOBBLED by sciatica, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, performed a difficult balancing act at the Copenhagen summit yesterday. His exposition on why Europe is losing the race to remain competitive with the US and Asia contained plenty of food for thought, but little to offend EC leaders, many of whom have different prescriptions for dealing with today's unemployment crisis in the Community. By winning a mandate for further study, Mr Delors has the chance to present new ideas and a possible action plan in time for the next EC summit in December. This may sound modest, but he has learnt to temper his ambition as the balance of power has shifted from Brussels to the member states. In his presentation, Mr Delors pointed to graphs showing that the US created almost 29m jobs between 1970 and 1990, compared to nearly 9m in the EC. He conceded that Europe's record on youth and long-term unemployment was worse than that of its principal competitors. Mr Delors called for an increase in job agencies to help people back to work, suggesting that EC states increase their annual spending on such agencies from 0.1 per cent of GDP to 0.5 per cent of GDP. But he rejected substantial changes either to Europe's labour protection laws or its welfare state. Mr Delors, a life-long Socialist, was never about to stage a Pauline conversion on the road to Copenhagen. His goal was more to shape the debate, now that Europe's political currents have shifted. The Commission president knows that the highly integrated model he espoused for the Twelve in the run-up to the Maastricht treaty three years ago is no longer realistic. Thus, the eight-point action plan contains something for everybody. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany will be pleased that Mr Delors is talking about the 'enormous potential for growth' in central and eastern Europe. Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, will take comfort that Mr Delors is preaching the virtue of open markets and is willing to support a 'swift' conclusion to the Uruguay Round of global trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, assuming that difference on agriculture can be overcome. Mr Delors offered little to the protectionist lobby in his native France which is gaining ground as unemployment soars. Instead, he is looking beyond the present Gatt round to the creation of a future world trade organisation whose rules would take into account currency movements, capital flows, environmental codes and the need 'to deliver the social progress to which everyone has a right. . . . ' Mr Delors also wants to raise spending on research and development, devoting 3 per cent of the gross national product of EC countries to this area, compared with the present 2 per cent. He is also calling for a 'common information area' in Europe, to be created by stimulating industries such as telecommunications, computers, and fibre optics. He suggested that the first new investment by member states be Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.9bn), followed by an annual Ecu5bn-Ecu8bn programme. These ideas confirm that Mr Delors has lost none of his instincts for thinking and acting on a grand scale. But in Copenhagen yesterday he showed that he understands that success will depend on the willingness of member states to co-operate. Now that he is entering the twilight of his Brussels career, Mr Delors is looking to preserve today's gains in the EC as much as to chart the future.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Delors' plan for economic recovery  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Consolidate the single market and progress to economic and monetary   union (Emu)  -Get a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of GATT  -Reform and redirect the educational system  -Set up a new EC development model  -Reform the EC labour market and help smaller businesses  -Increase co-operation in research and development  -Create smooth transport and telecommunications structures  -Create an EC information system to aid economic growth  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

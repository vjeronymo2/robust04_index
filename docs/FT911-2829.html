			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Financial retailing to be reviewed - The two main methods of selling finance products are to be scrutinised by SIB IF YOU do not know or understand what polarisation of the retailing of financial products means, do not worry: few members of the British public know much about this esoteric subject, even though it can be very important when you take out an endowment mortgage contract or a personal pensions plan. Indeed, so low is public awareness that this week the Securities and Investments Board, the body which supervises investor protection, decided to undertake a review of investment retailing, three years after the current regime was introduced as a result of the implementation of the Financial Services Act. High on the agenda will be the future, if any, of polarisation and of the formulae for disclosures of commissions, early surrender values and other important information which are imposed by the current retailing rules. Polarisation is the name given to the division of retailers of financial products into two camps. Independent financial advisers (IFAs) must give unbiased advice on all the competing products in the market place. Salesman or tied agents, on the other hand, may only represent one company, and need only recommend the most appropriate product from that company's range. It is illegal for an IFA to have special links or contracts with individual product providers. Equally, it is an offence for an Allied Dunbar salesman to sell a policy from Standard Life or Sun Life even if it is demonstrably better than anything from his own company's list. The rigid rule applies right across the market, from one-man firms to mighty financial institutions. For instance, National Westminster Bank is an IFA in all its branches, whereas Barclays is tied to its own in-house life company. Polarisation originally emerged as a concept around 1985 from a life industry think tank called the Marketing of Investments Board Organising Committee (Miboc), which was set up to pave the way for the Financial Services Act. Miboc attempted to reconcile powerful rivalries between direct marketing companies with big salesforces, such as Allied Dunbar, and other life companies, notably the big Scottish mutuals, which sold nearly all of their policies through IFAs. Many in the industry wanted to preserve the role of IFAs, which at that time handled perhaps 60 per cent of the industry's business, but Miboc discovered a legal problem. Under existing law, IFAs may have been acting illegally by claiming to act as brokers on behalf of clients but at the same time failing to disclose extra benefits such as volume-based bonuses and office expenses paid to them by life companies. No cases had actually come to court, but the new legislation would have to address the problem. Polarisation was the solution. IFAs would have to give 'best advice' about the most attractive products on the market, and could receive no remuneration except commissions. These would be subject to a maximum commissions agreement (MCA) to avoid possible bias if some life companies paid over the top. Meanwhile, employed salesmen or self-employed representatives could only sell the products of a single company. The formula seemed neat to the Miboc men but it has been gradually falling apart ever since. First, the direct-selling life companies went around offering IFAs much higher commissions if they became tied agents. Many of them duly switched. Then Sir Gordon Borrie at the Office of Fair Trading successfully attacked the MCA as being a price-fixing arrangement against the public interest. The MCA was scrapped and commission rates jumped by 20 or 30 per cent. That gave IFAs more money, but at the same time they were told to disclose more about their income to clients. It was the last straw for many of the banks and building societies which one after another tied to single life offices (NatWest and Bradford and Bingley Building Society are the only significant remaining exceptions). The Halifax Building Society, for instance, tied to Standard Life after conducting research among its customers which indicated that they were happy to rely on Halifax's own name and reputation and attached little importance to independent status. The IFA share of the life and pensions market has therefore slumped, perhaps to 40 per cent or less, and the specialist self-regulatory organisation which supervises IFAs, called Fimbra, is in financial difficulties, partly because of shrinking membership. What is more, Sir Gordon Borrie is still on the warpath, this time insisting that clearer disclosure of commissions should be made by IFAs to clients. IFAs fear that this could put them at still more of a disadvantage compared with salesmen and tied reps. The Securities and Investments Board has therefore been forced to conclude that the present framework is not serving, as originally intended, to maintain a strong independent sector. It is coy about what it may decide to do about it, but several possibilities will be on the agenda. They will include: A new multi-tied status which would give both small firms and big banks more flexibility in building ranges of products without claiming to give full market coverage. A change in the balance of disclosures to clients so as to reduce or eliminate the advantages currently enjoyed by salesmen over IFAs. The improvement of disclosures on costs and investment returns so that intermediaries, the technical press and consumer organisations can pinpoint good and bad companies through the compilation of league tables. This could all lead to a huge upheaval for the life industry and the various regulatory bodies. According to SIB, a key principle behind the review is that 'there should continue to be available high quality sources of independent financial advice.' And maybe the message is starting to get through to the public. Executives at the Halifax, for example, say that there has recently been a slight increase in the proportion of their customers who believe that independent advice might have advantages.</p>

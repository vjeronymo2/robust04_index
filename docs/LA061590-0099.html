			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> YANAI WORKS ON GOLF, WAITS FOR OLYMPIC FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Dave Yanai has been busy lately.  </P> <P> The Cal State Dominguez Hills basketball coach has been planning his annual  youth basketball camp and practicing his golf swing in anticipation of a match  against friends Pete Newell, the former basketball coach at California, and  Bobby Knight, the coach at Indiana.  </P> <P> Yanai has not spent much time on his role as assistant coach of the West team  for next month's Olympic Festival. All he knows is that he's been told to show  up for practice July 2 in Minneapolis-St. Paul.  </P> <P> "There's a committee that sorts the players out," Yanai said. "They get  evaluated and then we get them."  </P> <P> Yanai spoke with West Coach Don Monson in April at the NCAA Final Four in  Denver.  </P> <P> "We went over some guidelines as to what he wanted from me, what we would do,"  Yanai said.  </P> <P> Monson, who is basketball coach at Oregon, and Yanai will put the team through  two-a-day workouts for three days before round-robin play between teams from  the North, South, East and West begins July 7. The finals are July 10.  </P> <P> "I'm looking forward to working with some of the best kids in the country, many  of whom could be on the United States Olympic Team in 1992," Yanai said.  </P> <P> Yanai said he and Monson have agreed to keep strategy simple.  </P> <P> "You know I like to play man-to-man defenses anyway," he said, "So keeping the  system simple doesn't bother me a bit."  </P> <P> Yanai realizes that he is an ambassador for several causes. He has coached for  13 years at the Division II level, where few if any coaches get a chance to  coach Olympic-class athletes. He detests the zone defense because he believes  that it slows down the game. He is not a high-profile coach at a school with  financial resources, as Knight is, but has a 196-155 record. In addition, he is  the only collegiate basketball coach of Japanese ancestry in the United States.  </P> <P> Can he represent all those interests at the festival?  </P> <P> "I'm just going to go out there and hope I don't embarrass (anyone)," he said.  </P></p>

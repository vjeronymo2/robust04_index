			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Call for action on laundering INTERNATIONAL co-ordination is needed to counter the use of electronic payment networks by criminals laundering the proceeds of drug trafficking and robberies, the Bank of England warns this week. The Bank says in an article to appear in its Quarterly Bulletin on Thursday: 'The increasing efficiency and integration of the world's financial system creates an environment that organised criminals are only too ready to exploit.' The Bank is one of the seven founding members of the international Financial Action Task Force, which is the main forum focused on combating money laundering. The task force has been particularly concerned that many electronic payment instructions 'fail to include the names and addresses of both senders and beneficiaries'. As a result the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications has told all its clients to include these details. Few money launderers are caught. In the UK only two employees of financial institutions have been prosecuted for money laundering under Section 24 of the Drug Trafficking Offences Act, although about 12,000 suspicious cash movements are expected to be reported this year.</p>

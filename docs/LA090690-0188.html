			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> CITY TO TAKE STAND ON PARKWAY TREES  </P> <P> City officials are about to unveil a new ordinance intended to clear any  confusion about who owns the trees on city parkways: the city does.  </P> <P> The ordinance, which was several years in the making, gives the city the first  and last word on decisions to plant or replace trees and to remove any  illegally planted trees or shrubs.  </P> <P> Several months ago, city workers chopped down three dozen 70-year-old oak and  ash trees on the north side of Broadway in Anaheim, angering residents, some of  whom have lived in the neighborhood for more than 30 years.  </P> <P> The residents formed Broadway and Area Residents, an 85-member group that  succeeded in saving the trees on the south side of the street.  </P> <P> Christopher K. Jarvi, director of the city's Parks and Recreation Department,  said the ordinance probably will be controversial.  </P> <P> "You can't please everyone. . . . You have people who want their tree taken  out, and you have others who want one put in. You have some people who want  their tree trimmed four times a year, and you have people who don't want it  trimmed at all."  </P> <P> If passed, the ordinance will require that any appeals be made to the parks  director, who may consult an outside arborist. In two meetings with community  members, residents had asked that the appeals be made instead through a  citizens committee.  </P></p>

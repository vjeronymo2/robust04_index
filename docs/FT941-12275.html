			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: Incentives to ease pandemonium Investors in the Istanbul stock exchange are waiting to see if the dust settles this week after recent convulsions in Turkish money markets forced the government to devalue the lira, writes John Murray Brown. The equity market closed on Friday down 4.9 per cent, but off a mid-session fall of more than 7 per cent, as investors were encouraged by reports that the government was to provide new incentives for companies going public. With the lira devalued by 12 per cent late on Wednesday, the index has lost 38 per cent in dollar terms since January 21. Mr Stuart Harley, of Schroders, says that the worst is probably now over, although concern remains over prospects for higher inflation. The authorities face another test of nerve this week with the redemption of some TL7,000bn worth of government paper on Wednesday and Thursday. This could create renewed pressure on exchange rates - the continued volatility in money markets was underlined again on Friday when overnight rates briefly touched a heady 450 per cent. By announcing a new range of incentives Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, hopes to avoid any repeat of last week's market pandemonium. Following moves to tighten monetary policy, the additional demand for treasury paper is expected to hold back equity prices. Nonetheless, Istanbul brokers say that in spite of the dramatic collapse of dollar share values, there has been little move by foreign investors to liquidate holdings.</p>

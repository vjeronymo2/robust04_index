			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Sedgwick shares rise despite decrease to Pounds 55.8m TOUGH CONDITIONS in the reinsurance and US insurance markets and lower interest rates combined to depress profitability at Sedgwick Group, the insurance broking and services company. Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 55.8m (Pounds 74m) for the nine months to September 30. However, the performance was at the top end of analysts' expectations and the shares rose 8p to 158p. Sentiment towards Sedgwick and the rest of the insurance broking sector is also improving as a result of a strengthening in the dollar and potential rises in US insurance rates. Mr Sax Riley, the chief executive who has taken over from Mr David Rowland, said that in the US there were 'signs there for something of a change'. But following the unexpected downturn in US insurance rates in the second quarter this year, Mr Riley remains cautious. During the nine months revenues from brokerage and fee income fell to Pounds 465.3m (Pounds 472.1m). 'A substantial proportion' of the decline was due to a contraction in the reinsurance market, he said. Sedgwick has also been badly hit by the virtual elimination of the marine retrocession, income from which has traditionally a mainstay for the EW Payne reinsurance broking business. Despite successful interest rate hedging, investment income fell to Pounds 37.8m (Pounds 44m), mainly due to lower US interest rates. Interest payable rose to Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 8.5m). Expenses were marginally ahead at Pounds 435.7m (Pounds 435.5m) - but increased by 2 per cent in underlying terms - partially reflecting the costs of developing the group's European consulting business. Although the strengthening of the dollar will boost prospects in the fourth quarter and into 1993, its relative weakness during the first nine months had a negative effect of Pounds 1.6m on pre-tax profit.

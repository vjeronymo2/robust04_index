			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] On orders from President Zine Al-Abidine Ben Ali,  who is concerned over the safety of the Tunisian community in  Yemen, the members of our community together with members of  families of Maghreban diplomats from Morocco, Algeria, and  Libya, have returned aboard a private airplane from Yemen where  security conditions have deteriorated since fighting broke out  between Yemeni parties.    The airplane carrying Tunisian families landed at 1830  yesterday evening. Some Algerian, Moroccan, and Libyan families  who were living in Yemen returned to Tunis on the same plane  awaiting their return to their countries. [passage omitted]</p>

The bribes, said the sources, were paid for public bids to  build a freeway linking the Venice-Padua highway to the Marco  Polo airport of Venice.    De Michelis and Bernini are among five members of parliament  who may face charges of corruption and violation of party  financing laws for their alleged involvement in kickbacks for  public bids in the northern Veneto region.    (Barbara Coelin, De Michelis' former secretary, told Milan  magistrates she received "envelopes" from several businessmen,  including former Montedison chairman Carlo Sama, which, "for the  way they were given to me, the instructions I received and the  discretion I was told to use, I could understand they contained  money," according to transcripts of the questioning, which took  place in Switzerland on March 2.)    The other MPs are former Christian Democrat treasurer  Severino Citaristi, another Christian Democrat Senator, Pietro  Montressori, and Socialist MP Raimondo Galluppo.    The public works projects under investigation by the Venice  public prosecutors include pesticide cleanups in several Veneto  provinces and a pollution cleanup project just outside Venice.    De Michelis was the most powerful Socialist politician in  Venice before being implicated in a number of corruption probes;  Bernini was a local heavyweight in the Christian Democrat party  who has also been involved in a series of investigations.</p>

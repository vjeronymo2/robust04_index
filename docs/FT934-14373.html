			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: The British lead a merry dance - Sophie Constanti witnesses some bad behaviour and great performances at the FIND in Montreal THE BRITISH are famous for behaving badly when abroad. Consider the mob of neo-Nazi football hooligans running riot this week in Amsterdam. Montreal is not on the average British trouble-maker's list of Top 10 destinations; too cold, too cultural, reluctantly bilingual and much too far from home. But at the city's recent Festival International de Nouvelle Danse (FIND), some of the invited British guests - dancers, choreographers, producers, promoters - appeared hell-bent on being ill-mannered, unreliable, churlish and, on occasion, thoroughly disagreeable. After a week of British impropriety and contentiousness during a festival which lasts just 11 days, people began to ask: 'What's wrong with the British? Why are they so rude?' This year, FIND - initiated as a biannual event in 1985 but, since 1991, presented every autumn - decided to turn the spotlight on British choreographers. The programming committee, led by president Chantal Pontbriand, secured an impressive, state-of-the-art quartet - Michael Clark, DV8 Physical Theatre, Shobana Jeyasingh and Jonathan Burrows - and announced the sixth Festival as 'an explosion of British dance.' The first instance of this back-firing occurred on the opening night of the festival when Michael Clark brought the curtain down on his own show, Michael Clark's Modern Masterpiece, soon after the interval. An act of both self-destruction and self-empowerment, it left Clark's audience baffled, then quietly angered. But Montreal's dancegoers are an optimistic, tolerant lot, and a small crowd turned up the morning after for Clark's meet-the-choreographer session. Clark then used the public platform as an opportunity to give an informative and entertaining (if disjointed) lecture-demonstration. He talked about his Royal Ballet School days and his first choreographic works, such as Do You Me? I Did, and New Puritans; and he articulated the principles behind the 'pelvic technique' which he has developed and which now underpins his whole philosophy of dance classicism. Out came the costume box, Clark casually strapping on a dildo underneath his small apron and explaining the significance of this attire whilst standing in arabesque. It was a great performance and by the time he had finished all was forgiven. But how did Pontbriand react to Clark pulling the plug on his own show? With calm dignity, accepting without judgment his decision to stop the performance because 'it felt like the right thing to do at the time.' The following evening, DV8 Physical Theatre premiered its latest work, MSM, a 90-minute play about cottaging, ie sex between men in public toilets, and about the married, apparently heterosexual men who, according to statistical evidence, are more inclined than gay men to go cottaging. Lloyd Newson, DV8's founder and artistic director, had told the festival organisers that MSM (socialogical shorthand for Men Seeking Men) was going to be a text-based rather than movement-informed theatre piece. Pontbriand, quite rightly, remained willing to present MSM, whatever its eventual shape or form. Audiences who had heard so much about Newson's more overtly-physical works, such as Dead Dreams of Monochrome Men and If Only . . ., were divided after the show. Some felt let down by the fact that MSM was a play, others were further divided as to whether it was good or bad theatre. Having acknowledged Newson's right to choose his medium, many found the perfect complement to MSM a few blocks down the road at Cinema ONF, where film adaptation of DV8's Strange Fish (another FIND coup) was being screened. One thing that did seem to bother people was both DV8 and Clark's refusal to take curtain-calls. At home, this convention has taken root without anyone paying much attention. But in Montreal it deeply offended some members of the public. One can respect Clark and Newson's decision to keep their performers in the wings once the show is over - Clark admits that he has never felt comfortable with the sound of applause. One must also, in trying to make some sense of Clark's first-night party tricks, take note of the fact that the choreographer was not really satisfied with the show he brought to Montreal, having had to re-stage Modern Masterpiece in just a few weeks with an almost entirely new cast. But I am still searching for the logic behind John Ashford's vituperative outbursts at a round-table discussion entitled 'The British New Dance: Development and Perspectives'. Ashford, director of The Place Theatre, London's most dance-dedicated venue, gave a speech tinged with loathing for almost everyone and everything outside his own Eurodance network. It was an odd mixture of paranoid specifics and sweeping generalisations which amused some of the Canadian dance students in the audience, but served only to alienate many of his British colleagues who were present. His comment that 'ballet is at the heart of all dance critics' interest' (he later changed 'all' to 'most') was delivered as if it were an indisputable truth, its offensiveness exacerbated by a barrage of unprovoked verbal attacks mainly directed towards one member of the panel. Ashford, who later flew back to London to collect the Pounds 30,000 Digital Premier Award, has done much to promote new and independent dance in Britain and has forged important connections with the rest of Europe. In his April in Paris and Turning World seasons, contemporary dance from across the globe has been brought to our doorstep. But in his rude and public dismissal of the views of other dance professionals, Ashford does neither himself nor British dance any favours. He is a thorn in his own flesh. Ashford, however, claims that there is a conspiracy to undermine contemporary dance in Britain which threatens the proposed increase in Arts Council funding towards contemporary dance. His main complaint is that even those people supposedly sympathetic to contemporary dance have done nothing to retaliate against the likes of government ministers and the ballet establishment. Indeed, Ashford has a case, but his attitude is hardly conducive to building a united front. Maybe the FIND got what it deserved. In 1989, when British dance was less faction-ridden and more visionary, the festival refused to take a serious interest, turning instead to the rest of Europe. Until this year, Pontbriand had showcased only two British companies - Second Stride and Laurie Booth. These days, many British choreographers, even established artists like Clark and Newson, are more worried about their financial security and artistic development than they were in pre-recession times. Intent upon looking after Number One, their survival tactics are neither based upon nor seem to allow room for good manners. British dance seems to have become an incurably arrogant, desperate, badly-behaved animal - especially when it is abroad.</p>

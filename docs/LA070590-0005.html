			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU ASKED ABOUT: PUTTING PANS TO THE HOT-SPOT TEST  </P> <P> Question: Is there a way to test a pan for hot spots?  </P> <P> Answer: "The quickest and surest method we know is to pour a uniform layer of  four or five tablespoons of sugar mixed with a couple of tablespoons of water  into the pan, then turn the heat to a low-to-medium setting and wait for the  sugar to start to caramelize," says Howard Hillman, author of "Kitchen Science"  (Houghton Mifflin Co., 1981). "If the pan has no hot spots, the sugar will  caramelize evenly. If the pan has hot spots, the sugar directly over them will  caramelize first, forming a pattern that maps your pan's hot spots.  </P> <P> "If you discover that your pots have hot spots and you do not wish to replace  the equipment, you can minimize the defect by using as low a heat setting as  possible or by using a heat diffuser," says Hillman.  </P> <P> Q: Throughout the years, friends have given me bottles of sweet wine as gifts.  As of now I have 15 and don't know what to do with them. I do like wine  coolers. Would you have any recipes or other ideas?  </P> <P> A: Here are three cooling ideas for summer: two beverages and a fruit cup.  </P> <P> CRANBERRY SPRITZER  </P> <P> 1/3 cup cranberry juice, chilled  </P> <P> 1/2 cup sweet wine, chilled  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons Grand Marnier  </P> <P> 2 to 3 ice cubes  </P> <P> Club soda, chilled  </P> <P> Combine cranberry juice, wine and Grand Marnier.

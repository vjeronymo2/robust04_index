			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / No change to court dress AFTER a year-long consulta-tion exercise, Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor (above), yesterday announced that there would be no change in court dress, Robert Rice writes. Barristers will continue to wear wigs and gowns in court. High Court judges will retain their ceremonial full-bottomed wigs, knee breeches, hose and buckled shoes, beneath a scarlet cloth and fur mantle. Responses from jurors, witnesses, the public, the legal profession and the judiciary overwhelmingly backed the status quo. The majority felt that the formal dress had a significant role to play in maintaining respect for the authority and status of the court. More than 500 responses were received from organisations and individuals. Only 15 per cent of all respondents favoured abolition of daily court dress, 67 per cent favoured the status quo and the remainder favoured simplification, such as abolishing the use of wigs. Ceremonial court dress attracted comment from only 20 per cent of respondents, of whom a fifth favoured its abolition.</p>

Speaking at a press conference in Ljubljana  where he arrived on Thursday [27 January] on a short private  visit, Zhirinovskiy resolutely opposed any military action in  former Yugoslavia. Any further foreign involvement in the  Yugoslav crisis, especially in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina,  would inevitably trigger world war three, he argued.    The first precondition for resolving the crisis in the  Balkans is to withdraw foreign troops from the territory of  former Yugoslavia. Otherwise, the conflict would continue for  another 20 or 30 years, said Zhirinovskiy.    At the press conference attended by over 100 reporters from  Europe, Japan and the United States, Zhirinovskiy said he would  present his plan for resolving the Bosnia crisis during his  visit to Belgrade on Sunday. TANJUG learns unofficially that  Zhirinovskiy will be visiting Belgrade at the invitation of the  Russian-Serbian Friendship Society.    In Slovenia, Zhirinovskiy was highly criticial of the  disintegration of the Slavic states into a host of  city-statelettes. If this trend continues, the entire world  will break up because the retailoring of borders in one case  will encourage the same practice in another. Slovenia violently  seceded from the former Yugoslav Federation in 1991.    Asked whether he had his own ideas for the formation of a  new  Yugoslav community, Zhirinovskiy said a confederation of  Slovenes, Serbs and Croats could not be ruled out.</p>

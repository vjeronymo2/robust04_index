			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Deputy Chairman Wolfgang Thierse by </F> Horst Ohligschlaeger; place and date not given: "`A Lot  Possible With the FDP'"]    [Text] [Ohligschlaeger] Some 160 billion German marks  flow from west to east each year. Yet, at the recent local and  European elections, between 20 and 40 percent of all east  Germans voted for the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism]. Do  you understand this?    [Thierse] Beside the former supporters of the SED [Socialist  Unity Party of Germany] regime, there seems to be a considerable  number of Germans who think that they can best express their  anger and frustration by handing it to the PDS. Helmut Kohl is  to blame for this election result. Anyone promising as much as  Kohl did in 1990, and delivering so little of it, should not be  surprised to see an antiwestern party gain support in eastern  Germany.    [Ohligschlaeger] But this development harms the SPD [Social  Democratic Party] rather than the CDU [Christian Democratic  Union].    [Thierse] The CDU has clearly lost votes in eastern Germany,  while the SPD has achieved considerable gains. But without the  PDS, these gains could have been even higher. Secretly, the CDU  is probably pleased at the PDS victory. But I do not think  parties that promise a great deal, such as the CDU and the PDS,  can be successful in the long run.    [Ohligschlaeger] Why has the SPD failed to win over the  dissatisfied voters in eastern Germany?    [Thierse] The degree of frustration seems to call for a  certain degree of radicalism. Unlike the PDS, the SPD cannot  and will not promote antiwestern moods. We do not want an  election campaign full of pessimism. We want to make offers  that are feasible and can win a majority.    [Ohligschlaeger] But this does not seem to be very  successful at the moment.    [Thierse] We have learned our lesson and we will conduct a  far more emotional election campaign over the next few months.  We must show that we are passionately committed to effecting a  change of government. This also goes for myself. I have kept  out of the debate on the European election campaign strategy  because I did not feel competent enough on Europe. That is  different in the Bundestag and landtag elections in eastern  Germany. If I can contribute anything, it is certainly 40 years  of GDR socialism.    [Ohligschlaeger] And what would you recommend on the subject  of coalition statements?    [Thierse] We should not get tied up in coalition statements  now. At the moment we are closer to the Greens programwise than  we are to other parties. But what the talks in October will be  like and what their outcome will be is still open. I think  there is still a lot possible with the FDP [Free Democratic  Party of Germany]. Everything will depend on the SPD's election  results. And the results of the recent elections were not as bad  as many people want to make believe: In the municipal  elections, which are doubtless the more authentic ones, the SPD  could gain up to 9 percent.    [Ohligschlaeger] Is this not making things look better than  they are? In Saxony-Anhalt the CDU is ahead of the SPD by a  small margin in spite of the wage scandal.    [Thierse] This is a false interpretation of the result. We  have won up to 9 percent, and journalists call that defeat. The  CDU has lost up to 8 percent in the east. But just because it  has lost less than had been feared, a large crowd of journalists  interprets this to be a victory for the CDU.    [Ohligschlaeger] So it is all the journalists' fault again?    [Thierse] I think that a large section of the media are CDU  election campaign staff. They keep accusing the SPD of not  making it clear enough what it plans to do after the elections.  But the fact that the CDU has not yet presented a precise  factual program does not seem to bother any of the journalists.  The issue of parties' relations with the PDS is handled in a  similar manner.    [Ohligschlaeger] Are you surprised about that?    [Thierse] Yes, because this problem is not peculiar to the  SPD, but it is something that the CDU also has to face.    [Ohligschlaeger] What does the SPD say?    [Thierse] On the land and federal levels, any political  cooperation between SPD and PDS must be ruled out, whether it is  called coalition or something else. On the municipal level,  there will not be any coalitions either; but there the situation  is different. In Berlin, the district authorities' composition  has been forced upon them by the election results. It is only  decent democratic behavior to let people who have been elected  cooperate in the solution of common problems, where this is  necessary. The PDS has to be defeated by democratic decency  instead of making it a martyr.</p>

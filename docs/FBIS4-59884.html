			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in </F> Oslo, by Mikhal Gazit and Ya'aqov Eylon in the studio -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Eylon] Mr. Peres, with  regard to the question of Syria, U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's latest trip received a frosty reaction in  Damascus. Do you share this impression? Is the issue stuck or  do you see some progress?    [Peres] Look, we know how things work in Damascus. Until  they give their agreement, frosty winds blow in all directions.  People used to say that the difference between Syria and  Lebanon is that with Lebanon it is very easy to reach an  agreement but the agreement will be totally worthless, while  with the Syrians it is very hard to reach an agreement but the  agreement will stand. We will continue to act and strive until  we convince the entire Middle East of the need for peace. In  other words, we are the initiating party; we are not being  dragged after anybody and we are not the offended party; we do  not play sulking games. We have a very clear policy, and we  must continue to act to implement it.    [Gazit] Mr. Peres, a banner headline in today's press says  that Israel agrees to the establishment of a Syrian  early-warning station in the Galilee. Do you have any idea what  this is about?    [Peres] In my opinion, all these are premature speculations.  I do not think we can discuss such details yet, because the  problems between us and Syria are not of a technical nature but  are a matter of principle. Only after we reach an agreement in  principle will there be room to discuss technical issues.    [Gazit] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, thank you very much.</p>

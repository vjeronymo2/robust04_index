			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Trade and the Environment: Malaysia ridicules enemies of timber trade DR Mahathir Mohammed, the Malaysian prime minister, devotes a good deal of his time these days to ridiculing western environmentalists and criticising their attempts to restrict trade in tropical timber. At last month's summit of the Association of South-East Asian Nations in Singapore, he pointed out that the rich industrialised countries, having deforested their own land, were now causing most of the world's pollution while begging developing countries not to cut down trees. He disputed the idea that tropical forests were a common heritage of the world and - perhaps letting his imagination get carried away - claimed that wealthy, technologically advanced nations could plant even deserts with tropical hardwoods and so triple the area of tropical timberland within a century. More forests can be saved by preventing forest fires or putting them out quickly, Dr Mahathir added, than by boycotting the export of tropical timber or advocating that forest dwellers remain in the forest, eating monkeys and suffering from all kinds of tropical diseases. Malaysia has good reason to be defensive about the timber trade. It accounts for nearly half the world's recorded exports of tropical timber, compared to 26.7 per cent for Indonesia and a mere 2.4 per cent for Brazil. That Brazil - the most notorious environmental villain to ordinary, green-thinking people - should account for so small share of the trade is perhaps the best illustration of the lack of correlation between deforestation and timber exports. The Gatt report on the environment takes up this theme with enthusiasm, saying that a ban on trade in logs and processed tropical timber would have a miniscule effect because such exports amount to less than 1 per cent of the trees felled in developing countries. Those calling for restrictions on tropical timber exports have an especially unconvincing case for trade restraints on environmental grounds, the report says. Environmentalists would be the first to agree that general deforestation is usually the result of farming or tree-cutting for fuel (as wood or charcoal) rather than logging. Nor would they dispute the Gatt report's assertions that deforestation could be slowed by compensating lower-income countries for preserving large forests and by promoting employment and income growth for the rural poor. But they note that loggers build roads which allow others to encroach on virgin forest (even if it is true that the - all too rare - responsible logging enterprises protect their concessions from illegal loggers for their own financial benefit). The environmentalists also say that the arguments deployed by the likes of the Malaysian government and the Gatt report tend to lump trees together as if they were all of the same species. The problem is not just one of deforestation, they say, but the indiscriminate harvesting of rare hardwoods which need decades to regenerate themselves. With a logging ban announced, if not enforced, in Thailand, Thai entrepreneurs have taken to plundering the teak and other hardwood trees of Burma, Laos and Cambodia, a trade which also allows them to disguise illegally felled Thai trees as imports from neighbouring countries. I don't know how you can control that if you don't put controls on trade, says one environmentalist in Bangkok.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno; from the "180 Minutes of News" </F> newscast]    [Text] The extraordinary Council of Ministers meeting  approved guidelines for the decree establishing taxes on bank  debits which is scheduled to enter into effect on 9 May. The  announcement was made by acting Finance Minister Luis Javier  Grisanti who explained that the tax will be levied on all  operations carried out by individuals or legal entities at the  country's financial institutions.    The banks will act as withholding agents and will notify the  financial authorities of the total amount collected, one day  following the collection date. According to the decree, the  states, municipalities, Central Bank of Venezuela [BCV],  investment funds, the National Savings and Loans Bank, the  autonomous and academic institutions, and foundations are  exempted from paying the tax since these organizations are  considered state institutions. Exempt operations also include  those related to BCV's legal reserve accounts, operations  between PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum] and the BCV, and those  related to financial intermediation in mortgage banks as well as  savings and loans banks.    Likewise, exemptions include all transfers related to a same  account holder within the same bank institution, or between his  deposit and his liquid asset funds. Diplomatic missions,  consular and international organizations, and the personnel  assigned to these offices are also exempt from paying the tax.    [Begin Grisanti recording] Article 13 of the decree law  establishes a very important guideline whereby in those cases of  bank accounts opened for payroll purposes, employers will not be  allowed to transfer to the workers amounts paid as a result of  the tax. In other words, anytime the payroll account is debited  by the total wages to be paid to the employees, it has been  clearly determined that the employer will deduct the  corresponding amount. Of course, debits caused by the account  holder after having received payment will be taxed. [end  recording]    The acting finance minister stressed that because of the  provisional nature of the tax, payment will not entail a  decrease in the taxes to be paid the following year by taxpayers.</p>

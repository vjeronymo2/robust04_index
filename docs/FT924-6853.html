			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / People: Sach - 'intensive care' at RBS Derek Sach, formerly a director of 3i, has joined Royal Bank of Scotland. He is setting up a new unit, Specialised Lending Services, to help faltering businesses. Unlike banks' all too active intensive care and recovery operations, aimed at picking up the pieces of sick or dead companies, this unit is intended to provide assistance to businesses whose problems have not yet become critical but may deteriorate, and thus protect the bank's loans. The idea of setting up Specialised Lending Services came from within the Royal Bank and Sach was approached by George Mathewson, chief executive, himself once with 3i. Sach, now 44, spent 20 years at 3i, becoming group managing director for UK investments. He left at the beginning of this year because, he says, he was not wholly in agreement with 3i's proposed flotation, since postponed. Sach says there are many more companies that may be faltering than those actually needing intensive care. 'They may have made one acquisition too many, or become over-exposed on property,' he says. 'By developing and using our understanding of a company's business, and working together to achieve an early identification of future problems, we are far more likely to be able to offer a remedy to their malaise - and therefore ensure their survival.' He says that in the 1981/82 recession venture capital companies provided a similar service to that now being offered by the Royal Bank: 'Companies were backed then which often came good later.' The unit is absorbing the Royal Bank's intensive care and recovery operations and will employ 300 people. Sach, who pronounces his name 'saitch', will be based in London but the unit will also operate from Manchester and Edinburgh. ***** UK Gold, the new satellite channel running the best entertainment programmes from the libraries of the BBC and Thames Television, has appointed its first chief executive. Bruce Steinberg, 35, joins UK Gold from MTV Europe where he is the director in charge of advertising sales and new business development. Derek Lewis, the former chief executive of the Granada Group who was responsible for the launch of the channel, becomes non-executive chairman. ***** David Kent, formerly European sales and marketing director for Wilson Sporting Goods, has been appointed commercial director of GRANADA Hospitality; he succeeds Tom Sherriff who is leaving to become a consultant.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning the Foreign Exchange Market Committee  held a session chaired by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani.  According to a Central News Unit report at the session a report  was submitted to the president on the latest developments on  Iran's outstanding debts and the successes achieved.    Owing to the country's foreign currency reserves situation  it  was decided that, to fight the corruption perpetrated by foreign  currency dealers and to stabilize the exchange rate, in addition  to providing foreign currency for [the import of] goods which  qualify for official bank rates, the banking system will  provide, at 50 rials below open market rates, all the foreign  currency required by importers who have registered, or will  register, at the Commerce Ministry to import in return for  export. The banking system will also purchase the foreign  currencies earned from exports, if the exporters are willing, at  the same rate. A Central Bank statement will be issued on this  soon.</p>

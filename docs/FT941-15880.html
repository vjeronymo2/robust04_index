			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Beirut share offer 142% subscribed The share offering to found Solidere, the company being created to rebuild central Beirut, was 142 per cent subscribed, the company said yesterday. Tens of thousands of Lebanese and Arab investors bid Dollars 926m (Pounds 621m) for the offering, designed to raise Dollars 650m. Some Dollars 600m was raised from Lebanese citizens, who will be given preference in the final allocation of shares. Until a secondary market in Solidere shares opens (due next month), Lebanese citizens will hold more than 94 per cent of the company's founding equity. Mr Nasser al-Shamaa, general secretary of Solidere's founding board, said the response a 'clear statement of faith by the Lebanese in the future of their country and its capital'. The Solidere launch 'may be the largest public share offering in the Middle East'. The 10-week offer which closed on Monday represented the sale of 35 per cent of Solidere's equity. The remainder, worth around Dollars 1.7bn, were shares distributed to property owners in downtown Beirut in exchange for land rights. The company said tender documents for the first contracts to rebuild Beirut's former banking and commercial centre had largely been prepared; the first bids will be invited within weeks. Solidere plans to redevelop 1.6m square metres of land in central Beirut over the next six years. Its board hopes to have the nucleus of a working commercial centre open within two years. Beirut is enjoying a building boom, but little has been done to tackle the city-centre devastation left by 17 years of civil war. The response from Lebanese investors will be particularly pleasing to Mr Rafik Hariri, the billionaire businessman-turned-prime minister, who designed Solidere expressly to attract private Lebanese capital back into the country. Company officials said they had received about 10,000 applications from Lebanese investors in Beirut on Monday alone, and the response to the Solidere offering is the biggest single injection yet of private capital into Lebanon's rebuilding project. The final allocation of shares is expected to take up to 10 days to complete, with priority going to Lebanese property owners in Beirut, Lebanese nationals, government agencies, Lebanese expatriates and other Arab investors in that order. Some Dollars 276m will therefore be returned to Arab investors, mostly in the Gulf states. Investors in Saudi Arabia subscribed for more than Dollars 200m-worth of shares alone, according to bankers in Riyadh, who said the shares were likely to command a premium over their Dollars 100 issue price when secondary trading begins. Lebanese officials hope the market in Solidere shares will provide the basis for reviving the stock market in Beirut, which closed in 1983 during the civil war. Mr Hariri himself subscribed for Dollars 125m-worth of shares - some 7 per cent of Solidere's overall capital and just below the statutory maximum holding of 10 per cent. He has said he will donate all dividends from the shares to his charitable foundation. However, the offering has met strong opposition from militant Islamic groups in Lebanon. In December, Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah, denounced the Solidere launch as 'religiously forbidden' since property owners in central Beirut had been 'forced' to relinquish their rights to the company. Some landowners in Beirut have also complained that a proposed court to test the legality of Solidere's plans was never actually set up. A committee has been formed to try to amend Solidere's founding regulations.</p>

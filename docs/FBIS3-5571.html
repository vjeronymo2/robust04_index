			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 9 (YONHAP) -- Kim Mun-su, a former  progressive labor activist, stands out as a definite anomaly in  the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), which is still  characterized by many as conservative. Kim, nevertheless, has  recently joined the DLP and was named Tuesday as head of the  party's Puchon-Sosa District chapter in Kyonggi Province,  triggering a dispute among ranking members of the ruling party.    In the past Kim, 43, openly voiced skepticism about a  capitalistic society and pursued socialist revolution, centered  around workers. He was at the forefront of the radical labor  movement and led the leftist struggle against past  administrations headed by retired generals. His membership in  the party, not to speak of his appointment as head of a DLP  local chapter, naturally raised many an eyebrow. Conservative  members of the DLP wonder how Kim will react to proposals on  revising labor laws in the future and what stand he will take on  the controversial National Security Law.    Reaction to Kim's appointment came immediately at Tuesday's  party postholders meeting, where 10 local chapter heads were  named. Rep. Yi Chi-ho of the party's Minjung faction said he did  not understand how the party could accept a man who had served a  two-and-a-half-year prison term for illegal labor activities.    Kim was sentenced to two and a half years in jail for  organizing the Seoul Labor Movement Federation in 1985. It was  the crowning achievement of a long career devoted to struggling  against the government that began in the 1970s.    "If (Kim) could record the anti-establishment struggle as an  achievement, what is going to happen to those who stood on the  side of the establishment?" Yi asked Wednesday.    "If he has changed his political views, the party should  have  clarified them before accepting him into its ranks," Yi said.    Another senior DLP official said, "there are many party  members who are wondering about the true colors of the party."  Still another senior party man asked sarcastically: "Wouldn't  the DLP appear to be a progressive party to the people, while  the Democratic Party has become a conservative party?"    One party member who served as a ranking government official  under President No Tae-u reacted more stoically. "Hasn't a new  political force been forming in the party with new people being  induced from the dissident camp?"    "It is now the time," he went on, "for either those new  members or the party to clarify their ideological views."    The reform advocated by President Kim Yong-sam and  anti-establishment activities pursued by members of the  dissident camp are two different things and should be  distinguished as such, said another party official. "Those  people who welcome President Kim's reform would not necessarily  accept Kim Mun-su," he said. But party leaders belonging to the  Minju, or President Kim's, faction beg to differ. Rep. Kang  Sam-chae said the ruling party should be able to embrace a wide  spectrum of political views, including those in favor of  conservatism as well as progressive forces. "Political  ideologies change with the times," he said. Able politicians  with dissident backgrounds and progressive tendencies could  provide great impetus to the party's efforts to effect reform  and change, Kang said, noting that Kim Mun-su has already  publicly accepted President Kim's spirit of reform.    Other Minju faction members echoed Kang's sentiments. "With  the degeneration of socialism and the end of the Cold War, the  leftist progressive ideology has few followers even in activist  groups," they said. Those who still insist on ideological  confrontation do not even want to join the establishment, they  said.    In any event, the last word, perhaps, belongs to Kim Mun-su  himself. He has said he would actively participate in President  Kim's reform campaign and help carry it out rather than watching  from the outside and only offering criticism.</p>

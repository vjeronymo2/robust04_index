			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Management: Mean bosses, nice bosses, no bosses I'm not sure how best to break the news, so I'd better come out with it straight. The FT Mean Boss Award has been a total flop. Two weeks ago I asked readers to nominate up to three mean bosses. I was looking for leaders of Britain's biggest companies who were tyrannical, bullying and intransigent. I was expecting so many responses that I had considered installing a special fax machine. Sadly, however, I received just one lonely reply that met the criteria laid down. That came in an anonymous brown envelope and nominated Rudolph Agnew, chairman of Lasmo. It cited nine unflattering attributes, some of which are unprintable. I am reluctant to award the title to Agnew, about whom I know nothing that substantiates the claims. In any case he is disqualified for being in the middle of a particularly ugly bid battle. For all I know, the sender is some joker from Enterprise Oil. Having rejected him, and in the absence of any other suitable candidate, I am declaring the competition null and void. But before forgetting this unhappy episode, I want to understand why the result was so disappointing. I can think of three possible explanations. Nobody read the original article. All British bosses are delightful to work for. The bosses are so mean that people do not dare to expose them. The evidence from my in-tray leads me to reject the first two explanations. There was no shortage of mean boss nominations, but nearly all of them run companies too small to qualify. Judging from the letters, these bosses are so horrid as to be barely credible. Here are three particularly mean ones: The boss of an engineering company who apparently sacked one person for taking his jacket off during a meeting, and another for humming. He also shouted at a senior manager for using his private toilet on the company's jet. The chairman of a chemicals group who takes colleagues out to lunch, only to scream at the top of his voice in the middle of a busy restaurant. Apparently this individual likes nightclubs but always leaves his guest to pay, and fills his own cigar case from the box provided for company entertainment. The head of a distribution company who was so incensed by the state of his finance director's private car that he subjected him to a humiliating inspection of his colleagues' cleaner vehicles. Amid so much evidence of mean bosses of medium-sized companies, how is it that there could be none at the top? Are they all rumbled before they reach the first division? I have occasionally heard say that there was a mean streak running through Sir Alastair Morton, Sir Colin Marshall, Sir Peter Levene, Mick Newmarch, Sir Richard Greenbury, Alan Sugar, Sir Allen Sheppard, to name just a very few. It seems I've been misinformed.                           *      *      * Moving on to ultra-nice bosses, I was surprised to learn that Ben &amp; Jerry's, the Boston ice cream maker, is scrapping its relatively egalitarian pay scales in its search for a new CEO. The famous New Age, socially aware company is looking for someone with 'gentleness of spirit', but is having trouble buying that at its cut-price rate. However, to conclude that there is a market rate for every job would be wrong, at least on UK experience. All the studies show a great variance between comparable jobs in comparable companies. I doubt if Sir David Lees, who earns Pounds 330,000 at GKN, wants to move to TI Group just because the top job there commands more than twice as much. As for Ben &amp; Jerry's, it was all very well if Ben Cohen himself had a small salary, because he has a big stake in the business. But for a new CEO to run a thriving company as a wage slave, earning what in the US is peanuts, may be pushing it.                           *      *      * A scurrilous story in the tabloid press linking strippers and call girls to the eminently respectable Confederation of British Industry turns out to be true - well, almost. I've just had lunch with Howard Davies who drew my attention to a News of the World story claiming that the woman who by day organises the vol-au-vents for the VIP guests at the CBI is by night hiring out strippers. The only flaw in the story is that the woman in question is not exactly a 'CBI boss' as stated, but an employee of the contract catering firm used at Centre Point. It says much for Davies that he can see the funny side of a story that claims CBI stands for 'Crumpet, Bonking and Indecency'. Indeed he thinks the story considerably more accurate - and certainly more amusing - than a perfectly credible tale in The Independent newspaper last week. That claimed that the CBI leader was backing Tony Blair for the Labour leadership. Let us hope that Blair is also amused when he finds out that Davies is less worried about the CBI being publicly associated with girls in bondage gear than with a presentable young man who may lead the country one day.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Lending climate tightens banking disciplines - Small businesses The largest European economy was rebuilt from the devastation of the last world war by partnership between banks and small and medium-sized enterprises. Yet whether that outstandingly successful record can succeed is now in doubt as Europe faces up to cyclical and structural challenges. The German Mittelstand remains a thriving, stable layer of enterprises largely funded by long-term and fixed-rate finance. Some is in loans financed by development banks led by the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), the public sector agency which in 1992 lent DM29bn to the sector through banks. This system is admired around the world for the stability it contributes to small business development. But Mr Klaus Juncker, Deutsche Bank's chief operating officer for corporate banking, says it faces a test from recession and industrial restructuring forced by unification. 'Even if there is a turnround in the economy, we will still have structural changes in many industries,' says Mr Juncker. He argues the system will survive if banks stay close to their customers and use networks of industrial relationships to analyse risk properly. Yet the increased risk of financing small and medium-sized businesses in recession has already damaged similar relationships elsewhere. Tensions between banks financing small businesses and enterprises borrowing capital have spread across Europe over the past six months. This matters especially in Europe where small businesses tend to rely more than their US counterparts on loan finance from banks. The failure of thousands of small and medium-sized British enterprises which used short-term debt and overdraft finance for working capital has caused a shock. 'The relationship has been weakened on both sides,' says Mr Stuart White, head of small business at Midland Bank in the UK. And in France, a wave of small business failures led banks and business groups to call for help last year. The government has been forced to take a series of measures to help stimulate lending to small and medium-sized firms, including injecting Ffr300m into a loan guarantee fund called Sofaris. The strain on relations between banks and small and medium-sized enterprises has big implications, both for financing growth and for the banks themselves. Retail banks have become more dependent on small companies for revenue as large companies switch borrowing to capital markets. The main problem in lending to small business is that while the returns are high, so are the risks. German banks which take on the credit risk even of KfW loans do so only after very careful analysis. Mr Gunter Braunig, the KfW's head of branch operations, argues the German system depends on analysis of the company which is borrowing money and on an emphasis on long-term finance. Some 31 per cent of finance for small companies in Germany is in long-term loans, against 11 per cent in the UK. This stability comes at a price. German banks gain a lot of useful knowledge from their holdings of equity and loans in many industrial sectors. The German savings banks, which provide most small business finance, can sustain large branch networks and a strong local presence partly because they face no pressures from shareholders to cut costs. Savings banks protest they might lose touch with customers if privatised, as some German politicians have urged. Yet the pressure both for privatisation and the formation of independently-managed pension funds in Europe could bring disciplines of short-term profitability much more sharply to bear on banks. With fewer staff, they might find it harder to assess well the risks of lending to small firms. The prospect that financing for small firms might then dry up seems remote. In the UK, bank lending to small firms rose sixfold in real terms in the 15 years to 1992. Banks have little choice but to continue to do business with small firms, given the paucity of other forms of corporate lending. But that does not mean that they will have to lend money to all the firms they did in the past. Nor does it mean they will lend on the same terms. Without public subsidies - which French and British banks have been calling for over the past year - banks may be far more selective about making short-term loans at variable rates to companies they cannot fully understand.</p>

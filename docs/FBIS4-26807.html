			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 24 (XINHUA) -- The Japanese  Government is giving a million U.S. dollars worth of urgent aid  to help south China's six provinces suffering from the effects  of flood disasters.    Koichi Matsumoto, charge d'affaires ad interim of the  Japanese Embassy in Beijing, announced his government's decision  to give the emergency aid when he met here today with Long  Yongtu, Chinese assistant minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation.    The aid will include 800,000 U.S. dollars, and 100 small  generators worth 200,000 U.S. dollars.    Matsumoto said that the Japanese Government made the  decision  out of humanitarian considerations, since the scale of the  disaster was very large, and Japan-China ties are very good.    In the past two weeks, rainstorms and floods have hit  southern China's provinces of Guangdong, Hubei, Jiangxi,  Zhejiang and Fujian as well as the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous  Region.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RULE CHANGE WOULD HAVE GIVEN WINS TO 5 PITCHERS  </P> <P> Baseball's decision not to adopt a temporary rule change allowing starting  pitchers to pick up a victory after going just three innings instead of five in  the first two weeks of the season cost several pitchers a victory. But there  will be no asterisks attached to their statistics this year.  </P> <P> The great debate started last month when the official rules-makers briefly  considered a change. Oakland manager Tony La Russa was among those who liked  the idea and its intent to protect pitchers who didn't work much during the  lockout-abbreviated spring training.  </P> <P> The decision not to change the rule cost Frank Tanana, Eric King, Walt Terrell,  Jaime Navarro and Roy Smith one victory each.  </P> <P> "It doesn't bother me," Tanana said. "I'm fine either way."  </P> <P> Even if the rule had been adopted, it would have ended Sunday. It would not  have made much of a difference, either.  </P> <P> In a grand total of five games, a starting pitcher who went fewer than five  innings would have gotten a victory.  </P> <P> On the second day of the season, King pitched four innings and was relieved  with the Chicago White Sox leading Milwaukee 1-0. Chicago wound up winning 5-3,  and the victory went to King's successor, Scott Radinsky, who pitched 1 1/3  innings.  </P> <P> King, still without a decision, is to start Tuesday night at Texas.  </P> <P> "I wasn't really against the rule or for it," King said. "It seemed like that  would be a pretty easy win."  </P> <P> Tanana thought he was headed toward a victory when Detroit took an early 8-2  lead against Boston on April 12. He left after 4 2/3 innings after giving up  three more runs, and reliever Urbano Lugo got credit for the win as the Tigers  held on 11-7.  </P> <P> "I didn't do the job, and that's the way it goes," Tanana said. "I was capable  of going five, and I didn't do it. I didn't get the one key out."  </P> <P> Neither Navarro, Smith nor Terrell has a victory yet. If any of them wind up  with 19 wins, they can blame the three-inning rule for costing them No. 20.  </P> <P> Last Wednesday, Milwaukee gave Navarro a 9-2 lead. But he left after allowing  nine hits in four innings, and Tony Fossas got the victory as the Brewers beat  Texas 11-6.  </P> <P> The same day, Smith lasted 4 2/3 innings and was relieved with Minnesota ahead  of Seattle. The Twins held on, and Terry Leach got the win.  </P> <P> On Friday, Terrell pitched 4 1/3 innings and left with Pittsburgh leading  Chicago. The Pirates won 9-4, and the victory went to Scott Roesler, who  pitched only one inning.  </P></p>

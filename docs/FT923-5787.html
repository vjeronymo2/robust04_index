			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Acorn seeks move to wider market ACORN, the Cambridge-based personal-computer manufacturer which dominates the UK schools market, is seeking to break out of its educational niche with products aimed at the home and professionals. Acorn, in which Olivetti of Italy has a majority stake, has had some difficult years because of the recession and changes in schools' purchasing policies. It hopes customers will be attracted by its ARM microprocessor, a version of which is to be used by Apple Computer of the US in a pocket computer called Newton. Acorn's product list includes a home computer for Pounds 499, a 'home office' system for Pounds 999 plus VAT, and a Pounds 250 electronic notebook which is the first result of Acorn's collaboration with Psion, the UK portable-computer manufacturer. Last year Acorn recovered from a poor first half to record pre-tax profits of Pounds 274,000, against Pounds 1.58m the year before.</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Dull IT tasks shown the door PAYING an outside company to run your computer operations may make it easier to balance the accounts. But many companies worry that this may reduce their ability to react quickly when they need a system which will give the company a competitive edge. To provide the benefits of facilities management without the drawbacks, Gatton Synthesis, of Redhill, Surrey, has introduced a service which takes over the routine tasks of data processing while leaving the IT department to concentrate on the strategic development work. Such mundane jobs include everything from software maintenance, documentation and the running of help desks to applications such as accounts or payroll. Gatton Synthesis believes that Sam (systems application maintenance), as the service is called, can help the customer overcome continuing shortages in skilled software staff, as well as carrying out a less expensive and more cost-accountable support service to the business.

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Hunter Saphir to sell offshoot to Northern for Pounds 7.7m HUNTER SAPHIR, the fresh produce and herbs and spices group, is selling Matthew Walker, its Christmas pudding subsidiary, to Northern Foods, the dairy, convenience foods, meat and grocery group, for Pounds 7.7m. The sale is conditional on shareholders' approval and clearance by the competition authorities. Hunter said the disposal was part of its strategy of concentrating on its core businesses. The cash raised will be used to reduce debt. Walker had been bought in January 1987, and was in Hunter's February 1991 balance sheet at Pounds 3.7m. Northern, which makes own-label Christmas puddings at its Gunstones factory in Sheffield, said that Walker would strengthen its market position. In the 1990-91 year Walker made an operating profit of Pounds 918,000 on sales of Pounds 9.3m. Hunter's shares were unchanged at 48p; Northern's fell 3p to 527p.</p>

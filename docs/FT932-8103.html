			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Observer: Noah let up Many thanks to all those readers who pointed out that there was a happy ending to yesterday's tale about Noah and the two snakes who said they couldn't go forth and multiply because they were adders. Shortly after being let loose in the forest, they found a set of log tables and from that day forward had no difficulty multiplying.</p>

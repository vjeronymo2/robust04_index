			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The latest round of stalled U.N.-mediated Persian Gulf peace talks in Geneva  between Iran and Iraq ended without any progress or a firm date for their  resumption, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar reported. He said  his special representative, Sweden's U.N. ambassador, Jan Eliasson, will be in  touch with both sides in New York to "prepare for a possible meting in June."  The two sides blame each other for the continuing deadlock over the issue of  withdrawing troops to recognized borders. The two sides disagree over where the  border lies. Fighting stopped when a cease-fire went into effect last Aug. 20.  </P></p>

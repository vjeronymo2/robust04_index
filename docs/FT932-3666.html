			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Travel: Let down by tyre trouble THE SPARE tyre, fitted after a puncture just six miles before, went down with a despairing hiss, a sharp stone sticking through its tread. We were 60 miles from the nearest settlement, Khorixas, on the bare ochre slopes of a dried-up river valley in the deserts of Damaraland. I took off the offending wheel, dumped it with the punctured tyre it had already replaced and lowered the rear hub of the Combi on to a large stone. There was no shortage of large stones. Then we sat in the shade to wait. It was my lucky day. Within 20 minutes, a remarkably short time on these infrequently used roads, a couple of fellows drove up with two tyres of their own to be mended. They had left a second, crippled vehicle on the road behind us. Not only were they going into Khorixas and coming back but their estate car was fast, comfortable and air-conditioned. We hurried into the tyre repairers. Fortune was still smiling for there was a bank opposite and I needed more cash to pay for the work. Then it was discovered that one of my punctures could be mended but the other, the spare, had been so shoddily repaired previously that the stone had ruined the tyre. Fortunately, among the nine assorted new tyres on the rack was one that fitted the wheel, but at a cost of Pounds 100 - wine might be cheap here but rubber was certainly expensive. With all four tyres repaired or replaced and inflated, the three of us returned in air-conditioned comfort to the desert and to our respective vehicles. Our new tyre lasted precisely 20 miles before puncturing. Lady luck was in fickle mood. But we limped to the garage in Khorixas once more, just in time to mend our third puncture before it closed. A whole day had gone. But the following morning we were able to swap our Combi for a 4x4 with tougher tyres. And the hire company looked kindly on our contention that the puncture in the spare supplied had been poorly repaired and refunded the money for the new tyre.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (8): More power for the users - Case study: Willis Corroon - Brokers working on renewal business can now quickly extract mainframe information to produce vital statistical data via personal computers INSURANCE broker Willis Corroon has a UK network linking a big IBM mainframe, DEC VAX minicomputers and 1,000 personal computers - but a Pounds 475 software package is proving the key to unlocking the data held in this set-up for business users. Willis Corroon, the world's fourth biggest broker, has settled on Lotus Development's 1-2-3 spreadsheet package as a standard. It is offered to users for their own ad hoc spreadsheet applications and is used by a central computing team to develop major information systems which combine personal computers and the mainframe. 'We see the spreadsheet as a tool which will allow us to exploit transaction information already captured for other purposes,' says information services manager Mr Peter Mellor. 'The personal computers on which 1-2-3 runs are seen not just as PCs but as part of an overall mechanism for delivering information and system solutions to meet business needs: it's important to think in terms of application delivery, not individual items of hardware.' These are fine words but they pose 'quite a challenge,' as Mr Mellor puts it, both for users and for the computing people providing the systems. One major information system now being used live but in prototype form and expected to be snapped up eagerly across broking divisions highlights the challenge. This system uses standard business transaction data stored on the mainframe to produce statistics for brokers working on and negotiating renewal business. 'Previously, we would ask for the information and two days later we would get a rain forest's worth of paper to wade through to find a useful figure every 20 pages or so,' says Mr James Denison, a broker who has been a leading figure in the user team behind this development. 'We now get the information on demand.' The term 'on demand' is relative here. A special program has been written at the mainframe-end to extract the relevant data from the central database and put it in a file which is passed to a personal computer. It takes around 25 minutes to load the data and run the system. This is far better than the previous three days and the system produces information in an immediately useable form - but it is still 25 minutes. A team led by Mr Andy Miles, which develops 1-2-3 and other personal computer applications, is now looking at ways of reducing this time, perhaps by doing preliminary calculations on the mainframe. Even so, the team has rejected the idea of running the mainframe version of 1-2-3, partly because spreadsheet programs can demand a lot of processing resources and slow other jobs down and partly because running a package designed for personal computing on a mainframe cuts its flexibility. 'The mainframe version is 'mainframey' and not so interactive for end-users,' says Mr Miles. At the user-end there are standard 1-2-3 spreadsheet templates for this application, developed and tested by Mr Miles' team with the user group. But users still have - and need  - considerable control, as Mr Denison explains: 'Lloyd's syndicates have three-year accounting periods but each has a different way of handling, for example, the carrying forward of amounts expected for outstanding claims. Our central accounting system, from which the data is drawn, handles this in a single way; I have to translate that into what it should be for each syndicate. I can't expect the central system to know all the syndicates' different methods.' Putting this power in users' hands demands considerable training, compared with that needed for standard transaction processing applications on the mainframe, Mr Miles says. 'We regard it as an obligation to disseminate as many of our professional system development practices as possible, perhaps in a cut-down form, to the business users so that they can use technology in the best ways by themselves,' Mr Miles says. 'In addition, we can help in any way they wish: we can do the complete project or provide consultancy or do quality assurance if users want to do the actual development themselves.' There are several ways in which users and computing people get together for this passing on of professional computing practice and for users to pass back their needs. Each business unit has its own systems manager, either a computing person or a business person with deep computing knowledge and interest. These people meet bi-monthly in user groups in London or at the administrative headquarters in Ipswich, Suffolk, to discuss general topics. There are also information technology steering groups and more technical review groups, all regularly bringing together business and computing people. In addition, the information systems department produces a quarterly newsletter, not a rough sheet but a professionally presented newsletter which comes out on fixed dates. 'The user groups give us direction for doing things and we tell them what we are doing and they disseminate the information back to their business units,' Mr Miles says. 'We research new applications, directed by the business, we support end-user computing and we do bespoke development.' Spreadsheet applications developed by users themselves generally relate to ad hoc statistical reporting. However, Lotus 1-2-3 has also been used by the central team for major system development normally associated with a mainframe computer. A prime example is that of a system to produce credit and debit notes and track their progress through the accounting process. The standard problem of development backlog meant the computing department could not get round to this system and then get it up and running on the mainframe for seven months  -so an interim system was developed in four days using 1-2-3. Peter Mellor insists that the system had to end up on the mainframe, even though it was producing and tracking the credit and debit notes successfully. 'It had to integrate with other things on the mainframe,' he says. 'Yes, it was cheap and quick to develop but if you keep doing things in this way you end up with a mess of lots of little PC additions to mainframe applications and a lot of extra manual effort to ensure the different but related aspects running in different places are kept in line.' Andy Miles says certain applications sit naturally on a personal computer, especially those demanding great flexibility in information analysis. James Denison, as a user, agrees: 'We analyse business by different brokers, for management and this is very complex,' he says. 'It would take a very long time to code this program using a traditional programming language. We did it with Lotus 1-2-3 in 10 days.' Willis Corroon settled on 1-2-3 because 'when we went into PCs it seemed the natural choice,' as Andy Miles puts it. Any personal computer user is allowed to have it. Willis Corroon has 900 Compaq IBM-type personal computers in the UK and 100 Apple Macintosh machines. The Macintosh computers have been used mainly by brokers in London: an extremely successful application here has been the production of presentations for clients and underwriters. Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet package has been the standard on the Macintosh in Willis Corroon so far, but Lotus 1-2-3, launched on that machine late last year, is now expected to take over - 'it's important to have a consistent user-interface across all systems,' Andy Miles says. With Lotus established as that user-interface for information analysis systems, Mr Miles concludes by echoing Peter Mellor's earlier comment: 'Our ultimate aim is to provide access to any information, regardless of where it is stored, so that a user with a PC can see data from a big host computer as if it's just part of a local spreadsheet.'</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Westpac, AMP reshape link Westpac, the large Australian banking group, and Australian Mutual Provident, which owns the Pearl and London Life groups in the UK, yesterday announced significant changes to their troubled 1991 'strategic alliance'. These will in effect return certain distribution and fund management activities to the respective partners. Under the new arrangements, the bank will take full control of Westpac Financial Consultants, formed as a joint venture between the two and which distributed retail life insurance and superannuation products designed by AMP through the Westpac network. WFCL's sales force, which was largely drawn from Westpac ranks, will be 'fully integrated' back into the Westpac network. The partners claimed this would 'streamline operations and improve teamwork'. The bank stressed it would continue to sell AMPAC products, and receive a distribution fee from AMPAC Life. AMP will also resume management of the AMP Approved Deposit Fund. Under the original agreement, Westpac purchased Approved Deposit Fund business, but then provided products to be sold under the AMP name by AMP agents. The new agreement removes the requirement that AMP hold 13-15 per cent of Westpac - although the insurance group said it had no 'present intention' of reducing its stake. This stood at 13.93 per cent at end-November. Mr Philip Twyman, AMP's chief operating officer, said the new arrangement meant that 'AMP will wholly focus on the product and Westpac will wholly focus on the distribution channel'.</p>

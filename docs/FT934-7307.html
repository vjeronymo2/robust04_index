			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Farm trade officials in secret talks: US and EU make fresh attempt to break Uruguay Round logjam TALKS between the European Union and the US on the farm trade controversy secretly restarted yesterday in Brussels as Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, prepared to meet Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, in Washington on Monday to attempt to break the deadlock in the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations. Mr Joe O'Mara, a senior official from the US Agriculture Department, yesterday met Mr Guy Legras, head of the European Commission's agriculture directorate. 'We had a discussion, and it's one of a seris of discussions we've been having, and that will continue' between now and the December 15 deadline set to conclude the Round, Mr O'Mara said. He refused to divulge any details of the talks, which the Commission has not acknowledged as taking place. Mr O'Mara was due to fly back to Washington today. Officials in Brussels believe the two main items discussed were the Blair House agreement the two sides reached 12 months ago, to cut subsidised food exports, and market access for agricultural produce. Blair House is one of the foundations on which success in the Uruguay Round depends. While both sides say they do not want to re-open the hard-won deal, the EU, under French threats to veto an overall trade deal, is seeking 'clarification' or additional concessions. Washington, which believes Brussels got the better of the Blair House compromise, wants additional guarantees on entry to European food markets. Senior officials here believe the most likely 'clarification' Washington would be prepared to concede would be to ease the 'front-loading' of the 21 per cent cuts in subsidised export volume. A joint memorandum worked out by both sides after the Blair House deal was struck envisages that these cuts would take place evenly over the six years of the agreement, with some flexibility to offload cuts from one year if they were 'paid back' the following year. This flexibility might be increased to allow a greater shift towards the end of the six years. By then, if the EU's reform of its Common Agricultural Policy is working, the cuts might not have to be made at all. The CAP reform is intended to rein in overproduction and reduce grain prices to world market level, whereby they could be exported without subsidy and free from Gatt constraints.

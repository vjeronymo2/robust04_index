			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Mixed company news subdues Jakarta - But foreign investors may be tempted into Indonesian shares THE colour of the trading floor of the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSE) is a cool blue, in contrast with the heated faces of the traders. In the visitors' gallery above, anxious investors train binoculars on the boards, one alloted to each of the 148 quoted companies, to watch their share prices go up and down. 'There used to be telephones for people in the gallery to call down to the floor but they've been removed. Occasionally you see pieces of paper pressed against the gallery window with 'SELL' written in large letters,' says one broker. Brokers say that Jakarta's trading floor is similar to that of Singapore's a decade ago and is changing rapidly. Until recently floor traders sat behind large desks in armchairs. Now they are perched behind lecterns with two-way radios and mobile phones. By 1995 the exchange is scheduled to move to a new Dollars 300m computerised complex. The move might be overly ambitious given the recent history of the Jakarta market. Its composite index crashed from a high of 682 in April 1990 to under 225 last October. However, the market has since risen steadily to about 320, closing at 319.70 yesterday, although the hope that it might hit 400 by the year-end now appears optimistic. Equities discounted the result of the June 9 parliamentary election, won by the ruling Golkar party, in advance of polling day. Having momentarily broken 330, the index has slipped back in generally quiet trading averaging about Rp34bn (Dollars 17m) a day. The subdued mood has been compounded by mixed news from the two largest quoted companies. On June 22 Indocement announced acquisitions totalling Dollars 848m from within the Salim Group of which it is itself a part. Whilst its shares have only slipped Rp250 to Rp12,250, the nature of the purchases raised eyebrows amongst brokers and reminded public investors that with most quoted Indonesian companies they are at the mercy of private majority shareholders. Shares in Astra International, which accounts for over 50 per cent of Indonesia's vehicle sales, have fallen back sharply since mid-June, from Rp14,350 to Rp11,300, following the announcement of disappointing first-quarter figures which saw net profits fall by 55 per cent to Rp95.6bn. Brokers are concerned that Astra may not be the only company with poor results and do not expect the half-year results season, due to be released in late-July and August, to boost the index. Lending rates are expected to fall a few points from about 26 per cent at present, but a concomitant drop in deposit rates will be to the detriment of many companies, the profits of which have been boosted by high interest earnings. Whilst economists are optimistic about the long-term growth of the economy, the prospect of presidential elections next March is beginning to unsettle some investors. 'President Suharto is almost certain to win, but it's still a bit of a worry,' says one foreign broker. There have been comparatively few new issues this year, with an estimated Rp400bn raised in the first six months compared to Rp5,000bn in the same period of 1990. As a corollary, however, most new issues have been oversubscribed and have gone to an instant premium: last week Kabel Metal Indonesia, a producer of electrical and telecommunication cable, was listed at Rp3,500 and is now trading above Rp4,000 on the back of foreign interest. The exchange is also finalising plans to permit rights trading, an area where profits - and losses - are quickly made. Prices on the exchange cannot move by less than Rp50, so as one broker explains, 'If the price of a traded right moves up from Rp200 to Rp250, you've made an instant 25 per cent profit'. Where Jakarta may benefit is from investors tiring of other regional markets such as Hong Kong, Bangkok and Manila. Brokers say that one large US bank has gone long on Jakarta and, given the market's illiquidity, any surge in foreign interest is almost certain to send prices rising. Brokers estimate that foreign investors are holding about Dollars 4bn in shares of a listed market capitalisation of about Dollars 12bn. A decree allowing foreigners to hold bank shares is expected to be finalised before the end of the month which, they say, may give the market some impetus.</p>

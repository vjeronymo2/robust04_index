We provided interested individuals and organizations 60 days within which to submit comments on the proposed rules. The comment period closed March 22, 1993. We did not receive any comments on the proposed rules. Therefore, except for a technical correction discussed below and some editorial changes, these final rules are the same as the proposed rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These final rules amend our regulations on the payment of travel expenses of individuals who represent claimants at certain administrative proceedings to implement the amendments to sections 201(j), 1631(h) and 1817(i) of the Act made by section 5106(c) of OBRA 1990. In general, sections 201(j), 1631(h) and 1817(i) of the Act provide authority to reimburse certain persons for certain travel expenses which they incur in connection with the Social Security, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Medicare program under titles II, XVI and XVIII of the Act, respectively. Among other things, these sections of the Act authorize the payment of certain travel expenses to a claimant's representative for travel to attend a reconsideration interview or a proceeding before an administrative law judge (ALJ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 5106(c) of OBRA 1990 amends sections 201(j), 1631(h) and 1817(i) of the Act to limit the amount available for payment under these sections of the Act for travel by a representative to attend an administrative proceeding before an ALJ or other adjudicator. The amendments under section 5106(c) specify that the amount available for such payment shall not exceed the maximum amount allowable under these sections of the Act for a representative's travel originating within the geographic area of the office having jurisdiction over the proceeding. The Conference Committee Report on OBRA 1990 states that under the amendments the reimbursement for travel by a representative ``could not exceed the maximum amount that would be payable for travel to the site of the reconsideration interview or proceeding before an ALJ from a point within the geographical area served by the office having jurisdiction over the interview or proceeding.'' H.R. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 934 (1990). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final regulations amend our regulations relating to the payment of travel expenses of a claimant's representative for travel to attend a disability hearing or hearing before an ALJ under the Social Security or SSI programs to implement the amendments made by section 5106(c) of OBRA 1990. The title II regulations on travel reimbursement, like the rules in subpart J of 20 CFR part 404 generally, are made applicable to certain proceedings under the Medicare program pursuant to 42 CFR 405.701(c). Therefore, the changes to the title II regulations on travel reimbursement also affect reimbursement of travel expenses of a representative in connection with those Medicare proceedings under the Medicare program and, thus, implement the amendment to section 1817(i) of the Act made by section 5106(c) of OBRA 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our existing regulations on the payment of certain travel expenses, &sect;&sect;404.999a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and &sect;&sect;416.1495  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., implement the pertinent provisions of the Act regarding travel reimbursement that were in effect prior to April 1, 1991, the effective date of section 5106(c) of OBRA 1990. With respect to travel expenses incurred prior to that date, we reimbursed a representative for allowable expenses for travel to a disability hearing or ALJ hearing site from the representative's residence or office (depending upon whether the representative's travel originated from his or her residence or from the office) regardless of its geographic location. Based on travel distance between the hearing site and the representative's travel origination point (residence or office) and subject to the limitations in &sect;&sect;404.999c(d) and 416.1498(d), we determined the amount allowable for reimbursement for the ordinary expenses of transportation (&sect;&sect;404.999c(a) and 416.1498(a)) and for unusual travel costs (&sect;&sect;404.999c(b) and 416.1498(b)) pursuant to the applicable rules governing rates and conditions of payment (&sect;&sect;404.999c(c) and 416.1498(c)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Effective with travel expenses incurred by a representative on or after April 1, 1991, however, section 5106(c) of OBRA 1990 provides that the amount of reimbursement for such expenses shall not exceed the allowable amount that we could reimburse the representative for travel originating within the geographic area of the office having jurisdiction over the proceeding. Accordingly, the final regulations amend our regulations to provide that the amount available to reimburse a representative for travel to attend a disability hearing or a hearing before an ALJ shall not exceed the maximum amount allowable for travel to the hearing site from any point within the geographic area of the office having jurisdiction over the hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rules explain that the geographic area of the office having jurisdiction over the hearing means, as appropriate_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _The designated georgraphic service area of the State agency adjudicatory unit having responsibility for providing the disability hearing; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Belt-tightening of EC integration underlies labour unrest: Governments and employers can no longer rely on deficits and devaluation to ride wage rises THE 'hot spring' of continental Europe's labour unrest reaches its climax over the next two days with a half-day general strike in Spain today and widespread disruption expected in Italy tomorrow. Over the past few weeks action, or threatened action, by German workers has stolen most of the headlines but there have also been strike waves in France and the Netherlands. If there is any trend underlying these disputes it is labour disquiet at the belt-tightening consequences of European economic integration. With Europe's main currencies increasingly tied together, the structurally weaker countries with inflationary bargaining systems, especially in southern Europe, can no longer keep their prices competitive with the help of devaluation. Employers in the exporting sectors thus have to tackle excessive wage rises directly. At the same time governments are under increasing pressure to reduce public sector deficits, and thus control public sector pay, if they want to be founding members of European Monetary Union (EMU). In Spain and Italy the link is direct and public. Today's Spanish strikes were triggered by the socialist government's decision to reduce unemployment benefits in the Convergence Plan it has drawn up to enable Spain to join EMU. The other main bone of contention is the government's intention - also in its Convergence Plan - to freeze subsidies to state industries, at current levels which will force many big employers to make redundancies. In Italy, where there will be strikes on the railways and possibly in the engineering sector, the argument is over the reform of the Scala Mobile, which index-linked wages. The unions recognise that formal wage indexation is unrealistic and agreed that the system should go into abeyance at the start of this year. However they believe that one extra month is payable under the old system and are flexing their muscles before talks with Confindustria, the industrialists association, next month. In Germany the public sector pay dispute, resolved earlier this month, was also indirectly about convergence. The German government has to keep a tight rein on public spending to be able to pay for reunification without disrupting the route to EMU. The German unions recognise that and privately even accept that real earnings in west Germany will have to fall over the next few years to allow living standards in east Germany to be raised. However both the public sector workers and I G Metall in the engineering sector believe that the costs of reunification should be shared more fairly and that high earners and business should pay more. This is a political argument. The unions are taking it up because of the weakness of the There is a similar politicisation of the unions in Spain and, to a lesser extent, Italy. In Spain the government is nominally socialist but it is pursuing conservative policies with little effective political opposition. For that reason the two main union confederations - the socialist UGT and the communist CCOO - believe they have a political mission to defend labour. In Spain the unions are far less able to fulfil that role than in Germany or Italy where numerically and institutionally the unions remain much stronger. In Spain and France the unions organise scarcely 10 per cent of their respective workforces. Some progress is being made in Spain and Italy to reduce the political and religious rifts within the union movement but in France the problems seem as bad as ever. In France, the communist CGT is losing its majority on some of the most politically important works councils in France, such as at Renault, and is struggling to keep its power at the RATP Parisian public transport authority. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of Germany's I G Metall, caused dismay among French union officials when he observed recently that the French unions are the weakest and most divided in Europe. As convergence pressures mount in Europe's labour markets the French government may have reason to be thankful.

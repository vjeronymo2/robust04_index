			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 10 June, just hours  before the agreed one-month cease-fire is supposed take effect,  reports the continuation of combat activities in the following  areas:    The Information Service of the 107th Knightly Motorized  Brigade Gradacac reports that "artillery attacks on Gradacac  have continued since yesterday. During the visit by  representatives of the Nordic Battalion, the aggressor fired  more than 30 howitzer shells on the town itself." The shelling  continued overnight at regular intervals and "a true cannonade  started at 0400 this morning. From all directions and all types  of arms, the aggressor has been attacking the lines of our  fighters in Novalici, Vida, the industrial zone, Sibovac, Ukici,  and Mionica. The tanks from Osmanovici, Gornje Krecane, Bucje,  and Huskici are devastating the civilian installations in the  town and the settlements on the outskirts. At the same time,  projectiles from the howitzers of the largest-type calibers are  pounding the town center. The defense positions are being  attacked with mortars and it is estimated that some 800  projectiles have landed on the free Gradacac territory."  However, as the report says, "our fighters will not allow any  surprises. Despite all these attacks, the defense lines are  firm and stable."    "The enemy offensive on the defense lines of the 109th Doboj  and 111th Gracanica Brigades has reached its climax in its ninth  day," Izudin Durakovic says about the situation yesterday,  claiming that "more than 1,000 projectiles from tanks,  howitzers, mortars, recoiless guns, and antiaircraft arms" have  been fired in the process. He reports that Gracanica itself was  shelled in the afternoon, and continues to say that "although  only a few hours are left before the agreed cease-fire is  supposed to take effect, the behavior of Karadzic's criminals  early this morning implies that the Chetniks are continuing with  their old practice of saying one thing at the negotiating table  and doing another on the ground."    Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko that "as the moment when  the agreed cease-fire is supposed to come in effect on the  Bosnia-Herzegovina fronts, the attacks of the Serbian aggressor  on the Brcko battlefield are intensifying. The enemy's  artillery attacks, accompanied by the intensified activities of  the enemy infantry, directed at the positions of Brcko's  defense, have continued in the course of the previous night." As  he says, "the fighters of the 108th Motorized and 108th Infantry  Brigades and the affiliated units of the 2d Corps did not carry  out combat activities last night." Deronjic also notes the  arrival of Serbian reinforcements and the regrouping of Serbian  troops in the area overnight.</p>

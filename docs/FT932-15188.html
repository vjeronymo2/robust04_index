			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Russian and the G7: Yeltsin seeks backing for attack on his foes PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday promised 'more decisive action' against the 'negative activities' of the Russian parliament if he wins the support of the people in this month's referendum. He said he would resign immediately if he were not supported. The president said he had prepared a 'range of urgent measures' to present to the country on April 26, the day after the referendum. Though he did not specify in his meeting with the press what these would be, it was clear from other remarks that ensuring a legal base for individuals to hold private property would be foremost among them. Mr Yeltsin has called for a Yes vote on all four questions in the referendum. These, decided by the Congress of People's Deputies during a bitterly fought session, are on trust in the president; approval of the economic reform; early elections for the presidency and for a new, one-chamber parliament. He said he would define 'losing' as receiving a No vote on trust in himself and on early parliamentary elections through which the Supreme Soviet and Congress - a hangover from Soviet days - would be transformed to a bicameral parliament on the democratic model. Mr Yeltsin has done little campaigning and much of that has been lacklustre. He has no single opponent - but Vice-president Alexander Rutskoi and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, have propelled ever-harsher criticism of him and his government. Asked if he sought the resignation of General Rutskoi - considered a possible presidential contender - Mr Yeltsin said Gen Rutskoi was 'completely opposed to the reforms being introduced by the president'. He asked: 'How can he work in such a situation?'. Mr Yeltsin said he would define early elections as taking place in autumn this year rather than, as had been mooted, in spring 1994. He said a new constitution, guaranteeing all civil rights 'to world standards', was already prepared and would now be sent for discussion to the republics and regions of Russia. The constitution, he said, could then be adopted either by a referendum or a constituent assembly, or by the Council of the Federation itself. Mr Yeltsin, who has increasingly used regional and republican leaders as allies in his struggle with parliament, suggested that the last of these might be the better way and said that the new constitution put the upper house of the two-chamber parliament, the Chamber of the Federation, as the highest legislative body. Later, in talks with leaders of the Russian republics in Moscow, Mr Yeltsin said a new constitution would create a presidential republic and a 'full-blooded federation'. He told the republican heads that the present constitution, a patched version of the old Soviet era document, was an 'explosive mixture'. Mr Yeltsin also said that he would meet other heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States in Minsk tomorrow 'to discuss only one question - the future of the CIS, when integration would begin and which (of the states) would continue in an integrated community'. However, he said Russia would cease to sell energy to former Soviet republics at subsidised prices.</p>

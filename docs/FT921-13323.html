			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Securities house posts record earnings PAINEWEBBER, the US securities house, joined the Wall Street profits bandwagon yesterday when it reported record fourth-quarter net earnings of Dollars 46.9m. The result was a big improvement on the Dollars 92.3m loss incurred at the same stage a year ago, when the firm took a big restructuring charge. In common with other US brokers, PaineWebber has benefited from falling domestic interest rates, buoyant stock and bond markets and heavy demand for equities from individual and institutional investors. The strong final quarter took 1991 after-tax earnings to Dollars 150.7m, the highest in PaineWebber's history and well above the Dollars 38.1m after-charge operating profit earned in 1990. Earnings rose sharply across all leading business divisions in the last quarter. Revenues from commissions were up 27 per cent at Dollars 190m, from principal transactions up 65 per cent at Dollars 171.9m, from investment banking up 88 per cent at Dollars 98.2m - due partly to a big rise in new securities issues - and from asset management up 28 per cent to Dollars 58.5m. PaineWebber's strategy of concentrating on building up its fee-based revenues as a protection against the volatility of earnings from market-related businesses continued to pay off. During 1991 the firm attracted Dollars 1bn of new assets every month from individual investors, and by the end of the year a total of Dollars 93bn in customer assets was under PaineWebber's control. Cost-containment measures contributed to improved profit margins, and the move of the firm's back office operations and its financial management division from Manhattan to New Jersey, which was completed last year, helped to reduce fixed overheads. Overall, in the last quarter operating expenses of Dollars 513.1m were up on a year ago because of a sharp rise in performance-related compensation payouts.</p>

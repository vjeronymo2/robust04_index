			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> REPORT ON RAISING ART FUNDS ACCEPTED  </P> <P> The city's Cultural Affairs Commission, formed in January to help create a  cultural game plan for the city, took the first step Wednesday to spotlight  possible sources of money for an ambitious new art-support program.  </P> <P> The five-member commission agreed to accept a report by Sacramento-based  consultant Bill Moskin outlining a blend of public and private funding sources,  and appointed a task force to investigate how to enact the proposals.  </P> <P> Speaking to the commission, Moskin recommended as a first step an increase in  the city's hotel bed tax. City officials are already discussing an increase of  1.5% that would raise about $230,000 annually for cultural support and another  $460,000 for Chamber of Commerce efforts to promote tourism.  </P> <P> "It is the fastest way, and most visible way, to provide support to artists and  arts organizations," Moskin said.  </P> <P> Under the plan, Irvine would also mandate that 1% to 2% of municipal  construction costs be used for sculptures and other large-scale art projects in  public places. Private builders would earn developer credits for using public  art in their projects or contributing funds to municipal arts facilities or  programs.  </P> <P> A nonprofit support organization to pursue private and corporate funds would  also be formed under the plan.  </P> <P> The proposals were distilled from a number of funding suggestions contained in  a study done for the city last year. Moskin's report was commissioned to "zero  in on a couple of ideas that are not only applicable in Irvine, but acceptable  in Irvine," commission Chairwoman Peggy Mears said.  </P> <P> Mears expects the funding proposals to go before the City Council in July.RICK  VANDERKNYFF  </P></p>

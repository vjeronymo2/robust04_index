			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, The Netherlands (1): Tie-ups go on trial - As they fine-tune their new merged entities, Dutch financial institutions are learning that size, while important, is not everything, even in a small country such as the Netherlands. Fresh challenges are looming THE wave of big mergers that washed over the Dutch banking and insurance world over the past two years has now receded, leaving all the leading institutions with either a new partner or with the conviction that they can go it alone for the moment. Although the frenzied merger activity of the early 1990s is not expected to make an early return, the Dutch financial sector still faces a variety of challenges and changes. First and foremost, the three biggest players - ABN AMRO Bank; Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING Group), the banking-and-insurance group; and Rabobank and its insurance partner Interpolis - must reap the benefits which motivated the mergers in the first place. At the same time, the large financial groups must satisfy themselves and the financial community that they have erected sufficiently high and fortified 'Chinese walls' between their various operations, which range from merchant banking to lending and from stockbroking to insurance. Equally important, domestic banks and insurers will continue to face pressure and competition from foreign institutions attracted to the Netherlands' open market. For the time being, however, no big mergers between the leading domestic institutions are likely. Earlier this year, Mr Wim Duisenberg, president of the Nederlandsche Bank, the Dutch central bank, said 'the pie has been divided' as far as the large financial institutions are concerned, indicating that the central bank would oppose any link-ups between the three biggest players. Already, ABN Amro, ING and Rabobank have 80 per cent of the Dutch banking market between them. There is also another reason why further tie-ups at the very top of the Dutch financial world are unlikely, especially between the biggest existing banks and insurers. Mr Robertus Hazelhoff, chairman of ABN Amro, which was created out of the merger between ABN and Amro, the country's two largest banks, notes that additional large-scale banking-and-insurance mergers are ruled out at present 'for the simple reason that US law does not allow a company to be active in banking and insurance.' ABN Amro has a large presence in the US - principally in the state of Illinois and on Long Island - as do the big Dutch insurers Aegon, Amev (which is now part of Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch banking and insurance company) and Delta Lloyd (whose UK parent company is also active in the US.) For this reason, the merger in early 1991 between Nationale-Nederlanden, the Netherlands' largest insurer, and NMB Postbank, the country's third-biggest bank, to create ING was a good fit: although Nat-Ned has extensive US insurance operations, NMB's US presence is relatively modest. The US Federal Reserve Board has granted the merger partners an exemption until 1995 from US laws limiting combinations of banks and insurers. It is possible that US laws limiting link-ups between banks and insurers will be relaxed in the meantime, and this could lead Dutch banks and insurers to look again at further tie-ups. At home, the mergers have run into no legal trouble, although it is clear that any further concentration by the biggest institutions would cause difficulties. The spate of Dutch 'allfinanz' partnerships was made possible by a January 1990 decision by the finance ministry to repeal a 'gentleman's agreement' barring big cross-shareholdings between the insurance and banking sectors. This, in turn, reflected the blurring of distinctions between financial products and distribution channels at the retail level, as banks and insurers increasingly encroached on each other's territory to compete for the savings of Dutch households. Still, both the central bank and the finance ministry insist that the new financial conglomerates must keep the operational sides of their banking and insurance arms strictly separated, partly because the two industries continue to be supervised by distinct regulatory bodies. Officials are also keen to ensure that proper 'Chinese walls' are erected to keep sensitive information about clients from flowing between the lending, stockbroking, merchant banking and insurance sides of the country's financial institutions. Mr Willem Scherpenhuijsen Rom, chairman of ING, says it is made clear from the outset which 'counter' his group's clients are talking to when they do business with the company. But at the board level, management must have a complete overview of developments in both the insurance and banking arms. Because of their sheer size, ABN Amro and ING in particular often find themselves at the centre of the debate on the power of the Netherlands' financial institutions. As the country's two top private-sector investors, they each hold equity stakes in many Dutch bourse-listed companies of 5 per cent or more, enabling them to take advantage of the 5 per cent threshold for tax exemptions on dividend payments. Other institutional investors, including pension funds, also tend to hold stakes of 5 per cent or more in a number of Dutch companies. But Dutch financial institutions say they have no intention to emulate their German counterparts, which generally own even larger stakes in their country's industrial companies and play a far more active role in policy through their seats in corporate boardrooms. Although the number of mergers among leading Dutch financial institutions has declined since the surge of activity in 1990 and 1991, smaller deals and transactions are still being done, and there is potential for more. In July, for example, Delta Lloyd acquired Bank Cantrade, a small Dutch bank with a balance sheet of Fl 715m, (Dollars 453m) from a unit of Union Bank of Switzerland. Staal Bankiers, part of the Vendex International retail group, is still up for sale, as are small banking institutions affiliated to the Dutch trades union movement. In the medium-sized banking market, speculation on the future of merchant banks Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson and Bank Mees &amp; Hope has been rife since their parent banks merged to form ABN Amro. But ABN Amro has consistently and firmly denied any desire to sell, saying the two banks' activities do not overlap. The sale of either merchant bank to an overseas competitor would step up the pressure of foreign competition on the Netherlands' already open financial market. The coming together of ABN and Amro and their independently-run merchant banks Pierson and Mees into one corporate entity has accelerated the trend of bigger Dutch companies to seek out secondary banking relations with other foreign and domestic institutions. Thus, although the process of concentration has whittled down the number of domestic banks, it has not ended up shutting out foreign rivals. To the embarrassment of Dutch banks, foreign institutions such as Goldman Sachs have managed to carve out a rich niche for themselves by carrying out capital market transactions that domestic banks cannot or will not attempt. When Elsevier wanted to divest its 33 per cent stake in fellow Dutch publisher Wolters Kluwer in mid-1990, it sold its shares to Goldman Sachs which used its placing power to sell the shares, worth more than Fl 700m, to international institutional investors. Dutch banks have so far shied away from leading this type of risky block trading, thereby opening up opportunities for foreign rivals who have also been called in to advise on mergers and acquisitions, including both the ABN Amro and the ING deals. The opening of an Amsterdam office earlier this year by S. G. Warburg indicates that there is still room for foreigners in the Netherlands' consolidated banking market. As they fine-tune their new merged entities, Dutch financial institutions are learning that size, while important, is not everything, not even in a small country like the Netherlands.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Eckart Werthebach, president of the </F> Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution "who heads  the German security services," by Gad Shimron; in Werthebach's  office in Cologne, date not given]    [Excerpt] Shimron: Ever since the fall of the  Berlin Wall and the collapse of the communist regime we have  been hearing more and more about the smuggling of dangerous  materials (nuclear, chemical, and biological) from the east to a  thriving black market here. What are you doing about the matter?    Werthebach: Smuggling of nuclear equipment and  material or other weapons falls within our jurisdiction only  when such activity is organized by a foreign intelligence  service.    Shimron: Such as Iran?    Werthebach: Most of these activities are  perpetrated by organized crime. However, we have evidence that  Iran is very interested in the illegal acquisition of equipment  and weapons of mass destruction and the means to launch them,  and that the Iranian intelligence services are involved in these  activities. They relocated their procurement office from London  to Dusseldorf. I consider curbing these activities originating  in Iran one of the most important missions of the organization I  direct. We set up a special unit to deal solely and exclusively  with the smuggling of weapons and equipment to dangerous  countries.    Shimron: Iran has a big embassy in Bonn and a  large procurement office in Dusseldorf. Is it true that they  oversee all their nonconventional procurement programs from  Germany?    Werthebach: First of all, I would like to say  that I am convinced that the production of nonconventional  weapons (nuclear, biological, and chemical) constitutes the  worst type of terror one can imagine, because it does not just  imperil one person but entire nations. That is why all of us,  all my colleagues in the West, including Israel, are unanimous  in our belief that the matter should be treated with utmost  gravity. There is evidence, including the relocation of the  Iranian procurement office from London to Dusseldorf, that the  Iranians may be using Germany as a business center for all of  Europe. They buy equipment and material not just from Germany,  but also from neighboring countries. However, the entire  business is overseen and administered from Germany. We have  evidence to corroborate this assumption, and for our part, we  have taken all the appropriate measures against this phenomenon.  We treat the matter with utmost seriousness. Speaking from the  point of view of an intelligence service, I can tell you that we  have been doing all we can and we will do all that is necessary,  incidentally, amid coordination with our partners.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 4 Mar (MENA)--Today's Cairo newspapers  continue to comment on the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron,  which killed 90 and wounded 300.    AL-JUMHURIYAH advises the Arab negotiator to rearrange his  cards, priorities, and stances, noting that there is no time for  sorrow or he will lose his mind.    The paper adds that the Palestinian negotiator must benefit  from conditions around him and from the repercussions of events  in the occupied territories, where the Palestinian people are  enduring a great historic ordeal.    The paper writes that the massacre proved to the world that  the Israeli expansionist settlements constitute a security  threat to the Palestinian people, a threat that should be  eliminated. The massacre also showed the world that the  continuing Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories  will mean unceasing massacres day and night, since  confrontations between the Israeli army and the unarmed people  do not stop.    AL-JUMHURIYAH adds that the world has discovered that peace  is indivisible; it either involves all the parties or none. The  world has also discovered that negotiations will remain the only  approach to a balanced peace.    AL-AKHBAR regrets that the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre finds  someone at the UN Security Council to protect the culprits and  try to obstruct any resolution that condemns Israel and demands  serious protection for the Palestinians in the occupied  territories to avoid a recurrence of the barbaric massacre.    The paper is surprised that the world, which condemned the  massacre, is turning a blind eye to the massacres occurring  daily in the West Bank and Gaza for years. It notes that Israel  has given its soldiers the freedom to practice the hobby of  hunting children and women with their automatic rifles. It  wonders about the difference between the Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre and the massacres that have continued since the  intifadah started in the occupied territories. True, the Hebron  massacre was committed by a deranged Israeli officer, as they  say, and finished off by the Israeli army to avert any  Palestinian reaction. But the unceasing daily massacres against  the Palestinian people lead to the same result of shedding and  depleting Arab blood, the paper says.    AL-AKHBAR adds: If the members of the Israeli Government are  truly sincere in their sorrow over the victims of the massacre,  they would have prevented their soldiers from committing daily  massacres in the occupied territories.    AL-AHRAM contends that the limited, cosmetic measures taken  by Israel will not absorb the Arab, Islamic, and world rage over  the horrific massacre that occurred in the Ibrahimi Mosque at  dawn last Friday.    The paper believes that the world needs to know whether  Israel really wants peace with the Arabs and Palestinians or  merely wants to wear the mask of peace and pursue the policy of  hegemony behind it.    AL-AHRAM says the logic of peace is clear and its course is  straightforward. This makes it incumbent on Israel to adopt  actual measures, pledge to disarm settlers, ban the activity of  extremist Jewish organizations, and dismantle the Qiryat Arba'  settlement, from which the Jewish butcher who committed the  Ibrahimi Mosque massacre came, it stresses.    The paper concludes by saying that real peace begins by  truly  believing in a mutual and equal security, not by believing in  one side's security at the expense of the others' lives.</p>

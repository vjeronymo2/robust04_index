			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: A little light on environment law - European Court The European Court last week placed a strict interpretation on the obligations of Community countries under EC environmental rules covering the quality of drinking water. In two cases brought by the Commission against Germany and the UK, for failure to implement and apply the 1980 drinking water directive, the Court agreed with the Commission when condemning Germany and holding the UK in breach of EC environmental rules. The cases give some insight into the way the ECJ approaches EC environmental law which could guide interested parties in other areas of environmental regulations. The Commission made three complaints against the UK. First, the Commission successfully established before the Court that the UK had failed to bring into force binding provisions ensuring complete implementation of the directive. In particular, the UK's Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 1989 did not cover water used in the food production industry and the directive had not yet been implemented formally in Northern Ireland or Scotland until the Water Supply (Water Quality)(Scotland) Regulations 1990. Second, the Court upheld the Commission's claim that water supplied in 28 supply zones in England exceeded the maximum admissible concentration levels for nitrates and, when correctly interpreted, was not covered by unilateral derogations relied on by the UK. The ECJ rejected the UK's arguments that the EC rules did not oblige member countries to ensure that drinking water met the minimum requirements laid down but merely required them to take all practicable steps to comply with the standards. This meant that the UK could not blame the excessive levels of nitrate in drinking water in the East Anglia supply zones in question on the use of fertilisers by farmers, beyond its control. Again, in rejecting the UK's imaginative approach to its obligations and the permissible exceptions under the directive, the ECJ limited the applicable derogations to those expressly provided by the EC rules. Consequently, the Court can be expected in future environmental cases to refuse to make allowances for the activities of third parties or the conditions of the physical environment which may involve extrinsic factors, outside the complete control of a member state. The UK, however, successfully defended itself against the Commission's complaint that lead levels in 17 supply zones serving a population of about 52,000 inhabitants in Scotland exceeded the prescribed lead limits. The UK's arguments illustrate another aspect of the interpretation of EC environmental rules, likely to be relevant in other cases. The rules in question provide maximum lead limits in drinking water, established in accordance with general testing procedures laid down by the directive. Where a house had lead pipes, the rules are more flexible in that they only require action by a member country if a threshold double the general limit is consistently exceeded, on the basis of particular tests. The Court said this resulted from a correct interpretation of the specific notes on the meaning of the technical parameters stipulated in the directive. Consequently, in spite of the generally strict approach to member countries' obligations illustrated by the rules on nitrates, member states may be given greater flexibility by the small print, as in the case of lead standards. In the case against Germany, the Court upheld the Commission on two complaints against the German law implementing the 1980 directive in the context of derogations. First, Germany permitted derogations outside the narrow parameters of the directive; and second, the German Lander had not been obliged by the implementing law to notify the Commission of such derogations permitted by them. Case C-237/90, Commission v Germany, ECJ FC, November 24 1992; Case C-337/89, Commission v UK, ECJ FC, November 25 1992. Other Cases Case C-286/90, Anklagemyndigheden v Poulsen and Diva Navigation Corp, ECJ FC, November 24 1992 - enforcement of EC salmon conservation rules against vessels registered in non-Community state. Case C-376/90, Commission v Belgium, ECJ FC, November 25 1992 - infringement proceedings relating to Directive 80/836/Euratom on protection against radiation - member state permitted to adopt stricter limits than in the directive.

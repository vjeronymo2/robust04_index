			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Top pay rates THE NEWS of a further moderation in the rate of pay increases awarded to - or taken by - the chairmen and other directors of most of Britain's largest companies is welcome, if not surprising in view of the effect which the recession is having on many bonuses. Only a few months ago, after years of mounting controversy over the rate of salary increases, directors of large companies were rightly attacked by the British Institute of Management, among many others, for taking unacceptably big rises. There is some dispute about the average increase in the total remuneration of each company's highest paid director for the most recent financial year. One specialist remuneration consultancy reports it to be around 8 per cent and falling, while a different survey service calculates it to be only 2 per cent. What matters is that shareholders and employees should feel there is more equity between movements in directors' pay and those of the company's staff as a whole. The 'performance pay' of directors also needs to be seen to be moving roughly in line with corporate performance - down as well as up. The fact that this is now happening in more cases does not mean that the problem of excessive pay rises has somehow gone away. Nor does it lessen the need for a much tougher disclosure regime than proposed in the Cadbury Committee's code. The regime should be similar to rules recently proposed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. These would require the remuneration packages of the five highest paid directors to be disclosed, and divided into nine separate components, including stock options. In the UK only a tenth of companies disclose the overall amount paid to directors in bonuses, and just 3 per cent show how these are calculated. The case for official action is obvious.</p>

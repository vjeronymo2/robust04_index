The delegation is one of the three that are scheduled to  visit several post-communist countries this and next week, to  help launch the preparation of individual programs within the  framework of NATO's Partnership for Peace agreement.    Bierring said the principal issue at talks in Lithuania were  consultations on how to prepare a presentation document, which  is the first step toward developing an individual partnership  program with NATO. In Lithuania, the delegation held  consultations with a special working group that was created  immediately after Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas  signed up for the partnership plan at the NATO headquarters in  Brussels last week.    Albinas Januska, deputy minister of foreign affairs and head  of the group, said the presentation document will be ready quite  soon. "It is a matter of several months," he said.    "Lithuania is on the way to active participation" in the  partnership, Hermann Freiherr von Richthofen, German ambassador  to NATO, said, commenting on whether Lithuania is now considered  "an active partnership member." According to the Partnership for  Peace framework document, NATO will consult with any active  participant in the partnership if that partner perceives a  direct threat to its territorial integrity, political  independence or security.    Januska said Lithuania's goal is absolutely clear -  transition from partnership to membership in NATO. Hence, the  Lithuanian version of the presentation document will identify  the steps that should be taken to achieve this goal, including  joint military exercises and changing arms according to NATO  standards, he said.    "It is necessary to direct the money that Lithuania spends  on  defense toward closer cooperation with NATO. Lithuania is not  so rich as to spend money on cheap things," Januska said.    Sarunas Vasiliauskas, Lithuanian deputy minister of foreign  affairs, said Lithuania is prepared to invest in projects that  would meet NATO standards. "A system of air space control would  be an example of this."    Januska said Lithuania intends to ask NATO countries to  donate some of their arms.    But the visiting NATO officials did not mention any  advancement in discussions on possibly donating weapons that  must be destroyed according to international agreements.    Colonel Richard Cohen, branch chief of the NATO Military  Cooperation, Plans and Policy Division, said the United States  and Great Britain earlier cascaded weapons to Turkey, Spain and  Portugal. But the colonel doubted whether there is any suitable  equipment left for the purpose.    Cohen said, however, that the Baltics might get something  through separate agreements with NATO countries.    The NATO delegation leaves for Tallinn Wednesday evening. It  also includes Klaus Steinkopff, special assistant to the Supreme  Allied Command Europe, and John Barret, representative of the  NATO Political Affairs Division.</p>

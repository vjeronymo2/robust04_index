			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Letter: Lloyd's Name says majority accept losses without directing blame Sir, Anyone following the continuing furore at Lloyd's could be forgiven for thinking that the chances of an external Name being fairly treated by his agent are so small as to be non-existent. While there are indeed Names who have suffered appalling treatment, it is just not true that this is now custom and practice. Like most Names, I am facing heavy losses for the 1989 year of account and to a lesser extent for 1990, but this does not mean I have a quarrel with my agent. Quite the opposite, in fact, as in my first year of business, 1988, I made a modest profit when the market as a whole suffered substantial losses. Many of my current losses are due to participation in what has turned out to be a disastrous Gooda Walker syndicate, but I have little cause to complain as this syndicate made a respectable profit the previous year. Further, my agent, himself a member of the syndicate, ensured that my exposure was modest because of the high risks involved. I took a long time to decide to join Lloyds, as I thought it essential to find an agent in whom I had confidence. I also made sure I was in a position to fund at least a couple of years' losses up to the stop loss excess point, just in case the worst happened, which of course it has. I can understand that Names facing bankruptcy feel they have nothing to lose by suing everyone in sight, but the great majority of external Names accept that, as in any business, losses can be made without it being someone else's fault. It is time for those of us with confidence in the future of Lloyd's, and who intend to trade through these difficult times, to stand up and be counted.

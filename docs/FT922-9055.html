			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Mothers who mourn their lost innocents: Argentina's 'disappeared' children PROMPTLY AT 3.30 every Thursday afternoon in Buenos Aires, a group of ageing women don white headscarves and begin walking, as they have every week since 1977, anti-clockwise around the monument to Argentina's independence in the Plaza in front of the Casa Rosada presidential palace. The military regime responsible for the 'disappearance' of up to 30,000 people may have fallen a decade ago, but the women - known around the world as the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo - still gather every week to demand the truth about their sons, daughters or husbands. Thursday April 30 was the 15th anniversary of the foundation of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo. Although the Mothers' courage and determination has made them internationally famous, they still have little to celebrate. They have only been able to account for 9,000 out of 30,000 believed to have been 'disappeared' - that chilling euphemism for execution - under the 1976-83 military regime. The guilty remain unpunished: three army mutinies forced the government to halt prosecutions, so only 39 senior officers were ever brought to justice. Carlos Menem pardoned them all after becoming president in 1989. And perhaps worst of all, the Mothers are becoming irrelevant. They came together by chance in 1977 after a few women had tried to petition the junta for information about the missing. They agreed to meet every week until the disappeared reappeared alive - an act of outstanding courage that cost three Mothers their lives. To circumvent bans on demonstrations, they strolled around the Plaza wearing headscarves embroidered with the names of their missing relatives and the motto 'Truth and Justice'. Even today they have not given up. Hebe de Bonafini, the group's stout and energetic founder who lost two sons and a daughter-in-law, says: 'I do not look for them any more. We are reminding everyone every day of things they want to forget. We are doing this for the young generation, so that these events are never repeated.' But at the Thursday gatherings, most of the people who stop to watch are passers-by or tourists. Only a few are dedicated supporters who walk with them around the independence monument. Fewer still are under 40. The Mothers have blurred into the political landscape. They are usually ignored, except on special occasions - such as last month - or when one of them gets into trouble with the authorities. They hate Menem for freeing the guilty soldiers in the name of national reconciliation. He loathes the Mothers in equal measure, never losing an opportunity to attack them: the government is prosecuting de Bonafini for insulting the presidency by calling Menem 'trash'. The prosecution demands a five month jail sentence. The Mothers are still closely watched by the security services and claim, probably correctly, that their phones are tapped. Their office was burgled four times last year - unusual for a relatively crime-free city like Buenos Aires. Many Argentines agree with Menem, and want to put memories of the 'years of lead' of the 1970s behind them and look instead to the future: the economy is booming, and the government promises that sooner or later Argentina will become a respected member of the first world of rich countries. However, as the Mothers' literature points out, their 15-year battle has conclusively proved the 'hypocrisy of the institutions, the perversion of the system, the prostitution of officials.' Argentina still owes them truth and justice. They will only agree to memorials or reparations when all the 30,000 have been identified or accounted for. That will probably never happen. Yet the Mothers can draw grim satisfaction from the public's reaction to rare appearances by stalwarts of the military regime. de Bonafini says that when Ramon Camps, once the dreaded Buenos Aires police chief, entered a cafe recently, he was refused service and clients began leaving. The Mothers' marginalisation is partly their own fault. They are riven by internal bickering and have split in two factions. One is a moderate, broad-based group. The other is stridently left wing, attacking Menem as much for his conservative economic policies as for having pardoned convicted torturers and murderers. They still remain active in human rights work. Although democracy was restored ten years ago, Argentina's police retain a fearsome reputation. Beatings and torture are common, and summary execution of suspected criminals is on the rise. Now, as in the 1970s, the courts rarely give redress. Perhaps the most remarkable part of their work has been the effort to track down and recover children born in captivity and given to foster parents after their mothers were executed. In a few cases, babies were stolen and their mothers released. Seven infants are known to have been murdered. A sister organisation, the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, is dedicated to finding the grandchildren they have never seen. They have located 50 children, half of whom now live with grandparents or relatives. A further 13 remain with their adoptive families after it was established that the foster parents had acted in good faith and were not involved in the death of the child's parents. Five cases remain in the courts. The Grandmothers have proof that 213 children were kidnapped, which leaves 163 still missing. However, they suspect that far more, probably over 300, were taken. Miraculously, many of those recovered have grown into well-balanced teenagers who have come to terms with their traumatic past. As the Grandmothers themselves say, they are literally working against the clock. They are storing blood samples that can be used to establish the true identities of their missing grandchildren through sophisticated biogenetic testing long after they have died.</p>

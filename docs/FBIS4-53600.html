			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- The Budget Committee of the  House of Councilors began discussions Friday [20 May] on  supplementing the stalled stopgap budget after an agreement was  reached over Diet testimony concerning a dispute involving  Komeito.    The deliberations began after the ruling coalition and  opposition parties agreed to accept Committee Chairman Kichio  Inoue's compromise proposal to the Liberal Democratic Party's  demand to summon a former lawyer for Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist  sect that backs Komeito.    Both sides agreed to Inoue's proposal to start debate on the  stopgap budget and then conclude the issue of Diet testimony by  the time the upper house starts discussions on the full state  budget for the current fiscal year, which began April 1.    The LDP is demanding that Masatomo Yamazaki, a former legal  adviser to the Buddhist sect, testify before the committee over  relations between Komeito and the politically active Buddhist  organization.    The ruling coalition, which includes Komeito, is opposed to  the demand.    In the committee session, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, in  response to questions by an LDP lawmaker on a controversial news  report, denied he brought a letter from Soka Gakkai head Daisaku  Ikeda to the Pope during his recent European tour.    Hata said he believes that Komeito is independent of Soka  Gakkai's religious teachings or activities.    Komeito is a key component of the minority coalition that  backs the Hata administration.    Friday's agreement to discuss supplementation of the  provisional budget came just before the stopgap budget was to  expire Friday.    The Diet has yet to start debate on the full budget for the  current fiscal year due to political turmoil over former Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's shady financial dealings, which  forced him to resign on April 8.    During the agenda-setting meeting for the committee, the LDP  accused the coalition of "abnormal handling" of Diet business  that caused the delay.</p>

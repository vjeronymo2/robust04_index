			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COURT-MARTIAL ACQUITS SKIPPER OF THE KINKAID  </P> <P> Cmdr. John Cochrane, commanding officer of the destroyer Kinkaid, which crashed  into a merchant ship by the Strait of Malacca, was found not guilty of criminal  negligence Wednesday in a court-martial decision.  </P> <P> Cochrane was acquitted because the Navy prosecutor failed to prove "beyond a  reasonable doubt" that the San Diego officer was criminally liable for what  occurred aboard his ship early one morning last November, said Capt. Richard  Reed, a South West Judicial Circuit military judge.  </P> <P> Cochrane was the first Navy skipper to face a court-martial for a collision in  more than a decade. He was charged with dereliction of duty and negligently  endangering his vessel.  </P> <P> "Obviously, I feel a great deal of relief," said Cochrane, 44, a Navy veteran  of nearly 21 years. "I was exonerated, which shows military justice works as it  is supposed to."  </P> <P> The Kinkaid, on the wrong side of one of the world's busiest shipping straits,  crashed into a Panamanian vessel -- killing the Navy navigator, Lt. Sean  McPhee, 24, and injuring 17 sailors. "We never held the captain responsible for  the accident," the navigator's mother, Anne McPhee, said in a telephone  interview from Santa Rosa. "Sean always liked the captain. This was an  accident. Sean could have been killed on the Los Angeles freeway. Things  happen."  </P> <P> Reed, before announcing his verdict, pointed out a distinction between criminal  liability and accountability.  </P> <P> "Since criminal liability, if any, is based on negligence, I have focused my  attention during this trial on whether or not the conduct of this commanding  officer, Cmdr. Cochrane, was reasonable in light of his rank, experience and  customs of the service, safety, and protection of" vessels and crew at sea,  Reed said.  </P> <P> A key issue, Reed said, was what Cochrane knew and what he should have known  about the location and running of his vessel. And Reed concluded that  Cochrane's actions were "reasonable."  </P> <P> After the verdict was announced, a somber yet happy Cochrane turned and  embraced his wife Suzanne, who sat through each day of the court-martial.  </P> <P> "I did feel bitter for a time," said Suzanne, teary-eyed. "But with two words  -- not guilty -- all that disappeared. And now I am overjoyed."  </P> <P> Cochrane said he is uncertain about his future. Repeating that he harbors no  ill feeling toward the Navy for instigating court-martial proceedings against  him, Cochrane said: "I am not bitter. I love the U.S. Navy."  </P> <P> Lt. Tom Courtney, one of Cochrane's attorneys, said the Navy had assigned  accountability to Cochrane for the accident by stripping him of his command  last fall. Had he been found guilty, Cochrane would have faced a maximum  penalty of two years in the brig, dismissal from the Navy, and forfeiture of  all future pay -- including his pension.  </P> <P> In closing arguments Wednesday, the Navy prosecutor and defense attorneys  debated who was ultimately responsible for the crash of the Kinkaid.  </P> <P> Lt. Cmdr. Leroy Dickens, the prosecutor, touted the long-held Navy doctrine  that a captain is accountable for his ship and crew, and said Cochrane's poor  leadership and inadequate training of his crew led to the crash.  </P> <P> During the eight-day proceeding, Dickens called more than 20 witnesses who  testified that the ship's crew members had little idea where they were before  the vessel crashed; some men on watch were ill-qualified; only three of the  ship's 13 binoculars were fully functioning, and the combat information center  had six instead of 12 sailors manning it.  </P> <P> But defense attorneys maintained that a captain must rely on his crew in  running his ship. And, should his men ignore crucial orders, such as informing  the skipper of close-passing ships, then the captain cannot be held criminally  negligent.  </P> <P> Saying that Cochrane did not shirk his responsibility for the Kinkaid, Smith  said the skipper could not be criminally liable for events occurring that he  knew nothing about.  </P> <P> "He trusted his officers to do their duty and to obey his orders," Smith said.  </P> <P> The crash occurred because the duty officer failed to obey orders to contact  the sleeping Cochrane when he sighted lights, became confused about his  location or spotted close-passing ships, Smith said.  </P> <P> The duty officer's failure, however, was compounded by the error of the  navigator, who miscalculated the Kinkaid's position and time that it would  enter the Strait of Malacca, said Smith. The failures of the navigator, whom  Cochrane considered one of his best officers, and the duty officer were  "monumental, unpredictable, and inexplicable," Smith said.  </P> <P> "A commanding officer cannot do everything. He trains. He monitors. He leads,"  Smith said. "Ultimately, he must rely on officers and men to do their jobs."  </P> <P> After more than a week of testimony, much of which painted the Kinkaid and its  crew as a Navy version of Keystone Cops, the decision to acquit Cochrane seemed  to surprise few military experts but shocked many local officers.  </P> <P> "The decision doesn't change the standards of accountability one whit," said  Cmdr. Danny Barrett, a senior prosecutor who observed the proceedings. "In this  case, the facts did not justify criminal liability."  </P> <P> Cochrane testified Tuesday that he suffered a memory loss after the collision  and provided an erroneous account of the accident to an investigating admiral.  Cochrane testified he had forgotten that the ship's navigator had told him they  would reach the strait at 10 a.m. -- not 5 a.m., as he had told investigators.  </P> <P> As a result of this conversation with the navigator, Cochrane said, he had not  ordered the appropriate procedures for entering the straits.  </P> <P> A neuropsychologist -- Lt. Cmdr. David Spaulding -- testified that Cochrane's  memory lapse could be attributed to the post-traumatic stress he had suffered  in the month after the collision.  </P> <P> "I sure as heck wouldn't want to work for him in a pressure or battle  situation," said one senior enlisted man, who asked that his name not be used.  "Post-traumatic stress syndrome? Give me a break. The only thing Cochrane  didn't claim was that he did this to impress Jodi Foster."  </P> <P> Still others, however, said the decision reflected careful, deliberate military  justice.  </P> <P> "It all boils down to whether you believe Cochrane -- and I do," said retired  Adm. Lee Baggett, a former commander-in-chief of the Atlantic Forces and  supreme allied commander of the Atlantic Fleet. Baggett once worked with  Cochrane and testified on his behalf, saying that his actions aboard the  Kinkaid were "reasonable."  </P> <P> "The point here," Baggett said, "is that command responsibility does not  necessarily extend to criminal responsibility."  </P></p>

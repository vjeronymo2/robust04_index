			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAID MUFTI; FORMER JORDANIAN PRIME MINISTER  </P> <P> Said Mufti, about 90, a former Jordanian prime minister who helped lead his  country into becoming an independent kingdom. Mufti was one of Jordan's  best-known citizens during its 68-year history. The nation existed first as an  emirate under British protection and later as an independent monarchy. A strong  nationalist, Mufti balked at a 1928 constitutional agreement with Britain,  arguing that it gave away too much influence on Jordanian affairs to the  British. Under a League of Nations mandate Britain had been responsible for the  old state of Trans-Jordan, which became the independent monarchy of Jordan in  1926. Later, as prime minister from April to December, 1950, Mufti opposed  negotiations with Israel. In a second term, beginning in 1956, he opposed the  Baghdad Pact, a U.S.-supported plan to create a belt of anti-Communist nations  from Turkey to Iran. Mufti had served in Jordanian cabinets from 1929 until the  early 1960s, often as deputy prime minister or interior minister. The state-run  Jordanian television network reported Mufti's death but did not say how old he  was or where he had died. The network did say he died Saturday.  </P></p>

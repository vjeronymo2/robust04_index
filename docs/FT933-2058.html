			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Observer: Ofgas kept guessing Combative gas regulator Sir James McKinnon continues to create plenty of hot air, this time caused by speculation as to the identity of his successor when he bows out at the end of next month. With the Department of Trade and Industry expected finally to make its decision any time now, one relatively unfamiliar name that just keeps cropping up is that of ex-Treasury official Clare Spottiswoode. After leaving the civil service, she sold the enterprise she had started at boarding school - importing silks and cottons from Taiwan - before setting up in business in 1984 with her sister Alison to found software house Spottiswoode &amp; Spottiswoode. That was sold after four years to computer services company Sapphire International, although she continued to run it for a while. Not the most obvious preparation for regulating the gas industry, one may say, but she does have that hands-on business savvy that the DTI has increasingly favoured in top watch-dog posts. More tellingly, she has recently been heard asking some penetrating questions concerning the intricacies of privatised utility regulation - at a pretty high level. If she gets the post, Spottiswoode will be the first woman to head a utility regulator, though not the first to be considered. Penny Boys, deputy director general of Offer, was in the running for Ofgas chief but has just accepted a post back at the DTI as head of personnel. Meanwhile, Sally Hunt, a utilities consultant at Nera, the economic research group, was a candidate to head Oftel - and may, of course, be a challenger for Ofgas too.</p>

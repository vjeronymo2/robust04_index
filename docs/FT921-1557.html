			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / People: Stout returns to academe at LBS After 10 years as head of economics at Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch nappies-to-detergents group, Professor David Stout is returning to academic life as the new director of the Centre for Business Strategy at the London Business School. Stout, now 60, an Australian Rhodes Scholar, was a Fellow of University College, Oxford, for 16 years and economic director of the National Economic Development Office (Nedo) during the 1970s. Like his predecessor, Professor John Kay, who stood down from the post last year, Stout leans more towards industrial economics than what many business executives would understand by strategy. Nevertheless, Stout, who will take up his new post at the start of August, has a clear idea of the direction in which he wants to take the Centre. In what he describes as his 'mission statement', he says he intends to make the Centre 'a workshop on industrial economic success', which will study the impact of public policies on business strategy and competitive performance, and try to establish how success can be spread within and between different sectors of the economy. Stout says the Centre, which is largely funded by the Gatsby Foundation and is one of six research centres at LBS, will tackle economic performance in three ways: first, the dynamics of corporate growth and success; second, the effective design of public policy and its impact on industrial performance; and third, to test the results of these two approaches, it will examine key sectors such as biotechnology and fast moving consumer goods, where he says Britain has latent competitive advantage.</p>

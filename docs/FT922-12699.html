			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / People: Family footsteps lead to Prague Bob Kralovetz, the newly-appointed regional managing partner for central and eastern Europe for Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, is returning to his roots as he takes up his new position in Prague. With 300 staff in offices in Budapest, Moscow, St Petersburg, Warsaw and Prague, and new ones soon to be opened, the firm decided it was time to install a partner permanently in the region to co-ordinate its future growth. Kralovetz comes from Wisconsin, but his family emigrated to the US from Czechoslovakia in the early 19th century. He says that while he considered working from London or Vienna, the need to be close to the new offices, plus the beauty of the city and his family connections steered him to Prague. He estimates the number of professionals under his charge will grow by more than 50 per cent a year during his initial five year term, and hopes that - in spite of high development costs - the firm will be generating profits in the region before he leaves. He says the greatest demand for the firm's services currently comes from its existing global clients which are examining investment opportunities in the area. Andersen is also trying to provide assistance to large indigent companies and small, local entrepreneurs. A new office is likely to be opened in Kiev within three months, and preparations are already in hand for Riga and re-opening operations in Zagreb. Over the next year, Sofia and Bucharest are also on the agenda.</p>

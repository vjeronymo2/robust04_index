			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Caterpillar holds deficit to Dollars 190m CATERPILLAR, the US heavy equipment manufacturer, suffered a 1992 year-end loss of Dollars 190m, or Dollars 1.88 a share. The loss, which excludes the effects of required accounting changes and had been forecast by the company, was largely the result of unprofitable operations in Brazil. In 1991, the company recorded a loss of Dollars 404m, or Dollars 4 a share, after taking Dollars 373m in non-recurring charges. For the fourth quarter, Caterpillar reported a loss of Dollars 28m, or 28 cents, compared with a deficit of Dollars 318m, or Dollars 3.16, a year earlier. The fourth-quarter results exclude special accounting charges, but include a Dollars 56m one-time gain from the sale of assets to its lift-truck joint venture. Sales for the year were Dollars 10bn, virtually unchanged from 1991. Fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 2.6bn, up from Dollars 2.4bn a year ago. The company said that while overall sales values were steady for the year, sales volumes dropped about 4.5 per cent.</p>

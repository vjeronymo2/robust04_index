			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / GKN bid 'threatens Westland strategy' Westland, the helicopter manufacturer, yesterday warned that moves to restructure the company and forge overseas alliances could be undermined if the engineering group GKN succeeded with its hostile bid. Mr Alan Jones, Westland chief executive, said the future of the Yeovil-based manufacturer would not be enhanced either in management techniques or military sales if GKN, which already manufactures armoured vehicles, won full control. The engineering and industrial services group launched a bid for Westland last week after agreeing to lift its 28.3 per cent stake by acquiring 18.7 per cent held by United Technologies, the US parent of Sikorsky helicopters. GKN, which has a 45 per cent stake in Westland on a fully diluted basis, has offered remaining shareholders 290p per ordinary and preferred share, 354.8p for each convertible preferred share and 208.3p for each warrant, all payable in cash with a partial share alternative. It is expected to post its formal offer document in the next few days. Stepping up his opposition to the bid, Mr Jones said: 'Our managers are encouraged to run the company with vision and courage. I'm not sure GKN can continue that.' He is expected to tell Westland shareholders at today's annual general meeting, when he will take over as chairman, that the company is well placed to win new orders in partnership with overseas manufacturers such as McDonnell Douglas of the US and Agusta of Italy. Mr Jones, who met Agusta executives in Italy on Tuesday, said: 'We have a strong relationship and they want to stay with the people they know. We also have a deal running with McDonnell Douglas. GKN would not augment our ability to continue with such collaborators.' The engineering company declined to respond yesterday. Mr Jones, meanwhile, said Westland's two largest institutional shareholders  -M&amp;G and Schroders - have reaffirmed their opposition to GKN's offer. 'They know the real value of the company is much more than 290p (a share). Shareholders should stay on board to get the upside when we turn orders into deliveries.' Westland shares closed unchanged at 333p, a 14.8 per cent premium to the GKN offer.</p>

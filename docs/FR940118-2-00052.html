Baroid Corp., Baroid Drilling Fluids, Inc., DB Stratabit (USA) Inc., and Dresser Industries, Inc.; Proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement</DOCTITLE> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16 (b)&hyph;(h), that a proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States of America  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Baroid Corporation; Baroid Drilling Fluids, Inc.; DB Stratabit (USA) Inc.; and Dresser Industries Inc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Complaint of the United States in this case alleges that the merger of Dresser Industries, Inc. (``Dresser'') and Baroid Corporation (``Baroid'') may substantially lessen competition in the United States in the manufacture and sale of drilling fluids and in the manufacture and sale of diamond drill bits in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act. Both products are used to drill oil and gas wells. Drilling fluids, a mixture of natural and synthetic chemical compounds, are used at petrocarbon drilling sites to improve the function of the drill bit and other drilling tools in the well, including cooling and lubricating the drill bit and controlling downhole pressures. Diamond drill bits cut through rock and other formations during drilling operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dresser, through its 64% partnership interest in M&hyph;I Drilling Fluids Co., and Baroid, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Baroid Drilling Fluids, Inc., are two of the three major U.S. producers of drilling fluids. In addition, Dresser's Security Division and Baroid's wholly-owned subsidiary, DB Stratabit (USA) Inc., manufacture diamond drill bits for sale in the United States. They are two of the five major competitors in the U.S. diamond drill bit market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Final Judgment requires defendants to divest all of their direct and indirect ownership and control of either Dresser's or Baroid's drilling fluid business by June 1, 1994. In addition, Defendants must, by July 1, 1994, divest Baroid's diamond bit business, which includes a manufacturing facility, certain equipment, a nonexclusive license of patents and other intellectual property to manufacture and sell steel-bodied diamond drill bits worldwide, except in the People's Republic of China, and a nonexclusive license to manufacture and sell matrix diamond bits in the United States. If defendants do not complete the respective divestitures by the allotted time, a trustee or trustees will be appointed to conduct either or both of the divestitures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public comment on the proposed Final Judgment is invited within the statutory 60-day comment period. Such comments, and responses thereto, will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and filed with the Court. Comments should be directed to Roger W. Fones, Chief, Transportation, Energy, and Agriculture Section, Antitrust Division, room 9104, Judiciary Center Building, 555 4th Street NW., Washington, DC 20001 (202&hyph;307&hyph;6351). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Joseph H.

			<p>CSO     [Text] The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has announced that the  number of new overseas branches of financial institutions to be  preliminarily approved for the second half of fiscal year 1993  will be a total of six for six financial institutions including  the Sumitomo Trust Bank. The MOF has imposed strict review  criteria and limited the establishment of new overseas branches  in order to give priority to the restructuring of financial  institutions carrying bad loans. It approved new branches in  China and Hong Kong, clearly reflecting a trend to place  importance on Asia where a higher growth rate is expected than  in Europe and the United States.    Banks, as a matter of principle, must obtain preliminary  approval of the MOF when establishing branch offices or banks  overseas. An application covering country, city, and other data  is submitted to the MOF, which then issues a preliminary  approval to be followed by work on the details such as when the  overseas operations will commence. Once preliminary approval is  granted, it takes six months to one year to actually commence  operations.    Recent preliminary approvals covered branches in Shanghai  for  Sumitomo Trust Bank, Hokuriku Bank, Iyo Bank, and Shinwa Bank;  in Dalian for Fukuoka City Bank; and in Hong Kong for Aomori  Bank. Fukuoka City Bank states, "We wish to make Dalian the  center for our operations in China," and will proceed with  detailed planning once a feasibility study is completed. Among  regional banks, the Juroku Bank and Nishi-Nippon Bank already  have branches in Shanghai and the Yamaguchi Bank has a branch in  Dalian. It can be said that the boom in opening banks in China  has spread from city banks to regional banks.    On the other hand, opening of branches in Hong Kong by city  banks, long-term credit banks and trust banks has been completed  and it appears that the future will witness the opening of  branches by regional banks and second regional banks.    Preliminary approvals issued for overseas branches of banks  on a yearly basis included 86 in fiscal year 1989 and 80 in  fiscal year 1990 at high levels, but fell sharply to 28 in  fiscal year 1991 and 31 in fiscal year 1992. In fiscal year  1993, there were 16 approvals in the first half and six in the  second half for a total of 22.    As part of second half fiscal year 1993 applications, some  long-term credit banks and others had asked for approval of  branches in Hanoi, but they have been held in abeyance. The MOF  has assumed a cautious attitude in regard to opening of new  overseas branches and banks have begun to restrain applications  for new branches.</p>

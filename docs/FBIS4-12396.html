			<p>BFN     [Text] David Levi, the chairman of the Jordan Rift Valley  Regional Council, says that according to an updated map he has  seen, the boundaries of the Jericho autonomous enclave will be  larger than what was recently agreed upon with the PLO. The  town's boundaries have been expanded to include an area of  several square kilometers to the south. The perimeters of the  village of al-'Awja' have also been expanded almost up to the  border fence. Levi told our correspondent Gil Litman that  construction work on the Jericho bypass road has not yet begun.</p>

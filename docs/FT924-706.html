			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / GEC Alsthom in HKDollars 20bn power plant equipment deal GEC ALSTHOM, the Anglo- French engineering group, and General Electric of the US yesterday won one of the world's biggest power plant contracts with a deal believed to be worth about HKDollars 20bn (Pounds 1.7bn) to supply equipment for a power station in Hong Kong. A consortium led by GEC Alsthom will supply plant for the 2,400MW first phase of the Black Point combined cycle gas turbine power (CCGT) station. It fought off a challenge from Siemens of Germany to win the deal. Black Point is the world's biggest CCGT station to be announced this year, and vies with a plant planned by Tokyo Electric Power as the world's biggest CCGT station. CCGT uses gas and steam to provide power more efficiently and cleanly than coal-fired stations. The Hong Kong government yesterday gave formal approval for Black Point, which will be Hong Kong's first power station fired by natural gas. Due to start operating in 1996, it will have an eventual capacity of 6,000MW. The deal caps a successful year for both GEC Alsthom and GE following their co-operation on development of the 9FA gas turbine, the world's largest gas turbine. Eight of these, built in France and the US, will be used at Black Point in combination with US-built generators. The contract underlines the growing importance of the Asian market for the main western power equipment producers, and comes as the use of gas for power generation is being questioned in the UK following the row over plans to close 31 coal mines. The consortium signed the deal with Castle Peak Power, which is 60 per cent owned by Exxon Energy and 40 per cent owned by China Light and Power, the monopoly supplier of electricity to Kowloon and the New Territories of Hong Kong. CLP said the project underlined the company's confidence in Hong Kong. China is playing an integral part in the plant, which is to make use of a natural gas field off Hainan Island. The main plant supply contract is being financed through export credits from France, the UK and the US and a commercial loan fully underwritten by a group of international banks. The total financing package, which is expected to exceed Dollars 2bn, was arranged by J. Henry Schroder Wagg and Wardley Capital, with Societe Generale as lead manager for the French export credit.</p>

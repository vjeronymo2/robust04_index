			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Good omens from Poland While western Europe has been holding its breath over the future of the Maastricht treaty, a document based on concepts worked out before the collapse of communism, significant developments have been taking place beyond the eastern borders of Germany. Some are negative or ambivalent. The conflicts in former Yugoslavia have become more intractable. Czechs and Slovaks have pressed ahead with a divorce which will probably leave Slovakia in growing economic and political difficulties. The rise of Slovak nationalism, coupled with re-awakened concern for the fate of ethnic Hungarians in Romania and the border lands of former Yugoslavia, is causing concern in Budapest. Hungary's own progress towards market democracy has been marred by signs of ethnic intolerance. But it is in Poland, the biggest and most populous of the three central European states aiming for full European Community membership by the start of the 21st century, where the last few months have seen the biggest changes. Happily, they have been mostly changes for the good. For much of this year Poland seemed paralysed by political infighting between President Lech Walesa, the government and the fractious parliament. This issued from last October's general elections, fought on a flawed proportional representation system which still needs reform. The main symbol of the government's failure to get to grips with Poland's problems was a soaring budget deficit. Impressive coalition So a degree of scepticism was in order when Mr Walesa asked the previously little known Ms Hanna Suchochka to form a government three months ago. But Ms Suchochka has succeeded in putting together an impressive coalition which contains a former prime minister and several experienced senior cabinet ministers. Ignoring a rash of strikes in the coal and copper mines and the FSM-Fiat car plant, they spent the summer holiday working out their political and economic strategy. It is designed to re-activate the stalled mass privatisation programme, get public spending under control and reassure both Polish and foreign investors and the International Monetary Fund. An IMF team had the first chance to assess the government and its programme earlier this month. It left Warsaw impressed by the performance of the new ministers, encouraged by evidence of an export-led recovery in industrial output and willing to be persuaded that the government was capable of cutting the budget deficit from an expected 8.5 per cent of GNP this year to 5.5 per cent next. Enterprise plan To achieve this the government plans to cut spending on social programmes, mainly pensions and unemployment pay, while raising revenue through reforms to the tax system and better collection, especially from the private sector which now accounts for over half the economy. It will not be easy. The success of the strategy depends heavily on the labour minister, Mr Jacek Kuron. He is the main author of the government's 'enterprise plan' which aims to persuade workers to join in the task of privatising and improving the management of state-owned enterprises rather than strike for wage rises unmatched by higher productivity. Warsaw has been able to achieve export-led growth through a combination of lower real wages and a managed devaluation of the zloty. Consolidating these gains requires labour co-operation, more foreign investment and continuing access to prosperous EC markets. Prospects for the former should improve when Poland and the IMF sign a new loan agreement, possibly next month. But what Poland and the other countries of east and central Europe also need is a reappraisal of the European idea which would allow them to participate in framing an enlarged community. Such a community, in which Germany's size and power would be counter-balanced on the east as well as the west, would not only benefit the east. The participation of enthusiastic Europeans from the east could create a better framework for dealing with the resurgence of nationalist feeling all over Europe.</p>

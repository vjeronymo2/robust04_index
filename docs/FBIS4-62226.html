			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Journalist Andrey Dmitriyev report: "U.S. Publisher Fails </F> To Rescue NOVOYE VREMYA"]    [Text] The contract between the editorial office of NOVOYE  VREMYA weekly and U.S. citizen Charles Bausman has been  canceled. The "NTI" joint-stock company, set up jointly on an  equal footing, will most likely be wound up in the near future.    The editorial office was forced to conclude the contract  with  the U.S. publisher last August as an alternative to the  increasingly complicated relations with the "Novoye Vremya  Publishing House," headed by Sergey Dubov, former staffer on the  magazine and entrepreneur. The magazine's financial position  deteriorated following Dubov's murder this February.    At the same time the editorial office leadership had begun  to  realize that the contract with the American would not bring the  promised prosperity. The contract itself testifies to the  naivete of the journalists who signed it and the U.S.  businessman's romantic aspirations. The $100,000 invested in  the joint business by the magazine and the $50,000 by Mr.  Bausman personally is clearly an inadequate sum to revive the  once-popular magazine, whose print run has fallen to 30,000  copies.    Consequently the U.S. side's expenditure has already  exceeded  the $150,000, most of which went on the purchase of a computer  publishing system, and the magazine is on the brink of  bankruptcy. The contract has been canceled despite the fact that  work on a new model of the magazine has been virtually completed  and talks with a Finnish print shop have been held.    NOVOYE VREMYA, which is in debt to the MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA  print shop and "Rospechat," cannot continue to publish the  weekly's next issues.    The editorial office is counting on getting its affairs in  order by subletting part of the four-story building it rents in  downtown Moscow. An active search for investors has begun in  Russian financial circles.</p>

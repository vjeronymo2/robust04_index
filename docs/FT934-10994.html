			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Rockwell in Chinese car parts agreement ROCKWELL International, the US automotive-to-aerospace multinational, is setting up a joint venture in China to develop and make a range of car body components for the fast-expanding Chinese vehicle industry. The venture, in which Rockwell will have a majority stake, is with Zhenjiang General Equipment Factory, based about 200 miles from Shanghai. It will operate under the name of Rockwell Chassis and Body System Zhenjiang Company. Under the terms of the agreement, Rockwell will supply technology, processing equipment, systems and management expertise - as well as an undisclosed amount of investment capital - for the production of window regulators, door latches, handbrakes and similar products. Rockwell has been active in China since the 1970s. 'The venture reflects Rockwell's overall strategy for investment in China, where there is a huge potential for passenger car growth,' according to Mr Donald Beall, its chairman and chief executive. Rockwell already exports to China heavy-duty axles and brakes and components for off-highway construction equipment, avionics, telecommunications and automation equipment and printing presses. Several of its existing motor industry customers, including Peugeot of France, are either starting up of expanding car production in China.</p>

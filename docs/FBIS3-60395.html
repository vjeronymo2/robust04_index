He said if all Aids patients were to be admitted to  hospitals, then it would mean that patients suffering from  curable diseases would not get hospital beds. He said Aids  patients in the country were 35,000 while HIV positive cases had  reached 800,000.    The Minister, who was moving a motion seeking the  &pound;109,986.945 for the year 1993/94 said if the Government  continued admitting Aids patients in hospitals, then it meant  that those suffering from the common diseases would have to die  in their homes.    Mr Angatia, who is also the Malava MP, said health care  programmes had been introduced and that district health  management boards will now be allowed to use 75 per cent of  money collected in the cost- sharing to purchase medicines.    He said the Government was advising the Nairobi City Council  on step to take to run its clinics on a 24-hour basis, to avoid  congestion at Kenyatta National Hospital.    He disclosed that Pumwani Nyayo Wards will be opened soon  and  that the Infectious Diseases Hospital commonly known as IDH will  be converted into a district hospital.    Seconding the motion, the Minister for Labour, Mr  Philip Masinde, said too much money was being used in  maintaining ambulance vehicles. He cited cases where a battery  could go down in a car leading to its grounding.    He said the cost of medical attention had shot up and that  Kenyans could no longer afford to get sick. He said some  hospitals were demanding as high as Sh16,000 admission fee.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Letter: Why Mulroney's effect on society means he will not be missed Sir, The resignation of Mr Brian Mulroney, the prime minister of Canada, has garnered a fair share of attention. However, I feel the focus of the commentary has failed to highlight the true reason for the demise of Mr Mulroney's leadership career. While it is true to say that his tenure suffered from the blight of economic recession in Canada, other issues are more central to his unpopularity. Mr Mulroney, like many other politicians, failed to heed the history of his nation and the protestations of the citizenry. Mr Mulroney's greatest error was his transgression on the citizens' ideal of the nation of Canada. He fostered and supported policies that attacked the institutions of the national political and social identity. These ranged from simple incidents such as the controversy over the Royal Canadian Mounted Police uniform, to the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords. One must realise that being a Canadian means more than playing hockey and objecting to being called an American. There are intangible aspects that few Canadians can define, but they are all too aware of them when they are vio-lated. A national identity does exist in the hearts and minds of every Canadian, which is built up from the aspects of the Canadian social structure and lifestyle. In the final analysis, Brian Mulroney showed too much petulant disdain for that which the man in the street holds dear, and his fate was predictable. Therein lies the true reason for his fall from grace. Nicholas R M Lowson, Hollyhock Farmhouse, Guildford Road, Cranleigh, Surrey, GU6 8LT</p>

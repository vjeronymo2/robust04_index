			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 28 Jan (DPA) -- Judicial authorities in  the southern Mexican State of Chiapas today authorized the  release on bail of 38 Indians who were arrested under the  charges of belonging to the Zapatist National Liberation Army  (EZLN) guerrilla group.    In confirming the release, the Chiapas government explained  in a communique that the measure has no relation to the Amnesty  Law decreed a few days ago by the state and federal governments,  "which was implemented at a different time and under different  procedures."    The Indians, who were held prisoner at a jail in Cerro  Hueco,  near Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas, faced charges for  criminal association for their alleged links with the armed  rebellion that broke out in the state on 1 January.    During a recent visit to the jail, members of Amnesty  International interviewed approximately 70 prisoners. Most of  them said they were held incommunicado and that they had been  tortured to force them to confess their participation in the  EZLN rebellion. They also claimed that they received no medical  attention.    Several journalists who were allowed to visit the Cerro  Hueco  jail for the first time last Wednesday to interview the presumed  guerrillas said they heard the same testimonies. The detainees  showed reporters the marks left by the blows they received from  the soldiers and said they spent between four and seven days  without receiving any food. They were also blindfolded and had  their hands and feet tied. All of the prisoners who were  interviewed denied belonging to the EZLN.</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STREET SMART: SOME FIND 55 PROJECT ISN'T WORTH THE WAIT  </P> <P> As one of this city's founding fathers and a councilman for 16 years, Robert M.  Wilson is intimately familiar with "the ditch."  </P> <P> Wilson watched with pleasure in the mid-1970s as lumbering bulldozers began  slicing the deep chasm in the earth that would be necessary to allow the Costa  Mesa Freeway to reach the sea.  </P> <P> He grimaced when state money dried up and the earth movers fled, leaving the  ditch to the weeds and the field mice. Wilson was there as frustrated residents  took to derisively calling it "Costa Mesa's Panama Canal," or joking that it  should be filled with water and stocked with fish.  </P> <P> But now Wilson, who retired from the council in 1976, is smiling. Work has  begun anew on the long-awaited extension of California 55 south into the heart  of Costa Mesa. "I think it's great," Wilson said. "We need it badly. It's just  20 years late."  </P> <P> Not everyone, however, is happy.  </P> <P> All the construction work has ushered in monumental traffic jams along the  existing roads perched on the freeway's embankments. The long lines of  grumbling motorists promise to only get longer later this year as the roads,  Newport Boulevard north and south, are temporarily reduced to one lane in each  direction to make room for the project.  </P> <P> Many of the merchants at the freeway's edges are also irked by the work. The  construction has scared off customers, they contend, and the completed freeway  may act only to further divert business away from their doors.  </P> <P> Even when completed, the freeway extension falls more than a mile short of the  original goal envisioned by planners more than three decades ago -- to link the  San Diego Freeway with Coast Highway.  </P> <P> Under the current construction project, the freeway will terminate at 19th  Street, dumping traffic back onto Newport Boulevard in the heart of Costa  Mesa's business district. These days, the money and political willpower to  continue the freeway south to the coast are in short supply, authorities say.  </P> <P> "I don't think I'll see it in my lifetime," Wilson said.  </P> <P> What he will see is a $38-million, two-mile stretch of pavement topped by seven  bridges and featuring four lanes in each direction. Construction began nearly a  year ago, and already three of the bridges on the northern end of the project  are completed and two others are under construction.  </P> <P> Massive storm drains, some of them eight feet in diameter, have been laid along  several stretches, and a mountain of dirt is being removed on the southern end  of the project.  </P> <P> At the northern end, a mountain of recycled concrete and asphalt sits baking in  the sun. There is already a base along the road bed onto which the concrete  roadbed will be poured in the months to come.  </P> <P> Work on the bridges has conspired to tie up traffic on numerous occasions in  recent months. One day last week, a fleet of concrete trucks was lined up,  blocking a lane of traffic at the Del Mar Avenue crossing. Traffic was backed  up for a half mile up the street, as motorists tried to shoot across the  intersection when the signal light flickered green.  </P> <P> Jim Chappelle, an engineer shepherding the project for the state Department of  Transportation, didn't like what he was seeing, but said there was no way  around it. Snarled traffic and headaches for motorists come with the territory.  </P> <P> "You definitely have a gridlock situation here," Chappelle said, gazing toward  the line of cars. "People in Southern California don't have a lot of time to  waste sitting in traffic at a construction project. But they should know that  none of this is being done for the contractor's convenience. It has to be done  this way."  </P> <P> With completion of the northern half of the project early next year, the  traffic situation around the Orange County Fairgrounds and along Newport  Boulevard south to Fairview Road should improve dramatically, Chappelle said.  It's not the same story, however, further to the south.  </P> <P> Along the southern stretch, the company building the project, E.L. Yeager  Construction Co., will, in September or October, begin shaving back the sides  of the ditch in order to erect a lengthy, 30-foot-tall concrete retaining wall.  </P> <P> The effort, which will take at least six months to complete, will entail taking  away two of the three existing lanes on southbound Newport Boulevard. After the  wall is built, the section behind will be back-filled with dirt and then the  two lanes of roadbed robbed from Newport Boulevard will be repoured. The same  thing will be done to northbound Newport Boulevard, probably beginning in the  fall of 1991.  </P> <P> Authorities say the result of such work will be monumental traffic jams along  Newport Boulevard, the key route leading to and from the beaches, restaurants  and night spots of Newport Beach.  </P> <P> "It's going to have a major impact on traffic," Chappelle said. "There's not a  lot of alternative routes, but most people will get used to it and find their  way around the tie-ups. The worst will be the weekends. It's going to be a  mess. No doubt about that."  </P> <P> Several merchants along the route, especially those who depend on drive-by  business, are none too pleased.  </P> <P> Phil Daniels, night manager at Minute King Liquor-Deli on northbound Newport  Boulevard, said the congestion has already cut into business. Many people, he  said, seem too worried about dealing with the traffic to pull off and buy a bag  of chips or six-pack of soda. Even when the freeway is completed, things may  only be worse, he predicted.  </P> <P> "The store has been very slow," Daniels said. "I think it's only going to  continue and probably get worse. The end result, I think, will be things going  down big time. I think we're going to lose just about everything, profit wise."  </P> <P> Just up the street at Rancho Market, store manager Libby Pike said the  congestion has actually seemed to help business there, as "people who have to  wait in traffic come in." But she said the owners worry about what will happen  when the freeway opens.  </P> <P> Lee Heinz, executive director of the Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce, said the  construction work "has in general had an effect on businesses on both sides of  the freeway" but suggested that the "overall effect" of the freeway will be  positive for the community.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa Mayor Peter F. Buffa still hopes that the freeway can be connected  with Coast Highway in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is we're very glad to see it happening," Buffa said. "But it  doesn't mean a great deal until it goes somewhere, and the logical place is the  Pacific Coast Highway."  </P> <P> Prospects for any further work, however, are dim.  </P> <P> The project is not included on the state's long-range budget for transportation  projects. It wasn't even included among the wish list of projects to be  financed under Proposition M, the half-cent sales tax increase for Orange  County highway and transit projects that failed at the polls last year.  </P> <P> "There is a route below 19th Street," Buffa said, "but the bottom line to that  story is that there is no funding. It's just not going to happen in the  foreseeable future."  </P> <P> Dale Ratzlaff, deputy district director for planning at Caltrans in Orange  County, said there is a possibility that the sort of traffic jams that  historically have formed where the Costa Mesa Freeway funnels into Newport  Boulevard may simply be moved further south when the current project is  completed.  </P> <P> COSTA MESA FREEWAY EXTENSION  </P> <P> A. Pavement laid north of Fiarview Rd. and Newport Blvd. junction beginning  October. Section scheduled to open March 1991.  </P> <P> B.

Work should take at least six  months to complete. Same job on northbound Newport scheduled to begin fall  1991.  </P> <P> D. Bridge construction begins summer 1990.

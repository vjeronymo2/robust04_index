			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Blueprints for a recession 'PEOPLE said I wouldn't make a decent living out of doing this.' So far that has proved all too true for Walter Menteth and for many of the others who follow the same career. Menteth is an architect, a one-man band drawing, designing and project-managing small building schemes from a converted artisan's workshop in one of the more tired areas of south London. The image of a self-employed architect might be that of a Jaguar driver with large suburban home and kids in private school. But Menteth last year earned from his practice just Pounds 11,500 after deducting running costs from his fee income of Pounds 29,000. 'In many ways, I've been very lucky. Some architects have been forced to sell their homes in order to generate cash to keep their businesses afloat.' Britain's 32,000 registered architects complain that they are in the lowest paid profession with a mean average salary of Pounds 24,000 a year. The recession has proved particularly unkind to them. Of the 6,500 architectural practices, the Royal Institute of British Architects says more than half are one or two person businesses. This is up by 1,000 from five years ago as practices cut staff and those receiving their P45s set up on their own. 'There is half as much work about now compared with 1989 and much greater fee competition,' says the institute. 'Those architects classed as unemployed or underemployed was 14 per cent in the last study in 1991 but we would be surprised now if it is less than 20 per cent.' As the malaise in building is so pronounced it is surprising that this figure is not higher. Every profession has its fat cats. In architecture big names like Sir Richard Rogers and Sir Norman Foster are not short of a few bob. But for younger architects like 36-year-old Menteth, money does not grow on trees. Having completed his BSc in architecture at Nottingham University, Menteth worked in Belgium and Germany, and, after jobs in a couple of practices in Britain, set up on his own in 1985, first in his flat, then in small studios. He had no capital. Menteth says architects should possess some sensitivity in their make-up. 'You have to have something like that if you are designing for people. Architecture is a humanist, a liberal profession.' Some might say Menteth takes this to extremes which prove to be both a strength and a weakness in running his practice. Much of his efforts are directed towards housing associations and local community projects which held up better than commercial work during the first stage of Britain's construction crash. But he missed out on some of the more lucrative commercial business of the mid-1980s and public sector cash contraints are now crippling community projects. 'In the development boom I felt myself out of kilter. I was not enamoured with it and thought it was structurally wrong. There was a lot of money to be made and opportunities for extending egos. But I didn't see anyone doing buildings that I'd like to see done for people.' Most of Menteth's work involves refurbishment, and he has just completed his first new build project, a small block of flats. His biggest project is a house under construction for a total cost of Pounds 440,000. His smallest was an Pounds 800 contract to build a small set for an exhibition. Architects' fees sound handsome. The national charge scale ranges from 5 per cent to 16.5 per cent of total project costs depending on types and size of the building. But that does not help much if there is a general shortage of projects and when new cost pressures are squeezing small practices. Housing associations, strapped for cash, now tend to ask Menteth to design projects effectively free of charge, payment only made if or when the association has money released to it for the purchase of land on which to build. 'You can spend two years working on a project and then a further one and a half years to get your money. It is pretty diabolical.' Competition is so severe that some architectural practices are waiving fees for feasibility studies. 'There was one case in which one fee tender was Pounds 55,000 while another practice tendered for zero. Small practitioners will never get a look in while this is going on because of their low capitalisation.' The impact of undercapitalisation is exaggerated in architecture. Of the 63 potential projects Menteth has been involved with, only a small proportion have turned into bricks and concrete. The timing of fee invoicing can also suck a potential profit into loss. Fees billed in 1991 were Pounds 25,000, about the same as 1990, but Menteth made a loss because many of these were paid the following year. Company 'outgoings' last year of Pounds 17,500 included Pounds 3,900 for sub-contracting, Pounds 1,000 on insurance, Pounds 2,300 for rent and rates and Pounds 1,000 for stationery. Menteth is the first to concede that administration is not his strong point. He also says he is too honest to take a slice of those deals offered by clients who want the cost of projects artificially inflated so they can apply for fraudulently-boosted local authority and government building grants. 'On the other hand there are other people who think they don't have to pay architects at all.' Menteth is employing a debt recovery agent to obtain Pounds 7,500 he says he is owed by a charity run by solicitors. To keep his head above water, Menteth rents out a property in London and he is sub-contracting himself for the first time to another architectural practice for two months. Menteth struggles sometimes to see the benefits of working the way he does. 'It is difficult to take holidays. There is a lot of weekend and late night working to meet deadlines. I often find it lonely working on my own.' Things might get worse as the government is seeking to deregulate architects and a general trend to take overall contract and design responsibilities away from architects and give it to other types of project managers appears to be taking root. Nevertheless, Menteth hopes he can stay independent, dreading the idea of working for a large practice where, he says, he might have to specialise in lavatory installation or revising other people's drawings. 'It is never easy to put up a good building and it never will be. I get a buzz out of seeing a building I've created or altered.' Walter Menteth Architects, 1a Iliffe Street, London SE17 3QA.

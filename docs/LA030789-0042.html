			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Musically and academically gifted students who've had to choose between a  liberal arts and a conservatory education will now be able to study in both  worlds through a new joint degree program announced by Juilliard School,  Columbia University and Barnard College. The three schools have set up a  cross-registration program that will open individual courses at Juilliard to  qualified students in the other undergraduate schools, and vice versa. The plan  will allow students to earn two degrees -- a bachelor of arts in any major and  a master's degree in music -- in five years rather than six. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

This announcement is related to a statement made last  November by Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel, who said that the  imminent withdrawal of British troops from this state would  probably encourage its Guatemalan neighbors to reclaim this  territory, a former colony of the United Kingdom until 1983.    According to reports received in Mexico, spokesmen for the  Belizean Government assured that the government is planning to  gradually increase its troops in response to the withdrawal of  the British, who defended the country until last 31 December.    The withdrawal of 1,200 men and combat equipment, including  several squadrons of planes of various models, practically  concluded on 1 January 1994.    According to official data, Belize has 1,000 armed men,  while  Guatemala has an army of 30,000 soldiers.    A representative of the Armed Forces said the objective was  to add 1,500 men in 1994 and attract more recruits in the  following years, depending on the state budget, while making  structural changes in the corps.    Diplomatic sources in Belmopan said the internal situation  was calm, even though Guatemala has on previous occasions tried  to annex the territory.    Julio Roberto Herrera, Guatemalan vice consul in the  neighboring Mexican city of Chetumal (southern state of Quintana  Roo), said that from the times of the administration of Jorge  Serrano Elias, his country has ruled out a military intervention  in Belize.    After pointing out that Guatemala has other priorities, the  diplomat said: "We respect the sovereignty of Belize, and even  though we claimed that territory at one time, it doesn't mean we  are planning an invasion."</p>

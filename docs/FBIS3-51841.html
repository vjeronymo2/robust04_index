			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rickey Singh] </F>   [Text] Bridgetown, Barbados, 25 Jan, CANA -- Shrugging  aside the threat of a new opposition alliance, Prime Minister  James Mitchell predicts his new democratic party (NDP) "will win  a third term" in St. Vincent and the Grenadines' February 21  general election. The 62-year-old politician told CANA as he  prepared to present his party's slate of 15 parliamentary  candidates Wednesday night:    "No last-minute strategy of an alliance of convenience by  the  opposition parties can prevent us from securing a third  consecutive mandate from the people of St. Vincent and the  Grenadines".    The NDP's 15 candidates will be introduced during a rally at  Victoria Park that officially launches the NDP's election  campaign.    The newly-created opposition alliance of the St. Vincent  Labour Party (SVLP) and the smaller Movement for National (MNU)  [as received] will present its candidates on February 3, on the  eve of nomination day, February 4. The alliance, announced on  Monday, will be led by former opposition leader and leader of  the SVLP, Vincent Beache. The 62-year-old Beache, a former  long-standing trade and industry minister of previous Labour  Party governments, brushed aside Mitchell's prediction of a  third term, saying:    "Mitchell's contrived confidence is based more on  emotionalism and hope than pragmatism and the realities of  politics in this country today."    Informed political observers, however, say that while the  opposition alliance could "certainly weaken" the governing party  in the election, the NDP would take at least 10 of the 15  parliamentary seats. Reacting to the calculation, Beache,  opposition leader from 1984 to 1989, said: "We will surprise the  cynics, and Mitchell in particular." He declined to say how many  of the nine constituencies he thought the SVLP-MNU alliance  would capture. He was optimistic about MNU leader, Ralph  Gonsalves, a lawyer and political scientist, winning the  North-Central Windward constituency seat, held by NDP's  Johnathan Peters, until recently minister of trade. Peters'  resignation, "for personal reasons," takes effect from  month-end. In the 1989 general election, Beache and Gonsalves  lost to Peters in the fight for the North-Central Windward seat.    For the February 21 poll, Beache will be contesting, for the  first time, the South Windward constituency seat held by  ex-Health Minister Burton Williams, who resigned earlier this  month as a minister in the office of the prime minister,  accusing Mitchell of "being too arrogant and contemptutuous of  the people of St. Vincent and the Grenadines." Mitchell has  dismissed specualation about "serious rifts" in his party  forcing him to call the election.    "The opposition parties are grasping at straws," he said,  "in  seeking to make a lot of politics of the going, for different  and personal reasons, of both Burton and Peters. It is not a  problem for the NDP or me."    The prime minister said his party "will win on performance,  our record of economic and social achievements, the quality of  goverance, our concept of public accountability and, of course,  the confusion among the opposition parties that now have their  so-called 'unity' with three leaders."    Beache, referring to the "three leaders" comment, said the  prime minister was "smarting from the unexpected electoral  alliance. It is not a question of three leaders," he added, "but  one leader of the alliance for the election, with the  understanding should we win, as we expect to, I will be chosen  to head a new government as prime minister while the SVLP and  MNU will move to merge into a single party." Unlike the leader  of the SVLP, lawyer Stanley John, and MNU's leader, Gonsalves,  Beache is the most experienced political figure of the alliance.  He lost his own traditional North Central Windward constituency  in 1989 when Mitchell's NDP captured all 15 constituencies.    With a then 71-percent voter turn-out, the NDP's  unprecedented victory that included the four constituencies  labour had won in 1984, was achieved with some 66 percent of the  valid popular votes. Labour, though failing to win a single  seat, secured approximately 30 percent of the votes.    In contrast to Mitchell's rallying calls for a third term,  based on constant economic growth rate ranging from more than  three to seven percent over the past two terms, the opposition  alliance is charging "deteriorating standards of living under a  government with lopsided development priorities and arrogant  leadership." The government and the opposition alliance are wide  apart on the level of unemployment and the state of social  services, particularly in health. Prime Minister Mitchell, whose  government has consistently been given the "green light" on  fiscal management by both the International Monetary Fund and  the World Bank, has placed the jobless rate at approximately 20  percent. But Beache said unemployment was "now at least 40 and  possibly 45 per cent." He said the government diverted too much  development funding to the Grenadines, Mitchell's constituency.  This, he claimed, was done "at the expense of St. Vincent where  the hospital is without drugs and where the government remains  insensitive to the alarming incidence of drugs-related crimes  and rising cost of living."    Mitchell said his governments had succeeded in keeping  inflation at between 2.1 and 3.1 percent, improved the "general  social and physical infrastructure, and created development  projects in the Grenadines to bring this country more in line  with the realities of international competitiveness in the vital  tourism sector."</p>

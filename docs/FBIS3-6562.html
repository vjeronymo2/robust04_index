			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [From Hardev Kaur]    [Text] Honolulu, Sat.-- Japan and China said the Asia  Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) Finance Ministers meeting should not  be institutionalised, a sentiment which falls in line with the  feeling of their counterpart from ASEAN.    They said there was no requirement whatsoever to  institutionalise the meeting. Their feeling on this was  conveyed to Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister  Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim during their bilateral discussions here  yesterday.    Anwar had meetings with Chinese Finance Minister Liu  Zhongli,  Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and U.S. Treasury  secretary Lloyd Bentsen. Anwar also had an informal meeting  with his Taiwanese counterpart Chen-kuo Lin. They are all here  to attend the APEC Finance Ministers meeting which begins today.    ASEAN Finance Ministers had already met on Thursday where  they reached consensus on the matter.    Thursday's meeting was hosted by Thai Finance Minister Aran  Thammano. The common ASEAN position will be presented to the  APEC Finance Ministers today.    The consensus is that the APEC Finance Ministers meeting  should not be institutionalised and that they can meet and  discuss relevant issues during the meetings such as the  International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and Asian  Development Bank annual meetings.    They also felt that there was no need for a joint statement  at the end of the day-long meeting and that a statement from  Bentsen as chairman of the meeting would suffice.    Anwar told the Malaysian Press after his bilateral meetings  that response to ASEAN's common position from the three  Ministers was "positive".    On his discussion with Bentsen, Anwar said they also touched  on other issues to be raised at today's meeting. Anwar said he  was very pleased that Bentsen had asked Malaysia to take the  lead in discussions on capital flows and capital markets,  including the positive developments and achievements made by  Malaysia thus far.    They discussed the APEC Finance Ministers' meeting and said  that it should remain an informal meeting. If there is a need  for a meeting next year, it could be tied to some meeting that  "we are all already due to attend".    The issue of the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) was also  raised. Anwar told Bentsen that just as Malaysia was supportive  of some of the meetings that had been held within the context of  APEC, an informal caucus within the East Asian context and in  the same spirit were also desirable.    Anwar described Bentsen's response as being positive  following the explanation, adding that "if it can happen in an  informal framework within the APEC context, I see no reason why  it cannot be supported within the EAEC context".    Meanwhile, Anwar said Liu was keen to exchange views on  Malaysia's development experience. Liu suggested that a special  session be held in China to enable an exchange of views with the  Chinese leaders and economic planners in terms of macro planning  and strategies for growth with low inflation when Anwar visits  China.    Other issues raised included the possibility of joint  investments between Chinese companies or subsidiaries of  government controlled companies and some Malaysian private  sector ventures in Malaysia and in China.    The Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) project was  also discussed when Anwar met Fujii. Anwar assured him that the  project would continue as scheduled.    Fujii, on his part, gave an assurance of continued support,  including soft loan for the project and the possibility of  continued assistance in manpower planning and expertise.    He also said experts for some of Malaysia's development and  educational projects and programmes could also be made available  if and when needed.    Asked about increased capital flows and arguments that these  could complicate issues and thus the need for an institution to  regulate these flows, Anwar said he did not think increased  capital flows would complicate matters "but it certainly will  boost economic growth"    It requires effective cooperation with other countries and  authorities. "That is why in principle, we support the need for  an indepth study on issues relating to capital inflows and to  seek ways and means to effectively coordinate or cooperate even  though it is essentially a private sector initiative," he said.    On whether APEC could step in for this purpose, Anwar  pointed  out that "it was never the intention of APEC to be a regulatory  body and each country has its own effective regulatory framework  for coordination with the relevant authorities".</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has authorized opening another two  radio stations, raising to four the total of radio stations  already licensed. They are all based in Maputo. A source from  the Information Ministry told Radio Mozambique that the two last  authorized stations are: RTK [Klint Radio and Television]  belonging to businessman Carlos Klint and Radio Projeccao owned  by businessman Jose Custodio.    Earlier, two other radio stations had been authorized to  operate. One is Radio Miramar which, according to sources  contacted by our correspondent, is thought to be linked to the  Kingdom of God Universal Church. The other station is Radio FM  headed by journalist Suleiman Cabir. The Information Ministry  source added that two other applications may soon be authorized.  One is for Radio Encontro, which will be operated by the  Nampula Archdiocese, and the other is Coop Radio, to be operated  by a firm that will have Coop Imagem and the Golo advertising  company as shareholders. Well known journalists and radio  professionals such as Leite de Vasconcelos, Carlos Silva, and  Antonio Fonseca are linked to this project.    An application to open a radio station by the Machava Sacred  Family Parish in the outskirts of Maputo may also be authorized  soon. Our correspondent reports that a group of youths from  Nampula, headed by Carlitos Jafar has also applied for the  opening of yet another television station.</p>

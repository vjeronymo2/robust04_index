			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Further doubt cast on Russian diamond deal The top official in Russia's diamond industry has again cast doubt on the future agreement with the De Beers diamond monopoly - saying that Russia gets prices up to 35 per cent higher for the 5 per cent of its production it is allowed to sell outside its agreement with De Beers, the south African group that, through its London-based Central Selling Organisation, controls at least 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds. Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, head of the state committee on precious metals and stones, was speaking before the expected resumption of talks with De Beers in the middle of this month. The two sides talked in June, but were unable to settle any of the outstanding issues between them. Exports of rough diamonds - handled by De Beers - brought in Dollars 1.3bn last year, said Mr Bychkov, while exports cut stones yielded Dollars 680m. Nearly all of this production came from the republic of Yakutia, with the Urals, the only other diamond producing region, accounting for no more than 100,000 carats. Mr Bychkov added: 'Talk of the collapse of the Russian gold industry is very much exaggerated', pointing to an increased production estimates for this year of 150 tonnes, compared with 146.8 tonnes last in 1993. Some 30 to 35 per cent of the gold produced in Russia was exported, he said.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  Samper Attacks Pastrana's Economic Proposals </H6>   During an 11 February campaign visit to Manizales, Liberal  Party presidential hopeful Ernesto Samper said he was pleased  that Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana  has formalized his candidacy, but he characterized Pastrana's 10  February speech outlining his campaign platform as "short on  ideas and proposals." According to a 12 February report in EL  ESPECTADOR, Samper said whomever is elected in May will have the  "immense responsibility" of pushing forward the economic reforms  undertaken by "recent Liberal governments," and, more important,  of ensuring that those reforms benefit all Colombians. Samper, a  former Minister of Development, said Colombians have two clear  choices: the "savage capitalism" proposed by Pastrana that would  mean "returning to the past with the model of Reagan and  Thatcher," or Samper's proposal of "social capitalism" with a  "human face."    According to Samper, Pastrana is "keeping strangely silent"  with regard to unemployment and underemployment, which Samper  described as the "most serious" problem affecting Colombians,  especially women and youth. Samper reminded his audience that,  just days earlier, he had presented a "serious and concrete  plan" for creating 1.5 million "new, and better jobs." He also  attacked Pastrana's proposals to address problems in the  agricultural sector, saying Pastrana has in effect told farmers  he will "abandon them to their fate" in the face of unfair  competition from industrialized countries. Samper said he is  offering a comprehensive plan of renewal for that sector, which  could include "granting subsidies such as other countries do."  With regard to social welfare spending, Samper said Pastrana is  offering the "old style of assistance of the past" in contrast  to his own proposal for a "comprehensive and modern social  policy" that will "lift half of the Colombian population out of  poverty," and increase productivity. According to EL ESPECTADOR,  Samper further asserted that Pastrana's platform made no mention  of increasing the availability of housing, in contrast to his  own plan which promises to provide additional housing for  500,000 families.    Pastrana rejected Samper's criticism of his economic  program,  according to a 13 February report in EL ESPECTAD0R, adding that  "one should never give an opinion on something about which one  knows nothing. I don't know if Dr. Samper has taken lessons in  speed reading to be able to read, in a single night, the  270-page program that I am proposing for the country."

Navarro said this would restore the  purchasing power of the minimum wage which, according to  Navarro's estimates, has fallen 7 percent during the Gaviria  Administration alone.    During an 11 February speech in Cucuta, Navarro said  Pastrana's seven-point platform contained "nothing new,"  according to EL TIEMPO, and he described the Conservative Party  candidate as "more Gavirist than Gaviria." At another campaign  rally, Navarro said Pastrana's platform offered no "in-depth"  proposals for addressing the country's "three historic  challenges": an end to violence; treating social justice as a  priority; and renewal of the government, freeing it from  "clientelism and corruption."

ANMUSIC director Leonora  Castano is the second on the Senate list headed by Fernando  Botero Jaramillo.

Samper made the comments in response to a letter from  the two CUT leaders in which they expressed their opposition to  Samper's proposal to privatize Telefonos de Bogota (ETB) in  order to finance construction of a metro system in Bogota. The  labor leaders said such a move would serve to "concentrate  wealth, widen the gap between rich and poor, and threaten the  democratic system," according to the article.    In his response, Samper said that such "blind opposition" to  privatization is "as reproachable" as attempting to use  privatizations as "a panacea to cure all the ills and  deficiencies of the state," the article states. He said further:    "It's time, dear friends, to begin thinking in a different  way. I am convinced of the importance of union representation in  democracies, but the role of unions in a modernization process,  such as Colombia is experiencing, cannot be that of becoming a  permanent obstacle to the processes of change that are  inevitable."    Samper said the role of organized labor, like that of the  business associations, is to be committed to improving the  competitiveness "of our domestic industry in view the common  challenge we face from foreign competition."

Pastrana reportedly said:    "The first thing we have to do is to guarantee life, the  fundamental right of all human beings, because it is logical and  irrefutable that, in order to work, we must be alive," according  to the article.    Recalling the peace and prosperity he had found in the  region  while traveling there several years earlier, he contrasted it  with the present climate of fear, saying people are clamoring  for a return to normalcy in the countryside. (Santa Fe de Bogota  EL ESPECTADOR 21 Feb 94 p 5B)  <H5>  Navarro Questions Samper, Pastrana Job Creation Plans </H5>   Antonio Navarro has questioned the feasibility of proposals  by Ernesto Samper and Andres Pastrana to create 1.5 million or  more new jobs if they are elected, according to EL TIEMPO.  Navarro said studies conducted by economic researcher Eduardo  Sarmiento show that, with the "apertura" [economic  liberalization] program in full swing, it would be impossible to  create that many jobs, according to the article.

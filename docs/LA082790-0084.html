			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> YARD PATROL CHECKS DOGS FOR LICENSES  </P> <P> A man who appears to be lurking near houses and peering over fences in Oxnard  neighborhoods may be a city animal control officer canvassing residential areas  to enforce the dog license laws, Police Lt. George Moore said.  </P> <P> For the first time since Oxnard's dog license enforcement efforts began in  1985, the department is devoting one full-time employee to the program.  </P> <P> "The program was not publicized and people have been asking who is this  individual going door-to-door and introducing himself as an animal control  officer," said Moore, who manages animal control from the Police Department.  "The concern is that . . . he's possibly casing the area for burglaries."  </P> <P> Dressed in a uniform similar to that of the Oxnard police cadets, Animal  Control Officer Joe Soto has been checking dog licenses since July 1. His  mission is to update or issue licenses for all dogs older than four months.  </P> <P> Licenses are $20 for unaltered dogs with proof of shots and $7.50 for altered  dogs with proof of shots. Licenses can be purchased from Soto or at City Hall.  </P> <P> Dog owners have 30 days after they have been contacted to purchase a license or  they will be cited, Moore said.  </P></p>

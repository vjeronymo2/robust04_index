			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: NCR reduces workforce NCR, the computer subsidiary of AT&amp;T, yesterday unveiled details of a redundancy programme to reduce its worldwide workforce by 12 to 15 per cent. The company said it would take unspecified charges to cover the redundancies in the first quarter of next year. NCR said it was offering voluntary severance incentives to US employees who agreed to leave the company by the end of January. Of the approximately 27,000 NCR employees in the US, about 25,000 are eligible for voluntary separation and 5,500 for early retirement. Mr Jerre Stead, NCR chairman and chief executive, said the company recently announced a new, customer-focused business model, which called for fewer layers of management between NCR and its customers.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Banc One to acquire Liberty National BANC ONE, one of the US's most ambitious regional banking groups, has reached agreement to acquire Liberty National Bancorp of Kentucky in an all-stock deal which yesterday was worth Dollars 785m. The takeover, which signals the growing pace of consolidation in the US banking industry, would strengthen Banc One's presence in northern and western Kentucky and southern Indiana. Liberty National has 94 offices and assets of Dollars 4.7bn, compared with Banc One's Dollars 1.7bn of assets in Kentucky. Banc One's shares fell Dollars 1 3/8 on yesterday's news, to Dollars 36 1/8 , amid fears that the deal would dilute its earnings. The shares later recovered to Dollars 36 5/8 . Though its shares have now slid to a low for the year, Banc One remains more highly valued than many other banks, making its shares attractive as a takeover currency. After yesterday's fall, the shares were trading at 1.93 times the bank's book value, compared with an industry average of 1.53, said Diane Glossman, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. Banc One claims a dominant market share in Lexington, the Kentucky state capital. Liberty National claims a 40 per cent market share in Louisville, on the border with Indiana. 'Combined, these two affiliates will become the largest banking company in Kentucky and will be the only one serving all the major markets,' said Mr John McCoy, Banc One chairman and chief executive. Shareholders in Liberty National will receive 0.8421 of a share in Banc One for each share held. If the Banc One share price rises above Dollars 41.57 during a set period, they will receive stock worth Dollars 35. Liberty National's stock yesterday rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 29 3/8.</p>

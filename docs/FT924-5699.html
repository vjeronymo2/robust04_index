			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Westinghouse bites the bullet - Problems at the Pittsburgh-based conglomerate A DRASTIC restructuring announced this week by Westinghouse Electric has softened, but far from eliminated, a chorus of criticism over the running of this fallen giant of US industry. Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse, a 106-year-old conglomerate with interests ranging from electrical power generating equipment to radio and television stations, has been dogged for the past two years by severe problems in its financial services arm, mainly the result of poor real estate investments. On Monday, facing growing pressure from institutional shareholders and mounting concern about its finances on Wall Street, it finally bit the bullet and announced plans to get out of financial services, cut its dividend, take a Dollars 1.13bn after-tax charge and sell off several other businesses to bolster its balance sheet. The action, insisted Mr Paul Lego, chairman, would allow Westinghouse to 'put our financial services problems behind us'. That may prove so, yet Mr Lego still faces the problem of a lacklustre economic environment and criticism from shareholder groups over management's style and strategies. Indeed, this week's action was prompted in part by the targetting of Westinghouse by the US corporate governance movement - activist institutional investors which want a greater say in the running of poorly performing companies. While the restructuring will be welcomed by these groups, it seems unlikely to stop them pressing their much wider reform agenda. Ms Nell Minow, of Lens Inc, a small investment group which also includes Mr Robert Monks, a leading corporate governance activist, describes Westinghouse's action as a 'real positive step forward', but probably not enough to make shareholders withdraw their resolutions. Westinghouse's problems go back to the 1980s when the company, fearing hostile takeovers, pushed for short-term profits. It sold off dozens of subsidiaries (some to purchasers who crowed about turning the businesses around) and let slide its research, development and capital spending. The result was strong earnings growth through much of the decade, with a key role played by its fast-growing financial services operation, which invested heavily in property and leveraged buy-outs. But, in 1990, the financial services bubble burst as US property prices collapsed and many of Westinghouse's investments were exposed as highly speculative. Over the past two years the company had already taken some Dollars 2.8bn of write-offs in its financial services arm, and the Westinghouse strategy was to run the property portfolio down over five years. But Wall Street concern over its property exposure prompted a crisis of financial confidence. Credit rating agencies kept down-grading its debt, which shut it out of the commercial paper market and made it dependent on a depleting line of bank credit. No longer could Mr Lego tough it out. The result will be a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge of Dollars 2.65bn for losses in financial services and the cost of running the division until its assets can be sold off. Westinghouse will partly offset this through the sale, for an expected Dollars 800m, of four businesses: Westinghouse Electric Supply, which distributes electrical products; Westinghouse Communities, a property developer; Knoll International, which makes office furniture; and its distribution and control business, a supplier to the construction industry. Westinghouse's size will be cut by about one-third, with revenues dropping from Dollars 12.8bn last year to about Dollars 8.4bn. Mr Lego says the company will focus on five businesses: electronic control systems; environmental systems; electrical generating equipment; cooling equipment for trucks; and broadcasting. However, Wall Street analysts and dissident shareholders say this leaves three large question marks over the future of the company: How good is management? Mr Lego been much criticised by some shareholders for an isolated management style and being too fond of blaming economic circumstances for the company's problems. But Ms Minow says: 'Inside Westinghouse I think there is a company Mr Lego can do a superb job with.' Mr Lego has now created an eight-man management committee and a four-member president's office. But critics say there is no fresh blood. Does the shake-up go far enough ? With many Westinghouse businesses in sectors which move with the economy, analysts say more fat must go. How should it improve its corporate governance? Some institutions have been gunning for Westinghouse since the company pushed through fat executive pay increases at the start of 1991, just before a huge property related write-off. Proposals for next year's annual meeting include ending the company's anti-takeover poison pill, tying compensation more to performance, and splitting the job of chief executive and chairman. It has not been lost on shareholders that the board is advised by Mr Ira Millstein, a New York attorney who advised the General Motors board last April, when it staged a coup. But for now there are no signs of such drastic action in Pittsburgh.</p>

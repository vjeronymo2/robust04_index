			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour seeks to rally Tory rebels on social chapter A NEW alliance has been forged between Labour and Tory Euro-sceptics, aimed at forcing Mr John Major to choose between accepting the social chapter or being unable to ratify the Maastricht treaty. Labour's draft proposal for the Commons debate on the social chapter - which must take place before ratification - has been framed to maximise the prospect of a coalition of all the opposition parties and Conservative rebels which could defeat the govern-ment. Labour has been keeping in informal touch with Conservative Euro-sceptics, who met on Tuesday night to discuss tactics. The party is considering adding to the pressure on Mr Major by putting up Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, to open the set-piece debate, which is expected on 26 July. The need for a further vote on the social chapter was inserted into the legislation to ratify the Maastricht agreement by the same combination of opposition MPs and Tory rebels. Labour's amendment for the debate is critical because MPs will vote on it before the government motion. It would instruct the government not to ratify the treaty unless it had previously said it would sign up to the social agreement which applies only to the other 11 European Community member states. This is intended to attract both those in favour of the social chapter - on the basis that the government would sign rather than block the treaty altogether - and those who believe that the prime minister has tied himself so strongly to Britain's opt-out that he would stymie the agreement rather than surrender it. Some Euro-sceptics believe that faced with that unenviable choice, Mr Major might opt for a referendum on whether the UK should accept the treaty as he negotiated it - the course which many Tory rebels prefer. With the government's overall Commons majority standing at only 18, just a few rebels would put the result in doubt. One estimate within government is that there are about six Tories who would vote with the opposition, and at least the same number who would abstain. Mr John Major is expected to discuss tactics for the debate with government business managers on Monday.</p>

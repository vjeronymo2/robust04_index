			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCNEIL PLAYS OLD ROLE AS JETS DEFEAT BROWNS  </P> <P> Just two weeks ago, the New York Jets waived Freeman McNeil, the team's  all-time leading rusher with 7,146 yards.  </P> <P> When the former UCLA standout went unclaimed by another team, the Jets brought  McNeil back for his 10th season.  </P> <P> The move paid off Sunday against the Cleveland Browns as McNeil rushed for 62  yards and caught three passes for 80 yards as the Jets beat the Browns, 24-21,  to give Bruce Coslet his first victory as the team's coach.  </P> <P> "Freeman's too old," Coslet said with a big smile creasing his face after his  successful home debut. "He can't do it anymore. You saw that."  </P> <P> McNeil has been a starter in both of the Jets' games this season because Blair  Thomas -- the Jets' No. 1 draft pick -- has been slowed by a hamstring injury,  and Johnny Hector is just approaching peak shape after arthroscopic knee  surgery.  </P> <P> McNeil and quarterback Ken O'Brien connected on a 59-yard pass play in the  first quarter that was the longest of McNeil's career. He ran all the way to  the one and Brad Baxter got the touchdown two plays later.  </P> <P> The Jets' defense was stingy in the first half and pressured Bernie Kosar  throughout the game. Cleveland, which had only 80 yards rushing last week, was  limited to 44 against the Jets.  </P> <P> Kosar completed 24 of 41 passes for 233 yards. O'Brien completed 13 of 21  passes for 218 yards.  </P> <P> The Browns (1-1) got off to a fast start when Eric Metcalf returned the opening  kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> But the Jets (1-1) came right back with a 68-yard, four-play drive highlighted  by Thomas' 55-yard run with a screen pass that set up McNeil's two-yard scoring  run.  </P> <P> New York went ahead, 14-7, with a 90-yard drive that took just six plays.  </P> <P> Again, Thomas was a key figure with a 25-yard run. On the next play, Anthony  Blaylock was called for pass interference at the Cleveland 27.  </P> <P> Four plays later, Hector scored from the six.  </P> <P> Pat Leahy added a 47-yard field goal after the Jets recovered a Metcalf fumble,  giving the Jets a 17-7 lead.  </P> <P> "I was very surprised at how they came back after Eric's touchdown," Browns  Coach Bud Carson said.  </P></p>

According to Yang Wenhe, deputy-director of the State Bureau  of Oceanography, the Chinese Government has accepted the terms  of three international resolutions concerning disposal at sea of  radioactive wastes and other radioactive matter and the phasing  out of sea disposal of industrial waste and incineration at sea.    The resolutions were approved by member nations of the  convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping  wastes and other matter in London last November and will take  effect on February 20, 1994.    "The approval and implementation of the three resolutions  means a stricter global control of dumping of wastes at sea,"  Yang told XINHUA.    "China will strictly comply with the resolutions and  implement them in letter and spirit," he said.    "China will ban the dumping of waste matters which do not  conform to the standards set by the resolutions," he added.  "disposing of wastes without license or dumping irresponsibly at  sea will be punished severely according to law."    With special permission, disposal of low-level radioactive  waste at sea is allowed, according to China's present "rules of  controlling dumping at sea." Controlled low-level toxic or  non-toxic industrial waste is also allowed to be dumped at sea  with permission. But incineration at sea has never taken place  in China.    "China will make necessary revisions of the rules and  regulations concerned," Yang said.    According to the Chinese official, the dumping of wastes at  sea has been under strict management and control in China,  according to a system which includes application, examination,  approval and issuing of permits.    The State Council has approved 38 dumping regions in China's  sea waters. The major dumping material has been castoff from  dredging, according to Yang.    "In recent years, no pollution accidents caused by dumping  of  waste in Chinese seas have occurred. Close monitoring also  indicates that the water quality around the dumping regions  remains fine," he said.</p>

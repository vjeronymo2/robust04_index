			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A war of words has developed between right-wingers  opposed to, and those in favor of, participation in the  election. The general secretary of the Conservative Party [CP],  Dr. Lem Theron, has accused the MP for Schweizer-Reneke, Dr.  Pieter Mulder, of seeking cheap publicity for the Freedom Front.  He said those in favor of participation in the election had  chosen a soft option and had entered the election in the hope of  personal financial gain in what he called a communistic system  of government. Earlier, the Freedom Front accused the CP of  unilateral action, saying that certain individuals in the party  had apparently found it necessary to put pressure on Dr. Ferdie  Hartzenberg. According to reports up to 10 CP parliamentarians  could be standing in the election for the Freedom Front.</p>

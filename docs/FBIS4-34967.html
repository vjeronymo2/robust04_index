			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, the Paraguayan, Bolivian, and Uruguayan  foreign ministers relaunched Urupabol [Permanent Joint  Commission of Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia] -- 12 years after  it disappeared -- as a way to strengthen the physical  integration of the three countries.    After two days of meetings, at 1230 yesterday, Paraguayan  Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner, Bolivian Foreign  Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga, and Uruguayan Foreign  Minister Sergio Abreu Bonilla signed a joint declaration at the  Foreign Ministry in Asuncion.    The ministers asked that the Agreement for River  Transportation through the Paraguay-Parana Waterway be ratified  by all member countries as a way to strengthen physical  integration. Argentina and Brazil have yet to ratify the  document. Paraguay, Bolivia, and Uruguay have already ratified  it.    In the joint declaration, the foreign ministers express the  need for a more significant participation of companies from the  three Urupabol member countries in the implementation of the  various Paraguay-Parana Waterway projects. The ministers agree  that NAFTA is an important step forward for the creation of a  broadened economic space in the hemisphere.    Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu Bonilla stressed  that  the relaunching of Urupabol -- which disappeared in 1982 -- does  not seek to upset the influence of Argentina and Brazil, the two  powerful Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member countries.  The idea is to complement and compare interests, Abreu said.    The Paraguayan and Bolivian foreign ministers said they were  pleased with the Uruguayan offer to use Uruguayan port  facilities to take their products to the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

But not all of the  nearly $500 million invested in Nuclei's unfinished industrial  facilities in Resende (RJ) [Rio de Janeiro] will be wasted.  Brazilian Nuclear Industry, the group's holding company,  intends to use part of the equipment to transform the imported  enriched uranium into powder and then into pellets. The pellets  will then be transformed into the fuel elements, which are  currently made by another company branch.    In order to make this adaptation viable it will be necessary  to invest an additional $15 million in the Nuclei facilities.  Only South Africa and Brazil have built installations to enrich  uranium through the jet nozzle process. But the project is  today considered economically unfeasible, besides having been  questioned in scientific circles.    Jet nozzle technology contemplates the separation of  uranium's heaviest isotopes (238) from lighter ones (235). In  this process the uranium ore is made to circulate in a gaseous  form (hexafluoride) through equipment operating successive  cascades. The predominant uranium enriching process in the  world today is called the ultracentrifuge process. In this  process the machines rotate instead of the gas (uranium remains  in solid state up to a temperature of 56 degrees centigrade. At  higher temperatures it becomes uranium hexafluoride gas).    A proposal studied earlier was to incorporate Nuclei  facilities into the Aramar project that is being built by the  Navy, which developed its own untracentrifuge technology to  supply fuel to the nuclear submarine now under construction.  The idea did not prosper because Nuclei was designed to produce  160,000 enriched uranium units a year (enough to supply the  Angra-2 and Angra-3 power plants), while the submarine will only  need 1,000 units.</p>

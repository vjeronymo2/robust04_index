			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mark Gevisser] </F>   [Text] With under seven weeks to go to the election, the  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] is struggling against  late registrations, a debilitating office move, the logistical  strain of a last-minute change to two ballots, and conflict  between its commissioners and its directorate.    International observers and non-governmental organisations  members fear the IEC is dangerously behind deadline, though  senior IEC members insist that they are "on track". Both  insiders and outsiders agree, however, that the election date  cannot be changed.    After just over a month on its feet and a disruptive move  from the World Trade Centre to premises in Johannesburg, the IEC  is only beginning to put its national infrastructure in place.  Furthermore, the lack of clarity on final registration  deadlines and the sheer pressure of the task at hand, has caused  serious tensions between the IEC's senior directorate staff and  its commissioners.    According to senior sources, director of electoral  administration Piet Colyn tendered his resignation late last  week because of interference by the commissioners, but was  persuaded to stay. Colyn, the director-general of home affairs,  denies that this incident took place.    Several commissioners confirm, however, that this tension  does exist. "All the authority seems to lie with the  directorate," said one, "and it's almost impossible for us to  find out what's going on. But we are the ones who are ultimately  responsible to the electorate." But another commissioner said  "our working relationship with the directorate does not have  major problems."    Is South Africa going to be ready for an election that will  see up to 25-million people pass through about 80,000 voting  booths in 10,000 polling stations observed by at least 10,000  monitors and staffed by 207,000 officials?    Senior officers have just been appointed in the nine  regions,  from which they have until the end of the month to set up  offices and recruit and train regional monitoring and  administrative staff. And the last-minute registration crises,  along with the late decision to move from one ballot to two,  have placed an unexpected burden on the electoral timetable.    Many in the international observer missions and in the NGOs  that have been doing monitoring and voter education are anxious  that the commission appears to be behind schedule.    "People have great expectations," says Alice Coetzee,  project  director of Idasa's [Institute for a Democratic Alternative for  South Africa] Pretoria branch. "I'm scared. If it is a  shambles, we're going to muck up our only chance."    This sentiment is generally shared by members of the  international observer community. The following issues have  been raised with the IEC by members of these organisations:     -  That only a small percentage of the requisite  administrative field-staff have been appointed, and that the  appointment process is a month behind the timetable the IEC set  for itself.    -  That provincial offices are behind deadlines.    -  That the double-ballot system might put pressure on  voter-flow,  which might result in tension at the polling stations.    -  That the IEC has estimated too few voting compartments.    -  That the double-ballot system means many of the polling  stations will be too small.    -  That the security forces who will play a crucial role in  safeguarding the passage of the ballots have not yet been  identified and trained.       IEC commissioner Ben van der Ross responded: "We South  Africans are a pretty resourceful lot. We're getting the  message from the UN crowd that we can't do it. But we'll put  this thing together. We're not a Cambodia or one of those places  in a state of collapse."    Said Bheki Sibiya, the IEC's regional director in  kwaZulu-Natal: "Certainly, the situation is slower than it  should be...If the job is `substantially' well done, that's the  best we can hope for."    Senior officials of the IEC's monitoring and electoral  administration directorates are convinced that, even with the  delays and hitches caused by the registration uncertainty, they  can have their structures in place in time.    Colyn said that nearly 2,000 district electoral officers  will  be in place in two weeks. "And once they are there, it's an  easy job recruiting officials to staff the polling stations."    Monitoring director Peter Harris said his department was  also  "on track". His department is recruiting and training monitors  at the rate of around a thousand a week, and he is certain the  10,000 monitors will be in place by early April. Monitoring  logistics chief Francis Wilson knows that anxiety is rife at the  apparent lateness of appointments, but said "the bulk of the  monitors aren't needed until the polling days."    Van der Ross underscored this point: "Yes, it's true that we  need 200,000 electoral officials. But about 150,000 of these  are just to be employed for a couple of days, and their job will  be quite mechanical. Really, they don't need more than an hour  of training."    Mary Burton, presiding officer in the Western Cape, is cool  and confident about the task ahead of her: "The time scale  looks manageable".    She, along with many other newly-appointed IEC officials,  noted that applications for positions and offers of secondment  from the business and non-governmental sectors are pouring in.  "I think," said one official, "that a few people are panicking.  that's to be expected...give us a chance to actually put our  structures in place."    Colyn acknowledged that "our major concern is violence. What  happens, for example, if the situation is so violent in an area  that polling officials don't report for duty? It is my duty to  plan for alternatives".    Van der Ross said the double-ballot system has caused  logistical problems and there was difficulty in locating large  enough polling stations.    The overwhelming sense from all the senior IEC officials  canvassed is the election will not be smooth and flawless but,  given the limited amount of time, it will happen.    There's an aphorism going round the IEC's new nine-floor  premises on Kruis Street: the commission's work is like  building a ship while already at sea. Swimming against a tide  of unpacked boxes and unconnected telephone-lines earlier this  week, one wag was moved to quip: "Let's hope it's an ark, and  not the Titanic."</p>

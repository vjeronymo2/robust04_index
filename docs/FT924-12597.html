			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Niche paper profits continue to flow - Scapa's low City profile and overseas expansion AMID ALL the current despondency about manufacturing, some companies continue to thrive in profitable, if obscure, niches. The Blackburn-based Scapa Group, which supplies technical products and services to the paper industry, is a good example of a company which is one of only a handful of international companies in its field, yet is little known in the City. A telling reason for both the success and low public profile is the scale of its overseas activities. The group's 6,500 employees work in 48 manufacturing companies, located in 15 countries, with fewer than half based in the UK. Papermaking involves the forming, pressing and drying of wood pulp. Scapa makes the engineered fabrics and roll coverings which hold the paper throughout this process. Since even shareholders might not be clear what that means, the group's latest annual report has a large illustration of a papermaking machine, highlighting all the parts which Scapa can equip. Scapa, which last year made pre-tax profits of Pounds 44.7m on turnover of Pounds 300m, has seen its steady record of earnings growth checked as the paper industry has passed through the trough of recession. However, it has increased market share and continued to improve its products as structural changes in the industry have favoured larger companies. The surviving paper makers use fewer suppliers to service bigger machines, requir-ing greater technical input. Only three international companies supply all parts of the paper-making machine, Albany International, the private US company which is market leader, BTR, the industrial conglomerate, and Scapa. Consolidation in the paper industry has led to more competitive buying by paper makers, squeezing suppliers' margins. However, analysts believe that by matching the manufacturing concentration suppliers will gain greater efficiency and that margins are likely to improve in the long-term. Profits from the roll covering business have suffered from the recent scarcity of new machines. But the consumption of engineered fabrics is likely to grow with the increased use of recycled paper and as machine speeds reach their performance limits. Scapa has been very successful at building greenfield manufacturing plants, particularly in the US, where it followed the paper industry south. About 60 per cent of operating profit originates in the US, making it sensitive to exchange rate movements. The group estimates that for every cent the dollar appreciates against sterling, pre-tax profits increase by Pounds 150,000. To a lesser extent it also benefits from selling more UK-manufactured output in the US. Mr Bill Goodall, chairman, said he was struck during the recent sterling crisis how almost all attention seemed to focus on the sterling/D-Mark exchange rate. 'I cannot understand why no-one mentioned the dollar. The US is still our biggest export earner, yet both Tory and Labour politicians don't seem well informed on this.' The consolidation of the paper industry is being speeded by takeovers and mergers, a trend illustrated by Scapa's Pounds 27.3m purchase last year of Scandiafelt, a Swedish competitors. Mr Goodall said the purchase had increased market share and not just in Scandinavia. 'Powerful Swedish paper companies had bought their way into Germany, and owning Scandia takes us with them.' South-east Asia offers long-term growth opportunities for the paper industry. Scapa has no immediate plans to establish manufacturing plants there, although Mr Goodall said it would no doubt happen eventually. Because customers are widely spread, with different needs, south-east Asia is supplied by exports from Europe and North America. The high-value nature of the goods makes freight charges relatively insignificant. Analysts are less keen on Scapa's 'other industries' businesses, which account for 40 per cent of sales but only 20 per cent of operating profits. These are mainly UK-based and have suffered from the impact of the recession. Mr David Dunn, finance director, conceded that the industrial materials division serving 'other industries' enjoyed lower margins, but stressed that it offered a much more rapid return on capital than the investment-hungry paper businesses. The industrial materials division has been extensively rationalised to focus on filtration technology and industrial tapes. Although Scapa accepted that its efforts would be mainly concerned with servicing the paper industry, Mr Goodall believed the other areas offered good long-term growth prospects. Scapa's strong market position has not been achieved cheaply. In the document accompanying its Pounds 55.6m rights issue last year, the group said it had invested Pounds 171m in the businesses since the previous fund raising in 1985. Of this, a third was spent on acquisitions, one third on replacement capital and the rest on new technology or greenfield sites. Scapa recently assured the City that it would take 'no major leap into the unknown' to develop the industrial products division. Such an assurance was probably unnecessary from a group which embodies the qualities which are supposedly so rare in British manufacturing - a willingness to look long-term and invest heavily.</p>

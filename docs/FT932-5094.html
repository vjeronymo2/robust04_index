			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Money Markets: London remains static LONDON money markets remained largely static yesterday, reflecting the uncertainty that is still dogging the British markets, as they wait for clear policy signals from the new chancellor, writes Gillian Tett. In spite of hopes earlier in the week that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor, might be prodded into early interest rate cuts, the mood among dealers by the close of the week was more downbeat. Although the shorter end of the market was more optimistic than the long end about the prospect of early rate cuts, most analysts predicted that three month interbank rates would remain frozen around yesterday's close of 5 7/8 per cent in the near future. 'There are a lot of political pressures for a rate cut. But I can't see the Chancellor doing anything until the Mansion House speech, or perhaps even later,' said one dealer, who predicted that three month interbank rates would consequently continue to hover between 5 3/4 per cent and 5 7/8 per cent. After trading in a narrow band, the September contract for sterling futures closed around 94.25, slightly lower than the previous day's close of 94.28. For the second day running the Bank of England was slow to meet the Pounds 1.9bn shortage it had forecast for the day. But after late assistance of Pounds 475m, overnight rates closed at 6 1/2 per cent. On the continent, German futures drifted slightly downwards, after the Bundesbank's decision on Thursday not to cut its repurchase rate from 6.70 per cent. After a heavy day's trading, the September contract closed at 93.21, 9 basis points down on the previous day, of 93.30. With yesterday's figures for German manufacturing orders and unemployment slightly better than expected, there was a growing expectation that the Bundesbank might be persuaded to reduce its 7.60 per cent repurchase rate at its meeting next week, in spite of the D-Mark's continued softness. Meanwhile, with the Spanish economy still the focus of nervous attention in the run up to Sunday's general election, the Bank of Spain yesterday announced that it had injected Pta 601bn in money market funds at 11.82 per cent, slightly higher than the previous day's rate.</p>

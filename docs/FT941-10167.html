			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: US Treasuries extend gains after 10-year auction US Treasury bonds extended their gains yesterday after the market cleared an afternoon auction of new 10-year notes without stumbling. Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 better at 97 3/4 , with the yield slipping to 6.416 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was  1/16 ahead at 99 1/4 , to yield 4.384 per cent. In early trading, prices were firm across the yield curve ahead of the sale of Dollars 12bn in 10-year securities, the second leg of the Treasury's Dollars 40bn quarterly debt programme. The positive trend surprised many traders because it was uncertain whether the issue would generate sufficient demand. In the event, the auction went reasonably well, as did the programme's first stage - Tuesday's sale of Dollars 17bn in three-year notes. The 10-year issue was awarded at an average yield of 5.92 per cent, a little weaker than bidding before the sale had suggested. The market was still facing an Dollars 11bn auction of new 30-year bonds this afternoon. The prospects for a successful outcome improved yesterday with the reception accorded the 10-year notes. However, traders remained anxious about the final auction because it is to be followed by January producer price data tomorrow. A firm opening in US Treasuries and signs that the recent transatlantic selling had come to an end helped UK government bonds and futures to come off the day's worst levels. The March long gilt future bounced from the day's low of 115 1/32 as traded as high as 116 3/32 . It stood at 115 29/32 in the late afternoon, down  11/32 on the day. In spite of yesterday's recovery, analysts said the gilts market remained shaky, since many market participants had taken the view that Tuesday's unexpected rate cut had been politically motivated. German government bonds broke their recent losing streak and made solid gains as dealers covered their short positions. The March bund future on Liffe bounced back from the day's low of 98.58 to 99.21 in the late afternoon, up 0.20 point on the day. The market appeared to be divided about the market's short-term outlook. Some dealers warned that the market remained vulnerable to any adverse developments in US Treasuries which could push futures back as low as 98.00. However, others believed bunds had come to the end of their downward correction and that futures could go back above par in the next week. Southern European government bond markets continued to show resilience to the volatility in other markets, protected by their relatively high yields and sound economic fundamentals. The Italian government bond March future rose 0.14 point to 118.40, while in Spain, the March government bond future added 0.07 point to 106.28. Some analysts said the good performance of these markets since the start of the year could be put at risk if bond markets worldwide had another bout of weakness. 'There are funds with massive positions in the main markets so they might get cold feet about their exposure to smaller markets,' an analyst said. Japanese government bonds and futures continued to rebound yesterday as investors took the view that the worst was over for the market now the government's fiscal package designed to lift the economy had finally been unveiled. The yield on the benchmark JGB No 157 fell to 3.42 per cent in Tokyo from the previous day's close of 3.51 per cent, and stood at 3.42 per cent in London trading. Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International, said the market was contrasting its concerns about oversupply with Japan's favourable inflation prospects.</p>

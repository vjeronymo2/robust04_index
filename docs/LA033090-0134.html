			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIANTS HITTING THE BIG TIME;  </P> <P> POP: JOHN FLANSBURGH AND JOHN LINNELL LIKE TO CALL THEMSELVES 'BROOKLYN'S  AMBASSADORS OF LOVE.' THEY SHAKE OFF THE CRITICS WHO CALL THEM WHINY-VOICED  SMART ALECKS.  </P> <P> John Flansburgh, half of the duo They Might Be Giants, stood on the stage of  the Ventura Theatre this week, resembling a young Dan Aykroyd as he did a  parody of a rocker exhorting the crowd:  </P> <P> "Mumble-mumble-something HAVE A GOOD TIME TONIGHT?!"  </P> <P> The youthful fans who were crammed against the stage responded appropriately,  screaming and stomping.  </P> <P> But then John Linnell, the other Giant, dryly asked the fans, "Did you hear  what John said? He said, 'Are you ambivalent about having a good time tonight?'  "  </P> <P> It didn't matter. Many of the fans screamed and stomped at that. And they  screamed and stomped when the duo sang its witty ditties with lines like "My  story's infinite / like the Longines Symphonette" set in sophisticated, funny  melodies that tend to turn pop traditions inside-out. And they shelled out 20  bucks a pop for T-shirts that declared the two less-than-Greek-god guys as  "Brooklyn's Ambassadors of Love."  </P> <P> So you gotta wonder: Is this stuff going over the fans' heads? Might They Might  Be Giants be just a couple of overeducated, whiny-voiced smart alecks who -- as  some detractors maintain -- are too clever by half?  </P> <P> Well?  </P> <P> "That's it! The interview's over," declared Linnell when that assessment was  posed before the show at a nearby Thai restaurant.  </P> <P> He was joking. But both Giants made it clear that -- while not exactly denying  their image -- they take offense at the implications.  </P> <P> "As you become (more popular), you don't want to be sneering people, so you  keep yourselves in check," said Flansburgh, 29, noting that TMBG is riding a  wave of increasing popularity. Its new album "Flood," its first for a major  label, has boosted it from club status to the theater-concert level. The act  plays the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano tonight and the Wiltern Theatre on  Saturday.  </P> <P> "But being considered smart alecks is a negativity and we don't want that."  </P> <P> Continued Linnell, 30, "That's not part of what we're doing, and if we're  sarcastic or ironic, that's a way of dealing with our nervousness."  </P> <P> But on the other hand, the pair certainly does not downplay the smart side of  the image. "We have a lot of ideas going through our songs in an era when  having no ideas is the ideal," said Flansburgh. "You have to be awake, and that  may be too much for some people."  </P> <P> Said Linnell, "We're not trying to be smarter than other people, but there's  this major American trend that is anti-intellectual, especially in popular  music. It's popular not to have an idea between your ears."  </P> <P> Ideas they do have -- by the busload. The 80 or so songs they've released in  their four years as a recording act show no dearth of ideas. In the 70-minute  set Tuesday, the pair -- Flansburgh on guitar, Linnell mostly on accordion,  with tapes to fill it out -- showed off the widened range of their newer  material, from the absurd philosophy of "Whistling in the Dark" to the profound  commentary of "Your Racist Friend."  </P> <P> And they apparently have enough confidence in their material that they've now  pretty much left behind the props and antics of their past in favor of a  relatively straight-ahead presentation -- though the three metronomes on stands  behind them (which actually served as percussion on several songs) provided a  loose connection to their arty background. And by the end of the concert it  seemed that this was not going over the fans' heads, but that -- almost despite  themselves -- the Giants have legitimately connected with an audience that sees  them as more than just clever. And they're not necessarily your standard rock  fans: During one encore, a young man climbed onto the stage, not to do the  usual geeky dancing or stage diving. All he wanted was to stand there and blow  soap bubbles.  </P> <P> He might be a giant, too.  </P></p>

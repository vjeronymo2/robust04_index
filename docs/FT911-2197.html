			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / US discount rate cut as Fed eases monetary policy THE US Federal Reserve yesterday moved to stimulate the flagging American economy by unexpectedly easing monetary policy. It cut the discount rate - the rate charged when banks borrow reserves directly from the central bank - by half a percentage point to 5 1/2 per cent and signalled a quarter point cut to 5.75 per cent in the federal funds rate - the key short-term interest rate, which banks charge each other for loans. The cut in the discount rate, the third half-point reduction since December, follows repeated calls from the White House for an easing of monetary policy to combat the domestic recession. President George Bush, who has unsuccessfully urged interest rate cuts in other industrialised economies, praised the Fed for showing strong leadership. He said the move would stimulate growth not only in the US but across the world. The dollar lost more than 5 pfennigs in London to close at DM1.7170, while against the pound it finished nearly 5 cents lower at Dollars 1.7240. In New York it weakened further but ended above its day's lows at DM1.708 and Dollars 1.7315. The rate cut caught the ministers and central bank governors at the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank by surprise. It had not been discussed in Sunday's meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries or in Monday's session of the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee. Germany welcomed the action but made clear that there was no chance of similar action by the Bundesbank. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, said the cut was good for British recovery prospects. He added that UK interest rates would continue to be set in accordance with the pound's position in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System and the need to bear down on inflation. However, the Fed action both reduced the attraction to international investors of the dollar, which has shown persistent strength since February, and raised the possibility of interest-rate cuts elsewhere. Mr David Morrison, chief international economist at the London office of Goldman Sachs, the US bank, said the move would help Italy, France and Britain in particular. All three are keen to ease borrowing conditions as part of their effort to bolster growth. Cuts in the US prime rate are now likely. Yesterday Southwest Bank, a small St Louis bank that has led industry moves in the past, took the plunge, cutting its prime rate from 9 per cent to 8 3/4 per cent. The Fed's move came on a 4-1 vote of the governors with Governor Wayne Angell casting the dissenting vote. The cut follows a vigorous internal debate about policy with some regional presidents and governors expressing concern about the inflation outlook. The Fed said action was taken 'in the light of continued weakness in economic activity, especially in the industrial and capital goods areas, and evidence of abating inflationary pressures'. It added that the reduction in part realigned the discount rate with market interest rates. The easing of policy follows a spate of poor economic statistics. The Commerce Department said factory orders had fallen by 2.8 per cent in March and durable goods orders by 6 per cent. Real GNP contracted at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent in the first quarter, a steeper decline than anticipated by the White House. Early indicators for April are not encouraging. The Conference Board, a business group based in New York, said its index of consumer confidence, fell slightly in April after a big rise in March. Surveys show consumers more depressed about current conditions but relatively sanguine about longer-term trends.

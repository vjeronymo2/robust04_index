			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by an unidentified </F> correspondent on 3 June; place not given--recorded]    [Text] [Havel] Analyzing the parliament's deliberations  about the electoral law, analyzing it on the basis of all  discussions preempting this issue, all discussions about this  issue, I take the view that what is lacking here is the  political will to form the senate and thus to comply with the  Constitution.    I consider this to be a rather serious situation. In my  view, either the existing Constitution, regardless of how much  or how little we like it, is to be observed, with the  constitutional system functioning normally, or--and this is the  worse possibility--the Constitution has to be amended. In fact,  the worst possibility is when the Constitution is valid but is  not being complied with because this is an undemocratic state of  affairs. I cannot imagine a democracy where, for instance, it  would be impossible to dissolve a parliament--and this is the  situation today because the senate does not exist.    If there is no will to have a senate, it is necessary to  follow the second option, which is worse than complying with the  Constitution but still better than the current state of affairs.  In other words, it is necessary to amend the Constitution.  However, if this is the case, it is not enough to simply delete  the word "senate," as somebody has already suggested. It  demands a full rethink of the respective three chapters of the  Constitution and a rethink of all constitutional aspects,  relations between individual constitutional officials, in order  to form a functioning constitutional system. The senate had its  essential role in this system, and it is not possible to simply  omit it and think the system will function without it.    [Correspondent] In the context of what you have just said, I  would like to mention today's proposal by the KDU-CSL [Christian  Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party], which calls for a  parliamentary commission to initiate the amendment of the  Constitution. The amendment would aim at abolishing the senate,  some of whose powers would be transferred to the president of  the Republic.    [Havel] I think this initiative is probably good and  necessary because some action has to be taken. We cannot live  forever in this untenable situation. The problem of how to  divide the powers of the senate is another question. Probably  some of them would have to be transferred to the head of state.  This is possible, but it is a matter for the parliament to  discuss.    [Correspondent] Is it possible to call the current situation  a constitutional crisis, as some politicians have done?    [Havel] I would not say that we have found ourselves in a  constitutional crisis. We have only found ourselves in a  situation that would prevent us from solving a constitutional or  political crisis if such a crisis arises.    [Correspondent] Do you think it is essential to solve this  problem quickly?    [Havel] Yes, I do.</p>

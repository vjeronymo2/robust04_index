Observer's thanks to The Director magazine for this week's guide to personal financial issues, containing some trenchant advice from financial secretary to the Treasury Stephen Dorrell.

That is why the government will maintain sterling in the ERM and move to the narrow bands in due course at our current central rate of DM2.95.'</p>

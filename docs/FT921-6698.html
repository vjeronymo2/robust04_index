			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Coal imports AB Ports' decision to pull out of the proposed development for coal imports at its Immingham deep-water facility was a surprisingly blunt reaction to a request for a delay from PowerGen. Granted, the issue of coal imports has become a hot political potato. The two electricity generators are in the throes of negotiations with the government over future contracts with British Coal, and are doubtless also worried by the possibility that a Labour government would take a tough line on imports. But it is hard to see why AB Ports should have called such lucrative proceedings to a pre-emptory halt when it will presumably have to fund any alternative project itself. As for what the disappearance of perhaps 10m tonnes of import capacity will mean for the generators further out, it seems safe to assume that National Power will now decide to develop a facility in Teesside as well as Bristol and Hull, while arguably PowerGen had somewhat less need of Immingham in the first place. If UK coal is a little less expensive compared to imports, so much the better for British Coal. A deal before the election seems more likely than ever.</p>

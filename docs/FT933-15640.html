			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Gazans grapple with economic despair / A look at the downward spiral of Palestinian living standards SAMI Haddad is a skilled carpenter who sweeps the rubbish-strewn streets of Gaza for Dollars 9 a day. Like thousands of other Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, Mr Haddad and his family of eight became impoverished overnight when in late March Israel sealed-off the occupied territories and restricted labourers travelling into Israel. Now Mr Haddad is part of a temporary public works programme initiated by the Israeli military-run civil administration. To many Palestinians, the programme is a further slight on their dignity and a vain attempt by Israel to defuse rising anger among the 780,000 refugees and residents who inhabit the economically decimated strip. 'It's nonsense work,' said Mr Haddad. 'Each day we sweep the dirt into piles and next day it blows back into the street. But what can I do? I must work just to feed my family.' Per capita income in 1991 was Dollars 1,300 (Pounds 867) - a fraction of Israel's Dollars 11,000. The long-suffering economy has suffered a lack of job-creating investment, restrictive trade with Israel, annual population growth of 4.7 per cent and a fewer migrant labourers working in Israel. The closure has exacerbated the crisis. 'At one blow we lost jobs and our markets in Israel and the West Bank. The closure is an economic war against the Palestinians,' said Mr Mohamed Qudwa, chairman of the Gaza Chamber of Commerce. In the fruit and vegetable stores of Gaza prices have plumeted. The price of a 17kg box of tomatoes has fallen from Shk20 (Pounds 4.80) to Shk2.5 since the closure and a 11-12kg box of aubergines is down from Shk15 to Shk1. Some Gazan farmers are leaving their produce to rot in the fields rather than pay to harvest the crop. Shops have either closed down or been forced to extend credit for basic food items. Factories and businesses have scaled down production and laid off workers as the export market was frozen and the domestic market shrunk. Mr Nasser Sarraj, of the Gaza Union of Industrialists, says his members have lost up to Dollars 80m since the closure. Ordinary Palestinians in the towns and sprawling refugee camps have been forced to rely on extended families and meagre savings. But these resources are running out. A draft report by Oxfam, the British charity, has warned of the prospect of hunger unless urgent action is taken. 'Deterioration will continue and the situation cannot be stabilised unless there is a massive and continuing injection of funds to lift overall purchasing power,' Oxfam says. The closure of Gaza, eased slightly in recent weeks, has also focused attention on the long-term economic situation in the strip. Although the per capita income of Gaza grew substantially after the 1967 occupation by Israel as a result of access to the Israeli market, it fell sharply after the intifada (uprising) in 1987 and declined steadily thereafter. The economy was battered during the Gulf war. Israel sealed-off the territories after the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) backed Iraq, and Gulf states expelled 400,000 Palestinian guest workers, tens of thousands of whom had been remitting substantial earnings to relatives in Gaza. Most of the workers returned to Gaza with no prospects of finding work. For decades, Gaza has been starved of investment. Wealthy Palestinians shied away because of the security situation and fears of being accused of collaboration. Israel also restricted Gazan exports to Israel, especially agricultural produce, and has banned certain industries such as food processing to protect Israeli producers. Gaza's producers, who import 96 per cent of their raw materials from Israel, also suffer from excessive import tariffs and taxes levied by Israel without reaping the benefit of import substitution. In most years there has been a net capital flow from Gaza to Israel. Income tax and VAT collected in Gaza accrues to the civil administration but import taxes and VAT paid on imports from Israel accrues to the Israeli treasury. Professor Ephraim Kleiman of the Hebrew University estimated in 1987 the net flow of tribute capital from all the occupied territories into Israel was about Dollars 180m. In the past two years, Israel has begun changing its policy. It has encouraged more investments, reformed taxation, raised its investment budget in the territories and subsidised direct exports, like tomatoes and strawberries, to foreign markets. But even the civil administration concedes the present level of investment is inadequate compared to the massive need. Gaza will continue to depend on Israel for migrant employment, imports and exports, at least in the medium term. Billions of dollars of foreign investment, a relaxation of Israel's discriminatory trade and tax regime, and regional integration will be vital to Gaza's economy and its fast growing and malcontent population.</p>

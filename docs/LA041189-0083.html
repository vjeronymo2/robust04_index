			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;  </P> <P> PITCHING IN TO KEEP EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL  </P> <P> When Jennifer Brundage saw her first softball game more than seven years ago,  it was the pitcher who caught her eye. She decided then, that was the position  for her.  </P> <P> "It looked like fun, and I could be in control of the game," said Brundage, 15,  now a sophomore pitcher for Irvine High School's softball team.  </P> <P> Brundage, The Times' athlete of the week, has gotten better control of her  breaking pitches with the help of her pitching coach, Ron LeFebvre. The  Vaqueros have won their last seven consecutive games, and Brundage has pitched  in six of them.  </P> <P> "They are working a lot better now," she said of her curve, drop and rise  pitches. "I can see them break better and I can tell by when I strike out more  batters."  </P> <P> Brundage has struck out 151 in 108 innings and has given up only four earned  runs for an earned-run average of 0.26.  </P> <P> She has raised her record to 8-5 and has helped Irvine turn its season around,  going from 2-5 to 9-5. The Vaqueros' first nine games were against ranked teams  and four of their five losses were 1-0 tiebreakers in extra innings, Irvine  Coach Phil Dunmeyer said.  </P> <P> Brundage has shut out Irvine's last three opponents. She pitched a one-hitter  with eight strikeouts in a 3-0 victory over Woodbridge Tuesday. In a  doubleheader Thursday against Foothill, she pitched a no-hitter with six  strikeouts in the first game's 3-0 victory and pitched the final two outs to  get the save in a 4-0 victory in the second game.  </P> <P> Her hitting has been impressive too, said Dunmeyer, who calls her "the finest  high school hitter I have seen in 25 years."  </P> <P> She is hitting .435 and has struck out only twice in 46 at-bats, Dunmeyer said.  Her on-base percentage is .569. She leads the team with seven RBIs and has  scored twice as many runs (12) as any teammate. She has two home runs and two  doubles.  </P> <P> "Her leadership for being a sophomore and assuming the role has just been  incredible," Dunmeyer said.  </P> <P> Her desire to be in charge carries over to basketball, where she played point  guard on the junior varsity this season.  </P> <P> But basketball is more for recreation, Brundage said. "It's fun. Softball is  fun too, but I'm more serious about it. There are more opportunities to go to  college through softball."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Tanja Brix, University freshman, was fourth in the 3,200 meters at the Arcadia  Invitational Saturday. Her time of 10 minutes 54.64 seconds is the 16th fastest  in Orange County history.  </P> <P> Joy Burkholder, a freshman at Capistrano Valley, won the girls' diving  competition with 447.10 points -- almost 13 more than her closest competitor --  at the Capistrano Valley Invitational Saturday at Saddleback College.  </P> <P> Erin McKenney, Sunny Hills catcher, was named the most valuable offensive  player in the 4-A division of the Canyon softball tournament. McKenney was five  for 11, including a double and home run.  </P> <P> Ivy Pinkerton, Western shortstop, was named the most valuable defensive player  in the 4-A division of the Canyon softball tournament.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jennifer Brundage  </P> <P> Irvine High School  </P> <P> Position: Pitcher  </P> <P> Height, Weight, Class: 5-6, 140, Sophomore  </P> <P> Last Week: Brundage pitched a one-hitter and a no-hitter in shutouts over  Woodbridge and Foothill.  </P> <P> Season: Brundage (8-5) has won her last six games. She has struck out 151 in  108 innings and has a 0.26 ERA. She has a .435 batting average and leads team  in RBIs (seven) and runs scored (12).  </P></p>

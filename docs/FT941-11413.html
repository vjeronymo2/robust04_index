			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Technology: Clean sweep in the sky Laser beams will soon sweep the skies above Berlin to check if the air is fresh. Pollution will be mapped in three dimensions every half-hour by a DM1.5m (Pounds 570,000) laser radar system. It will identify the source of the pollution and trace its path through the atmosphere. The first permanent lidar (light detection and ranging) system for monitoring pollution was installed in Leipzig, east Germany, two years ago to map emissions from industry, electricity generators and traffic. By correlating the data with meteorological information, smog levels can be predicted. The maps reveal the sources of the worst pollution. The lidar, called a Lasair 420S, is a titanium sapphire pulsed laser that emits two beams of different wavelengths. One is tuned to scatter when it encounters specific pollutants; the other is used as a reference. The difference between the scatter of the beams indicates the quantity of pollutant and the echo time reveals its location. The back-scattered laser light is collected through a telescope and focused on to a photodetector. Software interprets the data and produces two- and three- dimensional profiles of the pollution. Typically, they show concentrations of sulphur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen oxide, nitrogen dioxide and dust at heights up to 800m above ground level. The equipment, which fits into a 3m cube and has a range of up to 12km, detects nitrogen oxide levels as low as 2 parts per billion (ppb) and sulphur dioxide concentrations as high as 270 ppb. A system will be sited on the roof of a Berlin hospital by the spring; a smaller, mobile version started trials in December. Conventional techniques for monitoring air pollution only take spot measurements above ground. 'They fail to represent pollution correctly, even if the chemical monitors are located close together because pollution varies drastically within cities,' says Nicolas Adolph, sales manager of Elight Laser, Lasair's German manufacturer. 'We can make remote measurements over several kilometres without the need to take samples.'</p>

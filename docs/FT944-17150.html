			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Maxwell pension schemes sue Credit Suisse bank for Pounds 80m Maxwell pensioners return to the High Court today in two legal challenges attempting to recover more than Pounds 80m from Credit Suisse, one of the banks which lent money to the late Robert Maxwell. Trustees for the Mirror Group Newspapers pension scheme and the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the former managers of other Maxwell company pension schemes, are suing Credit Suisse for accepting pension fund assets as collateral against a loan to the late publisher. The action brought by the MGN pension trustees is seeking more than Pounds 52m in damages. BIM is seeking Pounds 28m. The dispute surrounds a Pounds 50m loan facility from Credit Suisse to Mr Maxwell's private companies which was agreed in July 1990 and drawn against in September that year. Both the MGN pension trustees and BIM are arguing that Credit Suisse was, or should have been, aware that the shares offered by the publisher as collateral were pension fund assets. The ownership of the shares was split between the MGN pension scheme and BIM. Attached to the action brought by the MGN trustees is a further claim against Credit Suisse by Bank of America for Pounds 25m - the sum paid by the San Francisco bank to the MGN scheme, without any admission of liability, in January this year. Bank of America had acted on Mr Maxwell's behalf as custodian of the disputed shares and passed them on to Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse has mounted a counter-claim against Bank of America. Miss Margaret Cole of Stephenson Harwood, the solicitors acting for BIM, said: 'This is an important step in recovering pension fund assets. It is the first time a court will rule on a bank's liability for taking pension fund assets as collateral.' In February, the MGN trustees settled one case involving pension fund assets when it accepted a Pounds 32m out of court payment from securities houses Lehman Brothers, Invesco Asset Management and Capel-Cure Myers. The actions by the MGN pension trustees and BIM are legally separate, but will be heard together. They are expected to end early next year. Credit Suisse is fighting both cases. In a statement, the bank said it was under no liability to MGN pension trustees or BIM, and that the security taken for the loan was valid as it had been taken in good faith.</p>

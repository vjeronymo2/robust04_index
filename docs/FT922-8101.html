			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Norwich Union fined for advert: Regulator decides that four-page Sun supplement was misleading NORWICH UNION, one of the UK's largest life insurers, has been ordered to pay Pounds 65,000 in fines and costs for misleading advertising in the Sun newspaper. It is the first such fine levied on a life insurance company. Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the insurance industry, said yesterday that the Pounds 50,000 fine and Pounds 15,000 in costs are the first since it was granted authority to levy such fines last autumn. Its disciplinary committee is reviewing eight or nine other cases against life insurance companies which may result in fines. Most of these involve failure properly to control sales agents. Lautro is seen as having taken a tougher stance on life industry sales practices in recent months, following rising complaints about mis-selling by sales agents. The fines against Norwich Union stem from a four-page pullout advertisement supplement in the Sun on April 25 1991 offering a 15-year savings plan with initial monthly premiums of Pounds 10 or Pounds 20. Lautro said the style, layout and presentation of the advertisement made the material indistinguishable from the Sun's editorial matter so that readers could have believed they were reading a journalist's independent account of a new product. 'The revolutionary SunCare savings offer is unveiled today', the advertisement began. 'Every adult reader of The Sun aged between 18 and 65 has the chance to build a nest-egg.' 'And the offer could be worth Pounds 130 to you thanks to our TWO great bonuses.' The advertisement was placed by one of Norwich Union's so-called tied agents. These do not work for the company directly but sell its products exclusively and earn commissions for each policy sold. Lautro has said that tied agents account for a disproportionate number of complaints against life insurers. The tied agent, SunCare, was a subsidiary of Sedgwick Group, a nationwide chain of financial services brokers, and was formed for the sole purpose of the Sun promotion campaign. SunCare no longer exists. Norwich Union said it would continue offering its products through Sedgwick subsidiaries despite the incident. Norwich Union said 6,000 people responded to the advertisement, roughly 4,500 taking up the offer. At Lautro's request, it wrote to all clients pointing out that the product did not have the Sun's endorsement, an action which led to requests for refunds from only two policyholders. Norwich Union took steps to inform potential investors of many of the misleading aspects of the advertisement before ordered to do so by Lautro. However, regulators felt the advertisement's format was so obviously misleading that a substantial fine was justified. Lautro said the advertisement also misled investors by failing to tell them their premium payments would have to rise by 20 per cent a year in each of the first five years of the plan. The advertisement also wrongly implied that illustrations of potential investment returns were calculated on a conservative basis and thus actual returns were likely to be higher.</p>

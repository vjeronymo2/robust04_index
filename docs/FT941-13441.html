			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Portugal hit by strike standstill A 24-hour national strike by Portuguese public-sector workers yesterday seriously disrupted hospitals, schools, courts, public transport and other services. Unions said the action was backed by up to 90 per cent of workers concerned. The strike was in protest against a proposal by the centre-right social democrat government to limit 1994 pay rises in the public administrative sector to 2 per cent. Unions are demanding a 9 per cent increase. The strike was the first to be jointly backed by both the communist-led CGTP-Intersindical and socialist-dominated UGT union confederations. Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, has made clear that his government aims to set an example for private-sector employers by keeping pay rises low. This follows the collapse of efforts to negotiate a national wage pact between unions and employers.</p>

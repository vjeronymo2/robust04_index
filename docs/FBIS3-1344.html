A  representative sample of 400 people of all races throughout the  province was interviewed earlier this month.    The poll found that the National Party [NP] and its leader,  F.W. de Klerk, had quite favorable images among the Western Cape  electorate as whole, and they are the strongest among coloreds.  Sixty-one percent of all potential voters see the NP favorably,  as do 74 percent of colored voters.    The ANC [African National Congress] and its leader, Nelson  Mandela, have fairly unfavorable images in the same area except  among the African minority. Both major party candidates for  provincial premier are unpopular. Only 12 percent think the  NP's Hernus Kriel would make a good premier, while 21 percent  think the ANC's Allan Boesak would. The poll found that the  issues having the most impact in the Western Cape campaign  concerned group identity and economic benefits. These include  fears of how an ANC government would treat coloreds and whites,  and whether coloreds identify with whites or with blacks.  Overall, the survey found that 37 percent of potential Western  Cape voters say the National Party could best handle what they  consider the most important issues. Twenty percent named the  ANC, 7 percent the Democratic Party, and 2 percent the  Pan-Africanist Congress.</p>

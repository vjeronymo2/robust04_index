			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : OPHELIA IS NO PASSIVE WIMP, HELENA BONHAM-CARTER BELIEVES  </P> <P> Helena Bonham-Carter was a bit wary when director Franco Zeffirelli cast her as  the tragic Ophelia opposite Mel Gibson's melancholy Dane in Shakespeare's  "Hamlet."  </P> <P> "I thought Franco would try to make me into this decorative thing," the petite  British actress explains. "But, in fact, he sort of allowed me to make her a  strong character. She can be quite wimpy and passive. There is no space these  days to play Ophelia too passive or too obedient or too vapid. She has to have  spirit and character."  </P> <P> Bonham-Carter, who previously appeared in "Lady Jane" and "Room With a View,"  is annoyed with audiences' usual reaction to Ophelia. "They want to dismiss  her," she says. "There's not much compassion or respect for her. She is done a  disservice and I wanted to champion her."  </P> <P> The actress believes Ophelia goes mad because she is not allowed to have any  sexual feelings. "Then Hamlet dumps on her all of these feelings about his  mother," she says. "If Hamlet had said, 'I got a bit of a problem,' it would  have been great. He and Ophelia would have been able to talk about it. Instead,  Ophelia thinks it's all her fault -- Hamlet's madness and his rejection of her  and his killing her father. She can just imagine it's over her. I think it  would be great to rewrite the play from Ophelia's point of view."  </P> <P> Ophelia's death scene took four days to film. "I didn't have any lines because  I was dead, but it was difficult to stay still," Bonham-Carter quips. It was  also difficult not to laugh. "I didn't laugh until it was my close-up. I had  been lying there for four days and they had almost forgotten about me. Then  Franco put the cameras on me and then he decides to have a wind blowing across  my face. That was created by Franco blowing across me like a cherub. There's a  term called 'corpsing' in the business and that is when you break down in  uncontrollable giggles. I gave new meaning to the word."SUSAN KING  </P></p>

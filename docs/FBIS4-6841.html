			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Washington-based correspondent Chong Un-chan] </F>   [Text] Democratic Party Chairman Yi Ki-taek, who is  visiting the United States, held an emergency news conference in  Washington on 22 April regarding the resignation of Prime  Minister Yi Hoe-chang. He demanded the resignation of the  entire cabinet and decided to return home the day after tomorrow  [25 April]. He was originally scheduled to return on 2 May.    Chairman Yi Ki-taek asserted that President Kim Yong-sam's  acceptance of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang's resignation can be  interpreted as the president's distrust in the cabinet and  demanded the resignation of the entire cabinet to show that all  the ministers are responsible.    Chairman Yi Ki-taek clearly opposed the National Assembly's  appointment of acting Prime Minister Yi by saying that the new  acting Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok has no administrative  experience and is too conservative and that a competent and  progressive new figure should be elected as prime minister.    Branding the resignation of the prime minister due to a  disagreement between the president and the prime minister as a  national misfortune, Chairman Yi strongly denounced President  Kim's personnel policy.</p>

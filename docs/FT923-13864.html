			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Patten pledges to 'stand up for Hong Kong' MR CHRIS PATTEN, Hong Kong's 28th and almost certainly its last governor, declared yesterday that the colony's successful transition to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 would provide a 'shining example to the world' of partnership and co-operation between peoples and nations. Mr Patten, speaking after his swearing in by Sir Ti-liang Yang, the colony's Chief Justice, pledged to devote all his energy to representing the interests of the people of Hong Kong as 'strongly and wisely' as he could. 'I will stand up for Hong Kong as you would wish me to do, courteously and firmly,' he said. 'What we have to do in the closing years of this tumultuous century is to turn from earnest hope to firm reality that historic and far-sighted concept  -'one country, two systems'.' The hope of a smooth transfer is in stark contrast to the current acrimonious state of Anglo-Chinese relations. The two sides have failed to agree on the terms of financing the colony's multi-billion-dollar airport - a deadlock which has the potential to undermine confidence in the colony if not settled soon - and China is suspicious that Mr Patten will attempt to accelerate the pace of democracy in Hong Kong. Mr Patten used his address to try to begin repairing relations with Beijing, stating that good co-operative relations were his 'sincere aim and profound wish'. He said he would do all that he could to remove misunderstandings and build trust. But he reminded Beijing that 'trust is a two-way street'. He did not explicitly raise the issue of democracy, but, in what might have been an oblique reference to it, he said he had no 'secret agenda'. 'My only agenda is the one I have laid before you today. It is clear. It is public. And so it will remain.' The new governor did not, however, shrink from reminding his audience of the need to preserve and safeguard Hong Kong's way of life and freedoms. On domestic politics, Mr Patten promised an 'open and accessible' style of leadership, but one based firmly on the premise that the ultimate responsibility of leadership rests with himself 'in what is and will remain an executive-led government'. Patten turns on the charm, Page 4</p>

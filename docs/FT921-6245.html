			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Guinness raises Dollars 200m to repay short-term debt GUINNESS, the UK drinks and leisure group, yesterday raised Dollars 200m three-year funding in the international bond market, using the proceeds of the issue to repay short-term debt. Lead managed by J. P. Morgan Securities, the 6 1/2 per cent bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.85, where the yield spread over US Treasury bonds was 60 basis points. Many participants in the deal reported good demand for the bonds at this level from buyers anticipating an appreciation by the US currency on the foreign exchange markets. However, when the deal was allowed to trade freely by the lead manager, the price of the bonds slipped back to 99.75 and the yield spread widened to around 65 basis points. Most of this lost ground was later recovered as unsold paper was mopped up by firms with better demand, but the softness of the price in the early stages was seen as hampering the progress of the deal. By the close of trading the deal was quoted at 99.82 bid. The payment date on the bonds is April 6, more than five weeks after the launch date and longer than normal in the Euromarket. This was seen as deterring some institutional investors from buying the bonds, but may have helped Guinness achieve a better swap rate and a lower cost of funds. The proceeds were swapped into floating rate dollars. Elsewhere, New Brunswick, one of the less frequent visitors to the international bond market among Canadian provinces, had a mixed reception to a CDollars 200m 10-year deal launched via Merrill Lynch. The bonds carry a coupon of 9 1/4 per cent and were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.86, for a yield 73 basis points more than Canadian government paper. The pricing was seen as aggressive by many participants in the deal. Bonds issued by Ontario, which has a credit rating two notches above New Brunswick, trade at a yield spread of 74 basis points over government bonds. Against this, bonds issued by New Brunswick have rarity value and many participants in the deal anticipated good retail buying for the bonds. The deal was held at the fixed re-offer price throughout the day.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ji Jincheng (1323 6651 2052)] </F>   [Text] Shanghai, 17 Mar (XINHUA) -- The purpose of the  people's government is to serve the people. When Comrade Jiang  Zemin was Shanghai mayor, he called on the municipal government  to do practical things for the people. That was seven years  ago. Now, the municipal government has completed 97 practical  things for the people, all of them were closely related to the  masses daily lives. The municipal government's move won praises  from the masses.    For the past seven years, the Shanghai municipal government  organized personnel and sent them to solicit the masses'  opinions. Based on the masses' opinions, the municipal  government prepared a practical-things list for that year in  line with the principle of financial and manpower availability  and with the principle of doing things in a down-to-earth  manner. To ensure the completion of that year's list, relevant  departments would cooperate with each other and give priority to  completing those practical things. The 97 practical things that  the municipal government has completed are concentrated mostly  in the food supply, housing, and transport areas, things that  the masses show most concern for.    For the past seven years, housing construction has always  been on the municipal government's practical-thing list. The  municipal government has helped relieve Shanghai's overcrowded  housing situation to some extent. Shanghai built over 600,000  housing units in the last seven years, thus adding 0.7 square  meter to the per capita living space for its citizens. The  municipal government has always paid attention to the "vegetable  basket project" because it directly affects the interests of all  citizens. The government has helped improve the nonstaple food  supply.    Citizens living in outlying areas or in new residential  areas  once complained about the unavailability of public telephone  service at night. They said they were at a complete loss when  emergencies occurred. To meet their demands, the municipal  government entered the "emergency telephone" item on its  practical-thing list. Following coordination with many relevant  departments, it was decided that telephones at plants, stores,  schools, and organs operating at nighttime would be open for  public use. The new arrangement thus added 2,400 nighttime  emergency telephones in the municipality. Last year, the  municipal government also set up a "110 police information  telephone" network to enhance the people's sense of security.    Shanghai municipal government's persistence in doing  practical things for the citizens in the last seven years has  helped improve the living environment and quality of the masses.  The elated masses called the government's practical-thing  projects "projects of conscience."</p>

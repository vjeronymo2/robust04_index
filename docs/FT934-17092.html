			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Camelot's big bet The Camelot consortium created to bid for the UK's National Lottery will remain little more than a shimmering castle in the sky until the government details its intentions. But the serious preparations being made by a string of blue-chip companies confirm the view that a betting bonanza is about to break out. Some members of the Camelot consortium could benefit directly from operating the lottery. Racal, ICL and De La Rue will all be keen to sell their wares to the operator. Cadbury Schweppes's involvement appears rather less explicable, although its marketing muscle will clearly help. There may be a defensive aspect to Cadbury's move; indecisive shoppers with shallow pockets may waiver between indulging in lottery tickets or chocolate treats. But it is certainly gratifying to know that Cadbury has the spare management resources to become involved in Camelot while taking on the might of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo in their home market. The national lottery may yet become the biggest single consumer product in the UK, as Camelot firmly believes. But it is unlikely ever to be the most profitable. With the lottery's prizes, charitable contributions and tax fixed by the government, profitability will depend on the operator's efficiency. After the necessary heavy advertising, a meagre margin of just 2-3 per cent may be attainable, making volume critical. Even if wildly popular, there will be a limit to investment returns. Oflot's role will surely be to divert 'excessive' profits into the coffers of more worthy causes.</p>

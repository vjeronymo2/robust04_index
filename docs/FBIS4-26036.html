			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Sun Yong (1327 0516) and Zhu Dongju (2612 0392 </F> 5468)]    [Text] Beijing, 14 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Fifth National  Congress of Returned Overseas Chinese and Relatives of Chinese  Nationals Living Abroad opened in the Great Hall of the People  this afternoon.    Prior to the opening, leading cadres, including Jiang Zemin,  Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, and Rong Yiren, met cordially  all deputies to the congress and posed for group photos.    On behalf of the party Central Committee and the State  Council, Jiang Zemin extended warm greeting to the congress;  wished the vast numbers of returned Overseas Chinese, relatives  of Chinese nationals living abroad, and Overseas Chinese all the  best; and expressed his cordial regards to cadres of the  All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese [ACFOROC] at  various levels and to personnel who handle work concerning  Overseas Chinese. He said that work on Overseas Chinese has  been long-term, policy-oriented, important work for both the  party and the state. In the past, returned Overseas Chinese,  relatives of Chinese nationals living abroad, and Overseas  Chinese have made outstanding contributions in terms of nation  revitalization and national construction. In this new period  when China is accelerating its reform, opening up, and economic  construction, conscientiously doing a good job in Overseas  Chinese affairs will be important to the smooth realization of  China's economic development strategic objectives, to the  enhancement of friendly exchanges with other countries, and to  the promotion of the peaceful unification of the motherland.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping, who terms bringing out the positive role  of the broad Overseas Chinese as an unique opportunity for  greater development in China, has provided us with important  guidance with far-reaching significance to improve our work  under the new situation. Let's take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as  guidance, seize the opportunity, master the overall situation,  work hard in unity, and open up a new work horizon for ACFOROC  designed to contribute even more to revitalizing the Chinese  nation and unifying the motherland.    The congress, which is being attended by 812 deputies and  specially invited representatives, will examine ACFOROC's Fourth  Committee work report, scrutinize and adopt its draft  constitutional amendment, and elect its Fifth Committee.    In congratulating the congress on behalf of the party  Central  Committee and the State Council, Qian Qichen, a member of the  CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and State Council vice  premier, said: ACFOROC, a CPC-led nationwide people's  organization of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of  Chinese nationals living abroad, serves as a bridge and a tie  linking the party and the government with returned Overseas  Chinese, relatives of Chinese nationals living abroad, and  Overseas Chinese. Under the new situation, ACFOROC at various  levels should unfold its work around the economy; give full play  to the role of returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Chinese  nationals living abroad, and Overseas Chinese in participation  in government and discussion as well as democratic supervision;  and protect their lawful interests and legitimate rights in  China according to the law. It is necessary to fully bring out  ACFOROC's superiority in conducting nongovernmental exchanges,  to step up foreign liaison work; to enthusiastically help  returned Overseas Chinese, relatives of Chinese nationals living  abroad, and Overseas Chinese in promoting cultural, educational,  public health, and other social undertakings in China; and to  thoroughly bring out ACFOROC's role in building the socialist  spiritual civilization, including promoting the spiritual  civilization in areas inhabited by returned Overseas Chinese.    Qian Qichen said: The party and the government have all  along  been attaching importance to work concerning Overseas Chinese.  From now on, party committees and governments at various levels  should further strengthen and improve leadership in this respect  by giving full play to the role of ACFOROC and by showing  concern for and lending their support enthusiastically.    In presenting a work report entitled "Making New  Contributions Toward the Great Undertaking of Revitalizing the  Chinese Nation and Unifying the Motherland," ACFOROC President  Zhuang Yanlin, after reviewing the work of the past five years,  highlighted the federation's major future tasks as following:  to closely unite the vast number of returned Overseas Chinese,  relatives of Chinese nationals living abroad, and Overseas  Chinese to ensure greater contributions toward accelerating  China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive; to further  bring out its role in participation in government and discussion  as well as democratic supervision; to promote the full  implementation of "The Law for the Protection of Returned  Overseas Chinese and Relatives of Chinese Nationals Living  Abroad" and its "Implementation Rules"; to further bring out  ACFOROC's superiority in conducting nongovernmental exchanges;  to open up a new situation in foreign liaison work; to play a  positive role in building a socialist spiritual civilization;  and to vigorously promote reform within the ACFOROC itself for  its improved performance.    ACFOROC Vice President Zhuang Shiping made an opening  speech,  while Gao Chao, vice president of the Chinese Scientists  Association, greeted the congress on behalf of various people's  organizations.    Other leading comrades who attended the opening ceremony  after meeting all the delegates included Lie Jieqiong, Wang  Guangying, Cheng Siyuan, Wang Zhaoguo, and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme.</p>

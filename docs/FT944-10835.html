			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / CBI cool on union chief's training call: Bill Jordan warns conference of complacent attitudes - BP chief underlines the 'competitive realities' Industrial companies should pay a training levy if the UK is to overcome the handicap of the least skilled workforce in Europe, Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU craft union, told the CBI conference in Birmingham yesterday. He said the voluntary approach to training had been found wanting, and added: 'If the CBI is serious about wanting a strategy to deliver skills for the next century, we should not be debating whether to have a training levy but tailoring the shape of one.' He said budgets to improve skills had been cut by 35 per cent in the past five years. It was 'dangerously complacent' to praise Britain's best companies when the nation was lagging on productivity by up to 40 per cent compared with overseas rivals. The CBI responded cautiously to the idea. Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman of Cadbury Schweppes and the CBI's education committee, said: 'The CBI has not supported the concept in the past but we will be asking our members to express their views and we will be consulting all members via the regional councils.' But Mr Jordan's argument sparked criticism from some delegates to the conference. Mr John Phillips, chairman of Reliance-Barker-Davies, the engineering group, dismissed the idea of a levy as 'simply an additional payroll tax' and 'a pure addition to costs, a deterrent to employment'. Earlier, Mr David Simon, chief executive of BP, had warned that even well-trained employees faced uncertainty. He said: 'We will not be thanked by future generations if we duck the competitive realities of the present.' Jobs for life were unlikely. 'I think most of us recognise that such a prospect is no longer wholly appropriate,' he suggested. Ms Kamlesh Bahl, who chairs the Equal Opportunities Commission, told the CBI that inequality was 'demonstrably inefficient' and that 'a workforce trained in a discriminatory way is inflexible'. She noted that there had been a sevenfold increase in compensation over the past year since the ceiling on awards had been abolished last year. In cases of sexual harassment, awards against transgressing companies were likely to increase. But Ms Bahl, seeking to head off any criticism that the Equal Opportunities Commission was a hindrance to companies' freedom of action, assured businessmen that 'this is not a battle of the sexes'. Rather, the fair management of human resources was 'about achieving competitiveness through equality of opportunity'.</p>

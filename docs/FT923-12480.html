			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Active return for MGN Mirror Group Newspaper (MGN) shares, suspended last December at 125p following the death of Mr Robert Maxwell, the chairman and chief executive and ahead of subsequent revelations of a massive fraud, were requoted yesterday. The relisting took place amid hints that a stakebuilder had been quietly picking up stock being offered into the market. There has been considerable speculation recently that Mirror shares could well attract the attentions of a predator. On Thursday night there were rumours that a dawn raid on Mirror shares was being prepared. Mr Tony O'Reilly, chief executive of Heinz, the US food group, was one of a number of names mentioned as a potential bidder. The shares were initially quoted at 50p and gradually edged up to 54p before easing back late in the session to close at 52 3/4 p. turnover reached 20m shares. Dealers, on the alert for signs of a stake-building exercise, noted the appearance of a persistent buyer whenever shares were offered in size. MFI wanted Furnishing specialist MFI returned to the market in sparkling form, adding a premium of 2 to its flotation price at 117p and turning over 37.2m shares, making it the top-traded stock of the day. Traders had expected the shares to trade at a slight premium following the price being pegged back after several recent issues either flopped or were withdrawn. However, one analyst said: 'While the institutions recognised the realistic strike price as good value, in the last the three weeks since the price was set, the rest of the stores sector has been drfiting down towards its rating.' But not enough it seemed to prevent some buyers switching out of more expensive stocks and into MFI. Dixons, off 8 at 191p and Argos, down 9 at 219p, were among the causalties. Banks weak Barclays and NatWest were significant underperformers in a weak banking sector after BZW lowered its earnings estimates for both banks. The forecast reductions were made because of increases in provisions for bad debts, it was said. For Barclays, BZW reduced its current year forecast from Pounds 395m to Pounds 320m and that for next year from Pounds 975m to Pounds 785m. The broker shifted its 1992 figure for NatWest from Pounds 500m to Pounds 400m. Although unsettled by the downgraded profits forecasts the market was relieved that BZW expected Barclays to maintain the dividend. Barclays shares settled 12 off at 315p on turnover of 3.7m. NatWest lost 17 to 317p. The recent slide in Lasmo shares gathered pace yesterday with the shares dropping 19 more to 125p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 7m, amid stories that analysts had begun to chop their net asset valuations for the company. Over the week the shares have dropped 38p and many analysts expect further weakness, possibly to as low as 100p, a level last seen in 1986a Lasmo shares have underperformed in an oil sector that has been badly affected by a combination of a falling dollar and weak oil prices. A number of analysts were said to have reduced their asset valuations for Lasmo yesterday from levels of around 160p a share to as low as 130p. Dealers said there had been two big sellers of Lasmo stock in the market yesterday. One specialist said there was little or no support for the shares in the market. Stores group Marks and Spencer burnished its already well polished City image with a bullish agm statement indicating that first half profits were ahead of the same period last year. 'With the well-documented tough retail trading conditions being experienced at the moment, it is a remarkable performance,' said one analyst. The shares, ahead 6 at one stage, fell back to close a penny off at 306p. The move to lift its basic mortgage rate by the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society was seen as only the latest in a series of damaging blows to a housebuilding sector already on its knees. Taylor Woodrow dropped 3 more to 63p, Tarmac, despite news of the sale of Briggs Oil, eased 2 1/2 to 78 1/2 p, Barratt lost 5 to 51p and Costain 5 to 25 1/2 p. RMC, Europe's largest aggregates group, suffered from a broker downgrade, closing a further 20 off at 498p. The falls on Wall Street and weakness in the dollar, caused a retreat in leading international stocks. Among those to suffer most was BAT, which gave up 25 to 749p in turnover of 3.1m. Elsewhere, RTZ lost 17 to 542p. The steep falls in the equity market and their impact on solvency margins caused considerable unease in the composite insurance area. Sun Alliance dropped 16 1/2 to 253 1/2 p, General Accident 11 to 404p and Royal 7 to 193p. The sliding dollar prompted a sharp sell off in insurance brokers where Willis Corroon retreated 12 to 200p and Sedgwick 6 to 172p. Another bout of serious weakness in BP saw the shares dropping below the 200p mark to close a net 7 1/2 off at 199 1/2 p on good turnover of 7.4m. The steep decline in the dollar was said to have been instrumental in triggering the slide, as was a loss of confidence by recent US buyers of the shares. The market is split over whether the group, which reports second quarter results on August 6, will cut its dividend and if so, by how much, Shell lost 8 to 473p on 4.9m. Among other exploration and production stocks Enterprise was roughly handled, closing a hefty 17 lower at 341p, and Hardy 9 down at 87p, the latter despite a strong recommendation from one of the leading UK broking firms. A downgrade in Tate and Lyle left the food manufacturing outfit 16 down at 339p. BZW lopped Pounds 9m to Pounds 226m for the current year. A bout of profit-taking took the wind out of Northern Food's sails, the shares crumbling 18 to 603p. Hoare Govett decided that declining milk volumes would affect Unigate and moved to an overvalued stance. The stock slipped 9 to 292p. Property worries returned to haunt Ladbroke as Nomura downgraded the leisure group. The shares tumbled 12 to 183p in hectic tading of 4.5m. A glum trading outlook from Thorn EMI left the shares 15 adrift at 769p. Profit taking and a lack of confidence in the company's UK earnings left conglomerate Tomkins 22 lighter at 456p. The news that Ford Motor was to cut UK car production at Halewood cast a shadow over motor stocks. T&amp;N fell 9 to 148p and GKN 12 to 281p. Lucas Industries retreated 4 to 115p and BBA eased 9 to 126p. In aerospace, Smiths Industries was further weakened by a profits downgrading by agency broker Carr Kitcat and the shares ended down 5 at 273p. Carlton Communications ended 21 down at 593p after a bond issue. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (17).

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / OFT to conduct inquiry into office equipment leasing A WIDE-RANGING inquiry into the hiring and leasing of office equipment was announced by the Office of Fair Trading yesterday. It follows allegations of malpractice and high-pressure sales techniques, particularly in the photocopier market. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he was launching an investigation because complaints about selling practices had continued despite earlier attempts to improve standards. The OFT, which can investigate the activities of individual companies and can revoke their consumer credit licences, will also examine the supply of postal franking and vending machines. Sir Bryan said his office would examine sales methods, the nature, length and clarity of leasing contracts, the effectiveness of existing consumer protection laws and self-regulation. Investigations will also centre on the relationship - criticised as anti-competitive - between equipment suppliers, the dealers and supporting finance and leasing companies. Earlier this week, Southern Business Group, the publicly quoted photocopier leasing company, disclosed resignations and sackings after it admitted 'improprieties' in dealings with some customers. It said then it would welcome an OFT investigation of the sector. Last year, the OFT decided against revoking licences from the office equipment supplier Eurocopy following assurances about some of its business practices. Mr Cyril Gay, chairman of Eurocopy, last night welcomed the inquiry. Sir Bryan said that complaints to the OFT suggested numerous cases of 'misrepresentation and sharp practice', most noticeably involving photocopying leases. Initial OFT inquiries, he added, 'tend to confirm this view'. The Campaign to Clean Up Copier Contracts, which has logged more than 3,000 complaints from photocopier customers and has pressed for OFT intervention, said the decision was a breakthrough. A campaign spokesman said it would 'bring hope to the 250,000 cost-per-copy customers' who had been caused misery and distress by leasing companies which had enforced contracts signed under false pretences'. The campaign has submitted to the OFT a dossier of complaints, involving more than 50 photocopier dealers and leasing companies, some of them owned by large, London-based financial institutions. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, also welcomed the move. However, he criticised the OFT for acting slowly, and claimed that its inaction had cost photocopier customers millions of pounds. Allegations made by customers involve the use of flexible business agreements which obscure expensive obligations. contracts running well beyond the working life of the equipment and which include hidden increases in copy costs.</p>

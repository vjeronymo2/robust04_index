			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 1 (YONHAP) -- Police launched a  large-scale hunt for 30 to 40 leaders of the Korea Federation of  University Student Councils [Hanchongnyon] Wednesday after  deciding that Hanchongnyon is a pro-North Korean communist  organization.    Some 50,000 radical students joined by citizens staged  massive anti-government and anti-U.S. rallies and demonstrations  in Kwangju on Sunday, distributing leaflets calling the Korean  war (1950-53) a war of liberation from the American imperialists.    They also demanded an immediate end to international  pressure  on Pyongyang to halt its nuclear weapons program and praised  North Korean President Kim Il-song's chuche ideology.    Police said they have obtained arrest warrants for  Hanchongnyon Chairman Kim Yong-chun, 24, of Pusan University,  and Yang Tong-hun, 22, of Chosun University in Kwangu, chairman  of the committee for reunification of the motherland, among  others.    In addition, police secured a list of the names of nine  students described as chairmen of the regional reunification  committees and nine others.    Police are also investigating 20 other students on suspicion  of being core members of Pomchonghaknyon or the Pan-National  Student Alliance.    According to police, Pomchonghaknyon consists of an  11-member  leadership, 25 standing committee men and 200 members.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WOODBURY UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IS DEDICATED  </P> <P> Woodbury University dedicated a library Wednesday housed in a renovated former  chapel at the school's Burbank campus.  </P> <P> The 14,000-square-foot library has been open since 1987, when renovations were  complete.  </P> <P> Ceremonies on campus Wednesday included naming the structure the Los Angeles  Times Library in recognition of a $200,000 contribution from the Times Mirror  Foundation.  </P> <P> The renovation prepared the chapel, built in 1950, and chapel office annex to  hold the university's collection of more than 120,000 books and periodicals.  The chapel was a remnant of the former Villa Cabrini Academy, a Catholic school  for girls. Woodbury University moved to the campus from downtown Los Angeles  three years ago.  </P> <P> Two Woodbury alumni who majored in interior design planned the renovation,  which cost about $500,000, said Woodbury spokeswoman Karen B. Spiegel.  </P> <P> "When you walk in, there's still a kind of awesome feeling about it," she said.  "They still have some of the stained glass there and some of the original  lighting fixtures."  </P> <P> Areas of the former chapel house reference books and a study area. The annex,  built in 1959, has reading rooms and book stacks.  </P> <P> Other foundations that have contributed to Woodbury's capital fund include: the  William Randolph Hearst Foundation, the Weingart Foundation, the Roy Disney  Family Foundation, the Lockheed Corporation and the Security Pacific  Foundation.  </P></p>

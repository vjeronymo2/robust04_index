			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement provides optional coverage for those growers who may not wish to replant damaged winter wheat. However, the Basic Policy requires that crops damaged prior to the final planting date be replanted when practical. This requirement helps FCIC maintain lower premium rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some comments were in disagreement with the provision allowing insureds to select optional units for initially planted winter wheat and initially planted spring wheat for the following reasons: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Currently, production from winter wheat acreage often off-sets losses on spring wheat acreage. Allowing optional units by type can only increase the loss ratio in those areas where both winter and spring types wheat are planted and insured. To increase risk exposure by allowing winter and spring wheat units when other changes are concurrently being implemented in the program to decrease the loss ratio seems to create a conflict. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. There is no appreciable difference in harvesting and marketing the soft white winter wheat and the soft white spring wheat grown in the northwest. Although a yield difference does exist between the two types of wheat, yield differences also exist for many other crop practices and types not allowed separate optional units. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. If optional units are allowed by type, a significant increase in losses could result. According to information from some member companies who have analyzed prior year losses by type, loss ratios for wheat would have been substantially higher if winter and spring wheat could have been insured as a separate optional units. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. One organization had not received any requests for optional units by type from companies, agents, or insureds, and therefore did not see the need for the provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other comments provided the following observations and inquiries: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Will the cost of the options in provisions governing Unit Division be prohibitive? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Production of spring wheat and winter wheat is commingled more often than not. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Allowing winter and spring optional units may significantly increase risk. FCIC should analyze winter and spring statistics to determine if an additional rate should be charged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. The provision allowing optional units for initially planted Winter Wheat and initially planted Spring Wheat will permit growers who have insufficient acreage to plant in separate sections and declare separate optional units. Large producers will also be able to declare separate optional units, and the net effect will increase the number of wheat units. This may have a negative effect on FCIC's loss ratio. The provision will also increase the paperwork burden of the already overburdened claims adjuster. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Changes or adjustments to the program should be sensitive to rating adequacy and reduction of excess of loss ratios. Some of the provisions of the program contradict these goals. For instance, analyses by companies and industry trade associations do not support the notion that no additional rate is required for optional units by type. As proposed, optional units by type can only be justified as a marketing tool in some areas of the country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Separate units for winter and spring wheat have been requested by grower groups in Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. FCIC agrees that farmers should have the opportunity to designate initially planted spring and winter wheat as separate optional units because they are planted several months apart and are normally harvested separately. FCIC also agrees that soft white wheat types may be marketed together. However, there are substantial price penalties for commingling production of spring and winter wheat of other types. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FCIC has analyzed types of wheat reported by unit for the states in which both winter and spring types are insured. An average of only 7 percent of all units in these states reported both winter and spring types within the same unit. The majority, or 93 percent of all units, reported only a single type within the unit. These results suggest that most farmers already manage their land in a manner that permits them to put the winter and spring types into separate optional units. This is accomplished by planting the types within different legally defined sections of land. Thus, FCIC believes that the potential for increases in the number of optional units is not substantial. Most farmers who have enough land and who wish to designate separate optional units already do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Farmers who designate separate optional units by type within the same section will forgo the premium discount that is currently allowed if a basic unit is not separated into optional units. Thus, farmers who elect to designate units by type of wheat within the section will pay more premium than a farmer who elects to retain all acreage within a basic unit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments concerning additional paperwork are overstated. Farmers already are required to report separately any acreage planted to the spring and winter types within section because different premium rates, insurance guarantees, or both, apply to such acreage. The only difference in the acreage report under the new provision is that two distinct unit numbers will be used by the insurer rather than one as at present. Farmers will be required to report the production of the two types separately, which they already may do in many cases. FCIC cannot estimate the number of cases in which a new report may be required. The former wheat endorsement required only that insured persons report the total production of all the insurable crop produced on the unit. If a farmer elects to report only total production under the present arrangements, the accuracy of the guarantees for the types is reduced because the insurer must allocate the production in some manner to establish a guarantee by type. If farmers who now report the combined production of the two types within section do designate separate optional units, the change may enhance the precision of guarantees for the separate types, thereby benefiting the insurer. If the farmer already reports production of the two types separately, there will be no change in the paperwork required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Insured persons who wish to take advantage of the opportunity to designate separate optional units within a section must comply with all other requirements for unit division. Thus, if a producer commingles production of the winter and spring types, separate optional units may not be elected. If a producer plants spring wheat into a failed winter stand, separate optional units may not be elected. If planting patterns do not permit separate identification of the acreage, optional units may not be elected. If a producer wishes to reduce the premium paid for the insurance, he or she can elect to retain all the acreage in a basic unit. The new provisions do not mandate separate optional units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, much of the research about units referenced in the comments relates to size of acreage, not specifically to unit division. Results of such research suggests that small farmers should pay higher premiums than large farmers because small acreage may have higher losses on average. Although the issues is related, FCIC believes that the issues should be treated separately. If it is ultimately demonstrated that small acreage should be subject to a surcharge due to actuarial considerations, the surcharge should be assessed against small acreage regardless of whether these result from small farming operations or from unit division. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, FCIC does not find these comments persuasive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One comment took issue with winter wheat vs. spring wheat Transitional Yields (T-yields) and factors in many Pacific Northwest counties. The comment suggested that the uncoupling of winter wheat and spring wheat into separate units be preceded by a major rework of T-yield factors to prevent potential over-payments on spring wheat units. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  FCIC agrees that T-yields should reflect any significant differences in yields. Evaluations will be performed and any necessary changes will be made as soon as practicable. However, those changes will not require a change in this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The last paragraph under section 2. (Unit Division) indicates that optional units not in compliance with the provisions of the section will be combined into the basic unit from which they were formed. A comment suggested that this language be clarified to separate this combination from that which occurs at loss time if production is commingled between optional units. The comment recommended the following language: ``If you do not comply fully with these conditions, we will combine all optional units which are not established in compliance with this section into the basic unit from which they were formed.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  FCIC agrees with the comment and has modified the provision as recommended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 17 May, President Ramiro De Leon Carpio  threatened to suspend the return of Guatemalan refugees from  Mexico, according to the laws that apply to all Guatemalans if  the leaders of the Permanent Commission for Refugees [CCPP]  continue to violate agreements and defy authorities.    If they choose to return to the areas where armed clashes  are  taking place, the Army must be there, and that is why it is  impossible to accept their petitions to withdraw the Army. In  addition, this is not contained within the agreement. If they  do not heed the established legal order, the return of refugees  will be suspended, De Leon categorically stated.    De Leon noted that he is not willing to accept  responsibility  for the refugees' security despite his obligation as  representative of national unity and the state to seek to  maintain the security and peace of Guatemalans.    It so happens, however, that they are coming with  improprieties, demands, and lies because they begin doing this  once they reach Guatemala, in addition to manipulating the  people. Two or three leaders are manipulating the rest of the  refugees, who only want to come and work their lands, and this  is why we must be firm. Either they comply or we suspend their  return, De Leon pointed out.    De Leon said that on the afternoon of 15 May, Mauricio  Rodriguez, dirctor of the Special Commission for Assistance to  Repatriated People, asked him for authorization to suspend the  return, which he agreed to do in light of the official's  judgment and devotion.    He went on to explain that the intransigence displayed by  the  CCPP leaders is regrettable and disappointing because behind it  all there is an entire process by the mediating group, of which  he was a member. The mediation and the support groups  established the mechanisms and stages.    De Leon argued that attitudes like those of the said  leaders,  who even risk the lives of the refugees, show that this  manipulation exists and those who have been close and know in  advance the movements and the elements involved in the return  operation find it undeniable.    De Leon reiterated that all Guatemalans abroad, in  accordance  with the Constitution and government guarantee, are entitled to  return any time. This is also true in light of the agreements  signed in August 1992 and January 1993.    The government is willing to continue with mass and  voluntary  returns, but only if the conditions set are respected. They  cannot claim they will organize their own civilian authority, De  Leon concluded.</p>

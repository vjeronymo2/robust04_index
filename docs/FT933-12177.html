			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (3): The salmon may be coming back THE BARRAGE has to cope with some of the greatest tidal ranges in the world, writes Anthony Moreton. The difference between high and low water in Cardiff can be as much as 14m (about 45ft), putting the city's docks into the same bracket as Bombay and a few other very deep-water ports. The Severn estuary is noted for its salmon. The Usk, which comes out at nearby Newport, and the Wye, which emerges a little further east at Chepstow, where the present M4 motorway bridge crosses the river, are among the finest salmon rivers in Britain. Salmon, though, are not yet an attration in Cardiff's rivers. The Taff, the Ely and the Rhymney, all of which flow into Cardiff Bay, have been far too polluted to attract the salmon, or most other lesser fish. But there is evidence of salmon reappearing, and the 1,100m-long barrage will incorporate the biggest fish pass in Britain. Other features in the barrage include: 800m of sand and rock embankments. Five main sluice gates. Three navigation locks. Three bascule bridges. An outer harbour, requiring 370m of wave-screen breakwater. In addition, the construction experts estimate there will be: 1,700,000 cubic metres of dredging. 1,500,000 cu m of sand fill. 300,000 cu m of rock fill, armour and scour protection. 140,000 cu m of structural concrete. 20,000 tonnes of steel sheet piling. All this adds up to the largest construction project of its kind in the UK this century, according to consulting engineers, Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners.</p>

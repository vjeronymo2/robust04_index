			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Continued growth at Murray Enterprise Murray Enterprise reported a 64 per cent increase in net asset value to 204.96p per share over the six months to March 31. A year earlier the value was 129.6p. The growth reflected a large part of the portfolio being held in dollar assets coupled with strong performances from several investments in the fund, particularly the FleetCall mobile communications company. Net revenue for the half year amounted to Pounds 2,000 (Pounds 29,000) for earnings of 0.03p (0.46p) per share. The actual dividend to be paid from the Pounds 125,000 final declared last September cannot be calculated until it is known how much loan stock will be converted on June 30.</p>

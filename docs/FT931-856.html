			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling boosted by economy STERLING rose more than 2 pfennigs in early morning trading against the D-Mark yesterday, boosted by more good economic indicators in the UK and growing speculation that the Bundesbank might ease interest rates again next week, writes James Blitz. For most of this week, the pound has softened against the D-Mark in spite of the German currency's weaker performance against other European currencies. On Friday morning in Tokyo the pound won back a lot of the ground lost in previous days although it later fell back in the afternoon in London. Sterling closed in London at DM2.4300, a pfennig up on the day. The pound was partly boosted after the Confederation of British Industry reported on Thursday that British manufacturing industry expected to increase output over the next four months following a recovery in order books to their best levels since the summer of 1990. Compounding the pound's rise may have been the perception that Germany may ease interest rates next week. German call money fell yesterday close to the level at which the Bundesbank lends cash to commercial banks, prompting speculation that the crucial repo rate may be cut on Wednesday or Thursday. This way of thinking did not help either the dollar or the French franc against the German currency, however. The dollar again fell back after failing to break through the 30-day moving average against the D-Mark of DM1.6450. It closed at DM1.6305, down more than a pfennig on the day. The French franc also weakened, falling to its ERM floor against the Irish punt and falling nearly a centime against the D-Mark to close at FFr3.405. Despite the fall, some dealers appear to have been surprised that the franc did not come under more pressure in a week that saw the German repo rate unchanged, the Belgian government falling and the onset of the second round of the French National assembly elections. Mr Mark Brett of Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London said: 'ERM tensions do appear to be evaporating and forex traders are no longer taking short franc positions for weeks at a time,' he said. Mr Christopher Potts of Banque Indosuez in Paris, believes the new French government may be able to hold the franc initially. 'But the danger,' he says, 'is that interest rates can't be pushed down significantly in the next two months.' He believes the new French administration will take advantage of a wave of goodwill to instigate a cut in interest rates in the next two weeks.</p>

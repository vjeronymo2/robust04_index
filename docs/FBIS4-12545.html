			<p>BFN     [Text] On the second day of his visit to Pakistan, Mr.  Nateq-Nuri, speaker of the Islamic Consultative Majles, today  addressed the Pakistani National Assembly on the issues facing  the Islamic world. He described the all-encompassing cultural  and propaganda onslaught of the West against Islam and the  West's double standards toward the world of Islam as a warning,  indicative of the policy of confronting and attacking Islam. He  stressed: In today's world, the message of Islamic countries is  that they should defend the revivalist movement of Islam and  never bow to the pressures and political and nonpolitical  propaganda of the world of blasphemy.    Mr. Nateq-Nuri also announced the Islamic Republic of Iran's  support for any proposal that encompasses the rights of the  Kashmiri people.</p>

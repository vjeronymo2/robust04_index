			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FADED STAR;  </P> <P> PRESERVATIONISTS AND DISNEY IN TUG OF WAR OVER THE EL CAPITAN  </P> <P> Hillsman Wright was exploring the attic of the former 1920s-era El Capitan  Theater on Hollywood Boulevard one afternoon last fall when he happened across  a hole in the floor. Flashlight in hand, Wright lowered himself into a cramped  cavern suspended high above the orchestra pit.  </P> <P> Balancing himself on struts and support wires, Wright aimed the light at an  arch of ornate plaster sandwiched between the attic and the suspended ceiling  below. His discovery was a preservationist's dream come true.  </P> <P> "It was clear that this theater was imminently restorable," Wright said of the  decorative East Indian-style auditorium, which had featured live performances  by such Hollywood stars as Clark Gable and Rita Hayworth before being converted  into a television studio and later a movie theater.  </P> <P> But what was obvious to Wright, president of the Los Angeles Historic Theater  Foundation, was far less evident to his hosts that day, officials of the  distribution arm of the Walt Disney Co.  </P> <P> Buena Vista Pictures Distribution Co. and Pacific Theaters Corp., which leases  the building from the landowner, had invited Wright to the 65-year-old theater  to show him their plans for an upbeat Art Deco-style flagship for new Disney  movie releases. The opening would be the premiere of the much ballyhooed "Dick  Tracy" in June.  </P> <P> The plans left no room for a restored auditorium, which Disney has said needs  to be "more fun" and "more entertaining" than its intricate cast-plaster  patterns and columns. The building's unusual exterior would be preserved, but  the 1,500-seat auditorium would be broken into two theaters, with the original  design -- including the massive arch stretching above the stage -- buried  beneath a streamlined gypsum-board facade.  </P> <P> Wright is not alone in his love for the original designs of San Francisco  architect G. Albert Lansburgh. A small group of preservationists and community  activists want to see the El Capitan restored in its entirety.  </P> <P> But Disney is irritated by the criticism, according to sources, and last week  company officials let it be known that they may walk away from their El Capitan  plans because of the resistance they have encountered. Meanwhile, the project  could be stalled by questions raised by the city's Cultural Heritage  Commission, which is to decide this week whether the proposed make-over  conforms to federal restoration standards.  </P> <P> Disney's interest in languishing Hollywood Boulevard has had boosters of the  once-glorious cinema capital grinning from ear to ear. City officials have  struggled for years to re-establish the boulevard as the world's premier center  for movie palaces, and they see Disney as their ticket to Tomorrowland.  </P> <P> Now, the prospect of Disney giving up on its Hollywood plans has set off a  flurry of activity at City Hall to persuade the company to stay. Councilman  Michael Woo, who represents Hollywood, has assured both Pacific and Disney that  they are welcome. The Community Redevelopment Agency, which oversees  development along Hollywood Boulevard, has done the same.  </P> <P> Woo said last week, "I think we need to send a very clear signal that we  welcome the return of refurbished movie theaters to Hollywood," he said.  </P> <P> Disney's critics, however, complain that Hollywood deserves more than a  partially restored theater from a company that has built an entire theme park  in Florida around a re-creation of historic Hollywood Boulevard.  </P> <P> "They have been stealing Hollywood's architecture and history, and making  millions off of it in Florida, but when it comes to the real Hollywood, they  are trying to cover it up," said Robert Nudelman, a theater buff who heads a  Hollywood group concerned about renewal.  </P> <P> Opposition to the renovation plans has already caused so many delays that  Disney has abandoned any hope of holding the "Dick Tracy" premiere in  Hollywood. Several weeks ago, the company suspended work on the theater's  inside, where crews were removing layers of plaster and paneling that had been  tacked to walls and ceilings over the past 50 years.  </P> <P> Although Disney officials are hopeful the problems can be worked out, Richard  Cook, president of Buena Vista, said they are reassessing their interest in the  Hollywood project. "We are considering everything."  </P> <P> The city's Cultural Heritage Commission has the power to delay the project for  up to a year with City Council concurrence. After one year, the commission  loses authority over the project.  </P> <P> The El Capitan, known as the Paramount when Pacific Theaters closed it last  fall, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. At a recent  meeting, the city commission recommended that it be designated a city landmark.  This Wednesday, the commission is expected to decide whether covering the  auditorium's original walls and ceiling would violate standards that govern  historic buildings.  </P> <P> The commission's staff architect, Jay Oren, has expressed reservations about  the appropriateness of the auditorium renovation in light of preservation  standards.  </P> <P> "The commission has no intention of pushing Disney out of Hollywood,"  commission President Amarjit S. Marwah said. "But the commission has the  intention of requiring Disney to preserve the architectural features of any  building they deal with."  </P> <P> The three major preservation groups that deal with historic issues in Hollywood  have closed ranks and agreed not to actively oppose the Disney plan, even  though each of them has been highly critical of it and some members continue to  deride it privately. One source, who asked not to be identified, said the  groups do not want to bear the burden of having chased Disney out of Hollywood,  no matter how strong their objections to the proposed renovation.  </P> <P> Several weeks ago, representatives from Disney, Pacific, Woo's office and the  Community Redevelopment Agency met with the three preservation groups in an  effort to work out their differences. In the spirit of compromise, Disney  agreed to restore various parts of the theater, including a basement lobby and  the ceiling in the main lobby. The preservation groups, in turn, agreed to keep  quiet about their objections.  </P> <P> But Nudelman, the local theater buff, has refused to honor the deal. And the  community group he heads, the Hollywood Project Area Committee, has supported  him.  </P> <P> Nudelman went to the meeting of the Cultural Heritage Commission two weeks ago  armed with photographs of El Capitan's original interior and a resolution  demanding that the auditorium be restored. Meanwhile, members of the  preservation groups struggled to explain to the commission their position on  the project.  </P> <P> "Some people are looking at this and saying, 'Well it could be worse, we are  getting some things,' " Nudelman said. "What kind of example are we setting  here? What will happen to the rest of the theaters on the boulevard?"  </P></p>

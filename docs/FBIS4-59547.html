			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, the  House of Representatives speaker, today held a news conference  attended by local, Arab, and foreign correspondents.    In this news conference, which was held at the House of  Representatives, the brother House speaker explained that his  recent visit to fraternal Saudi Arabia was a normal visit that  falls within the framework of the understanding and ties between  the two fraternal countries. These ties, he said, are eternal  and strong. We must all exchange views on issues that are of  interest to the region. He added: The visit also aimed at  explaining developments to the brothers in Saudi Arabia. We  found that Saudi Arabia and the other fraternal Arab states  support legitimacy.    Asked if the House decision to remove al-Bid's legitimacy  and  suspend [Prime Minister] al-'Attas came late and if it should  have been taken at the start of the crisis, Shaykh al-Ahmar  said: As regards 'Ali Salim, he does not enjoy legitimacy  because he did not take the oath before the House of  Representatives. He defied the House. The House took the  appropriate Constitutional decision. As regards Haydar  al-'Attas, he was given the vote of confidence to implement the  government statement. He asked for a period of few months to  implement the statement. He, however, did not fulfill his  promise and continued to procrastinate, after the House made  several requests to him and after his government failed to  implement what it pledged. As for the delay, it stemmed from  the House's concern to contain the crisis fabricated by 'Ali  Salim and his gang. All the forces continued to work to contain  it, but he continued to escalate the crisis to the level of a  military explosion and then the House had to take that position.    The House speaker added: Within that context, and after the  rebels ignited the war, the House position is supportive of the  head of state and the supreme commander of the Armed Forces and  the forces of the people, which are the forces of legitimacy.  This is natural in such circumstances.    He noted that the formation of a new government is a  prerogative of the Presidential Council chairman.</p>

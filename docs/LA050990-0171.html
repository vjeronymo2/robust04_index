			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JURY DECIDES IN BORG'S FAVOR  </P> <P> Hours after Bjorn Borg stormed out of a courtroom, a nine-member jury decided  he had been defamed by a magazine that published allegations the former tennis  star had used drugs.  </P> <P> The jury's finding Tuesday, however, is not binding.  </P> <P> The three judges will deliver the formal verdict on Monday.  </P> <P> Borg sued Z, a weekly magazine, for $58,000 for printing allegations by his  former girlfriend, Jannicke Bjorling, that he used drugs.  </P> <P> Borg, a five-time Wimbledon champion, left the courthouse in a fury after the  presiding judge denied his attorney's request to call an unlisted witness.  "This is enough for me. I'm leaving," Borg said. He rushed past reporters and  called out, "I do not care what you write."  </P> <P> On Monday, Borg denied in court that he ever used drugs. His lawyer argued that  the magazine knew Bjorling was in a bitter custody dispute with Borg over their  son and should not have printed her unsubstantiated allegations.  </P> <P> Z's chief editor, Jorgen Widsell, told the court he had three sources saying  Borg had used cocaine.  </P></p>

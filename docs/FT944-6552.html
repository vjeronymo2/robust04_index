			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Bakery worker wins Pounds 27,500 settlement in asthma case A bakery worker has received Pounds 27,500 in an out-of-court settlement with his employer after saying inhalation of flour dust gave him asthma. The settlement was announced yesterday as the Health and Safety Executive announced research showing that people who inhaled chemical and natural irritants at work could become life-long asthma victims. Mr Roger Atley of Shawfield, Glasgow, worked for the Rutherglen plant of Greggs, the Newcastle upon Tyne-based bakery chain. The settlement was reached without any admission of liability by Greggs. The HSE said the case would make employers realise the importance of heeding warnings about the risks of asthma at work. Mr Atley's union, Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, said it believed the case would 'alert a lot of people who feel that they have been damaged by inhaling whatever it might be' to file similar suits. Robin Thompson and Partners, Mr Atley's solicitors, said they were already taking legal action on behalf of other bakery workers who said they had contracted asthma in similar circumstances. Usdaw said it hoped one of those cases would proceed to court and set a Mr Atley, who still suffers from breathlessness, has been moved to a part of the bakery where he has no contact with flour dust. The HSE's research, jointly funded by the National Asthma Campaign, finds that increased workplace exposure to such irritants is the most important factor in provoking occupational asthma. Previously, researchers had concentrated on the predisposition of an individual towards allergic reactions, rather than the intensity of exposure to the irritants, said Professor Anthony Newman Taylor, of Royal Brompton Hospital, who carried out the research. Professor Newman Taylor said that although the risk of asthma was primarily affected by the intensity of exposure to occupational irritants, smokers and those predisposed to developing allergies were at a higher risk of contracting the disease. More than 200 causes of occupational asthma have been identified, and Professor Newman Taylor estimates that between 1,500 and 2,000 new cases arise each year. Along with flour dust, he said, substances used in the manufacture of paint and plastics, urine from laboratory animals, solvents, grain dust, vehicle sprays and glues were among the irritants that could cause asthma. Mr Murray Devine, a senior HSE health policy official, said employers should install better air extraction systems, enclose the processes that expose workers to irritants and provide protective equipment such as masks.

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / South-east jobless rate above 10% MORE than one in 10 of the workforce in the south-east of England was unemployed in November, highlighting the destructive force of the recession in Britain's most important economic region. The Department of Employment reported yesterday that the number of unemployment benefit claimants in the south-east increased by 17,700 to a seasonally adjusted 916,800 last month, taking the region's jobless rate to a record high of 10.1 per cent from 9.9 per cent in October. The south-east's unemployment rate in November was nearly three times the 3.6 per cent for the region in early 1990. In Greater London alone, unemployment rose to 11.3 per cent in November from 11.2 per cent in October, making the capital the third worst region for unemployment in the UK after Northern Ireland and the north. November's 41,100 jump to 2.9m in UK seasonally adjusted unemployment was the 31st consecutive monthly rise in the claimant count since the spring of 1990, bringing unemployment to its highest level since April 1987. Since early 1990 - when unemployment bottomed out - registered unemployment in the UK has risen by more than 1.31m, lifting the national unemployment rate to 10.3 per cent last month. Total unadjusted unemployment was 10.1 per cent or 2,864,069 in November, up 49,657 on October's level. Yesterday's jobless figures gave only a partial picture of the shakeout in the labour market since the start of the recession. Employment department figures showed that the UK workforce in employment fell to 24.95m in the third quarter of this year, nearly 2m down from its 26.92m peak in the second quarter of 1990. According to the department's labour force survey, also published yesterday, the percentage of the UK population over 16 that is economically active fell to 63.1 per cent in the summer from 64.3 per cent in the spring of 1990. The latest statistics suggest the labour market shakeout will continue for some time. The November jump in unemployment was higher than the 35,000 increase generally expected in the City and above the latest six and three-month averages of 32,200 and 32,600 respectively. The 399,000 fall in the UK workforce in the third quarter was the highest on record. The inflow of claimants at job centres has also been running at a higher monthly rate in the second half of this year than in the first half. The stock of unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres rose 2,600 to a seasonally-adjusted 100,800 last month, but there were about 20,000 fewer vacancies than in the first quarter of the year. The latest UK figures show a big difference in unemployment rates between males - where seasonally adjusted unemployment set a post-second-world-war high of 13.8 per cent in November - and females, where the UK unemployment rate was 5.6 per cent. A notable feature of the year to October was the steep 241,000 drop in manufacturing employment. The latest figures also show that 233,000 service industry jobs were lost in the third quarter alone.</p>

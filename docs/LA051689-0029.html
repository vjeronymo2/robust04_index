			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Leading British actors who waged an emotional campaign in London over the  weekend to save the excavated site of the 16th-Century Rose Theatre, where  Shakespeare may have performed, got good news Monday. The British government  temporarily stopped construction of an office tower over the site, and  Environment Secretary Nicholas Ridley told Parliament the dumping of sand and  gravel over the remains of the open-air theater would be delayed for at least a  month. This will enable architects and conservationists to discuss how to  preserve the theater. Developers agreed to negotiations after the actors --  including Ian McKellen, Dame Peggy Ashcroft, James Fox and Sir Laurence Olivier  -- took center stage in efforts to rescue the historic site where Shakespeare  is thought to have made his debut as an actor in 1592 and to have acted in his  own play, "Henry VI." The Rose was built in 1587. Plays were last performed  there in 1603. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

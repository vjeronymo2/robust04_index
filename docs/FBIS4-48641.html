			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cas St Leger] </F>   [Text] New Health Minister Dr Nkosazana Zuma backs freedom  of choice on issues ranging from abortion to patients preferring  private hospitals. She was party to the ANC National Health  Plan released this week, which promotes the liberation of  abortion laws.    However, Dr Zuma says: "Any law should respect the right of  people not to have a termination of pregnancy if they do not  believe in it.    "Health workers should not be made to perform that  termination if it is against their morals and religious beliefs.    "People feel it may be un-Christian. As a Christian, I find  it difficult to be judgmental of women wanting a termination.    "That is something they have to sort out with their God. It  is not for me, as a doctor, to judge them."    Dr Zuma moved into her slightly shabby ministerial suite  high  in the Civitas Building in Pretoria on Monday. Brightening the  meagre decorations were the South African flag and a bouquet of  flowers sent by the dean of the University of Pretoria.    Already immersed in a formidable schedule and en route to  Cape Town for the opening of Parliament, Dr Zuma paused for a  second to wonder about the fate of the flowers. "I was  touched," she said.    Dr Zuma's first task will be to guide the National Health  System [NHS], which will unify South Africa's fragmented health  services, through Parliament. She intends retaining and  supporting the valuable parts of the old health service -- like  research and academic hospitals -- and rebuild the entire health  edifice around primary health care.    "I don't want the impression created that once we go the  primary health care way, academic medicine and research goes out  of the window," said Dr Zuma.    "I see both primary health care and academic medicine as  essential to the health service."    While there would have to be "some rationalisation," Dr Zuma  said she believed anxieties that academics would become poor  relations in the new health service were unfounded. Dr Zuma's  priority will be the well-being of South Africa's children.    Everything else -- from streamlining inefficient provincial  hospitals, to nudging the private sector to co-operate, to  setting up free medial care for those who need it and  establishing a primary health care network -- will follow.    She intends the changes -- at least in child care, with free  medical services for under-sixes -- to be visible by the end of  this year, depending on legislation. "Children are the first  priority. If you have a nation of stunted, malnourished  individuals, children whose brains have not grown to their full  potential, then you can't hope to have a nation that will be  prosperous and able to compete with the rest of the world ..."    If this mother and professional woman has one pang about her  new post, it is that she has had to leave her four children and  one step-child, aged between five and 12, behind in Durban.    She is confident the money for restructuring health services  -- about R[Rand]2-billion or 14 percent of the Budget -- will be  found.    "Unless we're saying that the changes taking place should  only be meaningful for me as a minister and not for anybody  else, then we have to find the money. The restructuring has to  happen."    Maritzburg-born Dr Zuma, 45, was raised at Pholela in  Zululand. She matriculated from Adam's Mission in Amanzimtoti  and went on to study at Durban's medical school. In exile with  her husband, ANC deputy secretary-general Jacob Zuma, she  completed her MB [Bachelor of Medicine] ChB [Bachelor of  Surgery] degree at Bristol University and received a diploma in  tropical child health from the University of Liverpool.    She then worked at the Mbabane Government Hospital in  Swaziland and at the ANC health department in Lusaka before  joining the Medical Research Council in Natal in 1991 to  research AIDS and maternal and child health.    Academic hospitals -- now called academic complexes to  include their teaching function -- are regarded as national  resources. They will fall directly under the NHS, rather than  under provinces. "They should be seen as national assets shared  across provinces," Dr Zuma said.    One possible way of streamling services would be for  specialised operations like heart transplants to take place in  one centre.</p>

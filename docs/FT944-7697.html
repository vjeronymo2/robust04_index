			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rise in commodities prices dismissed as short-term rally A senior World Bank economist yesterday dismissed the view that commodities, which have seen huge price increases this year, could prove to be a long-term investment on a par with equities. Mr Donald Mitchell, senior economist at the bank's commodities unit, told a conference in London that the rally was a short-term reaction to a plunge in prices over the past decade and not the start of a 'major uptrend'. 'Commodities are not a buy-and-hold type of investment,' he said. 'You can make huge amounts of money by speculating. But you have to have a view and understand the markets. 'Commodities primarily belong to the hedgers and speculators, not to the investors.' Commodities are strongly in favour this year as a way of diversifying investment portfolios out of poorly performing equities and bonds. Funds specialising in commodities have been launched on the back of increases such as a tripling in coffee prices and a rise of more than 50 per cent in aluminium, copper and cotton. But Mr Mitchell pointed out that if commodities turned out to be an asset class in their own right, worth holding for the long-term, 'it would defy 100 years of history'. A sustained increase in prices over more than two or three years would require a shift in wealth to the developing world, and a consequent surge in demand for commodities, similar to the oil price boom of the 1970s, he argued. But circumstances had changed. The Soviet Union, a large importer of commodities in the 1970s, no longer existed; Opec countries had financial problems preventing them from expanding imports; and China had shifted from being a major importer of grain to being a net exporter. Rapid growth in some developing countries was no longer accompanied by an equivalent increase in imports. He said, however, that commodity price movements appeared to offer investors a negative correlation with interest rates, which 'may be useful'. He also felt that metal and mineral prices had some way to rise, while agricultural commodities had 'by and large had their boom.' Other speakers were more upbeat about the potential for commodities at the conference, which was organised by Futures and Options World, a publishing company, and Rostron Perry, a public relations company focusing on derivatives, and sponsored by Reuters. Mr Neil Bresolin, an executive director of Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, said commodity investors were at, or close to, the middle of a bull market. Metals in particular should benefit from rapid growth in industrial production still to come in the US and Europe. 'There's a high positive correlation between commodity prices and industrial expansion,' he said. 'You can get direct exposure and participation in global growth (by investing in commodities). It's also an insurance against unexpected events.' Mr Roy Leighton, chairman of Credit Lyonnais Rouse, the French banking group's commodity derivatives arm, argued that over-the-counter instruments such as swaps and index warrants offered advantages to 'fundamental' portfolio managers. They provided opportunities to invest in commodities such as jet fuel, which could be highly sensitive to events in the Gulf but was not yet quoted on a futures exchange. They were flexible and allowed trade to take place further forward than in futures markets. 'Provided you have a reliable counter-party, these markets can be quite safe,' he said.</p>

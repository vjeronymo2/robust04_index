			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Under Secretary Livio Caputo by </F> Riccardo Orizio; place and date not given: "The Foreign  Ministry Is Opposed to Maneuvers: `We Are Still in the Race for  Important Posts'"]    [Text] "I rule out the possibility that a `sharing-out'  agreement has been reached, and that Italy has been excluded  from it. Rather, the truth is that talks are still under way  and are unlikely to reach a conclusion before the Corfu European  summit in June. The Italian Government is determined to ensure  that the agreement does not take only a few countries into  account, but all of them. As a matter of fact, over the last  few days we have been considering some very authoritative  candidacies on our part, and we are in the process of  establishing contacts with a number of European partners, which  are not necessarily those mentioned by THE GUARDIAN (i.e.,  France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and  Portugal -- CORRIERE DELLA SERA editor's note)."    Forza Italia Senator Livio Caputo, who is the foreign under  secretary in charge of European and security affairs, is  currently in Cairo attending the conference of nonaligned  countries. However, he has not lost sight of Brussels and the  complex negotiations concerning the international organizations'  key posts.    [Orizio] Is it not true that the game is over?    [Caputo] No, there is still plenty of time and room for  Italy. We have been hampered by the fact that the long  government crisis prevented us from concentrating on the  negotiations right from their initial stages, but we are still  in time to join. The prime minister's office is examining the  candidacies that we intend to submit.    [Orizio] What institutions is Italy aiming for?    [Caputo] Three in particular: OECD, GATT, and NATO.    [Caputo] Of these three objectives, how many will we  actually  achieve?    [Orizio] It may prove difficult to achieve all three, but we  will submit a sufficiently broad range of candidates not to be  excluded from the final agreement. In the end, we will have the  right man for the right job.    [Orizio] Former Minister Renato Ruggiero is being mentioned  as a possible candidate for one of the great European  institutions. Is this correct?    [Caputo] It is not appropriate to mention any names at this  stage.    [Orizio] As far as NATO is concerned, THE GUARDIAN is saying  that an agreement has already been reached on the name of  outgoing Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers.    [Caputo] NATO is not solely a European institution.  Americans have traditionally exercised a strong influence on  the choice of the secretary general, and I do not believe that  they will cease doing so in the future. When it comes to  choosing somebody, therefore, I would not be surprised if an  outsider wins the race in the end.    [Orizio] Belgian Prime Minister Dehaene is being mentioned  as  Delors' successor at the European Commission. Does Italy agree  with this?    [Caputo] It is no mystery that France and Germany are  pressing for Dehaene's appointment. However, there are other  candidates, too: for example, Irishman Peter Sutherland (former  EC commissioner and outgoing GATT secretary general -- CORRIERE  DELLA SERA editor's note).    [Orizio] However, should the fact that THE GUARDIAN is  predicting Italy's complete exclusion from this European  distribution of posts not be regarded as a further indication of  our country's international isolation?    [Caputo] No. THE GUARDIAN is a newspaper which often runs  ahead of events, and, in any case, it does not represent the  views of the British Government, from which in fact it is rather  far removed. Several European countries taking part in the  negotiations have unambiguously expressed their friendship and  appreciation for us, and our government's composition will not  be an obstacle to the negotiations' success.</p>

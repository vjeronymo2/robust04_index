			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary from the "Observer" column by Mirko Lauder: </F> "Tremors on the Lima Fault"]    [Text] Whether it is with 44 percent (in the poll by Apoyo  Inc.) or 47 percent (in the poll by M&amp;O) of Lima voters'  preferences, the popularity of Javier Perez de Cuellar is  beginning to cause a certain degree of perplexity, and not  because he might not deserve such percentages, but rather  because these figures might reveal something more than simple  support for his political figure. Perez de Cuellar appears to  embody a growing search for an alternative to Alberto Fujimori.    Yet underneath Perez de Cuellar's growing electoral  popularity other things are happening. The most important are  perhaps the simultaneous appearances in the M&amp;O poll of  Fernando  Belaunde, with 16 percent, and Alfonso Barrantes, with 10  percent of voters' preferences, while between 29 and 31 percent  of those polled preferred to remain undecided rather than voice  support for Fujimori.    Some clear conclusions may be drawn from the latest polls,  especially from that of M&amp;O and earlier ones conducted by  Imasen. The first is that party figures have improved their  standings, but not to the point of being perceived as  alternatives. Yet no one should minimize the 16 percent obtained  by Belaunde, simply through hard work, province meetings, and  statements, with very few televised appearances.    Another lesson is that in a clean election, Javier Perez de  Cuellar -- if he wants to -- would be the next president. The  preference of voters in Lima has gone beyond rational estimates,  and to this extent it has eroded the argument that his  popularity could collapse during a hectic electoral campaign.  We are entering ground similar to that held by Fujimori in  1990, or to that of the no-vote in 1993.    Another evident lesson is that Fujimori continues to lose in  Lima, which has been his stronghold, and therefore he would also  be losing his position as leader in the first round in 1995.  Some people claim that Fujimori expected this loss, and that it  will be compensated for through votes that will be recovered in  key provinces. Yet these provinces still appear to be mobilized  against him rather than for him.    The unusual sight of leading foreign and domestic  businessmen  trading their own as well as state assets is not exciting  Peruvian voters. On the contrary, it appears that such trade is  perceived only as something that is happening while jobs and  salaries continue to decline. No one is associating the  expression "social expenses" with the word "job."    Going back to the polls, it is no longer surprising to note  that while Fujimori maintains his popularity, the voters'  preference for him has declined. The people want Fujimori to  reach 1995, but not 1996. The fact of the matter is that now  that the elections are 12 months away, the figures that count  now are those concerning voters preferences, not popularity  rates.    In other words the electoral campaign is, already in its  initial stage, worsening the power vacuum that forced Fujimori  into military tutelage. Someone might say that we have already  had a military coup. The fear persists, however, that Fujimori  may want to use the force of arms to compensate for his loss of  popular support. Thirteen days before the second anniversary of  the Fujimori-Hermoza coup, this thought can only be worrisome.</p>

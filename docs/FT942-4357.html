			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Broadcast unions at the pain threshold: Rapid changes at the BBC have left staff mistrustful of management As strikes go, yesterday's second 24-hour stoppage at the BBC seemed good-natured. 'Please don't break our strike,' said the senior radio journalist politely to the few people making their way past the pickets through the heavy doors of Broadcasting House in central London. Yet the journalists and other broadcasting staff felt strongly enough about management proposals to introduce performance pay and decentralised negotiations on some aspects of terms and conditions that they left their posts on the day of voting in the European elections and in five by-elections - a day that could define the future of Mr John Major, the prime minister. The dispute - which is ostensibly about the nitty-gritty details of performance pay and the exact nature of what can be negotiated at divisional level - is fuelled by more than three years of rapid change and pain at the BBC. Last year 1,500 jobs were lost in the resource departments, which provide everything from studios to editing. A further 700 will go this year, partly a result of the move towards the target of having 25 per cent of BBC output produced by independent companies. Working relationships have been altered radically by Producer Choice, the system that allows producers to buy in services from the open market. It is a dispute marked by the staff's lack of trust in middle management. Ironically Mr John Birt, the BBC director-general, appears sympathetic and has said in public that his next task at the BBC is to do something about a middle-management structure which he believes is too hierarchical and rigid. Yet last night all the signs were that the two sides were digging in on matters of principle, with senior management making it clear that concessions offered in talks last week - such as accepting that everyone will receive the negotiated standard pay increase each year - represented the final offer. Mr Bob Phillis, BBC deputy director-general, said last night: 'Unless we have some element of pay which reflects performance, how on earth can we retain, attract and reward high-quality staff?' Mr Phillis said he would have preferred the management's final package - offered after negotiations at Acas, the conciliation service, last week - to have been put to union members in a ballot. The unions are taking action under a strike ballot held on the management's original proposals. Officials of the National Union of Journalists and Bectu, the main technical union at the BBC, said yesterday that they had presented the BBC's revised proposals honestly to their members at meetings. Ms Christina Driver, national industrial officer at the BBC for Bectu, said yesterday: 'We told the members we had not got what they wanted and no significant gains had been made, but that there had been some movement. The members were very strongly against acceptance of the offer.' The union meetings - attended by about half the staff - rejected any suggestion that the BBC offer should be put to a postal ballot because they felt it would take too long and weaken momentum in the dispute. Only about 40 per cent of members in either Bectu or the NUJ voted for strike action in the initial postal ballots. Bectu members voted 61.3 per cent in favour of stoppages. Support among NUJ members was 79.3 per cent. The unions accept that the management did make some concessions in the four days of talks at Acas to try to reassure staff about future conditions of service, but they believe these did not go far enough to calm fears. Ms Driver said: 'There is a crisis of morale among staff. It comes down to a question of trust. They do not believe line managers will schedule their work humanely without the protection of clear national agreements with the unions.' The unions want a national agreement on conditions of service to protect working time and compensation payments for breaches of it. BBC staff also oppose the corporation's plan to give line managers wider discretion in deciding the implementation of performance pay for individuals with no appeals procedure available, except for those facing possible pay cuts. The unions want every job to have an identifiable pay rate attached to it, conditional on a 'fully competent' work performance. The new system would also end annual increments for staff and national wage deals. Ms Driver said: 'We believe this is a recipe for unfair and discriminatory treatment. It will not deliver equal pay for work of equal value.' The BBC believes its proposals will make the corporation more competitive so it will be able to pay more competitive salaries as an integral part of the modernising programme. It is seen as ironic that industrial action taking programmes off the screens is coming when the most painful period of change is over and when the corporation is about to announce higher-than-expected savings of Pounds 125m this year - money that will be spent on programmes. But as the top BBC management prepare today to take their case to staff throughout the corporation, union feelings are running high. The NUJ says as many as 600 BBC staff have joined or rejoined the union during the dispute.</p>

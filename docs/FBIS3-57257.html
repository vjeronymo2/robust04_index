The Azerbaijani mission  in Moscow told Interfax today that the information was "not true  to life." The mission also dismissed the reports about a  large-scale offensive launched by Armenian forces.    At the same time, the press service of the Nagorno-Karabakh  army confirmed to Interfax that the jet was shot down saying  that its leftovers had been found. A special group left for the  place where the jet fell into the ground to look for the pilot  or his body and verify the type of aircraft. According to  preliminary information, it was an assault plane Sukhoi-25.    The press service said that two Azerbaijani jets trespassed  the air border of Nagorno-Karabakh again at 13:30 today.  According to preliminary information, one of the jets dropped  several bombs near Stepanakert. The effects of the bombing are  being verified.    According to sources in Stepanakert, fighting continued on a  number of sections of the front line today. Nagorno-Karabakh  forces repelled Azerbaijani attacks between the district centers  of Askeran and Agdam and in the north of the Martuni district of  Azerbaijan. Having lost 1 tank and up to 15 troops, Azerbaijani  units had to retreat to their positions. Several  Nagorno-Karabakh servicemen were wounded, according to the press  service.</p>

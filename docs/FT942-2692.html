			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (16): Group C - Bolivia Bolivia may one day win the World Cup, but first they will have to persuade Fifa to host the tournament in La Paz. High up in the thin air of the Andes, the Bolivians are almost invincible. They won all five World Cup qualifiers there including a 2-0 victory over Brazil, the first time a Brazilian side had been beaten in the qualifying rounds of the World Cup. But at sea level the Bolivians are at best average and at their worst easy prey for the best sides. In Brazil they were thrashed 6-0 by the sea in Recife. Even with the thin air advantage this was the first time Bolivia have come through the qualification rounds. In the 1930 and 1950 World Cups they qualified automatically, but did not do well: three defeats, no goals scored and 16 conceded. They face Germany in the opening match of the tournament. A heavy defeat there could destroy their confidence, built up so well by Spanish coach Xavier Azkargorta. Six of the Bolivian squad, including Bolivia's best player, Marco Etcheverry (Colo Colo), are graduates of one of sport's strangest institutions: the Tahuichi Academy. It was formed 15 years ago to take the poor children off the streets of Santa Cruz and has become world famous for the skilful footballers it has produced. Etcheverry is struggling with an injury. Without him Bolivia's warm-up results were mixed. The Bolivians will find it tough to go far in the World Cup, but at least they will be able to drink America's favourite drink. The head of the Bolivian federation banned the players from drinking Coca Cola fearing dope tests would be positive. He later relented.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Reorganisation costs behind decline to Pounds 3.33m at CI Group CI GROUP, which is rational-ising and reappraising strategy after growing rapidly in the 1980s, yesterday announced a decline in profits because of the recession. Pre-tax profits in the year to January 31 fell from Pounds 3.75m to Pounds 3.33m. This followed profits of Pounds 1.69m at the interim stage. Mr Patrick McTighe, who became chairman last October, said CI had disposed of its loss-making capital goods businesses, leading to an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.67m. Labour had been cut 9 per cent and a review of activities was continuing, with attention focused on the core steel and engineering divisions. Turnover fell to Pounds 75.5m (Pounds 93.7m), reflecting disposals and recession. Sales within the steel reinforcement and re-rolling divisions were worst affected, falling 22 per cent and 16 per cent respectively, but the flooring side limited the fall in turnover to 6 per cent, reflecting resilient industrial sales. Earnings fell to 2.65p (2.83p). The final dividend is 1.225p to hold the total at 2.05p. A net cash inflow of Pounds 1.5m reduced borrowings to Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 6.4m) and led to a lower debt/equity ratio of 34 per cent (40 per cent). Interest costs dropped to Pounds 1.16m (Pounds 1.81m). COMMENT CI's declining borrowings, new management and rationalisations highlight its attractions as a recovery play. But yesterday's 21 per cent rise to 28p in the share price was due to relief about the dividend rather than confidence that the company is well set for upturn. This year should see the benefits of cost cuttings and a lower interest charge. But exposure to the depressed construction industry via its steel reinforcement and commercial flooring operations suggest CI may lag, even if its early cycle businesses exceed expectations. Forecast profits for this year of Pounds 3m to Pounds 3.5m put the shares on about 10 times earnings with a 9 per cent yield. With the company's strategy review yet to be completed, and more disposals possible, uncertainty may keep a lid on the share price a little longer.</p>

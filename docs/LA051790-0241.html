			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'KING' TO CLOSE EARLY IN LONDON; PUBLICITY BLAMED  </P> <P> A $5-million London stage musical about assassinated black civil rights leader  Martin Luther King Jr. is to close on June 2 after only six weeks, its  producers said today.  </P> <P> They blamed damaging reviews and publicity about problems affecting "King"  before it opened.  </P> <P> The show started its run in London's West End almost three weeks late.  </P> <P> King's widow, Coretta, endorsed the production in March after earlier  complaining that the music trivialized her husband's memory and threatening  legal action to try to stop it.  </P> <P> The producers claimed that the production was receiving nightly ovations but  had taken only $170,000 in advance bookings.  </P> <P> Daily Mail critic Jack Tinker said "King" had taken an exciting subject and  "driven it into the ground under the weight of good intent."  </P></p>

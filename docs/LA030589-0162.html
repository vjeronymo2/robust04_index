			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BRIEFS: STYLES AND REVIEW  </P> <P> To review or not to review . . . that's one of the questions facing residents  in Beverly Hills, where many houses either are being extensively remodeled or  torn down to make way for newer, larger homes.  </P> <P> Under a proposed zoning code, the approval of an architectural review board  would be required for any "flat front" design, presumably because such designs  look more bulky from the street than designs that have part of the house set  back farther from the street.  </P> <P> At a packed council meeting, Tricia Moore said that establishing a review board  would discourage "traditional styles of architecture that have been around for  centuries: Cape Cod, French Provincial. . . . There is a whole category of  architecture that's being removed from the city."  </P> <P> She emphasized that she was speaking as an individual, not in her capacity as  executive vice president of the Beverly Hills Board of Realtors.  </P> <P> The City Council decided to calm the fears of those who favor traditional  exteriors by asking planners to write guidelines for Colonial-style houses or  others with flat facades to be built without review board approval.

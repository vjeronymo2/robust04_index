			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / US raises pressure on Baghdad THE US yesterday stepped up pressure on Iraq by warning that it could not rule out the use of military force if Baghdad continued to defy a team of United Nations weapons inspectors. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, said the US was 'increasingly concerned' by Iraq's continuing defiance of the UN, and said Baghdad must be held accountable for 'stonewalling UN inspectors who are trying to identify and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction'. US officials have grown increasingly frustrated at President Saddam Hussein's testing of the UN's determination to enforce the Gulf war ceasefire resolutions. The US and its allies have repeatedly threatened military action in the past, usually forcing Iraq to back down at the last minute. Mr Fitzwater acknowledged that the US had issued similar warnings, but said the current stand-off was 'about as serious as any we've faced'. The warning came as the UN team, which has been barred from entering the ministry of agriculture in Baghdad, decided to end a 17-day vigil in front of the building because of fears for its safety. Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN special commission into Iraq's weapons programmes, said there were 'fears of violence - either imminent or unfolding' against the UN team following several days in which it had been harassed by Iraqi demonstrators. UN officials insisted that the UN inspectors had not abandoned their demand to enter the building, but Mr Ekeus admitted that their monitoring had been 'severely weakened'. He said Iraq had refused to allow a UN helicopter to survey the building, believed to contain chemical, biological and nuclear-related weapons materials. The latest confrontation, which follows a series of attacks on UN troops and offices in northern Iraq, is encouraging the view among the Gulf war allies that Mr Saddam has moved beyond the pattern they characterise as 'cheat and retreat'. While limited military action against Iraq would be unlikely to attract any serious domestic US opposition, it would carry political risks by reinforcing doubts over President George Bush's handling of relations with Iraq.</p>

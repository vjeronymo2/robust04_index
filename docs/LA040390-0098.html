			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Changes at Long Beach Opera: The promised production of Debussy's "Pelleas et  Melisande" by the Long Beach Opera, originally planned for April 28-May 6, has  been rescheduled for April 1991.  </P> <P> Replacing "Pelleas" will be a triple bill: Pergolesi's "Livietta et Tracollo,"  Stravinsky's "L'Histoire du Soldat" and the world premiere of Mark McGurty's  "The Anatole Cycle." Performances are April 28, May 2 and May 6. Richard  Cordova will conduct all three operas. Steven McCarthy, administrative director  of Long Beach Opera, explained the rescheduling of "Pelleas" as due to the  current unavailability of Kurt Ollmann, scheduled to sing the role of Pelleas;  Ollmann will sing the performances next year.

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tomkins active Volume in conglomerate Tomkins soared to one of its highest ever levels after 25m shares were dealt, making it the day's most actively traded stock, after it forecast a 15.2 per cent dividend increase in a trading statement. Analysts said the increase is enough to trigger conversion from the convertible preference shares to the ordinary shares, which could help tidy the balance sheet in preparation for an acquisition. The group's last takeover was foods group RHM in 1992. The shares raced forward early in the session and were 13 ahead at the day's best on news that the current year dividend will be 8.5p, and that trading for the year to April 1995 had started well. They eventually came off the top after several analysts said there was 'little new' information in the statement, to close a net 3 1/2 better at 245 1/2 p. Goldman Sachs was said to have been a keen buyer of the shares following recent presentations by the chief executive in the US. Mr Andrew Mitchell at Smith New Court said yesterday's announcement was a further signal that it wished to return to the acquisition trail. International news and electronic information group Reuters Holdings lifted 8 1/2 to 512 1/2 p on consideration of a reiterated buy note from Goldman Sachs. The note focused on Instinet, the company's US-based equity brokerage service. The announcement of swingeing job cuts by regional electricity company Norweb as a response to the government's price restrictions was taken exceptionally well by the market. Norweb stressed that many of the 1,200 staff facing redundancy would be nearing retirement and able to take voluntary redundancy. But the bottom line for the market was, said Yamaichi, 'minimum 6 to 8 per cent real dividend growth and at least Pounds 40m in non-core earnings by 2000 ..a short-term target of 950p'. The shares rose 17 to 822p. Positive figures from satellite broadcaster BSkyB helped 17 per cent stakeholder Pearson rise 8 to 655p. Sadly for former Sunday Express editor Ms Eve Pollard, her departure was taken well by the market. United Newspapers, owner of the ailing weekend tabloid, gained 8 to 553p on the news that she was being replaced by Daily Star editor Mr Brian Hitchen. However, optimism might also have been focused on the talk that former Sun editor Mr Kelvin Mackenzie would take over the helm at the Star, also part of the United group. Allied Colloids shed 2 to 144p as a two-way pull developed on the stock. Smith New Court recently featured the stock as one of its stars in the sector but, yesterday, NatWest Securities said the shares had run 'too far too fast' and advised investors to take profits. Speculation that Granada Group was planning to bid for Gardner Merchant restaurant chain ensured that the shares closed only a penny ahead at 499p despite good news from BSkyB in which the leisure group has a significant stake. There was heavy turnover of 7.3m shares but dealers said some stock continued to overhang the shares. Interim results from Guardian Royal Exchange, which showed profits more than doubled at Pounds 131m, and Willis Corroon, down from Pounds 63.1m to Pounds 54.1m, were largely in line with expectations. GRE rose 2 to 184p and Willis Coroon dropped a penny to 153p. Mr Trevor May at BZW increased his full-year forecasts for GRE by Pounds 10m to Pounds 275m. 'It is doing all the right things,' he said. 'GRE is one of the smallest but one of the healthiest; there is fundamental value there.' Elsewhere, a stock shortage helped Royal Insurance move ahead 3 to 293p. Among the life companies, bargain hunters helped push Legal &amp; General up 11 1/2 to 464p. Interim results from Graham Group, their first since flotation from parent BTR in March, initially took the shares 3 higher. The stock failed to maintain the early rise and dropped back to close a net 2 off at 190p. Slough Estates, up 3 at 259p, was also slightly ahead of forecasts, with profit up 16 per cent at Pounds 33.3m, while Hambro Countrywide dropped 5 1/2 to 49p after moving to losses of Pounds 707,000 compared with a Pounds 13.3m profit last time. MEPC outperformed the market, closing 10 up at 464p, with analysts taking a positive view of its overseas exposure. Services group Rentokil wasthe day's biggest faller among FT-SE 100 constituents after interim figures from the company disappointed the market. The shares fell 11 1/2 to 222p, after sizeable volume of 2.6m. MARKET REPORTERS: Clare Gascoigne, Peter John, Joel Kibazo, Other statistics, Page 29.</p>

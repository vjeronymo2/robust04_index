An RNS congress is to be held in Suzdal early in  April to adopt a charter of the organisation.    The conference was addressed by RNS leader Aleksandr  Sterligov. He made an evaluation of the situation in the  country, noting disunity among the ranks of the patriotic forces  of Russia.    It follows from Sterligov's remarks the RNS has virtually  lost all allies after the events of the Autumn last year and the  December parliamentary elections. Sterligov pointed out the  correctness of the RNS' principled position of nonalignment with  respect to the National Salvation Front as well as  non-participation in the latest elections.</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Investors on sidelines as politics dominate trading ALTHOUGH US Treasury market investors kept their attention fixed primarily on today's presidential election, bond prices eased across the board yesterday in the wake of some unexpectedly strong economic news and uncertainty about the next refunding operation. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/8 at 95 7/32 , yielding 7.653 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down  5/32 at 99 19/32 , yielding 4.449 per cent. Turnover was reported to be light. Politics dominated the day's trading, with many investors remaining on the sidelines ahead of today's polling. The latest polls, showing a slight widening in Governor Clinton's lead over President Bush, had a slight dampening effect on sentiment, adding to the downward pressure on prices. The market, however, has already discounted the impact of a Democratic victory, so the declines were limited. The day's economic news was also mostly ignored, although there was some selling after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported its index of manufacturing activity rose to 50.6 per cent in October, up from 49.0 per cent the month before. Analysts had been expecting a smaller rise in the index. Prices were also slightly depressed by concern over the size of the Treasurys' November refunding programme, which some investors fear may be bigger than anticipated. UK government bonds tumbled by more than a point at the long end as political uncertainty and concern over the level of public spending took their toll in London. Dealers said the gilt market fell early in the day on fears that the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement would be larger than expected following reports that some Cabinet members are pushing for increased public spending to meet the rising cost of unemployment, increasing welfare benefits and cost of the incoming council tax. 'There is concern about the level of public spending and the fear is that part of the resolution could be a higher PSBR' said Mr John Shepperd, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. Adding to the poor market sentiment were worries about tomorrow's vote on the Maastricht Bill in the House of Commons which paves the way for ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union. The result is expected to be close, given the Conservative Euro-sceptics' threat to wipe out the government's majority in Parliament. The gilt yield curve showed a marked steepening yesterday as long-dated issues fell by a point or more, while shorter-dated issues ended either unchanged or slightly higher. The 9 per cent gilt due 2008 traded at 102 13/32 by late afternoon, down 15/16 from late Friday. Among short-dated gilts, the 10 per cent gilt due 1996 traded at 109 27/32 late in the day, up  3/32 . The Liffe gilt futures contract traded below its Friday closing level of 101.00, ending at 100.11 in relatively low volume. GERMAN government bonds ended the day slightly firmer, but activity in the market was subdued due to public holidays in much of Europe. Dealers said investor interest was focused mainly on five-year issues, with the DTB medium-dated bund futures contract showing a wider trading range than Liffe's long bund rival. The DTB contract rose from Friday's level of 95.54 to end at 95.70 yesterday. Although the bund market rose on Friday on news that Bonn would not launch any more Federal bunds this year, dealers said the market had not ruled out further issues by agencies such as the Treuhand and Unity Fund. Treuhand, the privatisation agency, is expected to issue another 10-year bond by the end of the year. Elsewhere in Europe, the Bank of France cut its two key interest rates by a quarter of a point, but trading activity was light due to the All Saints Day holiday. Although the Matif futures exchange was closed, cash bonds were quoted higher after the rate cuts with the 10-year OAT yielding 8.17 per cent against 8.21 per cent on Friday. JAPANESE government bonds ended firmer, but activity in the market was lacklustre ahead of a national holiday in Japan and US presidential election today. The yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.715 per cent, corresponding to the low price of the day, and moved to 4.69 per cent, but the bond later slipped to yield 4.695 per cent. In the futures market, the December contract reached a high of 107.59, but fell to end at 107.57, up from its close of 107.49 on Friday. Short-term money market rates eased slightly with the overnight call money rate dipping below 4 per cent again, to trade mostly at 3 31/32 per cent.</p>

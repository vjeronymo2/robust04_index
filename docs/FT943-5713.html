			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Observer: Pearly king Is an interesting culture change imminent at Time magazine, the weekly flagship of the Time Warner empire? Norman Pearlstine, former executive editor of the Wall Street Journal, is being tipped by the New York Times to take over as editor in chief of Time Inc, the parent of Time, Fortune, Sports Illustrated, and People. Pearlstine has interesting social and personal connections. His third wife, Nancy Friday, has made a career from writing up (anonymous) sexual fantasies. Her My Secret Garden (1979) regaled us with women's imaginings, while Men in Love (1980) crossed the gender divide for the same purpose. Francis Dealy, in his entertaining book The Power and The Money, Inside the Wall Street Journal, quotes Pearlstine saying to him that Nancy had 'emotionally emancipated' him. Pearlstine is far too glitzy to be mistaken for another Henry Luce. Even so, Time hacks might welcome his arrival if he puts a stop to the long running rumours that the mags are up for sale. Indeed, Dealy reckons that when Pearlstine took over as managing editor of the WSJ, in the first 10 months he incurred Dollars 11.4m in unexpected salary costs, by hiring 143 new staff instead of the budgeted 36. Dust off those CVs. . .</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Josip Manolic, president of the Chamber of </F> Counties, by Sanja Modric; place and date not given: "The  President Will Decide Whether to Convene a New Session of the  Chamber of Counties"]    [Text] [Modric] Can you comment on the political climate  in Croatia with regard to the replacement that is imminent in  the Chamber of Counties, after you were relieved of all your  functions in the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community]?    [Manolic] I think the attempt to replace me, the way in  which it was done, has created a certain repulsion and made the  public condemn that procedure. I have respected the procedure  to a "T." Amending the agenda during a session of the Chamber of  Counties is in the hands of the president of the chamber.  Therefore, he can, but does not have to, include an amendment  in the agenda. Since, that day, the HDZ Club of Representatives  did not manage to have the question of my replacement put on the  agenda; they demanded that the session be interrupted until a  Commission for Constitution and Standing Orders gives its  interpretation of the Standing Orders. The chamber accepted to  interrupt the session, and it cannot be continued, for the  interruption lasted for more than eight days. We must convene a  new session. This time-out has enabled me to buy time to create  -- first of all in the Chamber of Counties and then also in the  parliament -- a climate that will make it possible to decide  about my replacement in a legal and legitimate manner. I hope  that, when the time comes, deputies will be able to commit  themselves on that issue more objectively, although they were  pressured by the HDZ leadership.    [Modric] When do you plan to convene the session of the  Chamber of Counties, or will you convene it at all? HINA  reports that yesterday you were formally requested to do so by  representatives of the ruling party in the upper chamber of our  parliament.    [Manolic] Convening a new session of the Chamber of Counties  is a matter that will be decided by its president. I will be  governed primarily by political reasons in deciding to convene  the session, and I will completely obey constitutional and legal  regulations. My decision cannot be influenced by any kind of  demands of a group of the HDZ representatives nor of the HDZ  Club of Representatives. The attempt to eliminate me from the  Croatian parliament has undoubtedly resulted in a parliamentary  crisis, for a crisis in the Chamber of Counties can easily be  transferred to the Chamber of Representatives. I think the only  way out of this situation is to reach an agreement between  factors that lead to the crisis or new elections.    [Modric] What kind of agreement are you talking about?    [Manolic] It can be reached only if all parliamentary  political parties meet and try to find a solution together. If  there is no agreement, then there will have to be new elections  and, in accordance with the view of the electoral body, a new  parliament must be constituted.    [Modric] Will you persist in the founding of a new party  anyway, the party of Croatian Independent Democrats, as  announced?    [Manolic] Yes. I think that problems and differences within  the HDZ, especially that of its leadership, which had already  surfaced during the HDZ Second General Assembly, have piled up  to the extent that it is impossible to avoid the division. In  the HDZ, it is no longer possible to have any kind of critical  political activity regarding the politics of the president of  the country and the ruling party.    [Modric] Will Stipe Mesic be a member of the steering  committee of your new party? Some newspapers say that Mesic,  before the last session of the HDZ Club, spent two hours with  President Tudjman and then swore unconditional allegiance to  him. President Tudjman personally confirmed that Joza Boljkovac  was on his side.    [Manolic] You see, in the present circumstances, one wrongly  assumes that this is about my or Mesic's conflict with the  president of the country and of the HDZ, that this is a conflict  between people. However, the matter at issue is condemning a  trend in politics. Differentiation is, therefore, not done  according to "who is for and who is against the president," but  "who is for the president's politics and who is against it."  Therefore, people are divided around politics, and that is  important. Consequently, what you ask me is irrelevant: is  Mesic with me or not, am I with him or not. The important thing  is for people to commit themselves on the state politics. That  is a process that will not happen overnight but will last until  we emerge as a political party.    [Modric] When is that going to happen?    [Manolic] Very soon. There are some elements that make us  hurry. On one hand, the public is very excited because of those  developments; it demands solutions and requires prominent  politicians to make concrete steps.    [Modric] Some of your opponents claim you rushed making  political assessments. President Tudjman also said you were not  very dangerous, for if you leave the HDZ, only 1 percent of the  membership will follow you.    [Manolic] President Tudjman has proved many times what his  political judgment is like. Wrong! Involving Croatia in the  war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the isolation on the international  plane, abandoning traditional allies in Europe, seeking some  allegedly salutary solutions only through negotiations with  Milosevic, and much more -- all that speaks of the value of  President Tudjman's judgment and the statement you asked me  about can be viewed in that light, too. The statement about 1  percent of my followers is nothing but pure consolation for him  and his bureaucracy.    [Modric] In the fierce media campaign on the occasion of the  "Manolic case," some newspapers like VECERNJI LIST suggest that  a group demanding the resignation of Minister Susak could be  responsible for the tragic explosion in Sesvete [the suburbs of  Zagreb]. Jure Radic, in DANAS, has asked an important question:  What will happen if it is established that those who demand the  replacement of the defense minister are responsible for the  explosion?    [Manolic] First of all, when I demanded that Susak resign, I  had no criminal acts in mind, but Susak's political  responsibility for the tragedy of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats.  I thought that, especially in the aftermath of the Washington  agreement, the minister was disqualified by his war-mongering  moves and statements that stirred up hatred between the Croats  and the Muslims, the statement he made in the parliament that  "Herzegovina is a part of Croatia," and an attempt to divide  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was actually reckoning without the  host [the Bosnians]. Therefore, I claimed that Susak had to be  held responsible for his political actions. Similar demands of  the opposition, after the explosion in Duboki Jarak, rely on  different arguments, although we must say that the opposition  has also been critical toward the politics of Minister Susak in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The explosion in Sesvete, however, requires  a different kind of responsibility of the said minister. As  those storehouses are the property of the Defense Ministry, the  minister, naturally, must bear the consequences. Not because we  find him "guilty before putting him on trial," but in order to  enable a comprehensive and objective investigation. It cannot  be done if the most responsible people hold on to their  functions and they themselves appoint the so-called  investigation commissions, which are then suspected of working  for their benefit. Since, while there were still fires burning  in Sesvete, newspapers published that the tragedy in Duboki  Jarak was an "accident," we can say that there are some who want  to cover it all up, and we cannot allow that. As for the  speculation of Mr. Radic and those like him, they are very  tasteless. As the most responsible man in the party, right next  to the president, Radic should know that he can discuss the  explosion only after a thorough and objective investigation.</p>

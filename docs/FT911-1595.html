			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Survey of Franchising (3): Recession clouds the future - Becoming a Franchisee MANY of the visitors to next weekend's franchise exhibition at Olympia will be looking for the small business opportunity that will change their lives. They will be nurturing the dream of running their own business, with all the benefits of self-employment and escape from the frustrations of working for a large organisation. For many would-be franchisees the dream will remain simply a fantasy escape from their present job. But, equally, many will find in franchising the opportunity they are seeking and actively take up a franchise within the next 12 months. This year, however, the dream is also tinged with the reality of the recession. Many franchisees that joined the consumer spending bandwagon of the 1980s - especially in the retail sector - have caught a chill in the early 1990s. What seemed a licence to print money when the going was good, can seem more of a millstone. A report last year into the financial performance of the UK's top 100 business format franchises suggested that nearly one-third were losing money with one in every 10 insolvent and trading illegally. The report, from Oxford-based consultants CAMC, said that the franchise business had split into respectable and 'cowboy' operations. On one side, the report concluded, was a substantial minority of successful, well-run franchise operations made up of highly-innovative start-ups as well as the more established business-format franchises. The other side of the industry, it argued, consisted of an 'unwholesome concoction of cowboy outfits, look-alike versions of better-known and run enterprises; weak conceptions bolstered by over-optimism and grand claims, together with born-again failures rising phoenix-like from the ashes of previous ventures.' Set against this rather pessimistic view of franchising are other surveys, such as that carried out annually by the British Franchise Association and National Westminster Bank, which suggest that only about one in every 20 franchisees (with franchises which are affiliated to the BFA) fail. Mr Rob Ormond, franchise manager with Lloyds Bank, points out that the failure rate for new businesses in general is 25 per cent in the first year and up to 70 per cent over the initial five years. 'But over 90 per cent of franchises survive into the second year,' he says. Taking on a franchise with one of the more reputable and well-established franchise operations, and raising finance through a bank or other institution, reduces the potential risks. But it is by no means a guarantee of success. So why do people take up franchises? Franchising offers most of the advantages of running your own business - such as independence and job satisfaction - without many of the drawbacks which result in the high failure rate for small businesses. Although the average franchisee is aged about 40, married with children, and with a history of fairly steady employment there is really no such animal as the typical franchisee. Most were either white collar workers or self-employed before entering franchising: the shake-out among white collar workers in the south-east during the present recession has bolstered this trend. According to the BFA/Natwest franchise survey, people take up franchises for a variety of reasons. Of those surveyed, 32 per cent were motivated by what they described as 'personal fulfilment' with an equal number stating that their reason was 'what the system had to offer'. Some 18 per cent said that it was a 'matter of chance'. In some areas their attitude changed with experience. Initially, for example, only 11 per cent gave the safety factor as a primary motive, but safety was emphasised by 26 per cent of those asked about their current views of franchising, reflecting the impact of the recession. Most franchisees are individuals rather than companies, operating either as one person units performing a service or as owners of small retail units employing staff to help them. The BFA's survey showed that some 16 per cent operated more than one unit within the same franchise system. Before becoming a franchisee, would-be entrepreneurs should consider a number of factors. Not least are their motivations for going into franchising: people should not delude themselves when considering their own capabilities and long-term ambitions. Potential franchisees have to establish whether or not they have the emotional and physical stamina to work long hours to establish a business; and whether or not they can cope with the lack of security involved in not working for a salary paid by a company. In addition, it is important that a would-be franchisee discusses with their partner the hard work and commitment needed to make a franchise successful. Both may need to put in a great deal of work and it may be that, after careful consideration, the financial strain in the short-term and possible long and unsocial hours are simply not worth it. Potential franchisees who are satisfied that they have the right attitude to become a franchisee, then have to decide what sort of operation to get into. Do you, for example, want to run a fast-food outlet with the unsocial hours, or be constantly on call for a service business such as drain-cleaning? Or would you prefer to work more normal hours in a retail franchise such as instant printing or film developing? Another determining factor is the amount of capital you have available or have access to. Small service franchisees cost considerably less than a fast-food operation which has high start-up costs. But choosing a franchise simply on the amount of funds available - rather than because you feel it is right for you - may lead to problems later. Choosing the franchisor can also be fraught with difficulties for the potential franchisee. One easy way of sorting out the better franchisors is simply through considering the way the franchise is offered. For example, the use of an advertisement that gives only a post office box number may be an early warning sign. In addition, the first personal contact with the franchisor can give some clue as to the type of operation run by the franchisor. Where the initial meeting is held - office, hotel, room or bar - can be a clue, although would-be franchisees should be wary of being taken in by a too-affluent setting for the initial meeting. One franchise consultant suggests that potential franchisees remember 'that the good franchisor is someone who wants to form a lasting partnership with you and not just sell you something quickly which you will regret later'. It is possible to tell much about a company by establishing such facts as how long it is has been in business, its financial strength (including credit rating) and the bank references it offers. Potential franchisees should ask about its plans and prospective development, how selective it is in choosing franchisees, and how successful these become. Ask to talk to some of the franchisees at random. The anecdotal evidence from the leading banks involved in franchising is that so far during this recession, franchised businesses have been faring better than most small-businesses in general. Franchising is no panacea for the would-be entrepreneur; but the risk element is such that those wanting to go it alone should give it serious consideration. There are many useful books on the subject. Among these are: Franchising by Peter Hall &amp; Rob Dixon and published by Pitman for NatWest; and the Barclays guide to Franchising for the small business, by John Stanworth and Brian Smith, and published by Blackwell.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Faris Buwayz' Statement to AL-SHARQ </F> AL-AWSAT: Beirut Denies Existence of Secret Negotiations With  Tel Aviv, Stresses No Plan To Evacuate Palestinians"]    [Excerpt] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT--Lebanese Foreign  Minister Faris Buwayz has denied that there are any secret  negotiations between Lebanon and Israel like those held between  the Palestinians and the Israelis in Oslo. He said that the  negotiations held between us are those conducted in the  framework of the declared peace negotiations with the other Arab  delegations.    Answering a question put to him by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT during  his visit to Jordan, he said: We have not received any Israeli  plans regarding withdrawal from southern Lebanon, neither  through U.S. diplomacy nor any other quarters.    He added that the Lebanese position has always been clear  since the Madrid conference, as we refused to sit with the  Israelis or to discuss any partial solution. Nor did we accept  anything except full withdrawal from Lebanese territory.    He stressed that Israel is trying, by means of unclear  plans,  to dissolve Resolution 425, which stipulates full withdrawal  from Lebanese territory. We are calling for the implementation  of all the UN resolutions, including Resolution 425 concerning  Lebanon. Buwayz also stressed the need to continue and intensify  coordination among the Arab parties concerned with the peace  negotiations, as he regards it as support for the positions of  the delegations participating in the peace negotiations.    On the Palestinian self-rule agreement Buwayz said: What the  Palestinians brothers have arrived at with the Israelis  regarding "Gaza-Jericho" is an achievement -- which reflects  positively on the other negotiation tracks and opens the door to  progress on the other tracks.    Buwayz warned of Israel's intentions in trying to divide  solutions and single out the Arab parties individually in order  to impose Israel's will and ambitions on the Arab states. It is  always trying -- through trial balloons -- to agree a solution  with this or that party regarding such and such. All these  things are trial balloons for all the Arab tracks.    Buwayz denied that his country has any plan to evacuate  400,000 Palestinians who have been living in Lebanon for several  years and who hold Lebanese travel documents. He said: All the  rumors in this connection are untrue, and we are not at all  thinking of evacuating our Palestinian brothers. But we support  their right to return to their land and recover their legitimate  rights. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: After the pick up in the UK money supply last month, the provisional M0 figures for October are expected to show an expansion of 0.4 per cent rise for the month, with a 7.2 per cent annual rise. With last week's Confederation of British Industry manufacturing survey showing strong exports and a rise in price expectations, the markets will also be watching the Chartered Institute of Purchasing Managers' October index for developments with a particular focus on new orders, which fell for the third consecutive month in September. Tuesday: In the US, the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index is expected to be 58.7 per cent in October, slightly up from September's index of 58.2 per cent. Such a figure usually indicates strong economic growth. Wednesday: Given the strong performance of the dollar in October, the UK's official reserves are expected to increase by Pounds 15m in October. Thursday: Morgan Grenfell says the National Association of Home Builders' survey suggests weaker conditions for sales in September. It expects new home sales to drop by 4 per cent.</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Arts: Visiting orchestras - Concerts in London The debate over whether to keep May Day as a public holiday in Britain has attracted a lot of attention this year. Morris dancers set up their maypoles outside the Houses of Parliament - but, unknown to them, the finest May Day celebration was being held in South Kensington. On Saturday, at 10.30am, the Berlin Philharmonic gave its annual Europa concert at the Royal Albert Hall. As it seemed impossible to buy a programme, I am unable to give any details as to what the Europa concert entails. If, however, it means an event of this quality every May 1, well attended, put on at prices the average music-lover can afford, May Day should be declared a public holiday in perpetuity forthwith. It is still a novelty for audiences in Britain to encounter this orchestra under a conductor other than Herbert von Karajan. (During Karajan's long reign the orchestra's visits here were in any case relatively infrequent; Paris was favoured and always seemed to get the more interesting programmes.) There has been much discussion as to what has happened to the orchestra's playing in the post-Karajan era. Is its distinctively rich and burnished quality still in place? Has it become a more standard international orchestra? Obviously Bernard Haitink will have imposed his own requirements on the players, but the immaculate, warm blend of the sound all the way through Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture was the pure Berlin Philharmonic original, simply matured over the years. It was a lean programme - one and a half hours of music, straight through, no interval. After the Tchaikovsky, the orchestra slimmed its ranks and lightened its touch to accompany Frank Peter Zimmermann in Mozart's G major violin concerto, an exquisitely poised slow movement spoiled only by what sounded like newly-installed air conditioning, humming away inconveniently on a G sharp throughout. Then, finally, as immaculately-played a performance of Stravinsky's Rite of Spring as one could hope to hear. Every page of the score gave evidence of having been phrased, balanced, listened to with a fresh ear. I shall mention only one instance: the subtle blending of exposed octaves through the orchestra at the beginning of part two, which evoked so powerfully the haunting wail of mystic rites, perhaps half-glimpsed in the distance. Haitink, who has conducted this score as a staged ballet, paces it unerringly. The final dance of each section was thrilling. * It was fortunate for the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra that its London concert fell the evening before, not the evening after. The American orchestra is on a European tour with Raymond Leppard, in his fifth year as music director, and it would seem a very worthwhile visitor, if such comparisons had not been to hand. This is a new-world orchestra, with sound proficiency and determination to match. Even without the contrast of the Berlin Philharmonic, the orchestral sound would have an industrial-belt hardness and vigour. The brass predominate, not swamping the other sections, but prominent enough to give a strong metallic core. Strings wanted subtlety of colour; they did not provide balm when it was required. For all its good features, the orchestra's playing was not quite expressive in either Bruch's first violin concerto or Elgar's Enigma Variations. Rhythms were marked with a degree too much force; phrases were shaped dogmatically, as though the music was not being felt from within. The soloist in the Bruch was Dmitry Sitkovetsky, whose almost glaringly bright and authoritative playing was equally impressive, rather than moving. To start, the orchestra had given us its American calling-card, William Schuman's New England Triptych. This is a brief concerto for orchestra, which gives each section the opportunity to shine. With their technical dexterity the Indianapolis players did so. A strong American contingent in the audience at the Barbican did not let their virtues go unrecognised.

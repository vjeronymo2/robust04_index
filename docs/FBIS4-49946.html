			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, May 12 (XINHUA) -- A foundation-stone-laying  ceremony was held Tuesday for the Dongshan Economic and  Technological Development Zone in Dongshan county, Fujian  Province.    The zone is separated by the sea from Taiwan and lies  between  the Xiamen Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Fujian and the Shantou  SEZ in neighboring Guangdong Province.    Approved by the State Council, the 10-sq-km zone will focus  on the growth of such industries as food processing,  electronics, tourism souvenirs and new building materials,  according to an official of the zone administration commission.    Chinese and overseas investors will also be encouraged to  expand the financial, commercial and real estate sectors in the  zone, the official said.    He said that the Dongshan county government is doing  everything within its power to create a fine investment  environment in the zone.    To date, the zone has invested 40 million yuan in building  three km of roads and a substation, and installing a  program-controlled switchboard with 6,000 lines, he said.    A port in the zone has opened to foreign ships, he said.  With two berths for ships of 5,000 dwt, it is capable of  handling 9,000 standard containers annually.    Regular container ship services between Dongshan and Hong  Kong began May 1 this year.</p>

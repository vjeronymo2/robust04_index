			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESCUE FAILS, TWO CHILDREN PERISH IN FIRE  </P> <P> Two children died in a house fire Saturday despite rescue efforts by Sheriff's  deputies and a neighbor who were turned back by thick smoke and flames.  </P> <P> County fire officials said the blaze at 2057 Lucien St., in the Willowbrook  area, broke out shortly before 5:30 p.m. It took fire units only eight minutes  to knock down the flames, said Inspector Joe Silva of the county Fire  Department, but it still was too late to save the boy and girl who were trapped  inside.  </P> <P> The victims were identified by the coroner's office as Oscar Monterosa, 2, and  Kenia Miranda, 3. The children were not related.  </P> <P> According to neighbors, a woman who was inside the two-story house raced  outside with an infant clutched in her arms, screaming that other children were  trapped.  </P> <P> "She was just screaming -- hollering," said Christina Silva, a neighbor and no  relation to Joe Silva. "I guess there was too much smoke (for the woman) to  grab the other ones."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Flames Confined to Inside  </P> <P> Christina Silva and another neighbor, 13-year-old Rocio Labrada, said heavy  smoke poured from the house but the flames apparently were confined to the  inside.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies arrived shortly before county fire units, said Labrada.  </P> <P> "The cops (deputies) got here and tried to get in but couldn't," she said.  Labrada said she saw a woman outside whom she believed was the mother of one of  the trapped children. "She was crying. It was so sad."  </P> <P> Fire Department spokesman Silva said a neighbor also was unsuccessful in rescue  efforts. Several adults reportedly were inside the house when the fire broke  out, he said.  </P> <P> The fire apparently began in the upstairs, rear bedroom in which the two  youngsters died. Their bodies were found near a closet. Most of the damage was  confined to the bedroom, Silva said. Investigators were trying to determine the  cause.  </P></p>

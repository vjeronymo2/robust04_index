			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Kiev Ukrayinske Radio First Program  Network in Ukrainian at 1305 GMT on 1 March broadcasts the  "Independence" program featuring a recorded interview with  Yevhen Marchuk, chief of the Ukrainian Security Service, by an  unidentified correspondent.    The correspondent begins by asking Marchuk what measures are  undertaken by the state to ensure the reliable and efficient  operation of the Ukrainian Security Service, SBU. Yevhen  Marchuk responds by acknowledging the difficult financial  situation of all organizations financed by the state budget.  This is evidenced by the SBU's budget for this year which will  "be enough to keep our agency going only for seven months, and  only to meet our very basic needs, such as payments for  electricity, running water, heating and salaries for the  employees." Marchuk explains that in a bid to improve its  financial standing, the SBU sent letters to the Ukrainian  Cabinet of Ministers, Supreme Council, and the president  requesting financial help and emphasizing its role in providing  money for the state budget. For example, last year, the agency  confiscated 211 billion karbovanets, 156,000 Deutschemarks, and  $388 million during the investigation of criminal cases alone.  Some $560 million were saved for the state budget as a result  of the agency's efforts to prevent the conclusion of contracts  that would be unprofitable for Ukraine. The SBU chief stresses  that "this is a lot more than the organization's budget for the  last year."    Marchenko goes on to specify how much money was recovered by  specific SBU oblast bureaus for the state budget. According to  him, some of the best working bureaus are in Lvov, Donetsk,  Kiev, Khmelnytsky, and Lutsk, all of which could earn money for  themselves. Considering this substantial contribution to the  state reserve, Marchuk says that his agency has asked the state  for permission to receive 30 percent of the money confiscated as  a result of investigations of criminal cases. This issue is  currently being considered by the financial minister and acting  prime minister.    The SBU chief emphasizes that this is a temporary measure,  intended to tide the agency over during the current crisis  period. To corroborate this move, he recalls the recent  abduction by a terrorist in Lugansk Oblast of a bus with  children. The SBU agents had to collect all of the available  gasoline reserves to capture the criminal. In addition, because  of low salaries of SBU employees, Marchuk complains, "none of  the Kiev university judiciary department graduates agreed to  work with our organization." According to Marchuk, this example  proves that the financing of special services, whose output can  not always be expressed in money, should be executed on a  different basis from that applied to all other institutions and  enterprises.    The correspondent then says that many people wonder whether  the SBU needs to be financed so heftily at a time when Ukraine,  and the SBU itself, no longer has enemies. Marchuk answers: "I  heard about this opinion and can understand it. Outsiders  simply are not aware of the magnitude and scope of the problems  that the Ukrainian security service has to grapple with. There  are no enemies in terms of the standoff of two hostile camps.  However, at present, we see as many threats -- and not enemies  or adversaries -- to Ukraine as when Ukraine was part of the  Soviet Union. Socioeconomic threats are even more dangerous  today. They threaten the civilian peace and stability of the  state, although I hope we will not come to this. In addition,  there are many issues that are not publicly discussed, such as  activities of intelligence and counterintelligence.    He continues: In economic terms, the world is a place for  competition with its tough rules. The emergence of a new  partner in a place where everything is carved up would never be  welcomed. Ukraine is a serious partner, even though some may  think that no one over there fears us. Nothing of the kind. I  mean, in economic, not in military terms. No one is waiting to  embrace Ukraine with its agricultural potential. Because it is  clear that if we put our agriculture in order, we could flood  Russia and all of Europe with our produce. But there,  everything is settled and agreed upon. Strange as it may sound,  this is just how it is. We have an immense industrial  potential. Obsolete and run-down, it can be supported by our  intellectual resources. We have highly skilled professionals.    He goes on to say: But everything is divided in Europe in  this field. So, from the professional point of view,  intelligence is a normal thing in this situation. I mean,  intelligence operations conducted by those countries -- and our  country, too -- in order to know... What is intelligence? This  is a state institution executing political or scientific tasks,  only by special methods. Although we may not have the kind of  enemies we used to have in the past, we have instead very  serious competitors that can influence the shape of Ukraine.  This applies not only to the policies of our state, but also to  specific companies, concerns, and economic powerhouses. Those  enterprises are closely watched so that Ukraine does not inflict  any damage on them. And all of this involves intelligence,  which calls for strong counterintelligence.    Marchuk says: "The present situation in Ukraine facilitated  the presence of other intelligence services here. We are  gradually moving now to improve our work here. For example, you  know that the legislature has recently adopted the law on state  secrets, and the structure of our counterintelligence has been  adapted to modern developments. So, we do not say that we have  military enemies, but Ukraine will have economic and political  competitors -- enough for our generation and some generations to  come. This is the real world. It is highly competitive both  economically and politically."    Concluding the interview, the correspondent asks Yevhen  Marchuk what topics will be discussed during following  interviews with him -- soon to be featured on the "Independence"  program. According to Marchuk, those topics include combating  organized crime, especially in banking, protection of the  national economy, protection of national statehood and  integrity, military counterintelligence, and others.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ade Obisesan] </F>   [Text] Lagos, 10 Jun (AFP) -- Members of Nigeria's  dissolved parliament have appealed to Moshood Abiola, presumed  winner of presidential elections a year ago, to name a  government on Sunday [12 June], an ex-legislator said Friday.  Members of the abolished House of Representatives advised  Abiola to submit to the upper house, the Senate, a cabinet list  which should be "broad-based, reconciliatory and of national  unity," the legislator, who requested anonymity, told AFP by  telephone.    The Senate, also dissolved last November when the regime of  General Sani Abacha seized power, has issued a similar call to  Abiola. Abiola has pledged to form his government by Sunday,  the first anniversary of the poll, which was declared free and  fair by international observers but annulled by then junta  leader Ibrahim Babangida, who alleged irregularities. The  millionaire Yoruba businessman has also promised to reconvene  the Senate, to which he plans to submit his nominees as  stipulated under the 1989 constitution, ratified by General  Babangida's regime.    After their second clandestine meeting in a week on  Thursday,  the ex-legislators issued a communique urging civilian state  governors, who were also sacked by the military, to resume the  mandate for which they were elected in 1991. They also called  on the international community and governments to accord Abiola  immediate recognition as soon as he is sworn in as president and  commander-in- chief of the Armed Forces.    The communique was signed by seven members representing  different parts of the country.    In spite of government warnings, Abiola has insisted on  forming his government, challenging the military government to  arrest him. The National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) a  pro-democracy group which has been championing the cause of  Abiola, has declared Saturday a national day of mourning for the  "12 June martyrs", a reference to hundreds of Nigerians who died  last year during protests against the annulment of the  presidential election.    To mark the day, NADECO has called on all Nigerians to wear  black or white armbands or headbands, the group's national  secretary, Ayo Opadokun, was quoted as saying in the press on  Friday. Although the group said that it was not planning to  overthrow the Abacha regime or organise a violent demonstration  against it, the Campaign for Democracy (CD), a NADECO affiliate,  has called for nationwide civil disobedience from Monday.  During a "national week of action", the CD plans to organise  street protests, set up barricades, start bonfires and organise  rallies, all aimed at promoting "a popular national democratic  government" to be headed by Abiola, a CD statement said.    As a precautionary measure in the face of the mounting  tension, three universities including the University of Ilorin  in central Nigeria, were closed down Thursday by academic  authorities, press reports said here Friday.</p>

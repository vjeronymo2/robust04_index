Zhang  Boxing expressed important views on speeding up the construction  of the chemical fertilizer factory and the economic development  zone.    Zhang Boxing said: The Weihe chemical fertilizer factory is  a big project with the most of foreign investment and foreign  capital and the highest degree of modernization since the  founding of the PRC. The central authorities, leading comrades,  and working personnel have all devoted their efforts to this  project. The Weihe chemical fertilizer factory is one of the  province's strategic projects. After it goes into production,  its annual output of 520,000 metric tons of urea will help raise  the province's per unit grain output by a wide margin. [passage  omitted]    Zhang Boxing pointed out: First, funding should be treated  as the most important matter. If funding is not ensured, this  could cause a serious loss and affect the province's reputation  and image in opening up to the world. Second, construction  should be organized and coordinated properly, with attention  paid to safety. Third, good preparations should be made before  production starts, training should be provided to staff members  and workers, rules and regulations should be formulated which  conform with modern enterprise management. Fourth, production  costs should be reduced by means of meticulous calculations.  Fifth, all departments should provide all-out support, should  give the green light, and should not engage in disputes over  trifles, still less should they create difficulties.    On economic development zones, Zhang Boxing said: The  practice of the Xian and Weinan economic development zones has  proved that hinterland areas also have the ability to build  economic development zones well. The most important point is to  emancipate the mind. [passage omitted]</p>

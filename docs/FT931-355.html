			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Singapore banks exceed expectations TWO of Singapore's biggest banks, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC) and United Overseas Bank (UOB), have reported strong profits, reflecting improved domestic growth and general economic buoyancy in the south-east Asia region. OCBC, Singapore's second-biggest company in terms of market capitalisation after Singapore Airlines, reported net profits of SDollars 295.46m (USDollars 180.2m) in the year to December 31 1992, a 16 per cent rise over the SDollars 255.8m profits achieved in 1991. OCBC's banking net earnings increased by more than 17 per cent to SDollars 197.4m. Total income for the OCBC group fell slightly, to SDollars 2.29bn from SDollars 2.41bn. Net interest income for the group rose more than 15 per cent to SDollars 555.4m, from SDollars 480m. Loans and advances for the group rose 12.8 per cent to SDollars 16.1bn, from SDollars 14.2bn. For the banking activities, loans and advances went up more than 13 per cent toSDollars 12.8bn. OCBC said earnings per share in 1992 were 44 Singapore cents, compared with 38 cents in 1991. The bank will pay a final dividend of 10 cents, bringing the total for the year to an unchanged 15 cents. UOB net profits for the year ending December 31 1992 were SDollars 300.79m, a rise of 15 per cent on the SDollars 261.6m figure recorded in 1991. Banking profits rose 8 per cent to SDollars 169.2m. UOB said earnings per share rose to 52.8 cents in 1992, compared with 46.7 cents the previous year. The bank is paying a maintained dividend of 10 cents. Both OCBC and UOB results were slightly ahead of market expectations. Singapore's big banks continue to be among the world's best-capitalised financial institutions. Most analysts predict further strong growth in 1993. A recent Merrill Lynch report estimated that OCBC's combined capital adequacy ratio, including latent reserves, could be as high as 35 per cent. The island republic's conservatively-run banks are now being encouraged by the government to use their large cash reserves to help Singapore companies expand overseas. The banks have already stepped up their offshore lending activities, particularly in south-east Asia.</p>

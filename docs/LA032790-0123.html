			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> BID OKD FOR NEW CITY HALL COMPLEX  </P> <P> A bid to purchase a permanent city hall site was authorized by the City Council  Monday night.  </P> <P> City officials did not specify the size of the bid for a two-story office  complex owned by the Mission Viejo Co.  </P> <P> The South County developer is asking $3.4 million for the 2.3-acre site and  buildings at 24800 Chrisanta Drive near La Paz Road.  </P> <P> City officials estimate that it will cost an additional $1.3 million to upgrade  the existing offices for city uses.  </P> <P> The city pays $32,400 a month to lease a 16,000-square-foot suite of offices at  26522 La Alameda. The lease for the city's current offices expires in November,  but the city has a three-year lease option.  </P> <P> "Basically, we're looking for a place to call our home," City Manager Fred  Sorsabal said.  </P> <P> The Chrisanta Drive office building features an inner courtyard and formerly  housed the Mission Viejo Co., which developed Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Councilman William S. Craycraft was quick to distance the city from the  development firm.  </P> <P> "This transaction does not in any way deal with the Mission Viejo Co.,"  Craycraft said.FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

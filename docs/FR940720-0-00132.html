			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> State Game and Fish regulations in New Mexico allow the use of live  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minnows, including those brought into the State from other drainages, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sport fishing. This practice has encouraged the spread of these species,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one of which, the plains minnow, has completely replaced and/or hybridized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> H. amarus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in the Pecos River.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1979, Cowley discovered the introduction of plains minnow ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> H. placitus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the Pecos River drainage, New Mexico, from collections made as early  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as 1968, and also recognized the disappearance of native  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> H. amarus.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last known collections of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> H. amarus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> from the Pecos River took place in 1968  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> near Roswell, New Mexico. These same collections verified the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specimens of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> H. placitus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> from the river. It is suspected, because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> widespread use of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> H. placitus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> as a commercial bait species, that its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduction into the Pecos River was the result of release of bait fish by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anglers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by this species in determining to make this rule final. Based on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation, the preferred action is to list the Rio Grande silvery minnow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hybognathus amarus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as endangered throughout its historic range. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision to take no action would constitute failure to properly classify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act and would exclude it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from protection of the Act. The Service believes threatened status is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proper classification for the species because of the extremely limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat the species presently occupies and the threats it faces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Endangered status is appropriate because of the significantly reduced range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and declining abundance of the species, and because of the remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threats to this fish and its habitat. Without Federal protection, the Rio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grande silvery minnow can be expected to become extinct in the foreseeable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires, to the maximum extent prudent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and determinable, that the Secretary designate critical habitat at the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. Section 4(b)(6)(C)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states that a concurrent critical habitat designation is not required, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the final decision on designation may be postponed for 1 year from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of publication of the final rule to list the species. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4(b)(6)(C)(ii) allows the Service to delay critical habitat designation if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is not then determinable. The Service's regulations (50 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 424.12(a)(2)) state that critical habitat is not determinable if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information sufficient to perform required analyses of the impacts of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation is lacking or if the biological needs of the species are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficiently well known to permit identification of an area as critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat. Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic and other impacts of designating a particular area as critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat. The Service is in the process of evaluating the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained during the comment period on the economic impacts of designating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat, and has started the process of having an economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis prepared on the proposed critical habitat designation. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complexities and extent of the activities that must be assessed preclude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completion of the economic analysis within the 1-year deadline for listing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the species. The completed draft economic analysis will be made available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for public review and comment. The final decision on designation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat for the Rio Grande silvery minnow must be made by March 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995, pursuant to section 4(b)(6)(C)(ii) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain practices. Recognition through listing encourages and results in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acquisition and cooperation with the States and authorizes recovery plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if any is proposed or designated. Regulations implementing this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 402. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued existence of a listed species or to destroy or adversely modify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultation with the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal actions that are expected to occur that may affect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survival of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> H. amarus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> include the operation and maintenance of dams and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other structures that regulate the flow of water in the Rio Grande.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal agencies that serve as water managers and decision-makers who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine timing and amount of flow in the river include the International  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Boundary and Water Commission, which ensures delivery of water to Mexico  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under international treaties; the Bureau of Reclamation, which has played  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an important role in water development in the middle Rio Grande and has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been actively involved in the major water supply networks of the basin; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Corps, which is responsible for controlling any dredging or filling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within navigable waterways and associated wetlands under section 404 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clean Water Act. The Corps also has constructed and operates Abiquiu,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cochiti, Galisteo, and Jemez dams to control flood waters and sediment in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Rio Grande. The Environmental Protection Agency oversees water quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues that may affect the river. In addition, actions on the northern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pueblos that are funded, authorized, or carried out by the Bureau of Indian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Affairs may affect the Rio Grande silvery minnow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

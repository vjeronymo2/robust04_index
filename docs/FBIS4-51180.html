			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Journalists Must `Go Deep'"] </F>   [Text] In the less than four months since the conclusion  of the National Meeting on Propaganda and Ideological Work, many  prominent and gratifying changes have taken place on our press  front. In response to Comrade Jiang Zemin's call, many  journalists have studied hard Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. On the other  hand, they have gone deep into the realities of life for  interviews and investigations and have written a number of good  press reports portraying new achievements and experiences in  reform, opening up, and socialist modernization as well as the  valuable mental attitude of the laborers. An inspiring trend  has appeared in "using correct public opinion to guide the  people."    To undertake the heavy task entrusted by the party and the  people in a more proper manner, journalists should make further  efforts to "go deep." Into what should they "go deep?" First,  they should go deep into the realities of life. In other words,  they should leave their offices and confront the fiery realities  of life, instead of just sitting in the editorial room listening  to feedback reports, reading material, or editing manuscripts.  Second, they should go to the grass roots, namely the rural  areas, factories, shops, schools, armed forces units,  neighborhoods, and other basic-level units, instead of only  visiting leadership institutions. Third, they should stay among  the masses. In other words, they should frequently contact or  interview ordinary workers, peasants, intellectuals, cadres, as  well as officers and soldiers at the grass-roots level, to know  if they are happy or sad and to listen to their appeals, instead  of only reporting on local or departmental leaders, factory  directors, or managers. Filing anecdotes about singing or film  stars is even less recommended. Fourth, they should go deep  into the "focus" of society. In other words, they should  meticulously investigate crucial problems involving reform,  development, and the stability of the situation, as well as hot  issues in society about which the masses have complained  strongly; they should make penetrating judgments instead of  filing commonplace reports.    "Going deep" is an essential demand of our party in  exercising leadership over socialist journalism. Only by "going  deep," can journalists: Accurately find out about the real  situation at every social stratum; promptly grip the pulse of  the era; provide valuable information for leading institutions  to formulate up correct policies; form links with the masses and  serve them; file excellent reports and help foster talented  people; and only by "going deep," can our journalism take deep  root in the fertile soil of the people, yield good results, and  last for a long time. In short, only by "going deep," can our  journalists make due contributions to the great cause of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    In "going deep," not only must journalists make a "physical  appearance" but, more importantly, they should also be "mentally  engaged." They should cherish a genuine intention to and a  strong demand on "going deep." If they make a physical  appearance in the grass roots and among the masses without their  minds being engaged, this type of "going deep" does not mean  much, nor will it produce good results. To be "mentally  engaged," first, they should solidly cultivate the idea of  serving the people and socialism. Which people to serve is a  fundamental question, the settlement of which will provide a  basis for "going deep." Second, journalists should have the  spirit of hard struggle. Conditions are generally arduous in  grass-roots units, particularly in some remote regions, old  revolutionary base areas, ethnic areas, and poor areas. Before  going to these places, journalists should be mentally prepared  for a tough life. Third, they should resolutely oppose and  resist the temptation of "compensatory press reports." For a  time in the past, "compensatory press reports" were prevalent  and corrupted the minds of some journalists. How could they go  deep into the realities of life or stay among the masses? This  was a tragedy for the journalists. Greater efforts should be  made to stop this evil practice from recurring.    In the last few months, many fraternal press units have used  their brains and worked out ideas on "going deep" and they have  introduced many good columns and programs and published many  good articles. RENMIN RIBAO and RENMIN RIBAO OVERSEAS EDITION  have also made some efforts in this respect and achieved certain  results, which have been confirmed by the readers. But there is  still room for improvement. Facts prove that to do a better and  more brilliant job in "going deep," the crux is that press unit  leaders should have a strong sense of "going deep," draw up an  excellent plan regarding "going deep," and work out practical  measures for "going deep." Moreover, they should act as a good  example in "going deep." Of course, press agency directors and  chief editors are not like ordinary editors or reporters. Their  main task is to give consideration to the overall work and  drawing up an overall plan, instead of filing press reports.  However, when necessary, they should also "play an exemplary  role." This is quite beneficial.    Comrade Jiang Zemin proposed the following to journalists:  "Study, study, and study further; go deep, go deep, and go  deeper." These 14-character instructions point out the path for  journalists to grow healthily and should thus become a motto for  editors and reporters. We should take the achievements already  made in our study and going deep as a new departure point to  exert ourselves and blaze a new trail in journalism!</p>

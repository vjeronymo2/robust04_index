			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 30 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemalan  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio denied here today that he could  resign from his post should Guatemalans reject his  constitutional reform package revoking the mandate of Congress'  116 deputies and nine Supreme Court justices.    Speaking at the University Auditorium (in this capital's  Zone  One), where he cast his vote, the president said he trusts the  referendum will strengthen the democratic system, which was  negatively affected by the foiled self-coup d'etat by Jorge  Serrano Elias.    De Leon said this morning voting is taking place within the  framework of "political calm." Meanwhile, the Defense and  Government Ministries have mobilized at least 24,000 troops  throughout the country.    The president said he is happy with the way Guatemalans are  participating, because "the referendum is taking place as  planned" despite terrorist activities.    He said: "The referendum represents an example to the world,  because while in other countries, political crisis are resolved  in antidemocratic and violent ways; here in Guatemala electoral  mechanisms are wielded to resolve problems."    Referring to the threat of a transportation stoppage on 1  February, de Leon Carpio said: If necessary, "I will check it."  He cautioned: "I will assume my responsibilities with whatever  measure I may have to adopt in the economic, social, and  political fields."    De Leon discarded, however, utilization of the Army to  guarantee power and staples for the Guatemalans. Regarding this  Sunday's referendum, he said there are many covert groups (which  he did not identify) that are interested in the democratic  system not gaining strength.    He cautioned that if the "no" vote wins and should public  order be disrupted, "I will adopt measures the situation may  require and the law allows, because I will not tolerate any  disruption of public order."    De Leon Carpio--who hinted that violence could increase if  the no vote wins--said: "The enemies of democracy are not very  happy."    The president reiterated his intention to fight violence and  poverty, which affects 80 percent of Guatemalans, and to channel  resources to strategic fields, such as health and housing.</p>

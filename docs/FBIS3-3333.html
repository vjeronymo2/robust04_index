Hosokawa made the request during a two-hour meeting with Li,  the officials said. The subject of the ibis, though, was not  originally on the agenda for the talks with the Chinese premier.    Hosokawa told Li there are only a pair of ibis now in Japan  and they are too old for artificial breeding, they said.    He asked China to lend Japan a pair for breeding, saying he  has heard that there are a number of captive ibis in China that  have either artificially or naturally produced offspring, they  said.    Li replied that he basically supports Hosokawa's idea but he  will ask experts to work out such a loan, the officials said.</p>

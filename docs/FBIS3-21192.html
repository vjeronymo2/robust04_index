There is no risk for National  Semiconductor. We must attack.'' (Mitsubishi Electric Corp.  Intellectual Property Liaison Dept.)    Having been sued for patent infringement of the patent for  semiconductor production technology by National Semiconductor  (NS) of the United States, Mitsubishi Electric Corp. took on NS  at the end of August and brought a countersuit for patent  infringement. Also, the Kilby Patent is the basic patent for  semiconductors held by Texas Instruments (TI) of the United  States.    For the past two years, negotiations with NS concerning  cross-licensing of the patent concerning semiconductors  continued, but an agreement on price and conditions was not  reached and since they were caught on a snag, it was decided to  request a public judgement in court.    In the background there is a calculation that ``litigation  is  certainly costly, but even so the cost is about one tenth the  settlement money.'' Mitsubishi decided to set out the stance of  this attack in their patent strategy three or four years before.    Entering Mitsubishi Electric via being the Director-General  of the Patent Office, vice-president Kazuo Wakasugi assumed the  position of Intellectual Property Department chief in June 1989.  Immediately upon taking this position, he mentioned the idea of  ``making patents a source of income with the expansion of patent  acquisition abroad, beginning with the United States, and  broadening claims at the time of application'' and promoted the  switch from defense to offense. This change in awareness is  related to this countersuit.  <H5>  From Quantity to Quality Emphasis </H5>   ``Only 5% of the income from technical material is  paid. For  us to be the `Hitachi of technology,' it must be at least  Germany's average 50%.''    The director of the Hitachi, Ltd. Intellectual Property  Rights Department, Katsunori Ogawa has never forgotten these  words grumbled on a day 23 years ago by Toshihiko Kubo,  vice-president at that time.    It was Hitachi which introduced the system for evaluating  inventions in the second half of the 1960's and the full  disclosure system in 1970, but until 1981, the increase in the  number of patent applications remained a constant barometer for  invention activities. Those results were fruitful and the wish  of Kubo was for realization after ten years. Looking back, Ogawa  says ``we did not think we could clear the objective in just ten  years.''    Along with the advance to foreign markets and the expansion  of business zones, disputes among foreign and domestic  businesses have gradually increased and the switch of emphasis  from quantity to quality seemed to be approaching.    Around 1975, in an export project for heavy electronics  products, Ogawa, assigned to the processing of banned requests  received from foreign businesses, was surprised to find that in  the expanding patents of his company, not one patent was  effective on partners. This ordeal was instructive and he  started the Strategic Patent Redoubling Movement in 1981; in  1985, income and outgo from technical material rare in Japanese  business was in the black.    In the past several years, patent disputes in US-Japanese  business have been increasing and each company is strengthening  critical awareness. With the main products being the subject, it  is disliked that trials are lengthened just by taking ``actually  a form to suppress the first shoot'' (Director Yasuo Nishiguchi  of Kyocera) and many cases are also settled with a compromise.  <H5>  Compromise is a Stopgap Measure </H5>   Vice-president Wakasugi of Mitsubishi Electric appeals for a  revision of awareness and says ``in the end there are the  problems of the income and outgo and the percentage of  victories, but it is necessary not to compromise at once and to  claim the rights of this company definitely in a dry manner of  the partner.''    Even when compromise is chosen, the fact is that this is  just  a stopgap measure. This is because resistance is not possible  with such a policy in cases of demands to halt business and to  ban production and sales.    Hitachi is pressing patent activity called a ``fighting  patent'' in which ``it is not simply applied for, but fosters  individual patents with strong rights. The application claim of  the patent is taken broadly.'' Also, the way of Mitsubishi which  is taking action with a countersuit is one such model case.

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Adams sees prime peace role for US The US could play an instrumental role in helping achieve peace in Northern Ireland, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said in Belfast yesterday. His remarks, at a St Patrick's Day rally, came as Mr Bill Clinton, US president, said he had no regrets about letting Mr Adams into the US last month, in comments which received a cool response from Downing Street. Meanwhile, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister on a visit to Washington, urged political leaders to 'show daring as never before' in order to make the Anglo-Irish peace initiative work. Speaking before yesterday's meeting between Mr Reynolds and Mr Clinton, Mr Adams said that the US administration was displaying readiness to take a fresh approach to the conflict in spite of sustained British pressure. The Sinn Fein leader said he detected a willingness among Irish Ameri-cans to try to move the US administration 'in the direction of directly contributing to the resolution of the conflict'. He said republicans wanted to live in peace and without coercion among their unionist neighbours. In Washington Mr Clinton called on 'all those who practice violence for political aims to lay down their arms' and urged 'those who have yet to do so to endorse the joint declaration as the best, indeed the only, way forward'. Mr Clinton responded to Mr Adams's remarks by saying he was 'quite encouraged' that the IRA remained interested in the peace process. Mr Adam's words came 'at a good time', and Mr Clinton added: 'I hope it has a good effect.' Standing with Mr Reynolds at a White House ceremony to mark St Patrick's Day, Mr Clinton said it was 'premature' to discuss the question of issuing another US visa to the Sinn Fein leader. He had no regrets about letting Mr Adams into the US last month - 'because we all have to take a chance for peace' - but indicated that much would depend on what Sinn Fein did next. Downing Street said last night that it disagreed with the decision to let Mr Adams in at the time but accepted 'they did it with the best of intentions'. Mr Reynolds said at a dinner hosted by the president that US support for the Ulster peace process would have 'an important influence on its outcome'. He sought to spell out the benefits of a peaceful settlement in the province, saying: 'We have painstakingly erected a framework for the peace process, a framework in which the joint peace declaration is a crucial element.'</p>

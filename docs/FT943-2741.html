			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Advance of 18% comes as no surprise to James Crean James Crean, the Dublin-based industrial holding company which had a IPounds 62m rights issue in April, lifted pre-tax profits 18 per cent to IPounds 9.05m (Pounds 8.91m) in the first half of 1994. Mr Brian Molloy, chief operating officer, said the results were in line with expectations. However, in the food and beverages division, which operates mostly in the US but includes the sole distributor of Mars confectionery in Ireland, there were flat operating profits of IPounds 6m on turnover up 19 per cent at IPounds 78.1m (IPounds 65.1m). Mr Molloy said two-thirds of the sales growth derived from two product launches in the US frozen foods market, involving the one-off payment of 'slotting costs' to supermarkets to make shelf space. Inishtech, the paper and packaging company of which Crean holds 71 per cent, also had flat profits - at IPounds 4m on turnover of IPounds 29.8m (IPounds 27m). This, Mr Molloy said, was due to softness in the label business and the loss of a customer which accounted for 10 per cent of sales. Electrical wholesaling lifted profits to IPounds 1.1m (IPounds 800,000) on turnover of IPounds 23.1m (IPounds 19.7m) as UK markets emerged from recession. Office products made IPounds 1.2m (IPounds 800,000) on sales of IPounds 10.6m (IPounds 10.1m). Crean is hoping to buy the balance of Inishtech, probably in a share swap. Beyond that, the rights issue, which reduced borrowings to IPounds 18.8m for gearing of 15 per cent, should fund acquisitions across the group. Group turnover totalled IPounds 128.3m (IPounds 120.9m, including IPounds 12.9m from discontinued operations). Earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 13.5p (12.2p) and the interim dividend is lifted 5 per cent to 5.925p.</p>

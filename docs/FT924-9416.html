			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Nordbanken hopes for break-even next year MR JACOB Palmstierna, new chairman of Nordbanken, the loss-making Swedish bank, yesterday said he hoped the group's annual bad debt charge would peak this year and that the bank would break even next year. However, he said that the government was unlikely to be in a position to sell its 100 per cent holding in the bank for a least two years. 'I think the government would be happy if it could outline a plan for privatisation in August or September 1994, before the next election,' he said. The Swedish government was forced to buy out the minority shareholdings in Nordbanken and promise financial support earlier this year because of the bank's escalating losses. Mr Palmstierna, who became chairman in September, said that the charge for bad debts was likely to be SKr12bn (Dollars 2.04bn) this year, compared with operating revenues of only SKr2bn to SKr2.5bn. He added that the bank had received SKr10bn in new capital from the government only two days ago. The bank is being reconstructed. Bad loans of SKr60bn are being transferred to a new subsidiary, called Securum, which will be demerged early in the new year. At that time, Securum should receive an injection of another SKr10bn of government money. Mr Palmstierna said Securum was likely to receive further financial support from the government. He hopes that Nordbanken will break even next year, after the reconstruction, and that it should return to profit in 1994. When Securum is hived off, Nordbanken's ratio of tier 1 or core capital to assets should be 6 per cent, above the internationally agreed minimum level. Swedish banks have been very badly hurt by an fall of between 40 per cent and 60 per cent in commercial property prices over the past two years.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (6): Southerly attractions - The Mediterranean region has much to offer investors ON DARK winter mornings in Birmingham or Dusseldorf, how many businessmen wish for something different in terms of office or factory location? The idea of working in a more agreeable climate must be attractive to company managers when they peer down headlight beams in peak-hour traffic on motorways and autobahns. Many businessmen would probably prefer to be elsewhere as their cars' wipers clear snow, sleet or drizzle from their windscreens. And where better than the Mediterranean? But it is not only the climate and the accompanying lifestyle, enhanced by the cultural and historical heritage of Mediterranean countries, that makes them attractive for companies setting up or expanding their activities in Europe. Mediterranean Europe enjoys a strategic geographical position, looking north towards its own continent, as well as south towards Africa and East towards Asia. In addition to serving European markets, factories and offices on the Mediterranean's northern side are well placed to cover North and East Africa and the Near and Middle East. However, climate, lifestyle and geography are not enough on their own. In taking decisions on where to site facilities, companies must evaluate many other factors: the availability and cost of skilled and unskilled labour, quality of services, infrastructure, administrative structures and regulatory/legislative frameworks, political stability and incentives. How do Europe's Mediterranean options measure up? Spain: A leading beneficiary of inward investment in its manufacturing industry, statistics show that Spain is the world's fourth largest recipient of direct foreign investment. Last year's Dollars 10.3bn followed Dollars 11.6bn in 1991, Dollars 12.3bn in 1990 and Dollars 6.8bn in 1989. Over this period, Spain received more than twice the foreign direct investment in Italy. Spain owes its success in attracting foreign business to several factors. With a population of about 38m, Spain brought a large new market when it entered the EC at the beginning of 1986. Many foreign corporations wanted to be close to sales and have established operations in the country. The abundant supply of skilled and unskilled labour is an attraction. Over 18 per cent of Spain's workforce was engaged in agriculture in the mid-1980s, offering a pool of labour for factory work. While the agricultural workforce had fallen to just below 10 per cent of the total last year, the high level of unemployment suggests that supply constraints should not be a problem. However, Spain's advantage in direct and indirect labour costs has been eroded over recent years, and labour legislation is not market-orientated. IF the Spanish labour factor has lost some of its attraction, developments in infrastructure have enhanced the country's appeal for inward investors. Road and rail networks have been extensively modernised and expanded, and air services improved. Considerable importance has been placed on upgrading telecommunications. Part of the EC's relatively less-developed southern rim, Spain offers a significant level of investment incentives. Only a few areas of the country fail to qualify. Incentives are available from various sources (the state, local authorities and the EC). Some are targeted at specific industries. Spain's international image received a boost last year when Barcelona hosted the Olympic Games, Madrid held the title of Cultural Capital of Europe and Seville was the location for the Universal Exhibition. With the coverage given to Barcelona and Seville, few businessmen could have been unaware of Spain when listing alternatives for new factories and offices. Italy: Across the sea from Barcelona, Genoa also put on a major event last year. However, the 500th anniversary of Columbus's discovery of the Americas was overshadowed by political and economic events. Attendance at Genoa's fair was disappointing. Moreover, investigations after its closure revealed that it had been caught up in Italy's massive tangentopoli ('kickback city') institutionalised corruption scandal. Tangentopoli, which has seen foreign companies in the magistrates' net, has revealed an almost total absence of corporate ethics. But this is only one of several factors to discourage potential direct investors from choosing Italy. The Sicilian Mafia and its Calabrian and Neapolitan cousins is another. Although there seems to have been progress against organised crime this year, memories of the car-bomb assassinations of two leading magistrates last year will take a long time to fade. Italy's standing has taken a series of knocks, this summer's crisis at the Ferruzzi-Montedison Group and the liquidation of the EFIM state-holding corporation providing further examples. More than a year after the liquidation decision was taken, EFIM's creditors are still awaiting payment from the state. Also in the queue for government money are businessmen who have invested in assisted areas and have not received promised grants. The crisis in Italy's public sector finances means that the state is no longer able to honour its commitments. Officials say that all incentives approved will eventually be paid, but that time is needed. However, the uncertainty over capital grant payments that has been a feature of Italy's regional development incentives for many years is now joined by uncertainty of the development framework itself. Officials say that a new approach will ration and target incentive finance. Companies will have to submit projects to the Ministry of Industry which will rank them on the basis of evaluation criteria. With the Mezzogiorno (the south) now showing severe cracks in public order, in addition to suffering from organised crime, it is questionable that it will be a strong contender for foreign investment. Distance from main European markets and public services that creak even more than in the rest of Italy have always been a handicap. Central and northern Italy will continue to offer interesting locations, being close to markets and enjoying better services. Particularly north of Tuscany, the strengths of the country's versatile and flexible labour force are evident, although inflexible labour laws and high labour costs are a severe disincentive. But how Mediterranean is Milan? Greece: There is no doubt about the Mediterranean character of Athens and other Greek cities, albeit the Levantine flavour is very different from Rome and Barcelona. Greece is also different in other respects, being more competitive on labour and other costs. The country has a longer membership of the European Community than Spain, having become a full member at the beginning of 1981. LIKE its Spanish and Italian Community partners, Greece also tries to attract inward investment. Substantial infrastructure projects are underway to encourage this. Law number 1892, enacted in 1990 by the then newly-elected New Democracy liberal government and ministerial circulars and directives, provide the framework for encouraging investment in industry and tourism. The levels of incentive (grants, tax and accelerated depreciation allowances) depend on the prefectures where the investment is located. However, the whole of Greece is open to foreign investment. Malta: Located in the centre of the Mediterranean, 100km from Sicily and 300km from the African coast, the small (250 sq km) island of Malta has been making large efforts to attract foreign investment. Measures such as the Industrial Development Act, the Malta International Business Act and the Offshore Trust Act, passed five years ago, are designed to boost foreign business activity in the republic. The emphasis given to electronics, robotics and pharmaceuticals manufacturing has yielded results. De La Rue, Dowty and SGS-Thomson are among those present. However, Malta also has ambitions to develop as an offshore business and financial centre. The authorities consider that the combination of suitable legislation, strategic position, good services and infrastructure, and low costs should put Malta on short lists when foreign companies are considering new locations. Balkans: While the former Yugoslavia has been struck off lists of alternative locations, and seems unlikely to be re-admitted soon, Albania is a different matter. The government wants to encourage foreign investment, and enacted legislation to this effect in August last year. A diplomat with close knowledge of Albania says, however, that problems over land tenure are a brake on foreign investment, and so also are Albania's own cash shortages and lack of a banking system. Foreign exchange operations are usually through street dealers off the main square in Tirana. Albania is certainly a low cost country and this has attracted Italian businessmen wanting to escape the higher costs at home. However, it offers little at present for leading international corporations. The diplomat says that in a few years 'Albania should be a real alternative.' But businessmen will have to wait several decades before Tirana and Durres offer that attractive Mediterranean lifestyle that sets the Birmingham commuter day-dreaming.</p>

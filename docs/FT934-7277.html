			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Fresh dose of political will: The countdown to Gatt President Bill Clinton's triumph in getting the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) through the US Congress has reignited optimism in Europe that a Gatt world trade deal is now within grasp. Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's chief trade negotiator, stated cautiously on Thursday: 'I hope this will now enable the US administration to contribute fully to the solution of the limited number of substantial problems that still remain,' to complete the Uruguay Round by its December 15 deadline. In Washington, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, was confident that the momentum created by Nafta would produce 'concrete offers' from Asian leaders at the Asian-Pacific summit in Seattle for the bargaining table in Geneva. He acknowledged that there were several outstanding issues but said there was sufficient time to reach agreement by the deadline. 'There will be a Uruguay Round deal,' he said. He dismissed as propaganda the contention of Brussels officials that Washington's near-total redeployment of its crack trade negotiators to deal with Nafta had badly disrupted the impossibly tight Uruguay Round schedule. He knows, however, that there is an unremitting slog ahead, especially to settle differences between the US and the EU. If these two giants do not agree, the Round cannot be concluded. The meetings between Sir Leon and Mr Kantor on Monday and Tuesday are thus pivotal. 'We want a serious, hard, long negotiation,' an aide to the EU commissioner stressed. The signs are that the US is moving fast. This weekend, in Brussels, Mr Joe O'Mara from the US agriculture department is expected to hold important detailed talks with Mr Guy Legras, head of the European Commission's agriculture directorate. At stake is the extent to which Washington can make any of the additional concessions on last year's Blair House accord - in which the EU and US agreed substantial cuts in subsidised food exports - demanded by the French government as a condition for concluding the Round. Farm trade is the issue which has prolonged the negotiations for seven years and threatened repeatedly to sink them. There is a growing feeling, in Brussels and Geneva, that Washington will offer concessions on farm trade while preserving Blair House as a basic building block for the Round. But, equally, there is concern among senior Brussels officials that compromises on agriculture designed to get Paris off the hook with its militant farmers will be paid for in other sectors where agreement is still needed. Chief among these are: Market access and cuts in industrial tariffs. The EU is demanding that the US at least match the offer by Brussels to cut high tariffs. The EU is targeting US protection of its textiles, ceramics and glass industries. In a deal to get the backing of US textile interests for Nafta, the Clinton administration was careful not to tie its hands in the Round. It 'anticipated' tariff cuts that would not go 'substantially beyond' those agreed between the US and EU industries, and said it would work 'diligently' to harmonise tariffs to no higher than 7.5 per cent for man-made fibres - thus addressing the demands of Portugal and Greece - 15 per cent for yarns, 30 per cent for fabrics and 35 per cent for apparel. The US administration is still seeking zero tariffs for wood products and paper. It has apparently lost hope that tariffs will be eliminated on electronics and non-ferrous metals, but is proposing to drop the latter to no more than 3 per cent. Steel: 'We want peace in the marketplace, past, present and future,' a Commission official said, indicating that the US should scrap existing punitive duties on European steel and undertake to deal with future disputes multilaterally. In return, the EU is willing to restrict the terms under which it subsidises its steel industry. Cinema and broadcasting. This is another French bugbear because of the perceived threat to European culture from Hollywood. Washington has softened its opposition to existing EU subsidies for cinema and videos and voluntary quotas for indigenous programmes, but is demanding a free market in the new technologies - fibre optics, satellite-delivered programmes and other forms of pay television. The 12 member states have yet to decide on a common position on technological development. Aircraft manufacture. The two sides have a bilateral deal restricting EU direct subsidies to Airbus, and US indirect subsidies to its manufacturers through the defence budget. Brussels is strongly resisting US attempts to rewrite the bilateral accord inside Gatt. The US is also considering a twin approach on subsidies - eone for the US and EU, and another for other countries such as Japan and South Korea. The EU is determined that the future Multilateral Trading Organisation (MTO) to replace Gatt will blunt the US bilateral trade sanctions arsenal, in particular by forcing Washington to adapt its so-called 301 trade laws to the new MTO order. While Congress would not pass any agreement to forgo unilateral action completely, it could agree to bring complaints first to an international body if the settlement mechanism were sufficiently strong and swift. There is still a lot to resolve. But senior EU officials acknowledge that Mr Clinton showed courage in getting Nafta through, and that the same political will is now demanded from European leaders - particularly from Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister. Mr Kantor, who has met French officials on at least two occasions in the past month, is optimistic that common ground has been established. But everyone, he said, must rise above national interests to boost growth in the world economy. Only then can the tortuous Gatt negotiations be concluded and a new era of freer trade begin.</p>

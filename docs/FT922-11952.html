			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / French ports blocked by dockers STRIKING dockers occupied 12 French ports yesterday, blocking goods and stranding passengers bound for Corsica and north Africa, union and port sources said, Reuter reports from Paris. The communist-led General Workers Confederation said 97 per cent of the country's 8,300 dockers heeded its call for a stoppage in protest at government plans to reform work practices and cut jobs. Strikers blocked the ports of Marseilles and Bordeaux on Tuesday night. The stoppage spread to 10 others, including Nantes, Rouen on the river Seine, and Dunkirk.</p>

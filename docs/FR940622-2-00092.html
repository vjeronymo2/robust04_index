			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rules 1606A(d) and 2107(d) are being amended to provide that OCC's confirmation of acceptance of the clearing member's DVP authorization instruction will be carried out through an on-line confirmation message from OCC to the clearing member rather than by OCC's signature on a DVP form. Rules 1606A(f) and 2107(f) are being amended to provide that the clearing member must deliver to its agent bank a C/MACS-generated DVP report that contains the approved DVP instructions instead of the OCC-endorsed DVP form. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, an interpretation is being added both to Rule 1606A and to Rule 2107 to provide that should unusual or unforeseen circumstances prevent a clearing member from submitting DVP instructions by on-line data entry prior to any applicable cut-off time, OCC in its discretion may require the clearing member to submit such item by other approved means, including the use of hard copy forms, and/or may extend the applicable cut-off time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of the development of the on-line DVP system, extensive testing was undertaken to assess the operational impact of the new on-line system. Based on OCC's testing of the on-line CVP system, OCC has determined that the implementation of the on-line DVP authorization process should not stress OCC's current processing systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to security, internal and external controls have been put in place to ensure the integrity of the data and the software of the product. Data security is maintained through security software. In addition, OCC's Security Administration Department develops, reviews, and maintains appropriate security guidelines and standards. The integrity of OCC's operating systems is maintained through limited access to central systems libraries. Physical access to OCC's systems is restricted to those employees that require access. Finally, on-line access is restricted to users with authorized log-in IDs and passwords. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to contingency procedures, OCC has adequate back-up procedures in place to ensure the timely continuation of DVP processing in the event that any problem develops with respect to the on-line system. For instance, if C/MACS were not functioning properly, OCC could permit a clearing member to enter the DVP instructions at one of OCC's offices or to submit hard copy forms. Furthermore, if a system failure were to prevent a clearing member from submitting any DVP instruction through on-line data entry prior to any applicable cut-off time, OCC could extend such cut-off time by such period as OCC deemed reasonable, practicable, and equitable under the circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OCC believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  of the Act because it promotes the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions by substantially reducing the paperwork associated with the DVP settlement process. OCC believes that this first step in converting the DVP authorization process to an on-line system will make the system operationally more efficient and will reduce the time delays inherent in a system using paper forms. Furthermore, OCC believes that it has sufficiently considered capacity, security, and contingency issues in its development of the on-line DVP authorization system and that the proposed on-line DVP system should in no way pose a threat to the integrity or security of OCC's current processing systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

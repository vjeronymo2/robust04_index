			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Arts: Trelawny of the Wells - Theatre There is a mass of theatrical history behind Trelawny of the Wells. Over the years it has been Arthur Wing Pinero's most popular work, far ahead of what Hilaire Belloc called 'that interesting play, The Second Mrs Tanqueray'. But not even Pinero (1855-1934) could have expected to see two major productions of Trelawny in London in 1992-93. The first opened at the Comedy on Monday; the second will be at the Royal National Theatre in the new year. A word of warning may be in order. The first half of the Comedy production is leaden to an unexpected degree. Do not form a judgment at the interval, for the second half takes off. This may be because of the veteran Sir Michael Hordern, rumoured to be making perhaps his last West End stage appearance. Hordern plays the part of Sir William Gower who, in the first half, is a very dour fellow indeed. Vice-Chancellor of the legal profession, he lives with his even more repressed sister in Cavendish Square, sleeps briefly after dinner before devoting his intellectual energies to playing whist (not even bridge). Almost none of the first half jokes and situations succeed, including the introduction of the team of troupers at the Wells. Then comes the transformation. The Vice-Chancellor turns out to have been a more lively man in his youth: having seen Edmund Kean act, he had an eye for what he calls the 'gypsy profession' himself. Toby Robertson's direction is worth seeing for Hordern's second half showing alone. Even when he just grunts, and he does a lot of that, Sir Michael remains a formidable stage presence. He exudes old-fashioned authority; everyone defers to it. For the rest, some background may help. Pinero was an actor before turning to writing. He switched when realism in the theatre was just coming in and was not immediately popular. One of the characters in Trelawny is called Tom Wrench. He is drawn from the real-life playwright, now largely forgotten, T. W. Robertson (1829-71). Robertson came from a huge theatrical family. It was Robertson who - before Chekhov, Ibsen, Shaw and Granville-Barker - tried to introduce realism to the stage. He was known for his 'cup-and-saucer drama'. While much of Trelawny is farce, the background is the struggle for what the theatre should be about. The Wells is Sadler's Wells where some of the innovations, and some of the resistance, took place. The Trelawny of the title is not a squire, but Rose, the juvenile lead who started in musical comedies until she became more serious and was temporarily sacked. You can see the influence on Shaw: there is a touch of Eliza Doolittle in Rose. Some of Trelawny comes close to Victorian melodrama, though perhaps this is satirical. The Vice-Chancellor, for instance, could very well turn out to be a villain and his grandson come to a sticky end. Yet what you get, above all, is the fascination with theatre which, around the end of the 19th century, went into one of its most productive periods. Pinero was steeped in it. There are some wonderful ironies. The Vice-Chancellor recalls his theatre-going youth, does a little walk like a hunchback, then reflects on the decadence of the new realism: 'When I saw Kean as Richard, he reminded me of no member of my family. Shakespeare knew better than that.' Rose is played by Sarah Brightman. She is far too professional ever to put a leg wrong, but is a surprisingly mature actress to be cast as a 19-year-old juvenile lead. A touch of the ingenue might liven things up in the style of Sara Crowe. Some of the smaller parts are excellent, especially Kelly Hunter as the splendidly named Avonia Bunn. It cannot be beyond Toby Robertson to quicken the pace of the first hour or so. Comedy Theatre for an eight week season. (071) 867 1045</p>

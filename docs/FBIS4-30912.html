			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, May 29 (MTI) -- Hungarian Prime Minister  Peter Boross said that in spite of all the difficulties and  uncertainties, the organizing of the Hungarian parliamentary  elections proceeded far better than the European standard. The  prime minister made the remark on Sunday evening, during his  visit to the National Election Centre.    Attending the session of the National Election Committee,  Boross expressed satisfaction that the work of the Interior  Ministry, which he formerly headed, played a decisive role. In  his view, the country was characterized by a moderate  tranquility during the elections.    Leaving the session, the prime minister answered questions  from journalists. He said that although he regards it as  unpleasant, he would not be overly disappointed if his party  does indeed win only 34 mandates, as was indicated by the public  opinion poll issued in the evening hours. For him the true  disappointment was the first round (in which the Hungarian  Socialist Party won 32.96 per cent of the votes cast for party  lists, while the senior party of the current government  coalition, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, received 11.73 per  cent.)    In answer to a question on how effective a small-sized  opposition can be in Parliament, Boross said that everything  will depend on the readiness shown by the winning party. Up to  now, many promises have been made which express a desire to keep  in contact with the opposition.</p>

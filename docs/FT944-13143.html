			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Tractor unit acquisition boosts Agco to Dollars 31.9m Agco, the fast-growing Atlanta-based farm equipment company, yesterday announced record third-quarter net earnings of Dollars 31.9m, or Dollars 1.72 a share, nearly double the Dollars 16.2m, or Dollars 1.15 a share, reported a year earlier. The rise mainly reflects Agco's acquisition of UK-based Massey Ferguson, one of the world's biggest producers of tractors. The Dollars 329m deal was completed on June 29. Sales in the third quarter jumped by 183 per cent to Dollars 481.3m, reflecting the Massey deal and the takeover last December of White-New Idea, a US farm equipment business. Mr Robert Ratliff, Agco's chairman and chief executive, said industry conditions in North America remained positive. 'Corn production is forecast to be 46 per cent above last year and a bumper soybean harvest is also expected,' he said. In western Europe, Massey had benefited from improved market conditions, especially in the UK, France and Scandinavian countries. Growth in markets outside North America and western Europe was also positive. Pro-forma for the acquisitions, net sales, earnings and earnings per share for the first nine months would have been Dollars 1.35bn, Dollars 88.6m and Dollars 4.81, respectively. This compares with Dollars 1.1bn, Dollars 49.4m and Dollars 2.70, respectively a year earlier. The company said it expected to record a Dollars 19.5m charge in the fourth quarter for non-recurring acquisition-related expenses. This was within the range previously announced.</p>

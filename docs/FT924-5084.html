			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Letter: Right reward? Sir, Re Carol Arrowsmith's letter (November 21) on regulation of share options, no doubt institutional shareholders' guidelines are having their effect in regulating senior executives' share options schemes. What the guidelines have not done is lead to the elimination of the 'each-way rewards bet' when if a high-risk strategy to achieve the share options reward fails (often associated with acquisition) then the outgoing directors are rewarded for failure through three years plus service contracts.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Edmond Laci commentary: "Heroin in Durres: 500 Grams of </F> Confiscated Drugs"]    [Text] Durres -- Up till now, there have been only  investigations and suspicions, but now here is the proof:  heroin traffic also passes via Albania. Last Friday evening,  the biggest-ever quantity of the white powder to be caught was  confiscated in the city of Durres. During a surprise search  near the beach at Durres, the forces of public order discovered  around 500 grams of heroin in a person's private car. A few  hours later, after this person's immediate arrest, two other  persons were detained; an intensive search was still going on.    The first announcements--albeit very reserved ones--confirm  that the person from whom the big quantity of heroin was  confiscated was a man of 40, working in the Mercantile Marine of  Durres and a resident of Kavaja. Meanwhile, other sources from  Kavaja report that later the same evening, the forces of public  order carried out a minute search of the man's house. Anyhow,  there is no report of any new quantity of drugs having been  confiscated since then, although--due to the top secrecy of the  investigations--no other details relevant to this action,  carried out by the forces of order, were given. It is clear  that this discovery was preceded by long-running investigation  work that succeeded in coming to fruition only last Friday  evening. The fact that two other persons were detained is  another sign that makes us believe that, in this case, we are  dealing with a whole network of drug traffickers, whose  tentacles in Albania have just been revealed. Thus the  hypothesis presented--especially in recent times--of various  persons within the Albanian territory being involved in the  international drug traffic is thoroughly confirmed. On 9 March  1993, 10 grams of heroin and 53 small bottles of cocaine were  confiscated, again in Durres, in the facilities of the Italian  "Pellicano" Operation. The then vice-interior minister, Mehja,  told GAZETA SHQIPTARE at that time of "the capture of the first  Albanian drugs trafficker." Today--only one year later--a 50  times greater quantity of the best selling and most sought-after  drug, which can fetch the price of $700,000 in the West, was  discovered. It is not known yet whether this quantity of drugs  belonged to any contingent intended to reach the Italian shores,  or whether it was designed for domestic use. Yet that it was  intended for trade remains the most certain hypothesis, because  half a kilogram of heroin could not possibly be used by an  ordinary drug-addicted maniac alone.    Only one week prior to last Friday, the Italian authorities  announced the detection of an international network of drug  traffickers and the confiscation of 40 kg of heroin that was  meant to pass via Albania to the Italian drug market.  Besides--according to the Italian specialist--the existence of  a mobile heroin refinery--moving to and fro, stationed now in  Albania, now in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM]--was confirmed. Nevertheless--unless a  complete investigation is carried out, it cannot be ascertained  that the quantity sequestrated in Albania belongs to the  aforementioned drug refinery and network.</p>

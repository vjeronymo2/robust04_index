			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Rank Organisation Investors were deceived by Lonrho's example in marking Rank down so steeply this week. There was no dividend cut after all; earnings are more than enough to cover a maintained payment. There was no rights issue either; gearing is high but there is no immediate pressure to reduce it. Yesterday's 8 per cent jump in the share price leaves it slightly higher than before the scare. But there is still the question of whether the underperformance of nearly 40 per cent since mid-1989 is now set to reverse. Even without much help from the economy, Rank should manage a modest increase in profit this year, while funding enough capital spending from cash flow to maintain an edge over its competition. Disposals will reduce gearing, though probably not to the long-term target range of 50 per cent. That does not point to a higher dividend, but it should at least be maintained. The yield is thus 6 1/2 per cent, a comfortable underpinning for a recovery stock. Any revival of consumer confidence should feed through quickly into margins. In Rank's case the earnings benefit would be compounded by a reduction in the tax rate, as a smaller proportion of group profits would flow from highly-taxed Rank Xerox. The ACT problem which cost Pounds 7m should also disappear. A prospective multiple of 13 thus looks undemanding, especially since fears of a Mecca black hole are dying down.</p>

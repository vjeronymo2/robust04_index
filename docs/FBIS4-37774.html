			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Nasir-al-Din al-Nashashibi, "King </F> Husayn's adviser," by Arab affairs correspondent Avraham Barne'a  at al-Nashashibi's East Jerusalem home on 23 June --  Al-Nashashibi's remarks in English]    [Text] A meeting between King Husayn and Prime Minister  Rabin may take place much before October. This remark was made  today by Nasir-al-Din al-Nashashibi, a close adviser to King  Husayn in the West Bank. The senior Jordanian journalist,  Sultan al-Hattab, who was in Israel last week and met Rabin and  Peres, was sent here by Jordan's prime minister and stayed in  al-Nashashibi's East Jerusalem home. Speaking with our Arab  affairs correspondent Aharon Barne'a today, al-Nashashibi  explained what lies behind the recent moves by the king:    [Begin recording] [Al-Nashashibi] When Jordan found that  Syria has not moved enough towards peace -- and under certain  pressure from the United States and from the world opinion on  Jordan to act for peace, and under certain pressure, financial  and economic pressure, also pressure from the army side for more  new arms -- so, these things made Jordan fasten [as heard] its  steps towards peace.    [Barne'a] Nasir-al-Din al-Nashashibi, today a close adviser  to King Husayn, served as an adviser to the king's grandfather,  King 'Abdallah, just as he was an adviser to Jamal  'Abd-al-Nasir, King Fahd, and other Arab leaders. Today, he  believes, Husayn is past the stage of being angry over being  left out of the picture, and decided to take the initiative and  lead, as did his grandfather.    [Al-Nashashibi] He has been always a man who leads. And, as  I said, since 1948, his grandfather was a man of peace. He paid  his life as a price for that peace, and the king is aware of  this.    [Barne'a, in English] Are we to witness very soon a meeting  between the king, or high Jordanian officials, and high Israeli  officials?    [Al-Nashashibi] I think the king has no complexes. He  will... [pauses] I heard yesterday that a future planned public  meeting would take place in October. I doubt it. It will take  place before -- if the king feels that the bell is ringing  across the river and there are certain good, just, comprehensive  offers that he can transfer into concrete peace agreement.

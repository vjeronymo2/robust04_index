The various parliamentary  groups, which used the weekend to examine the document,  disclosed the results of their discussions at the plenary  session. Moussa Amagni has the details.    [Begin Amagni recording] The various parliamentary groups --  the opposition as well as the majority group -- after reading  and analyzing the rebels' demands in serious and deep tones  commensurate with the nature of this type of debate, rejected  all the rebels' demands outright for several reasons. For some  of them, the document is based on [word indistinct] and  unfounded, while for others the document is aimed at  partitioning Niger and is based on hegemony. It is neither  formal nor constitutional. It is, antinationalistic,  unpatriotic, and antirepublican. [passage omitted]    Much as the parliamentary groups condemned the contents of  the document of the armed rebellion, they all called upon the  government to lay a concrete basis for future negotiations.  Essentially, they all urged the government to do everything  possible to restore peace, calm, security, and harmony in Niger.  The various groups made several suggestions to this end. In  the meantime, the maturity of our people and their traditional  vigilance must (?guide) us to nullify all attempts to plunge our  country into the abyss of division, racial, and ethnic hatred.

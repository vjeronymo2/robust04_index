			<p>SUMMARY                                In the clearest expression to date of its readiness to allow  resumption of international inspection of North Korean nuclear  facilities, Pyongyang has indicated that an "early inspection" by  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be realized  once Washington announces cancellation of Team Spirit and the  date for reconvening DPRK-U.S. high-level talks.                           END SUMMARY     Using an authoritative Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement on  21 February, Pyongyang indirectly confirmed earlier Western  reporting of an IAEA-North Korean agreement on the imminent  resumption of nuclear inspections.  The statement referred to an  unspecified "agreement between us and the agency" and  acknowledged that Pyongyang is in "the action phase" of  implementing that agreement (Pyongyang radio, 21 February).     The statement, made ostensibly in an answer to a question by a  KCNA reporter, made a series of assertions:     + It again claimed that Washington and the IAEA have redefined  the scope of nuclear inspections they are demanding and that the  only remaining issue now standing in the way of carrying out the  agreement with the IAEA is the "simultaneous" action that the  spokesman claimed Washington had previously agreed to take.     + It maintained that a DPRK-U.S. agreement reached at a bilateral  contact in New York on 29 December specifies a U.S. declaration  of the discontinuation of the Team Spirit joint ROK-U.S.  maneuvers and a joint DPRK-U.S. announcement of the date for the  next round of high-level bilateral talks.     The statement also included a clear plea to avoid further  complications in resolving the nuclear inspection issue, warning  that if Washington "again" sets "unjustifiable conditions" for  cancelling Team Spirit or otherwise "applies pressure," the DPRK-  IAEA agreement cannot be implemented.  The present "hard-won"  opportunity will be lost, the statement went on, and there will  not be "another opportunity" to reach a compromise solution.     Inter-Korean Talks     Indicating that Pyongyang is also ready to  fulfill the other prerequisite for the resumption of DPRK-U.S.  talks, the 21 February statement for the first time claimed that  Pyongyang had also agreed at the 29 December meeting to  "affirmatively examine" any South Korean proposal for exchanging  special envoys.  In another indication that Pyongyang is moving  toward resumption of inter-Korean dialogue, Pyongyang on 18  February issued a Foreign Ministry memorandum--a vehicle  Pyongyang sometimes uses to map out its initial negotiating  posture--that purported to document South Korea's "clandestine  program" to develop "nuclear weapons" (18 February).  Serving  notice that there will be hard bargaining ahead, the memorandum  stressed that South Korea's heavy water reactors should be  replaced by ones based on light water technology.  Earlier, the  North had declared its intention to replace its graphite-  moderated reactors with light-water reactors.     Implications     The 21 February statement is the strongest  indication to date of North Korean readiness to take major steps  toward resolving the nuclear issue.  However, in warning that  there may not be "another opportunity" for reaching a compromise  solution, the statement may be implicitly signaling that  pragmatists in the North Korean leadership are under pressure to  deliver tangible proof of Washington's good faith.

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Breaking point for nerves of steel: German steelmakers are trying to raise the political temperature over a crisis-hit industry Steel manufacturers are not normally men to mince their words, and German steelmakers are no exception. In the past four weeks, the two most powerful men in the German steel industry - Mr Heinz Kriwet of Thyssen, and Mr Gerhard Cromme of the newly forged Krupp-Hoesch combine - have suggested that, if European steel policies do not change, they might pull their companies out of production altogether. The question is: are they bluffing? It is scarcely imaginable that two such giants of the industry, whose entire wealth and reputation was built on the back of mass steel production, could begin to contemplate abandoning it entirely. Yet both have diversified in the past two decades and today their steel interests are a huge drain on the profitability of the rest of their engineering and trading interests. Mr Cromme says the question of whether to abandon steel production is 'perfectly realistic'. Of course he does not want to do it, and he is pursuing all possible remedies to stem his losses from steel production. But at least he is prepared to entertain the thought. Mr Kriwet puts it like this: 'If the political establishment cannot or will not protect the private sector structures in the European steel industry from unfair competition, then we as entrepreneurs will be forced to take action - not because we want to, but because circumstances beyond our control are forcing us to do it.' Yesterday, more than 10,000 steelworkers from the plants of Thyssen and Krupp in Duisburg, the grimy heart of the German steel industry, marched to the so-called Solidarity Bridge across the river Rhine to protest against the loss of up to 7,000 jobs in their steel town alone. There were calls for protest strikes, and ringing condemnations of both Bonn and Brussels for failing to protect the industry. The IG Metall trade union wants a declaration from Brussels that the industry is in 'manifest crisis', and the imposition of production quotas EC-wide. The slogan of solidarity was much in evidence. The question is: are they bluffing? For it is barely five years since they were on the streets of Duisburg, fighting (and winning) to save the Rheinhausen steel plant from closure. Now it is under threat once again. They know thousands of jobs are going to go: the only question is where. As for the solidarity, there is precious little in evidence. The steelworkers of Rheinhausen are competing with their comrades at the Hoesch steelworks in Dortmund to see which of the two will survive the drastic programme of capacity cuts which Mr Cromme has ordered. And they are also acutely conscious that they face cut-price competition both from eastern Europe, and from eastern Germany itself. Either jobs go in the east, or they go in the west. It is clear that both the German steel bosses and their employees are playing politics in an overwhelmingly political industry. They are seeking to raise the political pressure on both Bonn and Brussels in the immediate run-up to today's debate in the EC Council of Ministers. At stake is a rescue package for the European steel industry in exchange for significant cuts of some 30m tonnes in production capacity. The German steelmakers are up in arms because they are facing a new round of plant closures and mass redundancies, after always being the most efficient, least feather-bedded operators in the entire European industry. This time, they believe, it should not be their turn. Out of DM121bn (Pounds 51bn) in state subsidies paid to European steel companies between 1975 and 1990, German producers received just DM7bn: the statistics are distributed with equal enthusiasm both by the manufacturers in the German steel federation, and the IG Metall trade union. Since 1980, more than 120,000 jobs have been axed in the German steel industry, or precisely half the 240,000 cut in the EC industry. Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German steel federation, believes that Germany needs only to cut about 5m tonnes of production capacity to bring its capacity utilisation back to an 'economic' 85 per cent. If it has to cut capacity according to its EC market share, it will lose more like 9m tonnes. Whatever happens, he fears that 35,000 to 40,000 jobs may go. He blames a whole complex of factors - both external and internal - which have hit the industry simultaneously, on top of the very sharp downturn in the German economy, 18 months after the rest of Europe slipped into recession. On the external front, the EC market has been left wide open to cut-price east European (and ex-Soviet) imports. 'It was a big political mistake to open up our market so quickly,' Mr Vondran says. East European steel is heavily subsidised through artificially low prices of coal, iron ore and energy. Since 1990, German imports from the east have more than doubled, from a monthly average of nearly 86,000 tonnes, to 195,000 tonnes last year: they account for the largest part of an EC-wide increase, from 240,000 to 370,000, in the same period. The east Europeans, as well as the Russians and Ukrainians, are exporting, above all, long products, such as steel girders, wire rods and bars. 'Two-thirds of our problems lie with long products, and only one-third with flat steel production,' Mr Vondran says. In a weak market, the east European imports have had a disproportionately destabilising effect. The US decision to bring anti-dumping suits against 84 importers from 21 countries was the second external blow. Mr Vondran says it will displace up to 6.5m tonnes of steel from the US market, 600,000 tonnes supplied from Germany. Internally, the continual complaint of the German industry is that the EC reforms of the 1980s failed to stop subsidy payments to grossly inefficient steel manufacturers. 'Brussels closed its eyes and allowed inefficient plants to carry on. It was the easy option,' Mr Vondran says. He cites the state-owned steel producers in Italy and Spain as prime offenders, and he argues that, from now on, they should only receive subsidies in direct proportion to the production capacity they remove. The German industry wants a 'market solution' from Brussels which will allow the efficient manufacturers to prosper, and the weak to fail. Yet it also wants more 'social' support to ease the cost of redundancies, and external protection against cheap imports. There is also an underlying aspect of the German steel industry which few inside the country are prepared to face up to. 'The problem starts because essentially the German steel industry has not restructured in about the last 30 years. That is unique in Europe,' says Mr Jeremy Fletcher, an independent strategic steel analyst. It may be technologically efficient, but it has remained fragmented. He suggests two reasons: first, because the customer base (above all, the automotive industry) kept expanding; and second, because Germany did not opt for nationalisation, inter-company restructuring was made more difficult, especially as there is no tradition of hostile takeovers in the system. Last year's shotgun wedding between Krupp and Hoesch was the first big move towards restructuring. In spite of reassurances to the contrary, it now looks certain to cost thousands of jobs. There is no doubt that the survivors are hoping against hope that Klockner-Werke will fail in its bid to write off 40 per cent of its debts, currently under negotiation with its creditors. Closing down its 3.35m tonnes production would be a step towards the relief of the industry. Meantime, Thyssen, Krupp and Saarstahl are talking urgently about 'co-operation' in the long products market. Industry sources say they must reach agreement within a month, or fall back on in-house solutions: more capacity cuts. Mr Cromme can scarcely wait. He has already announced the probable closure of Krupp's long products plants at Siegen and Hagen, unless they can win a last-minute reprieve from those negotiations. Yet German steel men defend themselves against charges that they have failed to restructure. They have just done it a different way, they say. 'We have diversified, and built up other pillars for our companies to survive on, if they have to abandon steel,' says one. Which is precisely why Mr Kriwet and Mr Cromme can make their threats to pull out altogether, with more than a grain of truth about them. They just might.  ------------------------------------------------------------------                    CRISIS IN GERMANY' STEEL INDUSTRY  ------------------------------------------------------------------ ROLLED STEEL IMPORTS INTO EC  ------------------------------------------------------------------ (tonnes, monthly averages)    1989      1990     1991      1992*  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Former Soviet Union         44,619    57,032   93,536   112,488 Poland                      36,529    48,870   45,172    68,810 Czechoslovakia              53,424    64,547   81,587   120,253  ------------------------------------------------------------------ ROLLED STEEL IMPORTS INTO GERMANY  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Former Soviet Union          5,423     7,824   52,807    61,036 Poland                      24,850    23,572   24,835    50,038 Czechoslovakia              21,144    27,003   35,869    60,277  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: German Steel Federation                *January to November  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

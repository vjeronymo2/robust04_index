			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MALL DEVELOPER ASSAILS LATEST CARWASH TACTIC  </P> <P> The developer of a proposed Studio City mini-mall Monday denounced the latest  efforts by a Los Angeles city councilman and residents to force him to delay or  alter his project so a popular carwash, gas station and restaurant would be  preserved.  </P> <P> Ira Smedra called the tactics harassment by a small contingent of residents who  don't want him to demolish the three businesses on the northeast corner of  Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards.  </P> <P> Last month, the residents group, Save Our Corner, unsuccessfully tried to have  the 28-year-old carwash and the adjoining gas station and restaurant declared  cultural monuments. The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission refused to  award the designation, clearing the way for Smedra to remove the three  structures within 90 days and build the mall.  </P> <P> But City Councilman Joel Wachs introduced a motion last week to force Smedra to  prepare an environmental impact report on the proposed $15-million mall  project.  </P> <P> Smedra said he especially was angered by Wachs' action.  </P> <P> "It's really unfortunate that this is happening," Smedra said. "And it's only a  small group of homeowners who are doing this. There are a lot of people in that  area who have said they want me to get rid of that atrocity and build something  nice."  </P> <P> Wachs today is expected to ask the full council to order Smedra to do the  report. He has said the mall would have a substantial impact on traffic and  would harm the aesthetics of the area.  </P> <P> If the City Council approves Wachs' request, the project could be delayed for  six months to a year.  </P> <P> Ira Handelman, a spokesman for the developer, said Smedra had already evaluated  the impact of the project. "We have already taken care of all the concerns," he  said, adding that Smedra had completed reports on traffic and other  environmental issues.  </P> <P> "This is nothing other than a delay tactic that will cost Mr. Smedra a lot of  money," he said. "It's unnecessary."  </P> <P> While commending Wachs on his efforts to save the carwash, the residents' group  Monday called for the city to purchase the corner and build a parking lot for  businesses along Ventura Boulevard.  </P> <P> "We don't need another shopping center; we need parking," said resident Jack  McGrath as he and several members of the group stood beside the carwash. He  said the city should pay for the parking lot out of funds collected from  parking meters in Studio City. The lot would cost an estimated $8.3 million,  McGrath said.  </P> <P> "We've been waiting since 1958 for something to be done with this money,"  McGrath said. "And we've gotten nothing back for our nickels, dimes and  quarters."  </P> <P> Another member of the group, Walter McIntyre, said 70 out 250 retail businesses  that have been built between Fulton and Vineland avenues are vacant. "This  center would just add to the glut," he said.  </P> <P> The group said the lot could be financed by raising the meter rate from 25  cents to 50 cents an hour and by extending the hours of meter operation by four  hours.  </P></p>

In his speech, the  President expressed his determination to tackle domestic  administration reforms in a positive way. His policies include  the reform of the medical insurance system, an effort to renew  the United States' strength; the revision of the welfare system;  and the strengthening of anticrime measures. It is hoped that  efforts to reform the domestic administration will lead to the  enhancement of U.S. leadership in the world.    Generally speaking, it has been observed that during the  first year of the Clinton administration, "there were some  losses," but "there were more gains," (as stated by the  WASHINGTON POST). What can be termed as achievements include:  the approval of the bill on reducing financial deficit; the  approval of the bill on weapons regulations; and the approval of  NAFTA.    President Clinton, who is now in the second year of his  term,  has pledged further efforts for economic reconstruction, and at  the same time, has called for strengthening anticrime measures  as one of the top priority tasks. Because public security has  deteriorated, particularly in big cities, he wants to set  stricter penalties for those who choose to commit crimes. Among  the measures to be taken are the addition of 100,000 police  throughout the United States and an expansion of the death  penalty for violent crimes.    Moreover, President Clinton also touched on such measures as  the creation of jobs; professional training for the purpose of  reemployment; enhancement of education; and the strengthening of  the information industry. In particular, he is determined to  carry out some reforms such as the health care reform that all  postwar Presidents have tried to avoid. His stance on  positively tackling reforms that could result in pains among the  people certainly deserves appraisal.    In this speech, President Clinton clearly stated that  priority will now be given to domestic issues. It is probably  because he has taken the by-election this fall into  consideration. But now that the economy is on the right track  toward recovery and the President is gaining greater backing  from the general public, it is hoped that he will be able to  carry out these policies as he has pledged.    On the other hand, there are factors that have aroused  concerns over the Clinton administration. For example, there is  the slow process of making personnel appointments and a  rekindling of personal scandals.    Last December, President Clinton accepted Defense Secretary  Aspin's resignation and then nominated Inman, former deputy  director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as his  successor. However, Mr. Inman has rejected the nomination and so  has an influential senator who was regarded as a likely  successor. And finally, Deputy Defense Secretary Perry has been  nominated for the post.    Moreover, President Clinton has no other choice but to agree  to the appointment of a special prosecutor because of the  rekindling of the political fund scandal that took place during  his Arkansas governorship years.    All these concerns may result in the gradual loss of  confidence in the President. And people may lose confidence not  merely in his capability in handling domestic affairs. Some  West European nations have now come to cherish apprehensions  about the United States' foreign and security policies.    In this post-Cold War age with less danger of nuclear  weapons, President Clinton is promoting an economy-oriented  diplomacy while giving priority to safety at home over national  security. Moreover, concerning settlement of regional  conflicts, Clinton has stressed the functions of the United  Nations and the sharing of responsibilities by major countries.    During his address, President Clinton touched on issues  concerning foreign and security policies but his remarks were  made merely in general terms. In addition to touching on the  situations on the Korean peninsula, in China, in former  communist countries, in the Middle East, and in South Africa,  President Clinton stressed the need for providing continuous  assistance to Russia in its efforts for democratization.  However, we had hoped that he would also have touched on the  new role for the United States in his post-Cold War world as  well as on practical measures for settling regional conflicts.    As the President has stated, there still exist dangerous  situations in various parts of the world at present. And for  the United States, which still enjoys a strong influence in this  post-Cold War world, its responsibility lies not only in  tackling the reform of its own domestic administration but also  in taking a strong initiative for the sake of the international  community.</p>

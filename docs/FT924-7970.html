			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: A long-awaited welcome for private sector support - Infrastructure projects financing GREATER use of private finance for public sector infrastructure projects looks, at first glance, to be a notable retreat from a long-held government position. But in reality it is a logical development in public finance that reflects the transformation in the composition of the public sector since the Tories first came to power in 1979. In his recently published memoirs, former chancellor Lord Lawson reveals that Sir Leo Pliatzky, a distinguished former Treasury official who specialised in public finance, was asked in the early 1980s to devise new means of financing nationalised industries. His proposals for bringing private sector funding to state enterprise were found lacking in radicalism by Lawson and Pliatzky's unpublished report was shelved. But his approach is now back in fashion because the privatisation programme has slowed down. The state has been left with a recalcitrant rump of enterprises which defy early privatisation and pose continuing financing problems. There has, in addition, been some retreat from the traditional Treasury hostility to such private financing. The so-called Ryrie rules, which imposed stringent tests for the use of private money in public projects, were abolished in 1989. Yet the consequent loosening in the criteria for using private funds led to only a handful of cases in which private sector money was invested in infrastructure projects. The Autumn Statement's proposals, though somewhat tentative, are intended to lower further the hurdles for private sector financiers. Where private firms are responsible for government-approved projects and are able to recoup the cost through charges at the point of use, the Whitehall mandarins will not apply a value-for-money test against a theoretical public sector alternative. This is important because public sector enterprise enjoys cheap capital thanks to the government's implicit or explicit guarantee. This saddled the private sector with a competitive handicap. The government also appears to have shed some of its ideological antipathy for joint ventures between the public and private sector provided there is a 'sensible' sharing of risks between the two sides. The intention is for the government to specify its contribution in terms of money and risk, and then invite participation through open competition. One ideological remnant, however, is that the state will eschew controlling stakes. Leasing, hitherto used in the public sector mainly by local authorities to dodge the financial constraints imposed by central government, is also to be given wider scope. The more relaxed approach to joint public-private sector financing will no doubt be welcomed by the construction and transport sectors and by the banks. There is a clear opportunity for creative financial engineering. But how great an opportunity is a moot point. One of the reasons why the disappearance of the Ryrie rules had so little impact was that few infrastructure investments hold out much hope of an adequate commercial return. By definition, infrastructure projects like the Channel Tunnel or the Jubilee Line extension are very long term, subject to planning delays and cost over-runs. Private capital is notoriously shy of such high-risk, long term investments. Plans for building toll roads, meantime, have to contend with the fact that the bulk of the existing, competing road network is free. The ability to bring in large amounts of private capital may be contingent on the introduction of road pricing or the imaginative use of government grants. Perhaps the biggest question mark over the viability of the Autumn Statement's proposals concerns the location of risk in the partnership. The government insists that there must be no creative accounting and that the private sector must genuinely assume risk if the sums borrowed or leased are not to fall on the public sector borrowing requirement. The banks and building societies may be able to meet such criteria in financing the government's new plans for the housing market, since the Pounds 750m of houses to be nationalised offer security (albeit with initial valuation problems) and a potential rental stream when let. Elsewhere, there will be complex problems in defining and evaluating risk. The one thing additional private financing will not do for the government is help generate an economic recovery. The impact, if it is more than modest, is unlikely to be felt before the end of the decade.</p>

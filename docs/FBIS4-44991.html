			<p>CSO     [Text] Economic Service -- With all the efforts that were  made to keep the interview with Dr. 'Isa Kalantari from going  too long, in view of the importance of the issues discussed in  this interview, we were reluctant to edit the article too much.    Despite the fact that many issues having to do with  agriculture were discussed, it is necessary to explain that what  you have read and will read today is excerpts from this  relatively long interview.    Following the publication of the first and second  installments of the interview, countless readers contacted the  newspaper wanting to raise other issues with Dr. Kalantari.  However, these readers must realize that it is practically  impossible to discuss all the issues in one interview.    Even so, their questions were sent to the Public Relations  Office of the Ministry of Agriculture, so we can print the  answers after we receive them from the minister of agriculture.    It is worth mentioning that this interview will not be  entirely conclusive unless we interview Engineer Gholam Reza  Foruzesh, minister of construction jihad, and we hope to hold  this interview as soon as possible.    Printed below in this issue you will find the final  installment of the interview with Dr. Kalantari.    [ABRAR] Mr. Minister! With your permission, let us return to  the first part of the interview. You have said repeatedly that  the government has no money. On the one hand you have said that  if the government would invest 900 million tumans over a  seven-year period, many problems would be solved. This would be  120-130 million tumans per year, and we hope that the Majles  deputies, the media, the officials, and the government itself  will give the necessary importance to this important matter. In  this same regard you mentioned that energy subsidies are  useless. Mr. Minister! The elimination of this subsidy for a  people who are crushed beneath the weight of high prices cannot  be a suitable solution. The people are also without money. How  much is this energy subsidy?    [Kalantari] It is 2 trillion tumans per year! I am not  saying  this subsidy should be cut all at once. This should be done  gradually, over a 10-year period. As far as I know, the  government cannot make investments. This is an important point.  With current revenues, with existing expenses, even if the  government wishes to do so it cannot invest any more in  agriculture. We need national investment. The people must be  given a justification. The people must reduce their waste. The  people must not be extravagant.    [ABRAR] The government has asked the people with you, and  they have made reductions. In these 15 years the people have  declared their willingness to make every kind of sacrifice.  But...?    [Kalantari] We did not ask, but our religion has taught the  people not to be extravagant for 1,400 years.    [ABRAR] The people are not extravagant. If what you mean by  extravagance is waste, the people are not to blame. For example,  with regard to wasted bread, it is the bad quality of the bread.  Are you and the government to blame for this?    [Kalantari] This is one dimension of the problem. The  government is also to blame. These very useless universal  subsidies are one of the main factors in the waste. We must not  give the public subsidies in the form of goods. We should pay  money for the goods to the low-income classes. If someone buys  bread at 35-40 tumans per kilogram and eats it, he does not  throw it away, he does not waste it. A baker now makes 1 tuman  profit for each kilogram of bread. Well, for this profit, we  cannot expect him to sell good-quality bread.    [ABRAR] The president of the republic has also said this,  but  we heard that some people asked that we not get into this  subject. Is that correct?    [Kalantari] Of course, those people want to take the easiest  path, not the most proper path. They themselves do not want to  deal with the problem. There are people who do not want to  think. They do not want to put forth a new procedure.    [ABRAR] In what way can cash subsidies be paid to the needy  and deprived, who are said to number about 40 million?    [Kalantari] About 40 percent of the nation's population is  rural. We may not have anyone more deprived than them, but there  is no bread subsidy for this great population (about 20 million  people). They are buying bread at the true price. They are  buying wheat at the same price it is sold to us and making it  into flour and bread. There is no waste in their bread. There is  also a solution for the others.    [ABRAR] Let us talk about agricultural exports. What are the  difficulties now facing exports?    [Kalantari] Currently our food industries have two obstacles  to exports, one is political, the other is hygiene.    [ABRAR] In the first case, I do not think that this is a  serious obstacle, that is if we can export food at international  standards.    [Kalantari] No, you are mistaken. If they are not buying our  oil, does this mean they will buy our lemon juice and catsup?    [ABRAR] Meaning, from this perspective we have a problem  with  the European Common Market?    [Kalantari] Forget about the European Common Market. We have  very little access to that. Consider our neighbor countries.  With knowledge of the market price there, if we sold apples  there at $.50 per kilogram, they would immediately bring the  same apples of the same quality from that side of the world and  sell them for $.20 per kilogram.    [ABRAR] Well, do they do this "dumping" everywhere?    [Kalantari] No! It is only for the products from our  country.  Just as soon as our agricultural products, and just ours, come  in, this kind of competition, which is mostly political, takes  place. Of course this is mostly done with goods that are subject  to spoilage.    [ABRAR] Of the nation's some 51 million hectares [ha] of  arable land, how much is actually being used? Statistics say  that 64 percent of Iran's soil resources, 55 percent of its  water resources, 63 percent of its forest and pasture resources,  and 85 percent of its aquatic food sources are not being used.  Are the statistics correct?    [Kalantari] The 51 million ha is correct, provided we have  water. We now have 7.5 million ha of irrigated agriculture and  about 11 million ha of dry-farmed agriculture.    [ABRAR] Meaning that the country's existing water is not  sufficient for these 51 million ha?    [Kalantari] It is not adequate for 51 million ha. However,  if  we want, we can easily increase irrigated farm land from 7.5  million to 20 million ha, as I said before, if there is  investment, if the government wishes to do so, if the Majles  insists.    [ABRAR] ...and 63 percent of the forest and pasture  resources?    [Kalantari] You should ask the minister of construction  jihad  about that, but I do not think this figure is correct.    [ABRAR] ...and 85 percent of the aquatic food resources?    [Kalantari] I think you should ask the executive director of  fisheries about that.    [ABRAR] We would like to know your view of the claim that if  proper use were made of aquatic resources our country would be  freed of the need to import hundreds of millions of dollars of  food each year.    [Kalantari] I think that we use more than 15 percent of the  sea resources. It is difficult for me to believe this.    [ABRAR] You asked us to ask the minister of the construction  jihad about forests and pastures. What is your view?    [Kalantari] The greatest damage to the nation's agriculture  is the destruction of water and soil. In the future, this will  not only be a cultivation problem, it will also be a major  problem for the nation's industries as well. They are destroying  the country, they are destroying life. Every year 4 billion  square meters, or 400,000 ha, or 4,000 square km, of our  nation's soil is destroyed and...    [ABRAR] And this is negligence by you and the government!    [Kalantari] All of us! It makes no difference if it is the  people, the government, they all go together.    [ABRAR] What did the people do wrong? How can they prevent  the destruction of water and soil?    [Kalantari] It makes not difference. All of us! We do not  notice that our country's soil is being destroyed.    [ABRAR] Well, now we ask you. What should be done to prevent  the destruction of water and soil?    [Kalantari] I say that we valued our country's water and  soil  when we were faced with a foreign enemy and our youth sacrificed  themselves for every inch of our homeland's water and soil. Then  we have thousands of kilometers of our soil being destroyed and  we are silent. Yet it is necessary for us to give this same  importance to our water and soil in the struggle against natural  problems, and not just in the battle with the foreign enemy.  This task does not cost a lot. Its importance has not yet become  evident to the country. The people and the officials are not yet  aware of the importance of this problem culturally and  economically.    [ABRAR] Now that we have become aware of the importance of  the problem, what should we do to prevent heavy losses to our  nation's soil?    [Kalantari] We must determine what are the agents of the  destruction.    [ABRAR] Who should determine that?    [Kalantari] We must determine it.    [ABRAR] You are determining it. Are you studying in order to  prevent this destruction?    [Kalantari] As I said to you before, this task is not one of  the responsibilities of the Ministry of Agriculture, it is the  responsibility of the Ministry of the Construction Jihad.    [ABRAR] Mr. Minister! Thank you for the time you have given  us for this relatively long interview. We hope we have not tired  you.    [Kalantari] I thank you also.</p>

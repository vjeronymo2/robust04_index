			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Merger to raise Kent's industrial development Sir, I noted with interest the article entitled 'Tecs set for bigger industrial policy role' (December 6) by David Goodhart. He is right to observe that the greater role in deciding regional industrial policy given Tecs is a significant move. In Kent we believe that this is an exciting opportunity to enhance and improve training and economic development services in a county undergoing considerable change. But I am concerned by your statement that in Kent the Tec will 'take over the economic development activities of the Kent County Council'. This is not the case. This is a merger between two organisations concerned with economic development. As a result a new organisation will be created, building on the strengths of the existing bodies. It is important that the business community perceives something new and value added, rather than a bolt-on to those that currently exist. Like you, we believe that it may be a template to help shape the formation of organisations elsewhere in the UK. Paul Sabin, chief executive, Kent County Council, County Hall, Maidstone, Kent ME14 1XQ</p>

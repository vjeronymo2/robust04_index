			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA's 5 April "Press Review"] </F>   [Excerpt] Sofia, April 5 (BTA) -- "Army Threatens To  Revolt Against Purge", DUMA writes on its front page. Defence  Minister Valentin Aleksandrov is expected to dismiss some 3,000  officers and 1,000 sergeants. According to DUMA, that might  provoke unrest and even a revolt in the army. According to  TRUD, 3,400 officers and twice as many sergeants will be sacked.  "I have dismissed 200 and I will dismiss more," Defence  Minister Aleksandrov reportedly said at yesterday's meeting of  the National Security Council with the Presidency, writes DUMA.  The minister explained that cuts were inevitable because of the  inadequate budget. Participants in yesterday's [4 April]  meeting suggested that an official declaration be issued for the  press to prevent dismal rumours from spreading in the Army, but  the head of the president's office, Mr. Ivaylo Trifonov, chose  to make a routine and colourless statement, DUMA comments. The  daily points out that the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP, the  former Communists) opposed any "shock measures" before the  coming into force of the Defence Act. 24 CHASA also writes that  BSP leader Zhan Videnov was against the dismissals. A signed  commentary in TRUD analyzes the current situation in Bulgaria  and concludes that a Pinochet-type dictator might fit quite well  in this country. STANDART NEWS reports that the council  discussed the financial and currency crisis. "Politicians and  the president fell out over the foreign debt," it comments. It  also maintains that Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev and  BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva angrily left the session long  before it was over. "The foreign debt issue is not to be  settled at the Presidency; there is a government for that, and  we are no presidential state," said Ms. Ananieva. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Interim growth at Ideal Hardware Ideal Hardware, the dist-ributor of computer storage products, is benefiting from the rapid growth of computer networks and communications systems. For the six months to September 30 the company reported a 34 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.74m to Pounds 2.34m, on turnover 55 per cent ahead at Pounds 45.7m (Pounds 29.4m). Earnings per share rose 33 per cent to 7.51p (5.66p) and the maiden interim dividend is 3.4p. Cash was strong at Pounds 8.8m. The company distributes storages systems for all levels of computer apart from mainframes. Mr James Wickes, managing director, said trading had been strong throughout the period. The price of equipment was falling but customers needed more storage to support larger networks. Mr Richard Jewson, chairman, said since the company floated earlier this year, it had signed distribution agreements with International Business Machines and had been appointed UK distributor for AT&amp;T's personal computers. He said growth had continued despite capacity constraints, adding that, since the second half of the year was traditionally stronger than the first, he was confident of a satisfactory performance for the year.</p>

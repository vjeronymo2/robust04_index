			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>   [Text] The day, 25 June, is the 44th anniversary of the  beginning of the Korean war. Station commentator (Mikhail  Gretov) writes as follows:    The most tragic day in Korea's national history is 25 June.  The Korean war broke out 44 years ago on this day. The South  and North were dragged into a severe war. This war, which  continued for three years, took over 10 million lives. Millions  of people were handicapped and cities and villages were  destroyed. The economies of the South and North were paralyzed.    Throughout the world there are continuous disputes over who  started the war. Probing into the cause of the war is necessary  so that such a tragedy will not be repeated. We must not forget  the fact, however, that the armed conflict between the South and  North was the first example of confrontation of the cold war  era. Using the name of the United Nations, the United States  supported the Seoul side. On the other hand, the Chinese  Volunteers supported the Pyongyang side and appeared at the  battle yard. Also, the old Soviet Union armed the DPRK in all  means. Thus, this war grew into the greatest international  conflict.    The bloodshed war ended with the signing of the Armistice  Agreement, but there is still no peace on the Korean land today  after 40 years. The divided two states of the unitary nation  continue artificial confrontation.    The Korean nation has been appealing for the country's  reunification for the past 40 years, but it seems that  reunification will not be achieved easily. This is because the  political and economic systems of South and North Korea are too  different. Elements of outside forces that instigated  confrontation between Seoul and Pyongyang are gradually  disappearing.    For example, these days the North Korean leadership  proclaimed that it is willing to freeze its nuclear program and  come forth to the third round of talks with Washington. A  sincere and equal principle must be found in the talks to  completely resolve the nuclear issue and improve mutual  relations between the United States and the DPRK.    Preparatory work for the first South-North summit talks is  being carried out actively. Extensive issues must be discussed  at the summit that are directly related to the fate of the  Korean nation. Such a summit will ultimately provide a favorable  basis to make the situation on the Korean peninsula sound.  Also, it will support resolving the task of achieving Korea's  reunification.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: BA's American dream British Airways' acknowledgment that it may have to write down its Pounds 275m investment in USAir is welcome. Prospects for the troubled US carrier look bleak. It would take monumental efforts to achieve the Dollars 1bn a year in cost savings that USAir management has set its sights on. Chapter 11 is a real possibility. BA's preference dividends are vulnerable. But all this is not disastrous. For a start, the benefits from the partnership with USAir - through code-sharing, merged frequent flyer programmes and cost savings - should continue even if the US carrier files for bankruptcy. These benefits, expected by BA to reach Pounds 70m this year, dwarf the Pounds 16m the company receives from its preference shares. Chapter 11 might even present BA with the opportunity to increase its stake in USAir on the cheap, while simultaneously avoiding many of the regulatory hassles the company has hitherto experienced in its US expansion strategy. The Clinton administration could find it harder to turn down BA if it was rescuing a bankrupt company. Meanwhile, the rest of BA's business performs strongly. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 301m in 1993-94 contrast sharply with the red ink staining most rivals' accounts. In the current year, traffic will continue to grow as the airline market's recovery gathers pace, though prices will be held back by continuing overcapacity in the industry. The management is also maintaining pressure on costs, with another Pounds 150m in cuts promised this year. In the longer run, BA's continental European operations should add to earnings. Deutsche BA and TAT will soon move into profit. And much as BA screams blue murder about state aid to rival European airlines, it seems likely that one way or another the British carrier will come out of the row with increased market share.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hanson abandons flotation plans for Ertl Hanson has been forced to abandon the flotation of Ertl, its US-based toy maker, because of difficult stock market conditions. The conglomerate had been hoping to raise about Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m) from the partial US flotation as part of its debt reduction programme. It is thought it will now try for a trade sale, though a deal is unlikely to be clinched for some months. When Hanson announced the plan in August it was hoping to sell 63 per cent of its holding, at Dollars 16 a share, valuing Ertl at about Dollars 216m. Even at that stage analysts viewed it as a full price for a company which had pre-tax profits of Dollars 14.1m on sales of Dollars 186m in 1993. The price represented 21 times historic earnings. Ertl, a leading US toy maker, is best known for its die-cast tractor models and Thomas the Tank Engine. It also makes the successful Bumble Ball toy. Hanson acquired Ertl with Kidde in 1987 after a proposed Dollars 89.5m sale to Tonka collapsed. A trade sale is likely to be at a lower rating than the planned flotation. But it would enable Hanson to sell all of the equity rather than retain a stake as is customary for such a flotation in the US. The proposed deal had a similar structure to the Beazer Homes USA flotation, Hanson's US housebuilding business, which was completed earlier this year as part of the group's strategy of reducing debt by disposals. Following last year's Pounds 2.2bn acquisition of Quantum Chemical, Hanson's debt jumped to Pounds 3.4bn, pushing its gearing to 86 per cent. But because of disposals and good operating cash flow analysts expect debt to have been cut to about Pounds 2.5bn by Hanson's September year-end, for gearing of about 50 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Barbara </F> Schmid in Bonn; date not given: "Kinkel: Solidarity Tax To End  After Three Years?"]    [Text] There is a looming controversy in the Bonn  coalition over tax policy. In the following interview with BILD  AM SONNTAG, FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel contradicts Chancellor  Helmut Kohl, who announced that the solidarity surcharge would  be levied for an indefinite period of time as of 1995.    [Schmid] In Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein, the Free  Democratic Party [FDP] foundered on the 5-percent hurdle. Do  you not have to fear that your party will be voted out of the  Bundestag?    [Kinkel] I am sure that we will do fine in the Bundestag  election. I think that we might achieve a double-digit result.    [Schmid] Why should the people vote for the FDP?    [Kinkel] Those who want to prevent a grand coalition or an  alliance between the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  and the Greens must vote for the FDP. We support the  medium-sized enterprises, particularly in the new laender, we  fight against the hostility toward technology, and we are making  sure that Germany will not fall into insignificance because, for  example, gene and biotechnology research is absolutely  neglected. Plus, we support hard work and elitist performers.  The upper half of taxpayers provide 90 percent of total tax  revenues.    [Schmid] The tax burden will increase next year as a result  of the solidarity surcharge....    [Kinkel] We must take some burden off the people who are  filling the coffers. This is why, in my opinion, we should  reexamine after three years whether the solidarity surcharge  should still be necessary.    [Schmid] What is the FDP's view on a 130 km/h speed limit  for highways?    [Kinkel] We are against general speed limits. One must not  take the pleasure of driving away from people. There is no  point in reducing the speed on the few kilometers of highway  that do not have a speed limit yet. I also enjoy driving, and  sometimes I like to drive fast, too. Besides, I am also in  favor of keeping the legal blood alcohol limit of 0.8 per  milliliter.    [Schmid] There will be a lack of 8 billion German marks [DM]  to finance the debts of the federal railroads as of 1996. Will  the gasoline tax be increased?    [Kinkel] Increasing the gasoline tax would be poison for the  economy. I am against it.    [Schmid] Why is the FDP making so much fuss about a  coalition statement?    [Kinkel] We will make this decision at the party congress in  Rostock in early June, where we will also outline the future  course of the FDP.    [Schmid] Friends within your party, such as Juergen  Moellemann, have accused you of being too close with the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU], and have called for  confrontation with Kohl.    [Kinkel] In difficult times we have done very good work in  the coalition with the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU]. The  voters do not appreciate if somebody suddenly begins to  hysterically dance on the table before the election. I am for  efficient work and against show performances. We will very  clearly emphasize the differences between us and the CDU/CSU.  We are calling for double citizenship, for example, for an  immigration control law, and less rigid guidelines for  naturalization. We must quickly reconstruct our social system  because otherwise it will strangle us. Still, nobody will be  stripped of justified social benefits. We also have to make it  clear to the people that the percentage of elderly people in the  German population is constantly increasing -- in the year 2000,  25 percent will be 60 and older -- and that fewer and fewer  children are being born. This means that we have to think about  the treaties between the generations, because a shrinking number  of young people has to take care of an increasing number of  elderly.    [Schmid] Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger has  said that criminal Kurds must not be deported. FDP legal expert  Burkhard Hirsch and FDP Vice Chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt are in  favor of deportation. So what is the FDP's position on this  issue?    [Kinkel] Several hundreds of thousands of Kurds enjoy the  right to be guests in Germany and have to behave accordingly.  Those who incur a penalty here must be taken to court and  prison. Under our law and under the circumstances, deportation  is only possible in absolutely exceptional cases. It has to  ensured that he who is deported is not threatened with torture,  the death penalty, or any treatment that is inconsistent with  the principles of the law-governed state. Within the Federal  Government we are examining whether this can be or is guaranteed  on the basis of a treaty or agreement. The justice minister  said nothing else.    [Schmid] The Turkish Government has signed international  agreements; nevertheless, people are tortured there.    [Kinkel] Yes, unfortunately violations of human rights do  exist in Turkey. Now as then there are reports of torture in  police prisons. It is particularly because we have had friendly  ties with Turkey for decades, because it is our partner in NATO  and has an important bridging function, that the protection of  human rights has to be called for openly. This is what I have  done and what I will continue to do. The last time I did it was  the day before yesterday in a long telephone conversation with  the Turkish foreign minister, who, by the way, is a Kurd himself.</p>

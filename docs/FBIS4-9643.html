			<p>BFN     [Text] We have received the following faxed communique  from a Romanian Government spokesman:    The Romanian Government notes with interest and appreciation  the clarifications made by the former sovereign's secretariat in  its letter of 16 April 1994, in which the former sovereign  informs the Romanian authorities of his desire to pay a visit to  Romania for the Easter holidays, thus emphasizing the particular  nature of the visit and the fact that he does not intend to  contest the current constitutional order. On this basis, and  proceeding from its determination to work for national  reconciliation, the government invited Romania's former  sovereign to visit the country and expressed its readiness to  ensure the proper organization and development of the visit.    The invitation was accepted, in principle, by the former  sovereign of Romania, agreeing that the details of the  organization, the place, and the program of the visit should be  worked out later. During the discussions held with the  representatives of the former sovereign, the Romanian  authorities presented several proposals, which took into  consideration the desires expressed by the former sovereign and  also arranged--with the appropriate protocol and organizational  level--his activities, accommodations, and participation in  religious services for the holy Easter holidays, as well as  various meetings with people wanting to see the guests during  the visit. The proposals forwarded by the Romanian authorities  also envisaged the adequate protection and safeguarding of the  guests as well as the avoidance of any actions liable to lead to  a disturbance of the public order or the violation of the  constitutional order.    Despite all of the arguments presented and the repeated  assurances about the Romanian Government's readiness to best  ensure this visit within the framework of its initially declared  purpose, the representatives of the former sovereign eventually  refused to continue the dialogue and go ahead with the visit  under the accepted conditions. The Romanian Government regrets  that the Romanian authorities' readiness for dialogue and  goodwill did not meet with an appropriate response, the  communique of the government's spokesman concludes.    The former sovereign of Romania has renounced his intention  to visit Romania for the Easter holidays, George Antoniade,  representative of the former Royal House, announced at a news  conference. He was authorized by the former sovereign this  morning to interrupt his talks with the Romanian authorities in  connection with the planned visit to Romania. The reason given  for this decision was that the proposals of the Romanian  authorities on the organization and program of the visit were  becoming increasingly more restrictive. Mr. George Antoniade  said that, despite the amiable tone in which his negotiations  were conducted, as the representative of the Royal House for the  talks with the Romanian authorities, he found the alternatives  offered by the latter for the visit unacceptable.</p>

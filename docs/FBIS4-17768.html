			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Rustam Narzikulov report under the "Privatization" rubric: </F> "`Gazprom' Up for Grabs at Auction. Check Investment Funds To  Be Banned From Taking Part in the Privatization of Russia's  Largest Company"]    [Text] The Russian Federal Property Fund has announced the  commencement of accepting applications to take part in a check  auction to sell the Gazprom Russian joint-stock company. The  applications will be accepted from 25 April to 1 May.    At yesterday's press conference devoted to the event, State  Property Committee Chairman Anatoliy Chubays called the  privatization of Gazprom "an absolutely unprecedented event,"  because, according to his estimates, the auction will absorb at  least 20 million privatization checks, that is, at least 13  percent of their total number. Some 40 percent of Gazprom's  total number of shares will be kept by the state for three  years. Around 34 percent of the stock will be offered for sale  at check auctions; 10 percent will be bought by Gazprom at face  value; 15 percent will be sold under closed subscription to the  Gazprom joint-stock company's workers collectives; and the  remaining around 1 percent of shares will be owned by the  "Rosstroygazifikatsiya" gas distribution company. A noteworthy  feature of the company's privatization is that around one-fourth  of all shares will be sold in Tyumen Oblast. The shares of other  Russian oblasts range from 1 to 4 percent.    The State Property Committee chairman pointed out in the  press conference that check investment funds will be banned from  taking part in the check auction to sell Gazprom stock, because,  Anatoliy Chubays stressed, there are plenty of other attractive  targets for the funds' activity. Regarding the possible  profitability of Gazprom stock and possible dividends for future  shareholders, Rem Vyakhirev, chairman of the company's board,  said that he did not expect large percentages, because the  shareholders' main advantage would be the growth in the shares'  market value.</p>

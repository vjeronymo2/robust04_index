			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Regulatory Confusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission does not believe that implementation of the Series 42 will result in regulatory confusion. As a preliminary matter, neither the Act nor the NASD Rules require the NASD to develop jointly an options examination with the options exchanges. Although uniformity of tests across self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') would be the most efficient means of ensuring industry competency, an SRO is still capable of developing an exam to cover its particular membership. In this regard, the Act permits the NASD to develop an examination that tests the qualifications of individuals associated with NASD members to trade options. <FOOTCITE>60</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 60 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> If the NASD determines that it is unable to maintain the quality of the Series 42 so that the examination adequately tests the competency of representatives to effect transactions in options, the NASD should discontinue using the examination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also disagrees with the assertion that regulatory concerns are raised by the fact that the options exchanges may not recognize the validity of the Series 42. The Commission believes that implementing the Series 42 is not inconsistent with the options exchanges retaining the Series 7 as their basic qualification requirement for exchange member firms. <FOOTCITE>61</FOOTCITE>  Use of the Series 42 by the NASD to test the qualifications of its members to trade options does not diminish the options exchanges' authority to determine the qualifications of their own members to trade options. The exchanges can continue to require exchange members to take and pass the Series 7 examination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 61 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As the NASD notes, it is likely that most full service firms will continue to opt for the Series 7 examination for their representatives. See NASD September 27 Letter,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 8. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission further disagrees with the assertion that individuals registered with NASD member organizations could recommend listed options transactions trading on an exchange without the exchange knowing that such individuals have the requisite knowledge to do so. As discussed above, the Commission believes that the Series 42 is adequate to test the training, experience, and competence of representatives regarding all types of options transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Commission does not believe that there will be increased legal liability on options exchange members because they accepted orders from representatives of NASD-only members who, although not Series 7 qualified, had passed the Series 42 exam. Implementation of the Series 42 will not alter the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> status quo  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> as far as these options exchange members are concerned. These services are currently provided to NASD-only members who have completed only the Series 62 and the Put &amp; Call Questionnaire. The Commission has not been aware of any case in which an exchange member has incurred liability based solely on the fact that the exchange member provided clearing and execution services to a non-Series 7 registered NASD member broker-dealer. The Commission, therefore, does not believe that replacing the Put &amp; Call Questionnaire with the Series 42 will increase the potential for exchange member liability in this regard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Limited Access to Options Markets <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission disagrees with the assertion that implementation of the Series 42 would result in limiting investor access to the options markets by erecting artificial barriers that could impede or deny access by customers to closely inter-related products because their representatives had not been qualified to trade them. The Commission believes that the Series 42 increases investor access to the options markets because it provides representatives that are only Series 62 qualified with a procedure for becoming qualified to affect transactions in options without having to take the Series 7 exam. Further, the Commission believes that the Series 42 provides better testing for qualified representatives than the current Put &amp; Call Questionnaire administered by firms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, the Commission believes that the Series 42 exam is an appropriate exercise of the NASD's statutory authority to ensure qualification of its members. The exam itself is sound and tests options knowledge in depth. Despite the objections of the options exchanges, the Commission does not believe there is a regulatory reason to disapprove the Series 42 exam as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons set forth above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a registered securities association, and, in particular the requirements of section 15A, <FOOTCITE>62</FOOTCITE>  and the rules and regulations thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 62 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78o&hyph;3 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It is therefore ordered,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, <FOOTCITE>63</FOOTCITE>  that the proposed rule change (SR-NASD-89-16) is approved contingent upon the NASD's updating of the exam as necessary to reflect the changes that have occurred in the options markets since the time that the Series 42 was originally proposed ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> new products) and the Commission's review of the revised examination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 63 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 64 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

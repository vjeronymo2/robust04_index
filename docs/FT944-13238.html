			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: More like nationalisation Sir, Mr Digby Jacks (Letters, October 27) resorts to Newspeak in his anti-privatisation drive. He attributes pensions mis-selling to 'the headlong rush to privatise everything, including occupational pension schemes'. If my memory serves, occupational pension schemes had already been 'privatised' for many a long year, and it was increasing regulation which set personal pensions alight. In particular, the regulation of private employment contracts, including the unilateral voiding of existing contracts, made it possible for an employee to leave an occupational scheme without leaving employment. Sanctity of contract is a sine qua non of private enterprise, and regulation is a close relative of (indeed it is a form of) nationalisation not privatisation.

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / IoD sees surge in confidence THE SURGE in business confidence late last year has continued in the first two months of this year but the government must avoid inflationary pressures in the Budget, according to the Institute of Directors. Its report is reinforced by other surveys published today, which detect an improvement in business and consumer confidence but, wary of proclaiming green shoots, warn that it could be shortlived. The institute found that 51 per cent of the 305 directors questioned were more optimistic about the outlook for the economy than they were six months ago, compared with 38 per cent in December and 10 per cent in October. The only region where the level of confidence fell was the Midlands, where 48 per cent were more optimistic compared with 50 per cent in December. Since December, when the institute argued that interest rate cuts were needed to end the recession, base rates have been reduced by 1 percentage point to 6 per cent. According to today's survey directors are even more confident about their own companies than about the economy - 60 per cent are more optimistic than six months ago, compared with 48 per cent in December, with the rise in confidence detectable in all sectors. Only 11 per cent are less optimistic, particularly in the Midlands. But fewer directors report that their company has been investing - 49 per cent in February compared with 53 per cent in December and 52 per cent in October. Consumer confidence is recovering slowly a survey by PA Cambridge Economic Consultants published today shows. 'There are indications that a turning point has been reached' it concludes, and the quarterly survey's index of confidence has seen the first rise since June 1992 to 75.2, up from 72.8 in December. Of the 1,000 people questioned, 12.4 per cent expect their financial position to improve in the next three months compared with 9.3 per cent in December - 20.8 per cent expect it to get worse, but that is down from 25.9 per cent in the last survey. Unemployment continues to be the greatest worry for 38.2 per cent compared with 41.1 per cent in December. A new index of activity in consumer industries launched this week by NTC, the research group, also suggests that the consumer sector is recovering. NTC reports that the index has been rising sharply for the past five months because of increases in retail sales, TV advertising, share prices and recent interest rate cuts. A more cautious note is sounded in the survey published today by the Finance &amp; Leasing Association. It reports that 64 per cent of members have seen a rise in confidence in consumer lending, compared with 8 per cent in October, but nearly two thirds of members report no change in business lending and 'a mood of caution' about the future. FLA members, who handle about 30 per cent of all UK fixed investment and 80 per cent of lending outside clearing banks and building societies, expect demand for unsecured personal lending and for small-scale business lending to rise in the next three months. But Infolink, the consumer credit information group, warned: 'Consumer confidence may well falter in the run up to the Budget on March 16'.</p>

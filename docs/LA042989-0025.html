			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHBISHOP MAHONY'S LETTER AND ABORTION ISSUE  </P> <P> How ironic that on the same day Mahony writes to criticize your editorial  supporting abortion there is an article on the Op-Ed Page entitled "Infant  Mortality: A National Disgrace." The column, by Sen. Bill Bradley, states,  "More than 40,000 American babies die every year, most of them needlessly . . .  (due to) poverty, ignorance and neglect."  </P> <P> Where is Archbishop Mahony? Where is the Catholic Church? Where are the  anti-abortion "pro-life" marchers who want to see Roe vs. Wade overturned?  </P> <P> Where is their conscience when it comes to protecting those who have been born  and either die within the first few months due to "poverty, ignorance and  neglect," or go on to become abused or discarded as a result of "poverty,  ignorance and neglect?" I'd like to see them put an end to the needless  slaughter (physically and mentally) of the born.  </P> <P> And while they're at it, why don't they adopt a child who is considered  unadoptable? A child who is no longer an infant, a child who is handicapped, a  child who is in an institution because no one has loved him/her enough to keep  him/her from becoming a problem child or a criminal.  </P> <P> GARY DONTZIG  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

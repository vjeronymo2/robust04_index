			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Caution urged on sales figures SHOPPERS continued to flock to the sales yesterday, but retailers warned against reading too much into sales figures from the past two days. Many said Monday's high turnout resulted largely from the good weather and the bank holiday. One Marks and Spencer manager said: 'People had got fed up at home, they were full of turkey, and they all came out on Monday to see what bargains they could find.' Mr Tim Daniels, managing director of Selfridges in London's West End and chairman of the Oxford Street Association, said yesterday's number of customers was probably 20 per cent to 25 per cent lower than the exceptional figures recorded on Monday, but this was normal for the second day of the sales. Mr Daniels said menswear was selling particularly well - something also reported by the House of Fraser chain of department stores. 'Menswear had a disastrous second half-year. I think people were saving up for the sales,' he said. Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the electrical retailer, agreed that shoppers had been saving for the sales and said frantic bargain-hunting seen on Monday might be a signal of the continuing lack of consumer confidence. Elsewhere there was more encouraging news. At the Lakeside Shopping Centre in Thurrock, Essex, Mr Brian Lucas, manager, said that after a slower start the number of vehicles in the car park was 10 per cent up on Monday. Mr Gordon Allanson, manager of Eldon Square shopping centre in Newcastle upon Tyne, estimated yesterday's visitors at 200,000, the same as Monday. Gateshead's MetroCentre reported 165,000 customers on Monday - a record for a bank holiday and 20,000 up on the first day of the sales last year. Yesterday's figure was expected to be similar to the 117,000 recorded on the second day of the sales last year. Mr Ron Woodman, the centre's marketing manager, said he believed spending yesterday would be about two thirds of that on Monday - when some retailers reported takings 20 per cent up on the equivalent day last year.

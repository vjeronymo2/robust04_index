			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Observer: Sir Owen stands down Three cheers for Sir Owen Green. The chairman of BTR, one of Britain's great post-war industrial success stories, has always been a bit of a maverick. He shuns talking shops like the CBI and has some pretty extreme views when it comes to the corporate governance debate. But when it's time to retire, he is a model company chairman. Whereas the likes of Lord Hanson and Glaxo's Sir Paul Girolami feel that they owe it to their shareholders to soldier on well past retirement, Sir Owen plans to bow out quietly next spring. BTR has a rule that no directors can stand for re-election after they are 65. Since he will be 68 next year, Sir Owen automatically forfeits his seat on the board when his current term expires. BTR, formed out of the old Birmingham Tyre and Rubber Company, has been going for close on 100 years. But it was not until Sir Owen came on board in the mid-1950s that it began to motor. Along with his key lieutenants - John Cahill (now chairman of British Aerospace), Bowater chairman Norman Ireland and the late Don Tapley - Sir Owen built BTR into one of Britain's top dozen companies. He more than anyone can feel proud of what he has created - a company employing 140,000 people and with a market capitalisation bigger than ICI's. His annual salary of Pounds 217,000 is modest by comparison with Lord Hanson's Pounds 1.4m. It will be interesting to see how BTR copes with Sir Owen's departure. In terms of boardroom upheavals it is not like Lords White and Hanson quitting their company. BTR has had an outside chairman before - Sir David Nicolson did the job for 15 years until 1984 - and it has changed its chief executive twice since it split the roles in 1986. BTR has shown that it can handle the succession question. Even so, finding a successor could prove difficult since BTR has never gone in for non-executive directors. Cahill and Ireland are too old and Alan Jackson, the current chief executive, is too untested to be allowed to combine the chairmanship as well. In most big companies a potential chairman would have had at least a couple of years on the board to get a feel of his new company. If Sir Owen is to be faulted it is for not preparing the ground well enough.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Jericho waits for its president: Arafat keeps world guessing about timing of his arrival First Voice: Do you think he will come today? Second voice: Yes I am sure he will come. In recent weeks it has been easy for many people in the Holy Land to believe they have got caught up in a conversation between the characters in Samuel Beckett's play Waiting for Godot. Waiting for Yassir Arafat has become an obsession. Every day brings a new rumour that Mr Arafat, the veteran PLO chairman and almost mythical embodiment of Palestinian nationalism, is about to set foot in Jericho. And at the end of every day there is renewed speculation about tomorrow. Everybody is waiting for him - the Palestinian people, the international press, the embryonic Palestinian government and the Israeli authorities. Almost every project seems to be on hold until Mr Arafat's triumphant arrival - billed as one of the greatest media events of 1994. Mr Arafat was widely expected to return to Jericho shortly after signing the May 4 Israeli-PLO peace agreement for Gaza and Jericho in Cairo. Last month, he said he would not go to Jericho until international aid donors produced their promised funds. The donors gave the PLO Dollars 42m earlier this month, and Mr Arafat has since maintained a solid silence about his plans. The most convincing explanation about Mr Arafat's indecision is that he is worried that as soon as he steps foot in Jericho the decades of myth and legend that have surrounded him will begin to wear off. 'He is going to have to govern on a practical day-to-day basis and with every day he will diminish,' said a senior PLO official. Despite the uncertainty, almost every Palestinian official claims to have spoken to him 'just hours ago' and to know the date of his arrival. 'Of course I know when the president will come,' said Col Jibril Rajoub, head of the PLO internal security forces in the West Bank. 'The question is not when President Arafat will come but whether I will tell you. I certainly won't tell you.' Even in Tunis, among Mr Arafat's closest confidants, there is widespread confusion about his plans. Almost everybody, including Suha, his wife, has packed their bags in anticipation of making the journey home at short notice on the whim of Mr Arafat. 'The truth is that Arafat will probably make a decision in the early hours one morning and we will all be given a couple of hours notice,' said one senior PLO official. 'That's his way of doing things to prolong the mystery he likes to surround himself with. Usually not even his pilots are told where we are going until we are airborne.' Israeli television reported last week that Mr Arafat would arrive with King Hassan of Morocco and King Hussein of Jordan, both descendants of the Prophet Mohammed, and with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. Israel has officially denied any plans to allow Mr Arafat an early visit to Jerusalem. In Jericho, where Mr Arafat is known by the nickname 'The Traveller,' the arrival of the president is taken more philosophically. 'Today, tomorrow, next month - it doesn't really matter,' said Mr Isaac Shawa, a storekeeper. 'We are used to waiting. He will come - that is the only thing known.' Meanwhile everybody is cashing in. Stores around the central square are doing a brisk business in Palestinian flags, stickers and T-shirts. Journalists are scrambling for roof space above the square to record Arafat's every move, A one-square metre piece of roof, just big enough for a tripod, is going for three thousand dollars for photographers. Television networks are paying Dollars 20,000 to Dollars 30,000 for a whole rooftop to set up satellite link-ups for a live broadcast of Mr Arafat's return.</p>

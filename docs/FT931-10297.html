			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Observer: Who was who Italy's Socialist leader Bettino Craxi, who only a year ago was seen as a presidential contender, has been dealt a further blow. He is to be struck out of the 1993 Italian edition of Who's Who when it's published in September. Craxi is under investigation on four counts of corruption and violating laws on the financing of political parties. He denies any wrongdoing but the politically correct Italian edition of Who's Who is not taking any chances with his reputation or its own.</p>

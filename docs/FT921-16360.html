			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Letter: Losing out Sir, How many companies suffering after customers have gone into receivership, have lost both goods and payment due to the actions of appointed receivers? Our experience is twofold: first, being told that goods cannot be identified; second, that goods have been incorporated into other units and cannot be identified and returned or paid for. Is this so?

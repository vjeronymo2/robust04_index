			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Immigrants become issue: Spain ANTI-immigrant sentiment is increasing, according to government opinion polls, writes Peter Bruce in Madrid. There have been about 15 serious racist attacks this year, directed mainly against north African and Latin American immigrants. Far-right parties in Spain have won little support in elections, although some political analysts say their support is growing. There are five main right-wing groupings. Only one, the Falange, has stood in elections, polling 0.12 per cent of the national vote in the last general election in 1989. Most racist violence is carried out by groups of youths who appear to have no party political affiliations. Among recent attacks, masked men shot an unemployed Dominican immigrant in Madrid earlier this month. This week the home of another Dominican immigrant was burned down north of Madrid. On November 20 an Egyptian man was thrown down an embankment in Madrid, breaking both his legs. About 400,000 immigrants live in Spain legally and and about another 300,000 illegally.</p>

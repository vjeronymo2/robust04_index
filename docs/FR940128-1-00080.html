Economic Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 compels agencies to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost-benefit analysis as a component of decisionmaking. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Flexibility Act requires regulatory relief for small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> businesses where feasible. FDA finds that this proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitutes a major rule under both Executive Order 12866 and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Flexibility Act. A summary of the preliminary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory impact analysis (PRIA), which may be obtained from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dockets Management Branch (address above), is presented below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order 12866 requires Federal agencies to justify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the need for regulations by demonstrating that the problem that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulation is designed to remedy cannot be adequately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed by measures other than Federal regulation. In its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review of such alternatives, FDA finds that the current system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (periodic inspection plus sampling of a small proportion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood), coupled with the uncertainty in estimating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illnesses related to seafood, has not adequately ensured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers that a minimum level of safety has been established.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the tort system is not able to provide remedies for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unsafe seafood, the price system provides some differentiation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between products based on brands and retail reputation. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the price system works in conjunction with current Federal regulation which signals consumers as to a minimum level of seafood safety. As is argued in the preamble, countless public arguments and attempts at legislation imply that the minimum levels that some consumers believe they are getting (those that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not search for higher levels) is probably higher than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual levels of seafood safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The tort system fails because consumers are often unable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trace either the source of their foodborne illness to seafood,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and even where that is possible, it is often difficult to trace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood to a specific company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> A. Regulatory Options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> FDA has evaluated multiple options to address the compelling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public interest in further ensuring seafood safety. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options include: (1) Maintaining the existing approach_``snapshot'' inspections and sampling; (2) significantly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing the frequency of both snapshot inspections and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sampling under the existing approach; (3) beginning a voluntary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP program in addition to the existing approach; (4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning mandatory HACCP for high risk products only, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to the existing approach; (5) beginning mandatory HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for all seafood (the proposed approach); (6) beginning a more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive mandatory HACCP program than that proposed, similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Model Seafood Surveillance Project (MSSP), which would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include all CGMP's, quality factors, and economic fraud as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical control points; and (7) beginning a mandatory water-to-table HACCP program which would include all vessels, carriers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and retail food operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

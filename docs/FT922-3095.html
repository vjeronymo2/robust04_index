			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / (CORRECTED) Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Death duty again Correction (published 20th June 1992) appended to this article. MY FATHER died in 1954 leaving an estate now valued at about Pounds 400,000 in a family trust for my sister and me to inherit on the death of our mother. Our mother is still alive and is living as a life tenant from an income of approximately Pounds 30,000 per year, although she only draws Pounds 12,000 a year of this and the family trust pays her income tax. Will my sister and I be liable to pay any inheritance tax when out mother dies? Death duty was paid at the time of my father's death. On the death of the life tenant (your mother) inheritance tax will be payable on the value of the settled fund as if she had been the absolute owner of the fund. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible. Correction (published 20th June 1992) AN incorrect reply was given in the item last week headed 'Death duty again'. It ignored paragraph 2 of schedule 6 to the Inheritance Tax Act 1984. The correct position as stated in Chapter 7.17 of the Inland Revenue IHT 1 booklet is: 'Where estate duty was paid on the death of one spouse on property in which the other was given a limited interest, for example, for life or widowhood or widowerhood, the property was usually exempt from estate duty on the death of the survivor. In such a case when the survivor dies, or the interest comes to an end or is disposed of, there will be no charge to IHT on the settled property if it would have been exempt from estate duty on the survivor's death.' IHT would not be payable on the death of the life tenant on the value of the settled fund as described by our reader.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--President Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan  arrived in Ankara on Thursday [5 May] for a stopover on his way  to Baku from Brussels.    Aliyev had been in Brussels to sign the so-called  Partnership  for Peace, a half way accommodation for former Warsaw Pact  countries wanting to join NATO.    Addressing reporters on his arrival in Ankara Aliyev said he  believed this arrangement with NATO would contribute to a  solution of his country's dispute with Armenia over the enclave  of Nagorno-Karabakh.    He added that he had wanted to meet with President Suleyman  Demirel on his return from NATO and had decided on a brief  stopover in Ankara for this purpose.    The two presidents held talks over a working lunch at the  Presidential Palace in Ankara. Aliyev left for baku after the  lunch.    Talking to reporters at a press conference in Brussels on  Wednesday Aliyev said his country was considering seeking  observer status, or even full membership, of OPEC.    Aliyev added that Azerbaijan's future relations with the  12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may be  decided by talks that started in Istanbul on Monday, between the  Azeri state oil company and Western petroleum companies. He  said Azerbaijan could "in the very near future" sign contracts  with Western companies to develop his country's oil reserves.    Azerbaijan was a major source of oil for the former Soviet  Union.    Although the main oil facilities lie outside the disputed  territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, Aliyev added that Azerbaijan's  oil industry had been hurt by the impact of the country's bloody  six-year conflict with Armenia.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Another Group 4 prisoner escapes POLICE WERE last night searching for another prisoner who escaped yesterday from a court guarded by Group 4 Court Services, Britain's first private prison-escort service. The man fled from Sheffield magistrates' court shortly after being sentenced to 14 days in prison. Group 4 said one of its custody officers suffered facial injuries while trying to prevent the escape. Yesterday's incident increased to five the number of escapes since Group 4 took over prisoner-escort services last week in the east Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside. Another two prisoners have been wrongly released. At a meeting with Group 4 on Thursday Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service, held the company responsible for only one of the first four lost prisoners. Further problems with the Group 4 contract since the meeting will, however, add considerably to pressures on Mr Lewis and Home Office ministers, who are facing opposition ridicule over the escapes. The issue is certain to be raised by MPs when Mr Lewis and Mr Peter Lloyd, the Home Office prisons minister, appear before the cross-party Commons home affairs committee on Monday.</p>

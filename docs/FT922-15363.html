			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: Lower costs benefit Trafford Park Lower administration costs and reduced interest charges led to Trafford Park Estates increasing pre-tax profit from Pounds 1.44m to Pounds 1.62m for the half year to December 31 1991. Full benefit of the savings was partially offset by charging the interest for the Cambridge Quayside development against profits, when previously it was capitalised. Turnover fell to Pounds 4.95m (Pounds 6m). Earnings per share were 1.672p (1.435p) and the interim dividend is held at 0.85p.</p>

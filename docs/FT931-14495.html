			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: Escada to sell US knitwear holding ESCADA, the troubled German fashion group, is to sell its stake in St John Knits of the US by April, Reuter reports from Munich. Escada, which last week declined to comment on reports that it planned to sell its stake of 83 per cent in St John, said the deal should be completed by April. The fashion company plans to use the proceeds of more than DM100m (Dollars 61.7m), to offset losses in the 1991-1992 year. It said in the year ended October 31 1992 it would suffer an operating loss of DM20m at the parent company and one of just under DM23m for the group, of which DM17m was due to currency changes. Escada has been hit by the weak economy as well as by currency turbulence. Founded by the late Mrs Margaretha Ley (she died in June last year) and her husband Wolfgang in 1976, it was one of the great success stories of German business in the mid to late 1980s. The company was enthusiastically received when it came to the stock market in 1986 and between 1989 to 1991 its sales doubled to DM1.36bn. It added that it was still undecided whether the 83 per cent stake would be sold to a group of investors, placed on the stock market, or sold to the Gray family that founded the company. St John, the high quality knitwear business Escada bought in 1989, has about 1,500 employees and turnover of Dollars 81m. The company said group turnover was about DM1.4bn, up from DM1.36bn previously. Mr Hans Woetschaetzke, deputy chairman, said considerable value adjustments had to be made, especially in foreign subsidiaries. Together with the operating loss the total burden could be 'slightly above' DM100m, he added. The company said it could not consider paying a dividend. The goal is to break even in the year ending October 31 1993.</p>

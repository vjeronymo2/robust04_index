			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets </F> by correspondent Chernyshova; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Chernyshova] Oleg Nikolayevich, the press has been  discussing the recent expanded government session for already  more than a week. One can say that the government is not in a  hurry to be involved in this discussion. If we summarize all  statements, I think that probably the main claims to the adopted  budget will be the absence of the mechanism of its realization.  Representatives of the right- and left-wings as well as heads  of administrations have been talking about this. Do we really  have this mechanism of fulfillment of the budget and the plan  for 1994?    [Soskovets] During the week after the government session, a  group of Presidium members and representatives of regions that  were formed to finalize this resolution worked on changes in the  nature of this document in order to elaborate those mechanisms  that would allow us to realize everything that was said -- the  president's message and a speech by the government chairman.  These proposals that were formulated in this document, as a way  to realize those critical remarks, are very specific.  Undoubtedly, we believe that the mechanism of fulfillment of  this document and this program of reforms that are now at a new  stage, is closely connected with the strengthening of the role  of the state and discipline, which is necessary for the  fulfillment of some certain requests by the state and economic  subjects. I believe that at this stage our citizens should  consider this as the next stage and the next specific step by  the government in order to form a new life in Russia.    [Chernyshova] Oleg Nikolayevich, as far as I understood now,  the government has determined its priorities in the development  of the economy. Is this true? I mean these sectors that the  state will support financially. Observers say that they are  afraid that this may lead to a new round of inflation.    [Soskovets] As far as the military-industrial complex is  concerned, of course, we will not manage without those capital  investments and budget allocations that are now necessary to  carry out these reforms in our military industry which, I  believe, is very important. Of course, some additional money  will be needed, but we will not be able to create all the  conditions that are necessary for our Armed Forces without  supporting the production of the military-industrial complex.  As far as agriculture is concerned, we really need a deep  reform there. On the one hand, it takes time and on the other,  these losses that we had last year were connected with the fact  that there was not enough fuel and lubricants, as well as  necessary equipment during the harvesting period.    [Chernyshova] As I understand, you later widened the  allocation of money both to the defense industry and  agriculture, right?    [Soskovets] According to the principles of budget formation  for 1994 regarding these two articles of the budget, we  proceeded from the level of expenditure in 1993. I think that  these decisions will be justified at this stage. In order to  continue with conversion and re-specializing, we need to spend  money.    [Chernyshova] The state, represented by the government,  keeps  emphasizing all the time that the social sphere will be a  priority in 1994. When one starts looking at the budget,  article-by-article, one realizes that not much money has been  allocated to the social sphere in any of them.    [Soskovets] We have not yet abandoned the old principles of  management in this sphere. We will use every possibility to  insure the implementation of this policy of developing the  social sphere. The situation was aggravated by the fact that  many social infrastructures that were supported by industrial  enterprises now become municipal property, which requires  additional expenditure from local budgets. Arrangements will  have to be made to support them from the federal budget. All  these issues are undoubtedly a weak point of this message. We  are working on tidying it all up.    [Chernyshova] You know, it is inconceivable that the  government, having made normal and reasonable decisions, allows  the situation when none of them is carried out. There is no  executive or financial discipline anywhere.    [Soskovets] I think that this is the result of the loss at a  certain stage of the capability to manage and the state's  participation in the formation of these relations. If you take  countries with long-established market relations, there is no  division there between the interests of the state and of some  kind of economic entity. There is no such thing anywhere.  Unfortunately, it happened in our country. I would like to  dwell on three examples of the restoration of the necessary  discipline in the state. I would, of course, put the discipline  with regard to the payment of wages to employees at the top of  the list. A resolution describes the degree of responsibility  of managers who leave their employees without wages for several  months and, of course, the mechanism of forming guarantees for  compulsory payment of a certain level of wages in cases when  enterprises' bank accounts are affected to a greater or lesser  extent by nonpayments.    With regard to financial discipline, I would like to point  out that one of the main issues of the day is how to organize  tax collection. At present, the system has not yet been  perfected by the Finance Ministry, the Tax Inspectorate, or the  Tax Police. The Currency Control Committee has put forward  specific proposals, envisaging visits to the regions, to  individual areas we in the government have already determined,  in order to disclose all the irregularities in this matter --  this might even lead to contracts being cancelled with those  heads of enterprises who had, to some extent, taken advantage of  the current lack of state supervision. So, order will be  restored in these relations.    The State Committee for the Management of State Property was  instructed to draw up a system under which contracts will simply  be cancelled with hardened tax dodgers, and new managers will be  recruited for those enterprises.    The resolution regulates relations between commercial banks  and those enterprises for which they have to provide financial  guidance and backing. Numerous examples of delays and mistakes  in economic relations show the lack of commitment on the part of  commercial banks to the productive activity of enterprises. The  Russian Central Bank was asked to draw up a system under which  banks like this would lose their license to conduct specified  kinds of financial activity.    [Chernyshova] Now probably the final question, Oleg  Nikolayevich. You have mentioned the industries the government  intends to provide with additional funding. Why then do you say  that by the end of the year inflation will be no higher than 10  percent?.    [Soskovets] Well, you know, we...    [Chernyshova, interrupting] After all, you are making the  hole in the budget even larger.    [Soskovets] Through our actions, through our actions, we  still hope to change the situation with Gross Domestic Product.  This should be the starting point. The fact is that the ratio  of the budget deficit to the GDP, with such a low volume of  production, when dozens of enterprises, that is potential  tax-payers, are currently shut down, does not allow one to say  that with a significant drop in the GDP, stabilization of the  budget deficit can be achieved. Our task today is to step up  production at those entities that contribute to the formation of  the budget. I believe that if we tackle this task correctly, we  will achieve success. For nowhere in the world of developed  market economies does a state allow the enterprises that bring  the state close to bankruptcy to operate. This then is our task.    [Chernyshova] Thank you.</p>

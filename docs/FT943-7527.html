			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Revenue to seek advisers' views The Inland Revenue is planning to canvass the views of professional advisers on how effectively it administers the tax system. The survey will be the fourth in a series as part of its efforts to meet its obligations under the Citizen's Charter to improve its service to taxpayers. The project will cover accountants, lawyers and other 'agents' who are involved in preparing corporate and personal tax returns and are in regular contact with the Revenue. The survey is likely to be carried out towards the end of the year. The intention is to find out what the agents want, how far those requirements are met by the Revenue, and how well the agents believe the tax system operates. The Revenue will not be seeking views on the nature of taxation, which is seen by officials purely as a political topic to be handled by ministers. In line with the previous surveys, and to ensure that the answers provided are candid, the work will be carried out by an independent market research company following a competitive tender. The Revenue has already surveyed the views of employers, pensioners and taxpayers in general. The first survey, carried out in 1992, found that taxpayers' greatest concern was for the Revenue to get its tax assessments right first time without the need for lengthy discussions with officials.</p>

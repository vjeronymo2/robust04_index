			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Groupe Bull offshoot seeks to win back Dollars 740m US deal ZENITH Data Systems is seeking to regain Desktop Four, the Dollars 740m (Pounds 487m) US air force personal computer contract awarded under new Pentagon procedures designed to speed procurement. ZDS, the US-based PC arm of Groupe Bull, the French state-owned computer maker, was denied the contract on Christmas Eve after appeals against the award were upheld. Mr Thomas Buchsbaum, ZDS federal systems vice-president, said: 'Even though two out of the mass of protests were granted, we are still in a better position than anyone else on Desktop Four'. Desktop Four is being closely watched as the first example of the Pentagon's fast-track procurement policy. For Groupe Bull, still losing money heavily, it represents additional revenue and a powerful confidence booster. The contract was let first in 1991 to two US companies, CompuAdd and Sysorex Information Systems. When appeals against that decision were upheld, the contract was given to ZDS in September 1992. Competitors including Compu-Add and Apple again appealed but ZDS, which supplied PCs under Desktop One and Desktop Two, believed its position was safe. It was surprised last week when the appeals were upheld. Desktop Three went to other vendors. The appeals board has now published excerpts from its ruling which show that ZDS failed on two counts: First, the video monitor it proposed to supply with the 300,000 PCs in the contract did not comply with the Trade Agreements Act, a measure designed to ensure substantial US labour content in systems assembled from offshore components. Second, the board did not believe the Air Force had given enough consideration to sourcing its PCs from more than one supplier. Mr Buchsbaum said ZDS intended to appeal against both rulings. He said he was certain ZDS monitors met and exceeded the legal requirements of the Trade Agreements Act. There were well-recognised benefits to the government of a single vendor policy including lower prices, greater compatibility between systems and decreased training requirements. Mr Robert Dornan of Federal Sources, a marketing consultancy specialising in government business, said the onus now lay on the Air Force to clarify its requirements.</p>

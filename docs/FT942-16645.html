			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (5): Moving into sharper focus - Markets and suppliers When Imperial Chemical Industries pulled out of IDAC, a Pounds 50m joint venture in Germany with Du Pont, the US chemicals giant, in January, it was one of three events finally defining the structure of the world's paint industry, after 12 years of turmoil. IDAC was set up in 1988 to attack the Pounds 650m European market for painting cars on the assembly line - automotive OEM, or original equipment manufacture. The venture failed to reach the 20 per cent market share ICI needed to justify staying in the market. Another of the three events had already deprived ICI of its seven-year-old title as the world's biggest paintmaker: in November, Akzo of the Netherlands took over the coatings business of Nobel of Sweden, astutely merging two portfolios of products that had little overlap between them. Akzo, however, is not obsessed by 'sizism,' as the third event showed: it sold its European automotive OEM business to PPG, the market's US-owned world market leader. Automotive OEM is now dominated in Europe by PPG, and the German paintmakers BASF and Herberts. ICI and Akzo Nobel are both strong in another branch of automotive paints - vehicle refinish, or VR, where ever-higher technology coatings are used for repairing damaged vehicles. Mr Louis McCulloch, senior partner of James Consulting, an independent specialist on the paint industry, says their exit from OEM was like slaughtering a sacred cow. The two main pillars of the paint industry are the entirely separate markets of decorative and automotive paints. The former is a low technology, high volume cash generator; the latter is a high technology industrial market, where partnership and symbiotic technical services are essential between paintmakers, vehicle manufacturers and the suppliers of painting equipment. Like Mr McCulloch, ICI's former OEM partner Du Pont, and OEM competitors like PPG, BASF and Herberts, all believe the OEM and VR markets are interdependent, if only to get car manufacturers to recommend specific companies' VR products as part of their anti-corrosion guarantees. Mr Herman Scopes, chief executive of ICI Paints, disagrees: 'Of the 10 top VR companies in the world, four - ICI, Akzo, Sherwin Williams and Rock Paint  -do not have any OEM. The link is more perceived than real,' he says. His doubters say Sherwin Williams and Rock are each rooted in their large, respective home markets of the US and Japan - and were the exceptions proving the rule. ICI and Akzo retort that the markets are entirely different. There is only a tiny number of car manufacturers worldwide, but thousands of body shops. Distribution, service, logistics and the ability to handle tens of thousands of small transactions efficiently are what count, as Sherwin Williams has proved in the US. Companies like Akzo and ICI are used to transplanting marketing skills in decorative paints around the world and are well up to this, apart from being good enough chemists to match thousands of colours and guarantee their work, whatever coatings technology was originally involved. The debate symbolises the latest stage of evolution in paint markets. Even 15 years ago they were still largely national, with thousands of companies. International spread was mostly based on the history of European colonialism. In the 1980s, ambitious suppliers of industrial coatings realised they had to follow their customers as markets regionalised under political forces like European union, or globalised under cost and efficiency pressures, as in car manufacture or repainting ships. Boats, trains, planes, cars and cans were all affected. A rush for territory and presence began, led by BASF of Germany and ICI of Britain. Others, such PPG of the US, which had developed the most corrosion-resistant electro-coated system yet for car bodies, started buying their licensees abroad. If you could not dominate territory, you occupied specific product niches. Courtaulds, which leads the world marine coatings market, set a trend by occupying its niche on a global scale, followed by PPG in automotive OEM. Theirs has proved the best policy because they did not suffer corporate indigestion as they grew by acquisition. Moreover, their research was focused on markets likely to yield early returns because they could introduce new products or technology without a fight. By contrast, ICI developed Aquabase, a good waterborne paint for automotive OEM, but could not dislodge entrenched European competitors, even though they were struggling to catch up with 'me-too' products. Du Pont, which has a strong OEM and VR base in the US, will carry on alone. Companies are refocusing on what they do best and where they can be in the top three in a world or regional market. They have to: industrial buyers are reducing numbers of suppliers - in the case of Ford, to one per factory. So ICI has also sold its aerospace coatings business to Courtaulds, now a leading transportation coatings specialist. In the US, Akzo sold its aerospace business to Dexter, but took over the latter's coil coating interests, while the two formed a joint venture in aerospace in Europe. ICI's focus is now on its Dulux brand of decorative paints, VR, and can coatings, where it is the US leader and strong in Europe against BASF. Similarly, the Swedish-owned Beckers has strengthened in European coil coatings, but sold its powder coatings business to Herberts : each was separately strong in three or four countries but neither had enough volume; Herberts is now strong in powder in eight European countries and will become an increasingly important regional player. By the same token, other companies abandoned low-margin decorative coatings, where mass marketing is needed for sales volume and reasonable profits. Hoechst set the trend here, selling Berger to Crown in the UK in the 1980s. Similarly, Tikkurila of Finland sold Macpherson  - Woolworth's paintmaker - to Akzo to concentrate on Kemira, its industrial coatings business. If economies of scale offer the best prospects in these decorative markets, big companies are best placed to achieve them. ICI is a strong marketeer of premium brands to consumers and trade painters. Akzo absorbed a series of medium-sized companies in the 1980s, then took over Casco Nobel, which - in the UK - had already absorbed Crown, which had already absorbed Berger. Other successful decorative paint companies like Johnstones passed into French ownership, with Total now an international player. Petrofina, the Belgian oil giant, is also in the big league through Sigma Coatings. Independents can survive, but they have to be very good, such as Kalon, which makes 'own-label' paints for DIY retailers. Its forte is good logistics to ensure just-in-time distribution. Small can still be beautiful, but your niche must be so unworthy of a giant's attention, you will not be stamped on or swallowed. An example is Carr's in Birmingham, or Weilburger, the UK subsidiary of the medium-sized Grebe group of Germany. The latter's strengths are in teltronics - matt-black, fingermark-proof coatings for TV and video recorder cases - painting plastics and high performance coatings for household durables. And the role of the environment in all this? Not only does compliance with green laws cost money, but also research and development time - and there is little direct return. Companies can only afford to spend resources on markets where they have enough sales volume or margin to carry their 'dead' investment in the environment. Every company's focus is likely to tighten further yet.</p>

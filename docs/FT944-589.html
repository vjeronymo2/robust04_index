			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Travel: Cuba, cash-strapped and jerry-rigged - Nicholas Woodsworth visits a small town where everyone lives in the past, and even lighting the kitchen stove is a challenge Is there any sense to the world of holiday travel? Not a great deal, I decided as we banked in low over a palm-fringed coast and oohs and aahs of anticipation rose from the throats of 200 French-Canadians. Cuba is not for everyone, it seems - especially not for Cubans. In the last few years the threat of imminent extinction - by sharks, by storms, by shipwreck, by exposure or drowning - has done little to deter tens of thousands of Cubans from hopping into flimsy rafts and paddling madly out to sea, away from Cuba. One has to wonder what even greater threats at home push them to so desperate a form of travel. Or does one? No one aboard this Canadian holiday charter flight seemed to be wondering at all. As we touched down on Cuban soil at Varadero airport, an entire plane-load of rowdy pleasure-seekers broke into enthusiastic applause. There were cheers and whistles all round. It was as if we were arriving in the promised land. A couple of days passed, and I began to realise that for recession-bitten, snowbound Canadians, we indeed had. Varadero, Cuba's largest beach resort, was everything their travel agents promised - the cheapest Caribbean package holiday on offer. With the US market out of reach, Canadian budget tourists are among Cuba's best customers. What matter if Cuban tourism is ruled by institutionalised inefficiency, by a sort of Manana-Marxism? What matter if the showers are temperamental, if service is as slow as maple syrup in January? The rum is cheap, the white sand beach is 20km long, and the winter sun shines with a kindness that can make a grown Canadian cry. I soon got the hankering to try a different kind of tourism. I am as fond of sea and sun as anyone else, but quickly grew tired of the hotel barbecue-and-cabaret-show atmosphere. How often can you listen to 'Guantanamera', after all, without feeling it is time to move on? What about a little conventional tourism, I wondered, some sightseeing around the island? It seemed easy enough to arrange. There were car hire agents and travel advisers sitting bored to tears behind hotel lobby desks. 'Take a jeep,' they urged me, smiling reassurance and thrilled to have a customer. 'Visit historic Trinidad.' And so I did. It was not long, though, before I discovered that there is little of the conventional about any holiday travel in Cuba. ***** Why, I wondered as I barrelled along the Ocho Vias - the great eight-lane motorway that cuts a swathe down the middle of the island - was mine the only vehicle on the road? Was the highway closed? Had there been flash floods, earthquakes, some other dreadful calamity? But no, I realised after driving 100 more kilometres and spotting at least a dozen other vehicles - this was just another day in cash-strapped, jerry-rigged, muddle-on Cuba. Desertion by the former Soviet Union and four years of economic crisis has left little transport in Cuba. There is not much petrol. There are few spare parts, few private cars, few state trucks to get produce to the hungry cities. Roadside hopefuls stand for hours flagging down anything on wheels. Drivers resort to prayers, bits of old wire and constant roadside tinkering. Not even the state itself, it appeared, was immune to breakdown - outside Jaguey Grande, I passed two grey-uniformed policemen sweating under the hot sun as they patiently pushed their little East German-built police car down the road. Near the town of Aguada de Pasajeros, I turned off the motorway towards the sea. Some four hours away, at the foot of the Escambray hills, lay the little town of Trinidad. If the Ochos Vias indicated Cuba's drift away from the modern age, life along these smaller country roads seemed to presage its return to a pre-industrial past. Heading for sleepy, tin-roofed villages where nothing moved, paired bullocks drew wooden carts along at infinitesimal speeds. By the roadside an unhusked rice harvest lay drying in the sun. Egrets hunted for frogs at the edge of sugar cane fields. Straw hats perched on their heads and machetes swinging from their belts, men on horseback rode out of the towns to tend their crops and herds of hump-backed Zebu cattle. The whole perspective was so unhurried, so timeless and so close to the margins of subsistence that were it not for the bright blue Caribbean nearby I might have thought myself in one of the more forgotten corners of Africa. The impression of a return to some sort of pre-consumer age only strengthened as I drove along the cobbled streets on the outskirts of Trinidad. 'Jabon] Jabon]' housewives appealed loudly to me from their front doors. It is not only soap that has recently disappeared from their daily lives; if rural Cubans eat better than the citizens of Havana, the manufactured essentials of modern life - everything from shoes to light bulbs to cooking pots - are often out of reach. Half an hour later I was standing in Luz Garcia's kitchen while she made me coffee. With the household rationed to just one small box of matches per month, even lighting the stove to boil water had become an exercise in ingenuity. Beside the stove Senora Garcia kept a little metal dipper with a twist of cotton at its end. To get a flame she removed it from the bottle of alcohol in which it sat soaking and ran it lightly over the two exposed wires of a live electrical cord. There was a short circuit, a crackle of sparks, and suddenly, a flame. The trick was not to short out the lights at the same time. The other trick, of course, was to ensure there was a supply of cooking gas to ignite, no mean feat in Cuba these days. In order to keep their household functioning, the Garcia family scout out tourists like me. With the dollars earnt from accommodation and meals, they are able to supply their more pressing needs. The Garcia's house was a large, airy building with vastly high ceilings. Need had transformed what had once been a courtyard rose garden into a courtyard vegetable garden. But inside there were still intimations of a far more opulent past. There were doors and furniture of cedarwood, coloured glass windows, and large diamonds of black and white Italian marble on the floor. Everyone in Trinidad, said Senor Garcia, lives in the past. In their determination to preserve their 16th-century Spanish colonial town, residents here would not change a shutter or a tile. It was not so surprising, he added. Trinidad looks back to the golden age when slave labour and more than 50 sugar plantations brought vast wealth and European sophistication to an isolated town. When mechanisation sent world sugar prices plummeting in the 1850s, Trinidad's better-off citizens sailed away and the town, cut off by the surrounding Escambray mountains, was left to its memories. It was untouched and forgotten for a century. The 1950s brought not only the first road to the town, but Fidel Castro's revolution. So set in their ways and ferociously resistant to change were Trinidadians by this time that many took to the Escambray where they waged counter-revolution. They were wiped out after a bitter five-year campaign, but Trinidad's conservative bent remains. And so a walk later that afternoon proved - the past was everywhere in Trinidad's colonial churches, convents, towers, squares, courtyards and cobbled streets. Each pastel-tinted house, with its wrought-iron window grills, carved wooden beams and iron-studded doors was a small museum in itself. A little treasure, the town has been declared a site of world cultural heritage by Unesco. But will the world come flocking to Trinidad on the strength of it? It appeared unlikely to me that evening when I visited the town's most popular watering-hole. In La Canchanchara bar, the oldest building in town, normal service was held up as local hotel, bar and restaurant workers met to thrash out problems. There was no transport to the Escambray resort hotels high in the hills - should employees hitchhike, apply for lorry transport, wait for Havana to do something? The argument raged. In the end it appeared that bicycles were the most realistic, if also the most exhausting option. No sooner was a vote to be held on the matter than the room went pitch black. Power failures in Trinidad are almost as common as cuts to the town's water supply. The vote was summarily cancelled until the next meeting, and the workers filed noisely out. A candle and a drink were eventually found. I sat in the quiet meditating on the day. The past was all very well, I thought, but in subtle doses. Cuba seemed so far plunged into a confusing darkness that for the moment there were few signs of where the future lay. I sat a few minutes more watching bats swooping about the ceiling of La Canchanchara, then drained my glass and felt my way back through cobbled streets to bed.</p>

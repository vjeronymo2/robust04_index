			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BACKERS OF TAX IN CAPISTRANO UNIFIED SAY IT WILL BE CLOSE  </P> <P> Backers of a measure on the ballot Tuesday that would raise property taxes in  the Capistrano Unified School District are sure that voters in bedroom  communities of southern Orange County know the value of an education.  </P> <P> They are just afraid that many of them, especially those who commute long  distances to work, will not make it home in time to cast their votes on the  measure aimed at raising money to build new schools and refurbish old ones.  </P> <P> "I just get nervous that people will forget and assume that their neighbors'  support or their spouse's support will take care of the 'yes' vote," said  Sheila Benecke, chairwoman of the political action committee formed to campaign  for the measure.  </P> <P> "It is going to be tight," Benecke said. "I think the votes are there, but the  fear I have is that people will say, 'Oh, I wanted to do this, but I forgot,'  or they won't get back to town on time, (and) we will have 'yes' voters who  won't show up to vote."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Special-Tax District  </P> <P> The measure would make all of Capistrano Unified a special-tax district to  raise funds for new school construction in the fast-growing area. Creation of  such a district -- known as a Mello-Roos district -- requires approval of  two-thirds of the voters. Very few localities in the state have given a  two-thirds vote to such proposals in recent years.  </P> <P> If the measure passes, it would raise property taxes $100 a year on existing  single-family homes, and $60 a year on existing condominiums, apartments and  mobile homes. Owners of single-family homes built after the election would pay  $200 more a year, and owners of new townhouses, mobile homes and apartments  would pay $120 a year. Senior citizens would be exempt from the new taxes.  </P> <P> Existing commercial and industrial buildings would be assessed 6 cents more per  square foot in taxes, with new buildings being assessed 12 cents more.  </P> <P> The election would raise $85 million over 25 years and would enable the  district to build three elementary schools, a junior high school and part of a  high school.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overcrowding Problem  </P> <P> Capistrano Unified officials said they put the measure on the ballot because  the district has a severe overcrowding problem that will only get worse because  of the rapid rate of new-home development in southern Orange County, where most  of the county's undeveloped land is concentrated. Capistrano Unified Supt.  Jerome R. Thornsley said the district's enrollment is expected to grow by 7,000  students by 1992.  </P> <P> The campaign for the measure has been targeted to key voters in the sprawling  school district, which stretches from Laguna Niguel to the San Diego County  line and includes the cities of San Clemente, Dana Point, Mission Viejo, San  Juan Capistrano, and the communities of Rancho Santa Margarita and Capistrano  Beach.  </P> <P> Benecke said there are 94,000 registered voters in the district but that  campaign organizers are being careful only to send out literature to those most  likely to vote, particularly those who voted in the last election.  </P> <P> "We certainly don't have the funds to communicate with all these (94,000)  voters by mail," she said.  </P> <P> Benecke said the committee, which has enlisted the help of a political  consulting firm, has so far spent about $50,000, money that has been raised  through donations from parents, most of which has been collected by mail  solicitations. "We spend only as we raise it," she said.  </P> <P> The most recent effort to raise taxes for schools in Orange County went down to  defeat when voters by a ratio of 3 to 1 rejected Westminster School District's  proposed $1.4 million tax levy on March 7. Westminster's Measure A would have  raised $100 per property owner and $200 per business to repair the financially  strapped district's aging facilities and restore budgets cuts. The levy would  have expired in 10 years.  </P> <P> Although there have been other Mello-Roos special taxing districts created in  Orange County, including some for housing developments within Capistrano  Unified, Tuesday's election will be Orange County's first for a school  district. The Westminster district measure would have raised money directly for  the district's general fund, not through creation of a special district  empowered to issue bonds as Capistrano Unified would be.  </P> <P> Thornsley said a few other such elections have been successful in other parts  of the state. He said the Elk Grove School District in north-central California  lost a Mello-Roos election the first time around but got approval of two-thirds  of its voters within the last year.  </P> <P> Thornsley said no organized opposition to the measure has surfaced so far, but  he added that he fears some voters will see a 'no' vote on the measure as a way  to stop the areas's fast growth.  </P> <P> "There are some people (in the Capistrano district) against growth," he said.  "Some people think that if we don't get the funds, the growth will stop. That's  erroneous. The people will still come."  </P> <P> Both Benecke and Thornsley say they are counting on parents in the generally  affluent district to make the connection between quality education and adequate  classroom space, which requires more money than is currently available.  </P> <P> "The educational level and sophistication of our parents is quite high,"  Thornsley said. "They know firsthand the value of an education -- that it's not  just an expenditure, but an investment."  </P></p>

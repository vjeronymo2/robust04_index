The finding of no significant impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410&hyph;0500.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Federalism Executive Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federalism, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has determined that the policies contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the notice is not subject to review under the Order. The NOFA merely sets forth funding availability for HAs to conduct, at their discretion, risk assessments for lead paint hazards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

Families could benefit from this funding action as a result of the identification of immediate and potential lead-based paint hazards; that identification will ultimately lead to a safer environment. However, since the impact on the family is not necessarily significant and is beneficial, no further review is considered necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D.

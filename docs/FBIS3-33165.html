The Presidential Press Secretariat announced that  Bustamante would be replaced by Foreign Minister Efrain  Goldenberg.    Bustamante, who had been appointed president of the Council  of Ministers in August, tendered his resignation six days after  the promulgation of a law that granted military courts  jurisdiction over the "La Cantuta" case, an incident in which  human rights were seriously violated and in which members of the  Peruvian Armed Forces have been charged.    The Presidential Palace communique indicated that new Prime  Minister Goldenberg will assume his post this Thursday while  continuing to hold his post as foreign minister.    President Fujimori also accepted Education Minister Raul  Victor Alfaro's resignation, who just two days ago denied any  disagreement in the government regarding the La Cantuta case.  The new education minister will be Jorge Reyes. [passage  omitted]</p>

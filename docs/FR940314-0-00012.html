			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, REA recognizes that reimbursing Borrowers only 80 percent of funds expended ``up front'' for community development projects, in order to achieve Borrowers' 20 percent required contribution to RLFs, may place an undue financial burden upon some Borrowers and discourage program participation. In addition, REA recognizes that requiring Borrowers to initially exhaust their financial resources, as well as the REA grant funds, will result in no available funds for Borrowers' revolving funds during the first year or two of operation until payments from the funded community development projects are received. Therefore, REA has modified the proposed rule in &sect;1703.22(h)(2), ``Requisition requirements'', to remove the 80 percent reimbursement provision and allow for full reimbursement of Borrowers' expended funds for approved projects funded. However, consistent with the supplemental funding requirements for individual projects, as well as revolving loan funds set forth in the proposed rule, Borrowers' supplemental funding requirements to the revolving loan fund will be maintained. Accordingly, paragraph (a)(5) in &sect;1703.22 of the final rule has been added to require REA Borrowers establishing RLFs to submit a commitment, in the form of a board resolution, to provide supplemental funding, referred to as ``additional funding'' in an amount no less than 20 percent of the REA grant approved. The Borrower will be required to provide documentation that the additional funding has been deposited in the appropriate account in &sect;1703.22(h)(1) of this final rule prior to grant disbursement. This paragraph also reiterates the requirement in &sect;1703.22(g)(2) in the proposed rule requiring additional funding be retained within the revolving loan fund. Additional funding for revolving loan funds may be retained initially as non-Federal funds for any rural economic development project(s), subject to the normal requirements outlined in &sect;1703.22(g). For example, for a $400,000 revolving loan fund grant from REA, the Borrower may requisition 100 percent of REA's portion of eligible project costs. However, the REA Borrower will commit at least $80,000 (20 percent of $400,000) of additional funds to be used for rural economic development projects in accordance with an approved rural development plan for non-Federal funds. Since the Borrower's funds provided as additional funds may be considered non-Federal monies and not subject to ``Federal monies'' restrictions for the Rural Economic Loan and Grant Program as outlined in the regulation, the REA Borrower can retain a worthwhile degree of flexibility to fund projects during the first year of the revolving loan fund. It should be noted, however, that as with pass-through zero-interest loans and grants, projects funded with Federal grant funds under the revolving loan provision will be subject to the supplemental funding requirements as outlined in &sect;1703.23 of the Rural Economic Loan and Grant Program regulation. As pointed out in the comments, REA recognizes that many projects may have limited sources of supplemental funding available. In this regard, therefore, REA has provided a provision in &sect;1703.22(a)(5), whereby Borrowers, with prior approval from REA, may use all or a portion of their additional funding to assist project owners receiving funding through the revolving loan provisions to meet their supplemental funding requirements required by &sect;1703.23. In this case, such additional funding will be considered as Federal funds and subject to the requirements and restrictions of the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, several technical changes have been made to the proposed regulation for clarification as follows: (1) Section 1703.21(d) has been revised to clarify that excess interest returned to REA will not be used to reduce principal indebtedness. (2) For revolving loan funds, &sect;1703.22(a)(4) has been revised to clarify that reasonable servicing fees may be charged regardless of whether Federal or non-Federal funds are involved. (3) Section 1703.20(a)(8) has been revised to clarify that the overall restriction for using zero-interest loan and grant funds for payment of Borrower salaries is subject to the operating expense allowance for revolving loan funds. (4) Section 1703.22(h)(1) has been revised to add to the accounting requirements, additional ledger accounts to record interest income. (5) Section 1703.22(g)(2) has been clarified to require Borrowers to retain interest earned from non-Federal funds within the revolving fund to be used in accordance with their approved Rural Development Plan and Scope of Work Plan. (6) Section 1703.22(g)(3) has been revised to require REA Borrowers that terminate the revolving loan program without obtaining approval by the REA Administrator to return the amount of the original grant to REA. (7) Section 1703.22(h)(2) has been revised to delete the requirement for account ledgers to be submitted as a prerequisite for requisitioning grant funds for revolving loan funds. (8) Section 1703.66(g) has been revised to require REA Borrowers to include in their legal documents the requirement for project owners to provide sufficient financial, accounting and budget information and other records deemed necessary to facilitate audits in accordance with 7 CFR part 3015 and 7 CFR part 3016 for non-profit entities, and REA rural economic development loan reviews for projects in a for-profit status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1703  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Community development, Grant programs_housing and community development, Loan programs_housing and community development, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Rural areas. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set out in the preamble, chapter XVII of title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1703_RURAL DEVELOPMENT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

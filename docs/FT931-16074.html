			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Minister sees new hope in US airline row MR JOHN MacGREGOR, transport secretary, yesterday signalled a new phase in attempts to resolve the dispute with the US over air services, saying he looked forward to working towards a more liberal agreement on flights with the incoming Clinton administration, David Owen writes. Speaking in Brussels, Mr MacGregor renewed calls for UK airlines to be given greater access to the US domestic market. He acknowledged this would present the US with 'difficult decisions' about changing their restrictions on foreign ownership and control of US carriers.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Courtyard Leisure to raise Pounds 284,000 Courtyard Leisure, the USM-quoted wine bar and restaurant operator, is making board changes and seeking to raise Pounds 284,000 through an open offer and subscription. The move follows increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 196,000 (Pounds 58,000) for the six months to September 30. There was a net interest charge of Pounds 30,000, against income last time of Pounds 25,000. Turnover increased to Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 805,000) mainly the result of acquiring a further wine bar in March 1992. Mr Jonathan North, chairman, said costs were being cut but it was thought new capital was needed. An open offer of 3.48m shares at 10p on a 1-for-3 basis is being made. Mr Ali Safa, at present joint managing director, and Ennerdale Trust will subscribe for the shares not taken up. In addition, Mr Safa and Mr Brian Chandler are being offered options on 248,000 shares at a minimum 15p.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (2): Economy is maintaining its momentum  -There is steady economic growth at a rate consistently above the national average and the continuing benefits of investment from outside the state - helped Tennessee to shrug off the nation's shallow recession in the early 1990s. The same factors are now propelling steady economic growth at a rate consistently above the national average, in turn supporting a gradual rise in state-wide living standards towards the US norm. During 1993, while the US economy as a whole grew at 2.9 per cent, the Tennessee valley region - covering Tennessee and some rural counties in six neighbouring states - advanced 6.4 per cent, according to Mr Juan Gonzalez, a senior economist for the Tennessee Valley Authority. In the state of Tennessee itself, the number of jobs rose about 4 per cent during the year, while job growth in the country as a whole reached only 3 per cent. The state's unemployment rate over the same period fell from 6 per cent to about 5.5 per cent, while the national jobless rate dropped from 7 per cent to 6.5 per cent. Tennessee's unemployment rate has remained below the US rate for the past three years. This steady growth owes much to the state's success since the early 1980s in positioning itself as an attractive manufacturing base. New car plants operated by Nissan - which began production in 1983 - and General Motors' Saturn division - 1990 - and the car parts suppliers attracted to the state by these facilities, have underpinned the growth. The upturn in the US vehicle industry last year had much to do with the state's overall economic performance. Even though Tennessee has failed to win recent 'trophy' facilities - a BMW plant, being built in South Carolina, and Mercedes-Benz, in Alabama  - its parts suppliers should still benefit from the strengthening of the car industry in the Southern states. Now, about 23 per cent of Tennessee's jobs come from manufacturing, compared with a US average of 16 per cent. The influx of new jobs came at a vital time. The recession of the early 1980s cost the state one out of every six of its goods-producing jobs, mostly in the textile and leather industries. Those jobs have never returned: employment in textile and related industries has continued to fall, dropping another 15,000 in the past five years to about 85,000 now. But while Tennessee's manufacturing sector has bucked the national norm, the real job growth of the past decade has come - as it has in other states - from services. And most of those service jobs have come in metropolitan, rather than rural, areas. Both Nashville and Memphis, for example, have strong healthcare industries. Nashville was home to the largest private US hospital group, HCA, until the company was taken over by Columbia last year. 'Clearly, healthcare has been part of the success of the urban area,' says Mr John Gnuschke, director of the business and economic research bureau at Memphis State University. Memphis, for its part, has developed into an important distribution centre. Although it has failed to match the explosive development of Nashville in the past two or three years, it has experienced 'slow steady growth, associated with slow, steady population growth,' says Mr Gnuschke. Mr John Kelley, president of First Tennessee Bank, reports 'moderate growth - but with it has come stability, which isn't all bad.' Nashville, meanwhile, has benefited from playing host to both the state government and the country music industry, as well as a disparate range of service and manufacturing industries. The property US slump of the late 1980s, though hurting Nashville more than other urban centres in the state, was not as devastating as that experienced by many other US cities - nor was the over-building as extreme. As a result, Nashville once again has a thriving construction sector and has regained a strong self-confidence, buoyed by the growing popularity of country music. The advantages that have stood the state in good stead over the past decade may not be sufficient on their own to sustain the momentum. The benefits of growth - higher personal incomes, for example - are undermining one of the traditional arguments for basing business in the state: a low-cost workforce. By the end of 1992, the average hourly wage in the state was Dollars 10.12, compared with a US level of Dollars 11.45. The attraction to manufacturers of non-unionised labour may also be less than is commonly perceived: about 17.5 per cent of workers in manufacturing jobs in the state are unionised, compared with 21 per cent for the country as a whole. 'Cheap labour is only any good (at attracting jobs) if it is really cheap,' says Mr Bob Margo, an economics professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. As wage levels have risen, Tennessee has begun to turn its sights to better-quality jobs - and in the process discovered that its skills base may not be adequate. 'What we have to do to get competitive is improve our education,' says Governor Ned McWherter. Like other Southern states, its public educational system is straining under years of under-investment. A recently launched programme to improve standards, particularly in rural areas, will take years to have an effect. In the meantime, the quality of the local workforce remains one of the main concerns of employers in the region. A comment by Mr Lewis Nolan of Schering Plough's healthcare division, located in Memphis, is typical: The education system 'needs improvement - we have to do a good deal of remedial education here,' he says. There are other, more specific challenges. First, Tennessee's economy could be more vulnerable than the US as a whole to a rise in the value of the dollar. According to Mr Gonzalez of the TVA, 14.3 per cent of the area's jobs are in industries which are vulnerable to import penetration - such as textiles - compared with 5.6 per cent in the nation as a whole. Second, both east and west Tennessee face local threats. Each has its share of poor rural counties, for example, and each has suffered from being far removed from the perceived centre of state life, in Nashville. In the eastern part of the state, the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge facility, which employs 16,000, could shrink fast in the years ahead as its budget is cut back. Efforts are under way to foster new high-technology industries in the area, using the extensive skills of Oak Ridge. 'The potential is very great - and the downside (from lost jobs) could be very bad,' says Mr Richard Riebling, the state's commissioner for economic development. Memphis, meanwhile, faces its own challenge from the south: the advent of river-boat gambling in nearby Tunica county, Mississippi. With Tennessee's ban on gambling unlikely to be reversed in the near future, Tunica will become a powerful draw for leisure dollars that were previously spent in Memphis. Memphis, like many other US urban centres, is also beginning to feel the pinch from spending cuts in healthcare: the Baptist Memorial Hospital, the largest in the area, has cut 1,000 jobs in the past year and a half, and has some 'pretty significant cost reductions in mind,' says Mr Stephen Reynolds, the hospital's president.</p>

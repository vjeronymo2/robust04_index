			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Zagreb, March 10 (AFP)--Bosnian Croats said  Thursday they would not accept a federation with Moslems in  Bosnia-Herzegovina which was not linked to a confederation with  Croatia proper. [passage omitted]    The statement was issued here after the presidential council  of the republic of Hereg-Bosna met in Mostar, southern Bosnia  [location as received].    The council has 11 members and is chaired by Kresimir Zubak,  who has also headed the Bosnian Croat delegation in Vienna at  talks on the proposed Moslem-Croat federation, brokered in  Washington last week.    The council expressed its "full support" for its delegation  in Vienna, but said that it had an "obligation to coordinate  daily with the members of the presidential council who are not  part of the delegation."    The report came after Zagreb's deputy foreign minister Ivo  Sanader said that the talks in Vienna could be concluded Friday  with leaders from both sides flying in to work out the final  details.    Further discussions would be needed on the "demarcation of  the Croat and Moslem cantons" in the future federation. [passage  omitted]    Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said on Monday that the  question of a confederation would be put to a referendum in the  republic, but added that the issue could not be settled "so long  as the question of Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina remains  unresolved."</p>

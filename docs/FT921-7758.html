			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Bank of Scotland set to expand in Italy Bank of Scotland is negotiating to take a stake in an Italian company which operates in the home loans market. It would be the first venture the Edinburgh-based institution has made in mortgage lending outside the UK, write James Buxton and Haig Simonian. The bank confirmed yesterday that it was negotiating with Finanziaria Italiana Mutui (FIM), the mortgage lending arm of Sopaf, the Milan-based merchant bank run by Mr Jody Vender, which has branched into a variety of property-related activities. The size of Bank of Scotland's stake could be about 25 per cent or larger, according to the bank. But the bank is unwilling to give more details until a deal is concluded. According to Italian press reports, both Bank of Scotland and SAI, the Italian insurance company, would take sizeable stakes in FIM in order to expand it. SAI is controlled by Mr Salvatore Ligresti, a controversial property developer who also has a dominant interest in Grassetto, one of Italy's biggest building groups. Italy has a relatively large mortgage market, which has been buoyed by the high level of owner-occupancy and of second home ownership. About 65 per cent of Italians own their own homes, a figure similar to that in the UK.</p>

A large number of officials of  various kinds have been laid off right up to the level of vice  premiers -- their number has declined from nine to four. And  only two of them will be first deputy heads of the cabinet.  Only 20 ministries, 24 state committees, and 20 departments  are left.    At first glance these figures confirm the official story of  the latest government reshuffle: The inflated apparatus must be  dealt with. But behind this reduction one can discern a  tactical gain for the agrarian and industrial lobbyists and  their leaders at the helm of power.    Premier Chernomyrdin has been given a week to personally  appoint his deputies and ministers. Already observers are  united in the opinion that it will be suggested that O.  Soskovets and Ye. Gaydar become the first vice premiers and A.  Zaveryukha and Yu. Yarov mere vice premiers. Of course this  layout could be different. If only because at a recent press  conference Gaydar dropped a transparent hint that he might not  join the government. It is true that he did not say everything  about his doubts. But the absence of his comrades in arms A.  Chubays and B. Fedorov on the list of vice premiers needs no  special comment. If the reformers' key figures are deprived of  their powers then Gaydar will yet again be in the unenviable  role of "whipping boy."    With this selection of vice premiers inflation will go  sky-high by the spring and the future of privatization will look  vague to say the least. With this disposition of forces Gaydar  and "Russia's Choice" will most likely join the hidden  [glukhaya] opposition.</p>

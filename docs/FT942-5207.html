			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / A layman's guide to US Fed policy: America It is hard to find rational explanations for the height of bond yields in Europe where unemployment averages about 11 per cent. But the direction of movement is determined by events in the US, where the risk of inflation is greater because the business cycle is further advanced. The key to understanding bond markets thus lies in grasping the modus operandi of the US Federal Reserve, which triggered the global rise in yields by starting to tighten monetary policy in early February, sooner than many investors expected. The Fed has not fully explained the principles that govern its decisions, but it appears to have two main criteria for action: Rule one. The Fed will raise short-term rates if economic growth appears likely to exceed an annual rate of 2 1/2 -3 per cent, the rate it deems sustainable in the longer-term. This rule was made clear in the minutes, released last month, of the March meeting of the Fed's policy-making open market committee. The Fed said it was aiming for a 'neutral' monetary policy. It defined this not in terms of a target real interest rate but rather as a monetary stance that would achieve 'sustained non-inflationary expansion consistent with the economy's potential'. What is this? Well, the labour force is growing at an annual rate of about 1.3 per cent and Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, believes productivity is growing at about 1.5 per cent. Potential non-inflationary growth is thus 2 1/2 -3 per cent. The Fed will raise rates to whatever level is required to prevent growth exceeding this rate. Rule two. The Fed will raise short-term rates if inflation shows any sign of rising above the current level of just under 3 per cent. Mr Greenspan spelled this out in his May 27 testimony to the Senate banking committee. 'If we are successful in our current endeavours, there will not be an increase in overall inflation, and trends toward price stability will be extended.' In the written statement, the word 'not' is underlined. Observers should ponder this commitment carefully because most seem to assume that US inflation will be permitted to drift higher, say to 3 1/2 -4 per cent. Mr Greenspan is saying, in effect, that this will happen only over his dead body. What do these rules tell us about past and prospective Fed policy? The lifting of short-term rates from 3 per cent to 4 1/4 per cent was an application of rule one. The Fed was not responding to actual evidence of higher inflation but was rather trying to reduce growth, from an unsustainable annual rate of 4-5 per cent in the second half of last year. It also wanted to prick a speculative bubble in financial asset prices caused by its own failure to heed good advice - for example the plea to raise rates last September from monetarist economists led by Professor Allan Meltzer of Carnegie-Mellon University. The perception that policies inspired by rule one are having the desired effect explains the revival of confidence in the US bond market  - most evident in Friday's rally despite news of a fall in the jobless rate to 6 per cent ('full employment' in many economists' eyes). The market took that number in its stride partly because labor department officials hinted it was probably an aberration and partly because other recent data appear to point to a modest deceleration in economic growth. Housing starts and home sales are down from the peaks hit late last year. Growth of consumer spending seems to be declining after several strong quarters, partly because mortgage refinancing is no longer providing much impetus. Factory orders and the Purchasing Managers Index - guides to the health of manufacturing industry - appear to be stabilising, albeit at robust levels. And the payroll side of Friday's ambiguous employment report pointed to a somewhat slower pace of job creation. It would be dangerous, however, to conclude that the Fed has done enough to reduce US growth to a sustainable 2 1/2 -3 per cent. Lulls occur in all business cycles. There is no evidence that interest rates are yet high enough to deter business investment, one of the engines of this recovery. Growth will probably accelerate again later this year as consumers get a second wind and as economic recovery in the rest of the world stimulates US exports. When Mr Greenspan said he had substantially withdrawn the monetary accommodation prevailing last year, he did not mean to imply rates had reached an equilibrium level. As he hinted on May 27, the right inference was that 'the degree and frequency of tightening' might be less in the future. Even if growth does decline to a sustainable rate, rule two may come into play. The leading index of inflation compiled by researchers at Columbia University - one of the best available - surged in May, having risen continuously for eight months. Key components - such as industrial material prices - point unequivocally to an upturn in inflation this autumn. If the price data do indeed deteriorate, the Fed will tighten again regardless of growth trends. None of this necessarily spells doom for bond markets. Long yields of about 7.5 per cent in the US, and higher in most European markets, should provide a cushion against future shocks. Indeed, the most disturbing event for investors would not be a further increase in US short term rates, but a perception that the Fed was again behind events because it was failing to heed its own monetary logic.</p>

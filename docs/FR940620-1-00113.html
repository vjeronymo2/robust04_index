			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The previously-reserved exception to &sect;4.1.7(1)(a) is added to allow alternative methods of access if it is determined that it is not feasible to provide physical access to a qualified historic building or facility in a manner that will not threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7.2(3) is added to cover title II facilities, and requires that, where counters have cash registers and are provided for the sale or distribution of goods or services to the public, at least one of each type shall comply with 7.2(1); at counters that may not have cash registers but at which goods or services are sold or distributed, a portion of the main counter shall be accessible or an accessible auxiliary counter shall be provided in close proximity; and at counter or teller windows with solid partitions or security glazing separating personnel from the public, at least one of each type shall provide a method to facilitate voice communication that is accessible to both individuals who use wheelchairs and individuals who have difficulty bending or stooping. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 10.4.1(8), which was previously reserved, is added to require that, in airports covered by title II, at least one accessible route shall be provided through fixed security barriers, and where security barriers incorporate equipment, such as metal detectors, which cannot be made accessible, an accessible route shall be provided adjacent to such security screening devices. An exception is also added to this section to exempt doors, doorways, and gates designed to be operated only by security personnel from the requirements of 4.13.6, 4.13.9, 4.13.11, and 4.13.12. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, appendix notes are added for the following sections: 3.5 (definition of transient lodging); 4.1.3(8)(a)(i) (public entrances); 4.1.3(8)(b) (path of travel to building entrances); 7.2(3)(iii) (counter or teller windows with partitions); and 10.4.1(8) (security systems in transportation facilities). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Process Matters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice of proposed rulemaking has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The Access Board has analyzed the impact of applying its proposed amendments to ADAAG to entities covered by titles II and III of the ADA and has determined that they are a significant regulatory action for purposes of Executive Order 12866. The Access Board has prepared a Regulatory Assessment, which includes a cost impact analysis for certain accessibility elements and a discussion of the regulatory alternatives considered. Adoption of the revised ADA Standards as the standards for title II is, therefore, also a significant regulatory action to which the Access Board's Regulatory Assessment would apply. Comments submitted to the Access Board on its Regulatory Assessment will also be considered by the Department as comments on this proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Access Board has determined that this proposed rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and, therefore, has included the flexibility analysis required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act in its Regulatory Assessment. The Access Board has made every effort to lessen the economic impacts of its proposed rule on small entities, but recognizes that such impacts are the necessary result of the mandate of the ADA itself. The Access Board's analysis also applies to the Department's proposed adoption of the revised ADAAG. The Department's proposed procedural amendments will not have a significant economic impact on small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Access Board has made every effort to lessen the impact of its proposed guidelines on state and local governments, but recognizes that the guidelines will have some federalism impacts. These impacts are discussed in the Access Board's Regulatory Assessment, which also applies to the Department's proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order 12875 prohibits executive departments and agencies from promulgating any regulation that is not required by statute and that creates a mandate upon a state, local, or tribal government unless certain conditions are met. The Access Board is required by statute to issue minimum guidelines for the purposes of implementing titles II and III of the ADA (42 USC 12204). The Department of Justice is required by statute to promulgate regulations that implement title II of the ADA and that are consistent with the minimum guidelines and requirements issued by the Access Board (42 USC 12134). Because the Department of Justice is required by statute to promulgate regulations that do not go below the Access Board's minimum guidelines, and because this rule adopts guidelines issued by the Access Board as also required by statute, this rule is required by statute. Therefore, the special conditions in Executive Order 12875 need not be met. However, the Department will provide any comments submitted that suggest ways to make compliance less burdensome or that would improve the effectiveness of the title II regulation in achieving its objective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 28 CFR Part 35 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Alcoholism, Blind, Buildings and facilities, Civil rights, Drug abuse, Historic preservation, HIV/AIDS, Individuals with disabilities, Intergovernmental relations, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, State and local governments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 28 CFR Part 36 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Alcoholism, Blind, Buildings and facilities, Business and industry, Civil rights, Consumer protection, Drug abuse, Historic preservation, HIV/AIDS, Individuals with disabilities, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 28 CFR Part 37 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

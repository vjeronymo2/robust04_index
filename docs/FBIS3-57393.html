He declared about this on Saturday at the opening of the  first Kurultai (congress) of Kyrgyzstan's peoples. At the same  time Akayev underlined that he would solve the problem of dual  citizenship minding Russia's priority significance "as the major  partner in all spheres."    According to the Kyrgyz leader, "the Russian language has  been and remains the second one" for the republic's all peoples.  Akayev is convinced that it is necessary "to strive for  trilinguality which is to become the basis of mentality of  Kyrgyzstan's single people" (saying trilinguality, Akayev  believes that all citizens of the republic must fluently speak  the Kyrgyz, Russian, and English languages -- Interfax). He  pointed out that the lingual factor "should not be a dominating  one" during educating process and job placement.    Akayev called formation of a maximum favorable climate for  joint existence of all nations and citizens as a necessary  condition to activate consolidation of all ethnic groups into  Kyrgyzstan's "single people." After the compatriots perceive  their multinational unity, there will appear "a public  atmosphere of aversion to nationalism and chauvinism."</p>

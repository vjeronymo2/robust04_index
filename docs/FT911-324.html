			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Logitek says yes to Microvitec LOGITEK, the computer services group, has finally agreed to a revised offer from Microvitec, the computer peripherals maker from which it had been fighting off a hostile takeover bid. Logitek is recommending a new and higher offer by Microvitec of 20 Logitek shares for 21 Microvitec shares, which values the company at approximately Pounds 3.5m. This compares with the one-for-one all share offer which valued Logitek at Pounds 3.3m. Microvitec had already acquired or agreed to acquire 22.5 per cent of Logitek's ordinary capital. The agreement ends Microvitec's one and a half month struggle for Logitek through which it sought to create an enlarged group andturn round its flagging fortunes. 'Unless you're small and innovative and keep coming out with super products, to have any chance of survival in the electronics industry you've got to have size,' says Mr James Bailey, the chairman of Microvitec. 'With the Logitek deal going through, we can expect 1992 to be a super year,' he added. Microvitec was not as fortunate in its bid to raise approximately Pounds 2.56m through a rights issue of 14.4m new ordinary shares to help fund the acquisition. The issue, while fully underwritten, closed with only 6.22 per cent of acceptances.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: GAN warns of steep decline to FFr400m net GAN, one of France's largest insurance groups, yesterday warned of a sharp decline in net profits to FFr400m (Dollars 71m) in 1992, from FFr2.32bn in 1991, because of the competitive state of the insurance sector and its exposure to the fragile property market. The group, a state-controlled company which is a candidate for privatisation under the conservatives - firm favourites to win this month's parliamentary elections - was also affected last year by a fall in the value of its asset sales and the poor performance of CIC, its banking subsidiary. GAN, which will announce its final results for 1992 in late April, is the latest leading French insurance group to have reported poor figures for last year. The insurers have for several years been struggling in intensely-competitive markets for both life and damage insurance. However, the recent economic squeeze has aggravated these problems by making it more difficult for the insurers to compensate by raising money from asset sales. It has also forced them to make steep provisions on the value of their property portfolios and industrial investments. Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the state-controlled company which is France's biggest single insurer, recently reported a fall in net profits from FFr3.8bn in 1991 to FFr1.1bn in 1992. Axa, the largest private sector insurer, saw profits slide from FFr2.4bn to FFr1.5bn over the same period. GAN has been particularly badly affected because of its exposure to the property sector. It managed to increase turnover by 10 per cent (on a constant basis) to FFr43.8bn last year with its bank-insurance interests representing a quarter of the total. The life insurance business remained profitable, but GAN experienced problems in the damage sector. These difficulties were compounded by a decline in profits from CIC, which was hit by the strains on the small business sector.</p>

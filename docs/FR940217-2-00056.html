			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Subcategory (B): system enhancement grants. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  System enhancement grants will fund activities that represent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> next logical step or steps to take in institutionalizing EMSC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities within the State EMS system and achieving program goals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outlined in this announcement and further elaborated in the 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institute of Medicine Report to Congress entitled Emergency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medical Services for Children. (A copy of the Executive Summary of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this report will be enclosed with the application kit. The full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report is available for $49.95 from National Academy Press, 2101  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Constitution Avenue, NW., Box 285, Washington, DC 20055.) For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, funding might be used to improve linkages between local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and regional or State agencies, to develop pediatric standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a region, or to assure effective field triage of the child in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical or emotional crisis to appropriate facilities and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other resources. Activities implemented under prior EMSC program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding but not completed or made self-sustaining during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original implementation project period will not be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suitable. States that have previously received EMSC funds may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply for a system enhancement grant, as long as they will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also be receiving implementation grant funds during the project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of the systems enhancement grant. Grants of up to $150,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are anticipated for the first year, with grants of up to $100,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the second year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Category (3): Targeted Issues Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The third funding category is that of targeted issues grants on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> topics of importance to EMSC. These grants are intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address specific, focused issues related to the development of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EMSC capacity, with the potential to serve as national or regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> models. Proposals in this category must have a well conceived  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology to evaluate the impact of the activity. The Director  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) will judge the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptability of projects proposed in this category. Prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicants are urged to contact EMSC program staff well in advance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of submitting their formal applications, so that the work of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal development can be avoided if the proposed project is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> judged to be inappropriate for submission in this category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Priorities for this category have been chosen from topics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended by the 1993 Institute of Medicine Report on EMSC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Priorities and examples include:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> _Education and Training. For this priority, proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are sought which develop or evaluate education or training geared  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to improving EMS providers' ability to address underdeveloped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements in EMSC. They may relate to particular areas of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attention, such as the psychosocial aspects of EMSC, or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular populations that are underserved or isolated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposals focusing on underserved or isolated populations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children might target the needs of Native Americans, Native  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alaskans, or Native Hawaiians, adolescents, developmentally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabled, mentally ill, homeless, or children living in rural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas or inner cities. Educational programs might also be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed for particular groups, such as parents, volunteers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caretakers, teachers, firefighters, medical control or medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispatch personnel. Assessment of the effectiveness of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training, using appropriate outcome measures, is a key objective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for proposals in this category. Proposals are expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporate existing materials whenever possible; however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> innovations in media or instructional techniques are encouraged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects could include the conversion of previously developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> teaching materials to interactive video format, the development of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> curricula or training exercises to promote improved EMS management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of psychosocial crises, or the utilization of multidisciplinary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seminars or study groups to enhance collaboration on pediatric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency care between primary and specialty providers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

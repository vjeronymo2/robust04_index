			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / French leaders deny Adidas tie THE French government yesterday officially denied it had influenced the decision of three state-controlled financial groups to buy shares in Adidas, the German sportswear group, from a company controlled by Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial minister of urban affairs. The Finance Ministry said in a formal statement that the government had 'no knowledge' of the decision by Credit Lyonnais, one of France's biggest banks, and Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) and Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the insurance groups, to participate in the consortium which on Monday bought Mr Tapie's controlling stake in Adidas. This denial followed calls for an official inquiry into the deal from the conservative opposition, which is favourite to win next month's legislative elections. It comes as the French socialist government's relationship with state-controlled companies is under the spotlight. Last month a similar furore broke out after Elf-Sanofi, subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, the state-controlled oil group, bought Yves Saint-Laurent, the French fashion house chaired by Mr Pierre Berge, a friend of President Mitterrand. Opposition politicians, who promised to privatise many of France's state-controlled companies including Credit Lyonnais, AGF and UAP in their election manifesto, also demanded an investigation into the YSL transaction. Despite the Finance Ministry's insistence yesterday about the independence of state-controlled companies, the close links between the government and some public sector companies were highlighted last week when Elf Aquitaine was ordered to abandon plans to close a unit at Boussens in south-west France. The proposed closure would involve transferring 480 jobs from Boussens, a socialist stronghold, to Elf plants in other parts of France when the socialists are under attack because of the steep rise in unemployment. The French Justice Ministry yesterday forbade a judge from investigating the circumstances in which Mr Pierre Beregovoy, French prime minister, received an FFr1m (Pounds 125,000) interest-free loan in 1989 from Mr Roger-Patrice Pelat, the now-deceased financier. The ministry said there was no evidence to suggest the loan had been fraudulent.</p>

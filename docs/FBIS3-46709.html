Gubernatorial elections, including the Seoul mayoral  election, will be held in the first half of next year, as  promised, the chief executive told reporters while exchanging  New Year's greetings with them.    An opposition mayor of Seoul would pose no problem to him in  carrying out his job as chief executive because the constitution  guarantees his rights and duties as president, he said.    In the United States, there appears no problem between  President Bill Clinton's Democratic administration and the  Republican mayor of New York, Kim added. In Japan, there was no  problem in the Liberal Democratic Party administration while  Minobe, who was elected on the Socialist Party's support, ruled  Tokyo for 12 years.    He said premature election enthusiasm is not desirable in  view of the nation's pressing task to boost the economy.    "The elections are still one and half years away, but the  press has already begun carrying speculative reports on  anticipated candidates to arouse public interest in the  elections," he noted.    Meanwhile, ruling Democratic Liberal Party Secretary-General  Mun Chong-su said his party was not studying a plan to revise  administrative districts for next year's local elections.    "My party will by no means push ahead with such a plan," he  added.</p>

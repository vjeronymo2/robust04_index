To credit enhance refunding bonds not fully secured by the FHA mortgage amount, HUD also agrees not to exercise its option under 24 CFR 207.259(e) to call debentures prior to maturity. This refunding proposal was approved by HUD on August 18, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced to an average yield of 5.72%. The tax-exempt refunding bond issue of $4,470,000 at current low-interest rates will save section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding tax-exempt coupons of 10.27% at the call date in 1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 5.72%. The refunding will also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest rate effectively immediately, from 10.41% to 7.05%, thus reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk. The refunding serves the important public purposes of reducing HUD's section 8 program costs, improving Treasury tax revenues, (helping reduce the budget deficit), and increasing the likelihood that projects will continue to provide housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD objective. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 50.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Regulation: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  24 CFR 811.114(d), 811.115(b), 811.117. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Project/Activity: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  St. Louis, Missouri IDA refunding of bonds which financed a section 8 assisted project, Douglas Manor Apartments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nature of Requirement: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Regulations set conditions under which HUD may grant a section 11(b) letter of exemption of multifamily housing revenue bonds from Federal income taxation and authorize call of debentures prior to maturity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Granted By: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Nicolas P.

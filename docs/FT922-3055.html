			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Week in the markets: LME to meet over zinc squeeze THE TIGHTENING supply squeeze in the zinc market prompted the London Metal Exchange to announce late yesterday that an emergency board meeting would be held on Monday to review the state of the market. Although LME warehouse stocks of zinc have been rising to ever-higher peaks a technical shortage centred on the June 17 delivery date has since the beginning of April pushed the market into a widening 'backwardation' - a cash premium over forward metal - a situation normally associated with supply shortage. At yesterday's close the cash premium over three months metal reached Dollars 189 a tonne, up from Dollars 172 on Thursday. On April 9, after the cash/three months backwardation had reached a relatively modest Dollars 12 a tonne, the LME board issued its second warning this year that it was closely monitoring the zinc market. It said at that time: 'The board has at its disposal a variety of courses of acxtion which would be introduced should cicumstances dictate the necessity of such actions'. The move was described by Mr Martin Abbott, the exchange's director of marketing as 'a warning shot across the bows of anyone who might be thinking of playing any games in the zinc market'. But the warning does not appear to have been heeded. LME copper prices suffered a shake-out following last week's rally. But the market steadied yesterday as dealers opted for caution ahead of Sunday's labour contract vote at Noranda's Montreal smelter. The LME's cash price closed yesterday at Pounds 1,225 a tonne, down Pounds 15.50 on the week. Aluminium prices came under renewed pressure from investment fund liquidation early in the week and falls were magnified by the triggering of stop-loss selling orders. The three months LME price dipped to a 2 1/2  month low of Dollars 1,294 a tonne before closing yesterday at Dollars 1,295.75 a tonne, down Dollars 32.75 on the week. Dealers ignored Tuesday's announcement of a modest fall in LME warehouse stocks and were equally unimpressed yesterday when a 12,450-tonne rise took the total to a record 1.261m tonnes. The three months tin price pushed through resistance at Dollars 6,500 a tonne in mid week to reach a two-year high of Dollars 6,540 a tonne. But the speculator-driven advance quickly ran into profit-taking and by yesterday's close the price was back to Dollars 6,492.50 a tonne, up Dollars 25 on the week. The London gold market was shaken out of its slumbers after the publication on Thursday of disappointing US retail sales figures, prompting speculation on the possibility of a cut in interest rates and heightening inflation fears. That helped to lift the London price above Dollars 340 a troy ounce for the first time since mid-April. The advance was not sustained, however, and the price closed yesterday at Dollars 339.50 an ounce, up Dollars 1.50 on the day and Dollars 1.10 on the week. Platinum and silver prices were also influenced by the hopes on lower interest rates. Platinum rose Dollars 2.25 yesterday to Dollars 372.25 an ounce, up 25 cents on the week, while silver added 2 cents to Thursday's rally with the cash quotation ending at Dollars 4.09 an ounce, up 2.5 cents on the week. At the London Futures and Options Exchange this week saw a resumption of the bear trend in the cocoa market and the establishment of fresh 16 1/2 -year lows. In the absence of fundamental developments to account for the fall, which left the September position Pounds 18 down at Pounds 545 a tonne, dealers attributed it chiefly to investment fund selling in the US and the continued slackness of consumer demand. They also noted that sentiment was weighed down by the prospect of further selling by the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa producer, which made a late start to this year's marketing campaign. The coffee market fared better, but prices were still down on the week. Following last week's fall a steadier tone was appartent early on in the week. But this quickly evaporated as dealers saw no prospect of supportive developments until closer to the International Coffee Organisations talks scheduled for June 22-26. At yesterday's close the September robusta futures price was quoted at Pounds 727 a tonne, down Pounds 3 on the week. New York cotton prices were boosted because of concern about the Texan crop, which is reported to have suffered severe damage in some areas from heavy rain. In late trading yesterday the October futures position reached 64.7 cents a lb, up 4.8 cents on the week.  -------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------- Aluminium      +12,450  to  1,261,000 Copper         -575     to  263,350 Lead           +375     to  136,875 Nickel         +570     to  29,406 Zinc           +6,925   to  277,300 Tin            -230     to  12,545  --------------------------------------</p>

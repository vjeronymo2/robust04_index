			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vice Admiral Aleksandr Ivanovich Frolov, </F> people's deputy of the Crimean Supreme Soviet, by B. Glinskiy;  place and date not given: "The Black Sea Fleet Is Holding Out  Thanks to Russia"]    [Excerpt] [Glinskiy] Aleksandr Ivanovich, over the past two  years, the destiny of the Black Sea Fleet has been sorted out.  The Russian and Ukrainian presidents signed protocols in Yalta,  Zavidovo, Moscow, and Massandra; they agreed on an urgent and  honest resolution to the problem that worries our people.  Impressive statements in the press and television followed  these meetings. However, when the presidents returned home,  their statements acquired another meaning and the protocols'  clauses remained unfulfilled. What, do you think, is the reason  for this?    [Frolov] We will soon celebrate the 10th anniversary of  perestroyka, but the old guard still holds the power.    People cannot keep the administration in check. To prolong  its existence, the powers-that-be exercise the meanest methods:  They set the Ukrainian and Russian peoples against each other.  These people have been living in peace for over 300 years.  What is terrible is that the army is involved in political  battles. Over 50,000 servicemen of the Ukrainian Armed Forces  are stationed in the Crimea. The Crimean president's decisions  are adamantly opposed. The young democracy is under the heel of  bureaucracy.    [Glinskiy] Aleksandr Ivanovich, our editorial office  receives  many letters and phone calls. Crimean residents ask: What  should we do? They voice concern over the situation around the  Black Sea Fleet. You participated in the recent negotiations  and I would like to know your opinion: Who is to blame for  their failure?    [Frolov] I would not draw your attention to the details of  the work, which was conducted by the delegations and groups of  experts at the Black Sea Fleet headquarters. Mass media  published a detailed report on this event. The participants in  the negotiations adopted a resolution to divide the fleet. The  agreements on the separate location and division of its  infrastructure were not implemented. Instead, old bureaucratic  tricks were used. The Ukrainian side used dual interpretation  of the clauses of the Moscow agreement: The breakdown of the  Russian-Ukrainian negotiations was prompted by nothing else but  a regular political order from the bureaucracy during the  campaign for electing Ukrainian president, setting up a new  legislature, and, hence, a new government. Young generals use  this high political wave for career purposes.    [Glinskiy] Was public opinion or the wishes of the local  authorities considered at the negotiations?    [Frolov] By the time the Russian and Ukrainian delegations  began working, Crimean President Yu. Meshkov and V. Semenov,  chairman of the Sevastopol City Executive Council -- who had  their own opinion and stance on the issue -- arrived at the  Black Sea Fleet headquarters. For example, one in every four  Sevastopol residents is directly or indirectly connected with  the Black Sea Fleet.    Ukrainian Defense Minister V. Radetskyy, head of the  Ukrainian delegation, categorically opposed the participation of  the representatives of the Crimean and Sevastopol executive  branches, even as observers. This is how military bureaucracy  views the local authorities.    Public opinion is taken into account in civilized states.  However, we have another approach. Bureaucrats, who never loved  the people and only gave orders, currently do not want to take  public opinion into consideration.    [Glinskiy] You know that the Army is maintained at  taxpayers'  expense. But our bureaucrats forget about this. Let us, for  example, take the Ukrainian Navy with only three ships that are  moored and do not go out to sea due to lack of fuel, ammunition,  etc. At the same time, the Ukrainian Navy headquarters has  eight admirals, over 500 officers and warrant officers! They  have official cars, high expenses, and apartments. They are  satisfied with their "duties." Billions of karbovanetses of  people's money are spent.    [Frolov] It would have been incorrect on my side to speak  about the military readiness of the Ukrainian Navy. However,  there is no smoke without fire. The [Ukrainian] Defense  Ministry has a voracious appetite, however, if wishes were  horses, beggars might ride. Having, for example, taken control  over two first-class military colleges in Sevastopol, the  Ukrainian Defense Ministry simply cannot maintain them. Unique  equipment is dismantled and buildings fall into disrepair.  Cadets and teaching staff live in poverty. On the basis of  these two colleges, a military-naval institute was established.  Nothing came of this. Currently, they are speaking about  setting up a military academy.    Ukraine has not been financing the Black Sea Fleet since  last  October. Not because it does not want to, but because the  coffers are empty. I do not pin hopes on any replenishment in  the near future.    The Black Sea Fleet is holding out thanks to Russia. It does  not simply hold out on its own. I am a deputy fleet commander  for combat training. Last year, the Black Sea Fleet ranked  second in combat training in comparison to the Northern one.

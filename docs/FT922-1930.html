			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Italian volume continues recovery / Review of last month's European equity turnover May was a volatile month for equity turnover on European stock exchanges, with a weakening in Belgium, France and the UK balanced by gains elsewhere. But even the winners were riding for a fall. Italy put up the biggest increase in trading, turnover rising by 30.7 per cent, extending and accelerating a 25.4 per cent gain in April after an exceptionally weak March. It had periods of excitement, and stock market rallies in May on the hopes of a recovery in political stability and in the economy longer term, seen particularly in industrial shares in anticipation of these events. 'People thought that Italy must have seen all the bad news,' says Mr James Cornish of County NatWest, which produces the monthly turnover figures, 'but the change in sentiment came ahead of any change in reality.' The Danish 'No' vote to the EC Maastricht treaty brought fear back into the Milan bourse at the beginning of June; it had already been severely incapacitated on June 1, when the screen trading system was knocked out of commission by heavy rainstorms and lightning. The Netherlands, up 20.5 per cent, was helped by the oil price rise and the boost in trading which this gave to Royal Dutch. There is a sense in which a market so sensitive to oil, the US dollar and the performance of its big international stocks seems never to have a domestic story of its own to tell. 'There is a good story to be told about the Dutch domestic equity market,' says Mr Cornish; but he reflects wryly that, this month, it seems likely to be submerged in this week's further, painful chapter in the Philips saga. Germany, in May, put on 16.6 per cent as the threat of a metalworkers' strike was averted. In this, it effectively returned to the January/March level after a nervous April, but once again, as in the case of other European bourses, its June trading has been seriously affected by worries about EC stability - after the Danish vote, on the run-up to yesterday's Irish referendum and in the prospect of a French version in September. Political stories were also reflected in the UK and France, the former falling by 14.1 per cent as the post-election spree evaporated and the latter declining by 10.7 per cent following the April euphoria on the appointment of Mr Pierre Beregovoy as prime minister. Belgium dropped by 20.6 per cent. Here, the market was still up on the average for the previous 12 months, and Mr Sebastian Scotney, Belgian specialist at Dillon Read, says dividend dates were behind the decline: 'Quite a lot of the market goes ex-dividend during May, and the dividend-interest buying which lifted April was replaced by post-dividend languor in big blue chips such as Petrofina, Electrabel and Societe Generale de Banque.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                  Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse             Feb       Mar       Apr       May         US                   1992      1992      1992      1992     Dollars bn Belgium          46.72     48.28     51.36     40.80        1.23 France          116.18    108.97    112.17    100.16       18.57 Germany         126.20    126.68    107.90    125.80       78.28 Italy         8,948.80  5,944.80  7,457.20  9,747.60        8.06 Netherlands      14.10     11.60     12.20     14.70        8.13 Spain           667.83    607.28    461.52    513.47        5.13 Switzerland      10.90     11.88     12.48     13.29        9.13 UK               29.61     32.59     41.17     35.35       64.70  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

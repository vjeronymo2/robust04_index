Smith is scheduled  today to drive the first production car off the $1.9-billion Saturn assembly  line in Spring Hill, Tenn., but there will be no reporters and no politicians  around, and only company photographers will record it. Bruce MacDonald,  Saturn's vice president for communications, claimed that employees wanted a  private ceremony alone with Smith, who retires as chairman on Tuesday. Industry  analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Bros. Inc. said keeping the  ceremony private might also be an effort by GM to lower expectations about the  new nameplate.  </P></p>

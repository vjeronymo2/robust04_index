			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HUNTING FOR REVERSE OF VIRGINIA BLUE LAW  </P> <P> The folks at Virginia's Wildlife Violation Hotline have answered some unusual  calls in their time, but they'd never before handled a complaint quite like Joe  Ficarro's.  </P> <P> "I'd like to report a hunting violation," said the 40-year-old Virginia Beach  taxidermist when he rang up in February.  </P> <P> "Sir, when and where did the violation occur?"  </P> <P> "Tomorrow," said Ficarro, "in Pungo."  </P> <P> Ficarro explained that he'd be the violator and wanted to make sure a game  warden was around to catch him hunting on Sunday. He even solicited advice, to  be sure he clearly broke the law.  </P> <P> When Warden Craig Thomas met him at the appointed hour, Ficarro hauled out a  $14 single-shot clunker of a shotgun, just in case it was confiscated as  evidence. "They weren't going to get my Browning," he said. Then he loaded it  with birdshot and stepped afield, ostensibly to hunt quail.  </P> <P> "I told the warden I hoped I didn't have to actually shoot one, because we  might be there awhile," chuckled Ficarro, a deer hunter who claims no expertise  with birds. "But he said all I had to do was walk around with the gun."  </P> <P> Ficarro did, and got the ticket he came for, thereby entering a fray he hopes  will change the law of the state.  </P> <P> When he enters Virginia Beach District Criminal Court on April 25, it will be  to challenge the constitutionality of a law he says unfairly denies him the  right to do as he pleases on his day off.  </P> <P> "You can go to tractor pulls on Sunday," he said. "You can shop at the mall.  You can shoot skeet, go to a football game, buy beer. But I'm stuck at home,  watching all-star 'rassling on TV. It burns me up."  </P> <P> The perceived injustice of Virginia's traditional Sunday hunting prohibition  has bugged Ficarro for years. He works six days a week, he said, with Saturday  his busiest day in the shop. But when he finally gets a day off, he has to do  as others tell him in keeping with anachronistic, Bible Belt blue laws, as he  sees it.  </P> <P> He was bemoaning that fact at his weekly card game last winter when his cronies  suggested they do something about it. Their research showed several legislative  bills aimed at opening Sunday hunting in Virginia, one of 11 states that  prohibit it. All had failed.  </P> <P> Ficarro called the sponsor of the most recent one, Sen. Madison Marye, D, who  said the chance of getting a bill through the General Assembly was nil and he  wasn't planning to try again.  </P> <P> That left one avenue, said Ficarro's attorney and card-playing partner, Gary  Byler. "He told us, 'Someone's got to break the law and test it in court,' "  said Ficarro.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Who would be stupid enough to do that?' and when I turned around,  everyone was looking at me."  </P> <P> The rest is civil-disobedience history, and Ficarro is turning into something  of a local figure because of it. "The day this thing hit the papers I was like  Donald Trump's lawyer," he said. "The phone rang off the hook. People wanted to  know, 'What can I do to help?' "  </P> <P> Ficarro and Byler figure the case is likely to go to several levels of appeal,  so they established the non-profit Virginia Sportman's Association for Sunday  Hunting Inc., to raise money.  </P> <P> "We've already got $1,400 and that's just the tip of the iceberg," said  Ficarro. "We're selling $7 hats for $25, which is a better deal than the  televangelists give. At least you get a hat."  </P> <P> But for all the joking, Ficarro believes he's onto a serious issue. Virginia's  blue laws against commerce and recreation on Sundays, like those in many  states, have been eased in recent years.  </P> <P> Some states also have removed or eased Sunday hunting prohibitions, according  to the Wildlife Legislative Fund of America, an Ohio-based hunters'-rights  organization that reports 34 states have no ban on Sunday hunting.  </P> <P> But prohibitions remain firmly in place in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia,  Pennsylvania, Delaware and North Carolina, as well as Connecticut,  Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio and Maine.  </P> <P> That leaves Ficarro surrounded by places that won't let him hunt on his day  off, even though he's been assured by Virginia's Game Division chief, James  Remington, among others, that there's no biological need for Sunday closures.  </P> <P> Ficarro said the sentiment against Sunday hunting comes from churches, which  want folks in the pews, and from some farmers who want a day of rest with no  one tramping around their fields.  </P> <P> He recognizes those constituencies, he said, and appreciates their concerns.  "There's no bad guys in this dispute," he said. "But our country and our state  were founded on principles of freedom to do what you like, as long as it  doesn't infringe on someone else."  </P> <P> Byler said: "We believe Sunday hunting is outlawed because it's the day most  people who go to church choose to worship. We all know that's why the day was  picked. We feel that picking a day for religious reasons is an unconstitutional  mix of church and state."  </P> <P> Byler reckons it will be an uphill fight to change the law. "Judges at this  level are always reluctant to strike down a state statute as opposed to a city  statute," he said.  </P> <P> He hopes a protracted court case will force the Virginia legislature to  readdress the issue and change the law voluntarily, so Ficarro doesn't have to  take it all the way to the Supreme Court.  </P> <P> Whatever the outcome, however, it's clear Ficarro has opened a can of worms,  which is a bold move for a taxidermist.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kigali, June 21 (AFP) -- UN military observers from  Senegal, Congo and Togo will leave Kigali Wednesday [22 June]  after receiving threats from Rwandan rebels over France's  planned military intervention, UN sources said Tuesday.    More than 40 out of a total of 124 observers in Rwanda will  quit the capital city, the sources said. The overall UN mission  in Rwanda comprises 495 personnel.    French-speaking Senegal, Congo and Togo are seen as  supporting Paris' plan to send 2,000 troops to Rwanda to halt  ethnic slaughter raging since early April.    UN military observers said Rwandan rebels fiercely opposed  to  the French intervention plan have agreed to escort the African  observers to the Ugandan border.    The rebels, mainly Tutsis, are wary of France because of its  past support of President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu whose  death in an April 6 plane crash touched off the violence.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / UK Company News: Erith cuts dividend as profits slide ERITH, the builders' merchants, just stayed in profit for 1991. It is cutting the total dividend from 3.9p to 2p. Turnover fell to Pounds 67.5m (Pounds 77.7m) from which a pre-tax profit of only Pounds 24,000 (Pounds 2.24m) was generated. The group's problems were aggravated by a bad and doubtful debts provision of Pounds 1.7m, representing 2.6 per cent of sales against a normal 0.4 per cent. Mr Graham Davies, chairman, said the poor result came despite a stringent cost-reduction programme during the most difficult year for the building and construction industry. Earnings per share reached only 0.09p (3.83p). The recommended final dividend is cut from 2.6p to 0.7p. Mr Davies will retire as chairman on May 21, at the conclusion of the annual meeting. Mr Bryan Castledine will become chairman and managing director.</p>

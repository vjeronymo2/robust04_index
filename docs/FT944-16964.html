			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Arts: Impressionist view of social realism - William Packer finds the work of Gustave Caillebote full of surprises, despite his bourgeois reputation In his proper character as a painter, Gustave Caillebotte is perhaps the least well-known of all the Impressionists. A few particular images  - the huge 'Paris Street in the rain', of 1877, from Chicago's Art Institute, for example, with its forced perspective and grey-suited figures under grey umbrellas, stark against the wet, bright pave: or the Musee d'Orsay's 'Parquet layers', of 1875, the workmen kneeling and stretching to their planes in strong silhouette against the reflective floor - have alone sustained a curiosity as to whatever else he might have done. But fate conspired against him, not in any single regard, but in perverse combination. He died comparatively young - this year marks the centenary of his death at the age of 45 after a career of barely 20 years. He was well-off - so much so that he was able to put together a notable and pioneer collection of the work of his Impressionist friends. He then left his collection to the state. Not all of it was accepted, but some 40 works were finally picked out, of Cezanne, Manet, Degas, Sisley, Pissarro, Monet, Renoir . . . They include such famous plums as Manet's 'Balcony', Monet's 'Gare St Lazare', Renoir's 'Bal du moulin de la Galette' and his most delicious nude, who sits in dappled sunlight beneath the trees. Thus Impressionist painting came into the French public collection for the very first time. But all this left poor old Caillebotte's own reputation rather up in the air. His dealer, Durand-Ruel, did give him a memorial show in the summer of 1894, and a couple of his best things - the 'Raboteurs de parquets' and a view over roofs in the snow - were also given to the state by his heirs, but all too soon the name of Caillebotte the painter gave way to that of the dilettante, the amateur, the benefactor. No doubt, had he lived, his weightier oeuvre would have redressed the balance. Other painters have enjoyed private means but have then been less sociable and urbane. Other painters have died young, but in circumstances more fraught or tragic. Caillebotte, perhaps, was simply too normal a bourgeois, too open in his interests and unextreme in taste and temperament, to be taken that seriously. He was admittedly an uneven artist, a function, perhaps, simply of inconsistency of application. Clearly much of his work was done in intermittent bursts of activity that settled on particular themes or visual interests, albeit sustained over considerable intervals - the raboteurs, the life of the streets, industrial development and urban renewal, rowing and sailing, the garden in the country, the grands boulevards, the still-life. But, uneven or not, episodic or not, the work is unmistakable in its essential quality and interest. And it is full of surprises. Comparisons are inevitable - with Renoir in the soft, tactile modelling of the figure; with Degas in the radical liberties taken with the composition; with Monet and Manet on the river and Pissarro in the fields and gardens - but always Caillebotte remains his own man, with a view of the world that is entirely his own. A little younger and a later starter than his fellows, he retained rather more thoroughly than they, perhaps, the academic influences of the Ecole des Beaux Arts. His compositions were conscientiously worked out, squared up from preliminary drawings, the figures studied in isolation, details noted. And there is something, too, of the social realism of the Salon in the contrast he draws between the bourgeois and the working life, and in his interest in the modern, changing city, with its iron bridges and Haussmann's wide new boulevards. The ironies of workmen laying expensive parquet, or a bourgeois, au paysan, working his kitchen garden, were surely not lost on him. Yet there is no polemic to it, none of a Millet's romantic self-identification, or a Pissarro's socialist agonisings. His cooler detachment is quite his own. His vertiginous perspectives were new, and look how the tracery of the balcony itself becomes the near-abstract subject of the picture. Look down at the island refuge in the middle of the carrefour. Look down upon the tree below, and the circular grating at its base, and the bench beside it, set out like a map. There is a freshness of vision here, an unselfconscious originality that should be recognised. Near and far are what fascinate him, the figure set on the balcony against an infinite distance, the fists of the oarsman thrust up to the picture-plane, the tiny figures glimpsed through the ironwork. But how well, at its best, it is done, how fresh in the paint, how crisp and lush the chrysanthemums, how strong the oarsmen in the modelling, how light the snow on the rooftop. Here surely is a true painter seen clearly at last, and seen whole, in his own right. Was he the first to look down on the boulevard far below, to make the balcony a subject in itself, to remark the dignity of labour, to take a boat on the river? No: but it hardly matters. In the end, as always, it is painting as painting that counts. Gustave Caillebotte 1848-1894: Grand Palais, Paris 8me, until January 9, then on to Chicago.</p>

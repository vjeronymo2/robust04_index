			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: English yes, French non I feel sorry for the French. I know that will provoke you because nobody on the planet, so far as I can determine, remotely likes the French. They have the best country in the world, yet their arrogance and rudeness serve as insurmountable barriers to anyone who tries to like them. The reason I feel sorry for the French is that their efforts to protect their culture from American crap, pap and rubbish are doomed to failure, at least temporarily. True, the exclusion of films and broadcasting from the Gatt agreement on world trade liberalisation has been hailed by French politicians as prefacing victory in their struggle to stop Hollywood's moguls annihilating Europe's film industry. But Europe's 'victory' will prove hollow. Eventually, Hollywood will get its way. Technological developments in the global media marketplace are moving at such gigantic speed that efforts to preserve 'cultural identity' by propping up regional film industries will not prevail. The global village is a reality. As a result, the future is streaming into our homes and lives in a great sun-burst of particles. For a while, Hollywood will hold sway. American audio-visual products will indeed rule the airwaves. Our lives will seem ever more coarse. We may get quite desperate. And we shall feel immeasurably sad as the French film industry topples into the gutter. I love French movies. But I also love Australian movies, Italian movies, British movies, Spanish movies - movies of wit, distinction and sexiness from anywhere on earth, Hollywood by no means excluded. I expect I would even enjoy Welsh movies if that grey little region ever stopped whinging, actually got its finger out and did something constructive to endear itself to the rest of us. In London, according to listings in Time Out magazine, there are 27 American films on current release against eight British and two French. (I am not counting co-productions. Orlando, for example, a most enjoyable film, is listed as a British-Russian-French-Italian-Dutch co-production). The preponderance of American films on show in London no doubt justifies film-makers' accusations of US cultural imperialism. But there is one development to come that, in the fullness of time, will rescue regional film-making and deal Hollywood a blow. It is this: the French and all the rest - China, perhaps, excluded - will make their films in English. They will do this because English is what they will speak. You don't have to be a genius to see that the main reason why the French at present capture only the tiniest fraction of ticket sales in US cinemas is because they film their movies in French. Americans don't speak French. And they cannot struggle with subtitles. This is not because they are thick - well, not exclusively because they are thick - but because cinema audiences in the US cannot be expected to watch the screen and read subtitles while at the same time consuming immense quantities of food and Coke. It shocks me that so many French people do not yet speak English. When did you last meet a German who did not speak English? Or a Scandinavian? Or a member of any number of forward-looking nations? When I visited the Norwegian embassy in London 10 days ago to berate them for their whaling, do you imagine we spoke Norwegian? I was confronted by the phenomenon of non-English-speaking French people last April in Paris when attempting to find my hotel in the middle of the evening rush-hour. I was sitting in my car - traffic was at a standstill - when, from a passageway to my right, a Parisian shot out in a large, yellow Citroen, halting his vehicle only 1.5 mm from the side of my car. I looked at him aghast. And then I started shouting. 'Have you the remotest idea what this car is,' I screamed. 'This car is a Rover, a noble and lineal descendant of the Spitfire aircraft that helped cleanse your skies and save you from the Hun. 'How dare you hurtle that heap of lemony metal virtually into my side. Are you completely mad? You look hopelessly mad to me.' I kept this up for three minutes. Stonily, he stared. It dawned on me that he was equipped with not a word of English. The French have got to get real, starting with their movies. They must ditch their dead language. The sooner they switch to English, the sooner they can play a role in zapping the Hollywood moguls.</p>

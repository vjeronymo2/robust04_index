			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Observer: Bouncing Gaidar While not as risky as playing Russian roulette, being used as a political yo-yo must have its unnerving aspects. But Yegor Gaidar, who looks to be undergoing such treatment, showed every sign of thriving on it while wowing audiences at the London School of Economics this week. Main architect of Russia's economic reform until last December, he was sacked by Boris Yeltsin in deference to the conservative parliament. Now reformists are lobbying the president to lure him back. Where in the cycle is he placed at the moment? No idea, he says, throwing up his hands. 'I've been in London for two days and already lost touch with Moscow intrigue.' Still, to judge by his LSE account of how he and a few fellow reformers took swift advantage of the post-coup power vacuum , he could be just the man to seize the current opportunity. With the system transfixed by shock in 1991, Gaidar pushed a previously recalcitrant bureaucracy into slashing the military budget by 70 per cent. He also cut the budget deficit, headed off hyper-inflation, and forced the other republics to stop issuing uncontrolled rouble credits. What he failed to do, however, was curb the powers of the central bank. It continued to undermine the reformists' tough monetary policy by issuing cheap rouble credits to the unreformed state enterprises - the same sin of which national bank chairman Viktor Geraschenko stands accused. If they succeed, the betting is that the bank job would go to Boris Fyodorov. But he could be replaced by Gaidar as deputy prime minister in charge of finance, so bouncing back into his old job.</p>

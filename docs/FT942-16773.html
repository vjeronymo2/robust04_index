			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Arts: Dishonor with an honorable lady - Theatre This week ex-Avenger Honor Blackman is entertaining her admirers at the Criterion with her one-woman show, Dishonorable Ladies. It is a disconcerting event. Ms Blackman in maturity is very much the Colonel's lady rather than Rosie O'Grady and the evening has the indelible air of a genteel soiree at a fashionable spa at which a distinguished actress has been lured out of retirement. Ms Blackman's succession of 'femme fatales through the ages' would not ruffle the wings of a butterfly. They come across as genteel ladies, better at talking about romance than getting involved in anything so sticky as sex. But Michael Crompton, who is directing, and John Watts, have served Ms Blackman faithfully with material and anyone who enjoys anthologies will feel comfortable here. Some of the items are lost gems, like a sketch by the deeply unfashionable Herbert Farjeon, a monologue for a 1930s gold digger rehearsing the evening as she dresses to meet her date. Some are ill-conceived, like Ms Blackman attempting the vamps of the silent movies. Some are plain weird, like the excerpt from Elinor Glyn's novel Three Weeks, which must surely return to print. William Blezard is at the piano. He is the most diplomatic of men, for in his day he accompanied both Dietrich and Grenfell. The evening brightens with the musical numbers, in particular an updated version of Let's Do It, with John Major and the Prince of Wales neatly caricatured, and Piaf's La Vie En Rose. All in all, an occasion for those who like their passion vacuum-packed. At the Criterion until April 9.</p>

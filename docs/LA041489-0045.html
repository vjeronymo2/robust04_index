			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PREVIEW: METAL OR PUNK? NOT EVEN HEADBANGERS KNOW  </P> <P> To parents, the lines between punk and metal have always been blurred -- it  always just sounded like noise. Lately, though, even kids are having trouble  sorting out the labels. Hardcore fans turn up at speed metal shows, especially  if Slayer or Metallica is playing, while bands with punk roots (DRI,  Crumbsuckers) have converted lifelong metalheads.  </P> <P> What happened? Basically, metal guitarists discovered the joys of playing fast  . . . real fast, and hardcore musicians started exploring metal riffs and liked  what they found.  </P> <P> "At first, it was really weird seeing a bunch of metal bands playing faster,"  Excel's Dan Clements said by phone from the Venice skate shop where he works.  Formerly a member of the hardcore band Chaotic Noise, Clements now is in a  group that even he has trouble classifying.  </P> <P> Founded by Clements and fellow Chaotic Noise alumnus Adam Siegel, Excel is  often associated with Suicidal Tendencies, the best-known group of the Venice  skate metal/hardcore scene. Suicidal's Mike Muir is credited as executive  producer on Excel's first album, "Split Image," and when he's not in the  studio, Clements works in the Suicidal-owned skate shop in Venice.  </P> <P> Listen to Excel, and you'll hear the influence of thrash producer Randy Burns  (Megadeth, Nuclear Assault). He produced both "Split Image" and Excel's second  album, "The Joke's on You," to be released April 21.  </P> <P> Adam Siegel's guitar riffs are heavier than the Suicidal sound, and, as if to  emphasize the differences between the bands, Clements also works for skateboard  star Tony Alva, who owns Alva Skates and is considered by many to be the  arch-enemy of Suicidal Tendencies. It's all part of Clements' way of defying  classification and staying neutral. "One thing I respect is seeing a band like  Jane's Addiction -- they used to play to punk crowds, but they never took a  side."  </P> <P> Excel doesn't take sides either. Individuality and fighting hypocrisy are  common themes in Clements' song lyrics. "People sing about politics, people  sing about the devil, people sing about nuclear war -- they're always thinking  they know more than everybody else about something," Clements said. "But when  people read my lyrics they can't say they disagree with what I write."  </P> <P>  Excel, Candlemass, Steel Prophet and Visual Discrimination appear at 7:45  tonight at the Country Club, 18415 Sherman Way, Reseda. Tickets are $12. For  information, call (818) 881-5601.  </P> <P> LAURIE OCHOA  </P></p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Port leaves a bitter taste in Rifkind's mouth: Disagreements over the Tees &amp; Hartlepool privatisation THAT the first privatisation of a trust port has turned into an embarrassing debacle is clear. But is it a case of bungling on a spectacular scale? Or has the decision simply been misunderstood? A furore erupted when the Tees &amp; Hartlepool Port Authority decided last month to sell its port neither to the highest bidder nor to a management/employee buy-out team, but to a consortium called Teesside Holdings for Pounds 180m. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, said he was 'minded' to approve the decision as soon as the necessary order had been approved in parliament. Last week, however, he was obliged to bow to the protests by ordering a departmental review of the port authority's decision. The review, likely to take about two weeks, will need to address a number of serious concerns. The main ones are: Why was the port not sold to its management and employees? The simple answer is price: the buy-out team offered only Pounds 150m compared with Teesside Holdings' Pounds 180m. Yet price was only one of three criteria set for the port's sale. The others were to ensure that the port operated to the benefit of the local economy, and 'to have particular regard to the desirability of encouraging the disposal to managers and staff of the whole, or a substantial part, of the equity'. Given this strongly expressed preference for a buy-out, how could Teesside's bid have been preferred when it was offering employees an equity stake of only 5 per cent compared with the buy-out team's 100 per cent? One adviser close to the sale says the buy-out team misjudged the degree of preference that would be given to a management/employee bid. It was clear from other privatisations - for example, in the bus industry - that a bid from a buy-out team would be worth only an extra 5 per cent or so on the value of their bid. 'They could easily have closed the gap by bringing in a bit of outside equity and ratcheting up a bit,' he said. But in his opinion, the buy-out team was greedy: it wanted all the equity for itself. Did the port authority favour Teesside by negotiating with it during the contest? Teesside is said to have raised its initial bid from Pounds 100m to Pounds 120m, brought in two outside investors - Powell Duffryn and 3i - raised its bid again to Pounds 180m and changed its name to Teesside Holdings before the bidding closed. The implication is that it received guidance from the vendor's advisers that its original bid was deficient. That, however, is not unusual or improper in privatisations of this kind. Those involved in the sale say all the bidders were advised about the competitiveness of their offers, and could have adjusted them accordingly. Then why was the buy-out team not advised that its bid was unlikely to win? Advisers connected with the sale says it was, but claim the management was over-confident to the point of arrogance. 'They really committed hara-kiri on this,' says one. 'They just wouldn't listen to what they were being told.' If price was the ultimate consideration, why was the port not sold to the highest bidder? Teesside's bid of Pounds 180m was well short of the Pounds 202m offered by the highest bidder, Maritime Transport Services. Furthermore, MTS had devised a scheme for putting up to 20 per cent of the equity in the hands of management and employees, against Teesside's 5 per cent. What counted so heavily against MTS was concern about the company's other main activity: operating the relatively new Thamesport container terminal on the Isle of Grain in Kent. This is incurring heavy start-up costs, which led to fears that Tees &amp; Hartlepool's revenues could be diverted to support it. One adviser to the sale says these fears were made known to MTS, but the company did not adequately dispel them. Its plans for the development of Tees &amp; Hartlepool were less ambitious than Teesside's, exacerbating concerns that it could be planning to use the port as a cash cow. Set against this, however, is the fact that MTS's chairman, Mr Geoffrey Parker, is one of the industry's most experienced leaders, and that the bid had the backing of County NatWest and Legal &amp; General Ventures. The puzzle is that these qualifications failed to set the authority's mind at rest. Could Teesside's offer of seats on its board have presented the port authority with a conflict of interest? Teesside said that if its bid succeeded, it would bring in local expertise by appointing one member of the port authority to its board and one local lawyer. However commendable in motive, the effect was that the people judging the competition knew that one of their number could benefit if Teesside won. Furthermore, it seemed possible that the local lawyer chosen would be from the firm advising the port authority on the bidding. The possibility of the public perceiving a potential conflict of interest in the offer of two places on the board makes it remarkable that it was allowed to stand. As with the other concerns over the sale, Mr Rifkind's problem is not just to establish that the decision was fair, but to persuade a doubting public that it can be seen to be fair. The second may prove more difficult than the first.</p>

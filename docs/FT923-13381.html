			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt tax fears join dollar and interest rates APPREHENSION ahead of the Bundesbank meeting on Thursday combined with a weaker dollar to depress bourses yesterday. Paris was closed for the Bastille holiday and will re-open on Wednesday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT added higher taxes to its fears, singling out carmakers after weekend newspaper stories saying that driving in Germany would become 30 per cent more expensive. BMW dropped DM9.50 to DM571, Daimler by DM11.50 to DM746 and Volkswagen by DM8.20 to DM373.70 as the FAZ index shed 6.78 to 687.08 at midsession, and the DAX by 17.98 to 1,736.50 at the close. However, turnover fell from DM4bn to DM3.9bn and dealers said that both investment thinking, and trading was extremely short term. Deutsche Bank made Daimler a trading sell yesterday. There was also a report that slowing growth, more international competition and technological advances could cause the German car industry to lose up to 200,000 jobs from its current total of 780,000. After hours, the transport minister, Mr Gunther Krause, denied a report that he wanted petrol taxes raised, although he defended his call for the introduction of motorway user fees. Siemens fell DM7.10 to DM654.40 on talk was that Deutsche Bank was a seller. In retailing, Massa followed its former major shareholder, Asko, into troubled waters, reporting big extraordinary costs and halving the dividend; its shares fell DM9 to DM190. MILAN drifted lower after a quiet start but was enlivened towards the end of the session when a domestic broker actively bought shares in Montedison and Generali. The Comit index fell 1.2 to 441.05 in turnover estimated at less than Friday's L117.6bn. Dealers said that 90-95 per cent of options were abandoned when they expired yesterday. Generali closed L215 down at L27,445 before rebounding to L27,800 while Montedison closed L7 lower at L1,410 but reached L1,435 after hours. In a generally easier telecom sector, Sip fell L23 to L1,175 on uncertainty about the effects of the government's plans to freeze tariffs. But Italcable, which manages telephone traffic between Italy and non-European countries, bucked the trend, adding L90 to L4,530. At a presentation in London yesterday, the company said that outgoing calls rose 42 per cent in the last four months, which it attributed to the big improvement in the network as a result of heavy investment by Sip and Italcable. Regarding the current reform of the sector, the company forecast that its turnover would double if it were granted the European traffic previously managed by ASST. It estimated the cost of the transfer at roughly 1.6 per cent of its revenues for the first three years, plus payment for the proportion of the assets it would inherit from ASST, which it would depreciate over the next seven years. The big question mark, however, was what proportion of ASST's 18,000 employees Italcable would have to take on. ZURICH fell on interest rate fears, the SMI index closing 15.0 lower at 1,841.5. Adia, the temporary employment agency, plunged again, the shares falling SFr27, or 9 per cent to SFr258 on a depressing interim report for 1992. AMSTERDAM weakened on the dollar and interest rate uncertainty, the CBS Tendency index closing 1.4 lower at 203.7. News that Tandy was to cease selling Philips' CD-I system through its US outlets contributed to a 40 cent decline in its shares which closed at Fl 28.80. Elsevier went against the trend, rising 60 cents to Fl 107.90. BRUSSELS fell back with SGB losing BFr95 to BFr2,025 in volume of only 13,900 shares. The Bel-20 index ended 5.51 lower at 1,166.20 in turnover of BFr507m. Solvay was one of the few stocks to rise on the day, advancing BFr250 to BFr12,500 in volume of just 4,575 shares. MADRID gained ground with the general index advancing 0.5 to 235.75. Popular rose Pta60 to Pta10,930 after reporting a 19 per cent increase in first half consolidated net profit. VIENNA continued to decline with OMV, the oil group, losing another Sch62 or 8.4 per cent to Sch675. The ATX index closed down 24 at 865.07, a fall of 2.7 per cent. The weakness in OMV affected other stocks, with Creditanstalt preferred shares declining Sch21 to Sch465 and Bundeslander preferred shedding Sch20 to Sch630. STOCKHOLM fell back, reversing a two-day recovery which had brought the market off its lowest level for the year which it reached last Wednesday. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 9.2 to 888.1, in thin turnover of SKr289m after SKr280m. Astra, the session's most active issue with turnover of SKr38m, saw its A shares fall SKr4 to SKr546, while its B shares lost SKr5 to SKr527. COPENHAGEN was shored up by shipping shares, selected banks and industrials as the CSE index rose 0.33 to 318.47. In shipping, AP Moeller's D/S 1912 rose DKr1,000 to DKr92,500, while D/S Svendborg climbed DKr700 to DKr131,000. Among banks, Unidanmark rose DKr2 to DKr175, although Den Danske Bank slipped DKr2 to DKr266. OSLO's all-share index lost 5.84 or 1.5 per cent to 391.05 in turnover of NKr138m. UNI Storebrand A lost NKr4 to Nkr28 on unconfirmed reports that the insurer was to seek new capital through a planned share issue of NKr1.4bn. Norsk Hydro fell NKr3 to NKr152.5. ISTANBUL fell slightly in low volume. The 75-share index closed down 27.95 at 4,356.39.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUL 13                            Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open    10.30am   11 am     12 pm    1 pm     2 pm    3 pm     close 1121.26  1120.73  1120.70  1121.83  1122.63  1122.28  1121.99  1121.63                Day's High  1123.27    Day's Low  1120.25          Jul 10      Jul 9     Jul 8      Jul 7     Jul 6           1129.14    1128.17    1121.53   1129.83   1134.09  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> U-T LABOR TALKS END WITHOUT ACCORD  </P> <P> Representatives of the San Diego Newspaper Guild and the Union-Tribune  Publishing Co., attempting to resolve an increasingly acrimonious labor dispute  threatening the two daily newspapers, ended talks Friday without agreement  after a full day of negotiating.  </P> <P> No date was set for new talks, although both sides expressed hope that some  sessions could be held next week.  </P> <P> The lack of an agreement, despite the presence of a state mediator, appeared to  worsen an already grim mood among employees. After Friday's negotiating  session, workers held a boisterous meeting at their strike headquarters.  </P> <P> "People in the plant are just outraged with management," said James Griffin, an  international representative of the Newspaper Guild who participated in the  negotiations.  </P> <P> "This is a sad day for San Diego journalism," one guild member said after the  talks ended.  </P> <P> Guild officials accused management of refusing to budge from its position on  two critical issues: The length of a new contract and the use of company  vehicles by circulation employees. The guild is seeking a three-year contract,  while management has offered a one-year package. The company is seeking to cut  back on use of fleet vehicles, the guild says.  </P> <P> Herb Klein, editor-in-chief of Copley Press, which publishes the morning Union  and afternoon Tribune, said both sides had made various proposals, but he  acknowledged that advances were few.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed that there wasn't as much progress as I had hoped," Klein  said.  </P> <P> The two sides, working with the state mediator relaying proposals from room to  room, met from 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the Hyatt Islandia hotel. One minor  matter, involving leaves of absence, was resolved, Griffin said.  </P> <P> The guild's 1,150 members, including reporters, photographers and employees in  the advertising, circulation, library and maintenance departments, have been  without a contract for 18 months. The guild authorized a strike last month.  </P> <P> Talks had resumed Wednesday after a 12-day hiatus.  </P></p>

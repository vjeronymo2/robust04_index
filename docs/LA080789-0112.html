			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RAIL WORKERS, SANTA FE AGREE TO CUT IN SIZE OF SOME TRAIN CREWS  </P> <P> Railroad workers have ratified an agreement with the Santa Fe Railway that  authorizes a reduction in the size of some freight train crews, the carrier  announced today.  </P> <P> "This agreement covers 30% of Santa Fe's conductors, trainmen and yardmen," the  railway said. "None of the approximately 1,300 employees involved will be  furloughed as a result of this agreement."  </P> <P> A standard crew consists of one conductor, one brakeman and one locomotive  engineer. Under the agreement, on designated intermodal trains, which represent  20% of the railway's through trains, there will be no brakeman.  </P> <P> In return, the railway is providing $75,000 to each employee who voluntarily  resigns. Those remaining employees will receive a $10,000 cash payment to be  paid by the end of September and $65,000 to be indexed for inflation and  distributed when they retire or leave the company.  </P></p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Water purity boils down to a question of price: Next week the results of surveys by water companies will start to emerge. They have taken the unusual step of asking their customers how much they are prepared to pay for purer water before they commit themselves to the huge investment needed to bring English and Welsh water into line with EC standards THE water companies' customers are so concerned about rising bills that some companies may ask industry regulators to allow them to delay expensive modernisation. That is one of the results to emerge from the first nationwide surveys of water customers' attitudes, which water companies will start to publish next week. Water companies have found that where customers are offered a choice in standards of service or water quality, they often prefer to have lower bills, even if that means forgoing some improvements. The exceptions are improving the taste of drinking water, the cleanliness of beaches and replacing lead piping. Customers' strong feelings about bills in many regions of England and Wales are likely to play a part in government deliberations over whether to privatise the Scottish water industry, already emerging as a political battleground. Most of the 33 companies in England and Wales will soon publish the conclusions from months of interviewing customers, domestic and commercial, in the biggest exercise of its kind in the industry. The consultations were ordered last summer by Ofwat, the industry regulator, at the same time as it published its controversial report, The Cost of Quality, which warned that ambitious environmental regulation would continue to push up bills above the rate of inflation for many years. Ofwat told companies that they had to gauge customers' reactions before committing themselves to further investment between 1992 and 2005. In the past month Ofwat has clashed with the National Rivers Authority, the water quality watchdog, over whether all these improvements - which could cost about Pounds 45bn in the 1990s - are necessary. Friction has arisen because Ofwat, which fixes price rises, does not control the environmental regulations, which are set by the European Commission, the UK government and the NRA. The survey methods chosen by the 10 large companies to get round this problem ranged from Welsh Water's questionnaire posted to all customers, to Thames Water's 'quality circles' with hand-picked panels, and long face-to-face interviews by many of the others. Customers were keen to have their say. Welsh Water said: 'We have been overwhelmed by the speed and volume of the response. Within five days of the first questionnaires going out, 67,000 of our 1.2m customers had replied.' North West Water, which conducted hour-long interviews with its chosen sample, said that more than half did not realise that the company managed sewage as well as water, and so were unaware of the link between their bills and the company's spending programme of more than Pounds 5bn this decade. Preliminary analysis suggests that the surveys will strengthen Ofwat's argument that the pursuit of perfection in water standards, beyond levels necessary for health, is resented by many cus-Tomers. Companies have found that: Much customer concern focuses on the spending needed to meet the EC urban waste water directive, one of the most expensive of all the new rules, which covers treatment of sewage and its discharge to estuaries and coasts. Water companies have estimated that this directive alone could cost Pounds 8bn. Many customers would like to see the most ambitious improvements - such as waste water treatment - stretched out over a longer period to slow the rise in bills. Customers are prepared to pay more for some 'aesthetic' improvements such as avoiding discoloured water in the Northumbrian region and, in Wessex, better-tasting water and a solution to the problem of rivers running low. While customers are wary of future price rises, they are generally appreciative of the investment that has already been made. They tend to accept the principle that much of the cost of improvements is passed on to them - Anglian Water reports that more than three quarters of its customers are willing to pay more for higher standards. The companies will publish these responses and their spending plans in 'market plans' which Ofwat says must be made available to customers in a 'short, illustrated document in non-technical language'. The market plan will be a main part of the business projections which the companies must submit to Ofwat next spring, as a basis for Ofwat's periodic review. The review will be the first wide-ranging assessment of pricing formulae since the 1989 water privatisation and will set price rises until 2005. Ofwat said last week 'customers were not involved in setting price rises at privatisation and this time Mr Ian Byatt (Ofwat's director-general) wants them to play a part'.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Hongkong Land ahead by 9% HONGKONG Land, the Jardine Matheson group's property investment arm, yesterday reported net profit before extraordinary items of USDollars 165.9m for the six months ended June 1993, representing a 9 per cent increase over the 1992 figure. The interim dividend is being increased to 3.15 US cents from 3 cents last time. The company also booked a USDollars 213.2m extraordinary profit from the USDollars 490m sale of its Number Nine Queens Road commercial development. The deal was announced in May 1992, but was only completed in June 1993. Hongkong Land remains the colony's largest commercial landlord, and with average leases of three years on its property portfolio, it is still feeling the affect of a sharp downturn in office rentals in 1989 and 1990. However, commercial property prices have appreciated substantially in the past 12 months, and the longer-term outlook is more positive. Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said: 'While property earnings for the full year are expected to remain flat, in part due to the loss of rental income from Nine Queen's Road Central in the second half, the medium-term outlook is for renewed growth as reversions come through to profits.' The company has diversified from its exclusive role as core Central landlord, by taking the largest single stake in a consortium to build Container Terminal 9. However, the project continues to face political opposition from China. It has also purchased a 25.3 per cent shareholding in UK-listed Trafalgar House. Jardine International Motor Holdings (JIMH), the motor trading arm of Hong Kong's Jardine Matheson group, yesterday announced a 21 per cent rise in first-half net profit to USDollars 35.8m, up from USDollars 29.7m a year earlier. Profits growth was struck on marginally higher turnover of USDollars 462.4m. The Hong Kong operations, which hold the exclusive right to sell Mercedes Benz cars, registered lower earnings, but a stronger second half is expected. There was a surge in sales of Mercedes into southern China in the first half of the year, through associate company Southern Star, which contributed USDollars 6m, up from USDollars 2.1m in 1992. 'Sales in the first half remained at last year's high level and the company continues to expand its distribution network. Performance in the second half could be affected by the austerity measures recently introduced in China,' the company said. An interim dividend of 1.2 US cents a share is recommended, up from 1.06 cents a year ago.</p>

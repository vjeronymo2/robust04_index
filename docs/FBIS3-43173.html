			<p>REGIONAL          Turkey Fears Losing Oil Advantage to Moscow      In an interview, Turkish economist Mustafa Sonmez expressed  concern over developments in the route-selection process for oil and  natural gas pipelines from Central Asia to Europe.  Sonmez, who is  known for his pipeline research, said that Russia's preference for  Novorossiysk Port for both oil and natural gas would put control of  the spigots in Russia's hands and cautioned operators and financing  institutions to concentrate lobbying activities on avoiding such a  possibility.  Upon his return from a three-day international  conference at Tampa, Florida at which the pipelines were a major  topic of debate, Sonmez answered questions about how the Central  Asia pipelines will affect regional economic and diplomatic balances  and whether Turkey will be able to take advantage of the "golden  opportunity" they represent.      Sonmez said that Turkmenistan natural gas will help Turkey  develop gas-fueled power plants and chemical facilities to meet the  increased fertilizer requirement resulting from the irrigation side  of the giant Southeast Anatolia (dam and irrigation) Project.  Sonmez stated that the gas pipeline will create jobs, bring in $250  to $400 million annually in foreign exchange through transshipment,  and produce up to $600 million annually in the export of goods and  services, as well as the opportunity to "offset" the cost of gas  used.      According to Sonmez, four routes have been proposed:  (1)  Turkmenistan prefers a route to Eastern Anatolia via Iran, to avoid  riling that neighbor; (2) Turkey prefers a pipeline under the  Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan-Nakhichevan and on to Anatolia, (3) while  the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which  will finance the project, has tried to balance Muslim and Christian  interests by supporting; a route passing through Armenia from  Azerbaijan-Nakhichevan, or; (4) Azerbaijan-Georgia-Anatolia.      Sonmez estimated that an oil pipeline from the Caspian to the  Mediterranean would carry 40 million tons of crude oil per year, 25  million tons of which would be Azerbaijan oil.  The 1,040-km line  would intersect the existing Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline at Viransehir in  Turkey and would cost $1.5 billion.  He added that the Caspian-  Mediterranean route would benefit Turkey by providing constant  foreign exchange from offset and transit earnings and could be built  with $400 million in capital and $800 million in credit (numbers as  reported).  (Istanbul NOKTA 3-9 Oct 93)      Sonmez noted, however, that Russia does not favor this route and  was denied its preferred route through the Turkish Straits because  Turkey would not accept the environmental pollution risk.  In  addition, Russia wanted Azerbaijan and Central Asian oil piped to  Novorossiysk and then shipped to the Turkish port of Samsun.  A  pipeline would be built from Samsun to join the existing Kirikkale-  Ceyhan line, perhaps including Sile and Kiyikoy which flank the  Straits.

The republic's prime minister, Muhammad Sabirof, said  that Tatarstan wants to develop economic relations with Turkey and  that it will sell war industry products on a commodity exchange  basis. The helicopters sale represents the first realization of this  policy, according to a report datelined Kazan.  However, Sabirof  said that the Turks are not making the necessary effort for trade,  that they had sent poor quality goods to Kazan, and that "we had to  cancel a recent exhibition."  On a different note, Sabirof also said  that Tatar geological experts believe that rich oil deposits exist  in Anatolia and are doing oil exploration in Turkey.

He said that Turkish  businessmen have operated in Kazakhstan on a "scam" mentality and  have left behind a very negative impression.

(Istanbul DUNYA 6 Oct 93)      Last Word on "Turkish"-"Turkic" Quandary      A column in Turkish daily MILLIYET cites comments by professor  Nadir Devlet on the ongoing debate over whether to use "Turkish" or  Turkic" in reference to the CIS Muslim states.  In Devlet's view,  with the republics now tending to pull away from Turkey, perhaps the  Turks have been "presumptuous" and "patronizing" in reducing the  republics' languages to the status of Turkish dialects and that, to  preserve the bridge between them, they should use the term used by  the CIS Muslim states themselves-- "Turkic."  Hasan Pulur published  Dr. Devlet's comments in his regular column in an attempt to "lay  the question to rest."

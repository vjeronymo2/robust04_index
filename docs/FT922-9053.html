			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Cookery: There is life after paella of the pleasurable kind. The myth that Spanish food and drink begins and ends with tourist-trap gazpacho, paella and sangria is about to be exploded once and for all. Maria Jose Sevilla is poised deliciously and passionately to dispel the crude caricature and to open our eyes to the true and infinitely more subtle character of culinary Spain. In the course of five television programmes and in an accompanying book she takes us on a tour of Galicia, the Basque country and Navarra, Catalonia, Madrid and the Mesetas, and Andalusia. We cannot talk about la cocina, she insists. There is a plurality of cooking styles. Each region has its own local traditions, born of the terrain and the seas that bound it, shaped by Greek, Roman, Moorish and other influences mingling with the indigenous culture - and the evolution goes on today. I have travelled with Maria Jose Sevilla in Spain and witnessed first hand her passion for the cooking of her country. She has an inquiring mind and extensive knowledge of wines as well as of local ingredients and cooking. She lights up when talk turns to pork and beans or Basque fishermen's stews, and she welcomes the chance to roll up her sleeves and start mixing garlic and spices into freshly minced pork to make chorizo. If her television programmes are as inspiring, they will introduce the viewer to the producers of a lovely array of hams, cheeses, olive oils and wines, many of which are almost unknown in the UK. They will follow Sevilla into markets bustling with spice stalls, tripe stalls, dazzling displays of fresh fish, and a great deal more. And they will feature this ambassadress for the good food and drink of regional Spain, aproned and wooden- spooned, aiding and abetting her compatriot chefs and home cooks as they prepare dishes for our delectation. Here, as an appetiser, are three recipes from the book. CHICKEN LIVER PROFITEROLES (serves 6) Maria Jose Sevilla makes these unusual profiteroles to float in a rich meaty caldo made with chicken, a Serrano ham bone and oxtail. They would also be good to garnish the highly flavoured pure chicken broth I wrote about recently. 2 tablespoons olive oil; 4 oz plain flour; 2 eggs, beaten plus 1 egg yolk; 9 oz chicken livers; 4 oz pine kernels. Put the oil in a pan with 8 fl oz water, some salt and pepper. Bring to the boil. Away from the heat tip in the flour. Beat well until the mixture forms a ball which comes away cleanly from the sides of the pan. Put the dough into a bowl and work in the two eggs. Spoon or pipe the mixture into walnut size balls, and space them out on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 350`F (180`C) gas mark 4 for 15 minutes until puffed up and golden brown. Cut a slit in the base of each profiterole and set them aside to cool slightly while you blend the chicken livers, egg yolk and pine kernels in a food processor until creamy. Pipe or spoon the filling into the profiteroles and drop them into a pan of piping-hot soup. Simmer for 2 minutes. The filling will cook in the hot soup. Serve immediately. ESCALIVADA (serves 4) This is a very traditional dish from Catalonia. The instructions given here are for baking it in the oven, but Sevilla says if you can make escalivada griddled over charcoal, so much the better. 1 lb small aubergines; 2 red peppers; 2 Spanish onions; 2 potatoes; 3 tomatoes; 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil; 2 tablespoons chopped parsley. Rub all the vegetables with some olive oil. Place the first four sorts on a baking tray and bake for 45 minutes at 350`F (180`C) gas mark 4. Add the tomatoes and bake for a further 15 minutes or so until all the vegetables are cooked. You may need to vary the cooking times depending on the size of the vegetables. Peel the cooked vegetables with your fingers. De-seed the peppers and tomatoes. Tear the aubergines and peppers into thin strips, the tomatoes into pieces, and slice the potatoes and onions. Arrange the vegetables on a serving dish and season with salt and pepper. Pour the remaining oil over the vegetables, sprinkle with parsley and serve warm or cold. MERLUZA EN SALSA VERDE (serves 4) Sevilla describes this as one of the pillars of Basque gastronomy. She advises sprinkling the fish with a little sea salt and resting it in the fridge for a couple of hours before cooking, and warns against allowing the oil to get too hot - the garlic should stew, not fry. She tells me that the recipe is demonstrated on television. Don't miss it: the way the gelatin seeps from the fish as it cooks and mingles with the oil to make the sauce is intriguing. 4 x 5 oz hake steaks; 3 1/2 fl oz olive oil; 3 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced; 2 fl oz dry white wine;  3/4 fl oz fish stock or water; 4 parsley sprigs, finely chopped; 6-8 clams, scrubbed (optional); a few green asparagus stalks, blanched (optional). Put a flameproof earthenware cazuela over an indirect heat. Pour in the oil. When it is warm add the garlic. Cook until light golden, then strain the oil into a container and reserve the garlic separately. When the oil has cooled slightly return half of it to the cazuela and set over low heat. Add the fish, then take the cazuela off the heat. Hold the pot with both hands and shake constantly in a circular movement. Add the rest of the oil little by little and shake until a thick creamy white sauce is achieved. Add the garlic and carry on shaking the pot. Return the pan to the heat, add the wine, stock or water and parsley and cook for a couple of minutes. Then add the clams and asparagus and cook for a further minute. Discard any clams that remain closed, and serve. Spain On A Plate by Maria Jose Sevilla, is published by BBC Books at Pounds 14.95. The five-part television series of the same name begins on BBC 2 on Friday May 15.</p>

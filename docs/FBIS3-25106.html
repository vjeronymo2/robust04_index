			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Durban Feb 7 SAPA -- KwaZulu Police [KZP]  commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During will appear before the  Transitional Executive Council [TEC] on Tuesday [8 February] to  supply information about alleged KZP hit squads, his lawyer  confirmed on Monday. In an out-of-court settlement on Friday,  it was decided Gen During would appear before the TEC in  Pretoria on Tuesday afternoon. This averted Monday's planned  TEC application for a Supreme Court order compelling Gen During  to appear before the council, said the KZP commissioner's legal  representative Patrick Falconer.    Acting on the instruction's of kwaZulu Chief Minister and  Police Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Gen During has until now  refused to appear before the TEC. Mr Buthelezi and the kwaZulu  government refuse to recognise the TEC's authority.    In a statement on Monday, Mr Buthelezi said media reports  stating his government had capitulated to the TEC were a  "blatant misrepresentation of the facts".    "Neither I nor my administration have deviated one iota from  our rejection of the TEC which we regard as an undemocratic and  politically biased structure which is embarking on a campaign  against their political rivals."    He said he had accepted the settlement based on the fact  that  SA Police [SAP] Commissioner Gen Johan van der Merwe had the  authority to instruct Lt-Gen During as a seconded member of the  SAP to appear before the TEC. "In my capacity as minister of  the KZP I would not obstruct such a request by the commissioner  of the SAP," said Mr Buthelezi.    "Secondly, I point out that the settlement was also based on  a withdrawal of the (Supreme Court) action by the TEC with each  party bearing its own legal costs. This is hardly indicative of  a successful suit by the TEC."    Earlier, Mr Falconer explained that in terms of Friday's  settlement, Gen During would appear before the TEC in his  "private capacity" and not as KZP commissioner. In this way the  kwaZulu government would not appear to be officially recognising  the TEC.    However, TEC Co-Chairman Zam Titus responded on Monday that  "as far as I'm aware, that is not the situation". He could not  comment further as the issue would be discussed at a meeting  later on Monday. The meeting had not been concluded by early  Monday evening.    Gen During's expected appearance before the TEC follows a  Goldstone Commission report last year on the existence of at  least one KZP hit squad allegedly responsible for several  murders in Natal. Five suspects -- allegedly linked to some of  the murders -- have appeared in court in Mtunzini, near  Empangeni, and will appear again next month.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Violence marks Russian Christmas VIOLENCE prompted by soaring food prices and fresh rumblings in the armed forces marked the first Russian Orthodox celebration yesterday of Christmas as an official holiday since the Bolshevik Revolution. Tass news agency said people in the southern town of Stavropol smashed shop windows in anger at the explosion of prices triggered by the abrupt end of seven decades of price controls last week. Shops in the agricultural centre best known as the birthplace of Mr Mikhail Gorbachev were forced to reduce their newly-liberated prices for meat and sausage. In Ukraine, the deputy chief of the Black Sea Fleet said the 300-ship force could not go along with an oath of allegiance demanded by the Ukrainian government. Admiral Ivan Kapitanets explained the fleet was part of the strategic forces which are supposed to remain under the unified command of the Commonwealth of Independent States. President Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, has given servicemen until January 20 to decide whether to take the oath or to go back to Russia. A first batch of 850 recalcitrants is due to be repatriated this week. But the Russian leadership, already unhappy about Ukraine's haste in dividing up the armed forces, has served notice that it will resist attempts to take over the Black Sea Fleet. Two conservative newspapers, Krasnaya Zvezda, the armed forces daily, and Sovietskaya Rossiya, published angry officers' letters and hostile editorials expressing concern at the break-up of the Red Army. Republican representatives today meet in Moscow to tackle military issues at expert level. But food remains the main issue. Protests in the ancient town of Vladimir forced authorities to intervene to lower the still-controlled price of milk from Rbs6 to Rbs1.20, while a complaint by young mothers prompted similar action by the regional government council in Nizhny Novgorod. (The Russian government has devolved responsibility for remaining price controls to local authorities). Elsewhere there were signs of a voluntary lowering of prices by shops after food was left lying untouched on the shelves. With free prices an entirely new concept for state shops and most suppliers, it will take time to find the right price levels to clear stocks. Tass said prices for dairy products and vegetables, which initially soared by as much as ten times, had fallen back in a number of towns such as Yaroslavl and Syktyvar.

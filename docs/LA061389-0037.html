			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The radio-commanded firing of an onboard motor shifted a new navigation  satellite into a circular orbit about 11,000 miles above the Earth, the Air  Force reported. The Navstar satellite was launched from Kennedy Space Center in  Florida on Saturday into a preliminary elliptical orbit ranging from about 100  to 11,000 miles high. The new satellite is the second advanced model Navstar to  be launched. It is designed to tell U.S. and allied military forces where they  are within 50 feet anywhere in the world. Ground stations tracked the satellite  for nearly two days to determine its orbital path, then sent a radio signal to  start the motor.  </P></p>

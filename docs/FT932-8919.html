			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Clarke reassures sceptics with ERM pledge MR KENNETH Clarke underpinned his claim to the chancellorship by reassuring the Euro-sceptic wing of the Tory party yesterday he would not seek sterling's early return to the European exchange rate mechanism. The home secretary's suggestion that ERM re-entry might be delayed beyond the general election due by 1997 came as the semi-public debate among ministers about Mr Norman Lamont's future at the Treasury intensified pressure on Mr John Major to bring forward his expected summer cabinet reshuffle. Some senior members of the government want the reshuffle during the Whitsun recess at the end of this month. Friends of Mr Lamont, however, said he had received no indication in conversations with the prime minister that Mr Major had already decided to replace him. Mr Lamont was said to be 'getting on' with preparations for November's unified Budget. It was also pointed out in the chancellor's support that it was only at Mr Lamont's insistence that the government removed from the Maastricht treaty a provision that would have made ERM membership a legal obligation. Mr Clarke's comments coincided with admissions from other 'pro-European' ministers in the cabinet that they have all but abandoned hope in anything but the long term of retying the sterling to the D-Mark. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said it was 'very difficult to see' Britain fulfilling the condition in the Maastricht treaty that all currencies should be in the narrow bands of the ERM by the end of 1994. Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, echoed that view. Mr Clarke, a favourite to replace Mr Lamont, went further. He said that he would be 'surprised' if the pound rejoined the ERM during the lifetime of the present parliament. His statement was interpreted by supporters of the home secretary as providing clear evidence that Mr Major could appoint him chancellor without risking a renewed split in the Conservative party over Europe. In the past, Mr Clarke's known enthusiasm for Europe and for the ERM have brought warnings from the Euro-sceptics and their allies on the Tory right that they would not tolerate his appointment as chancellor. Speaking to Sir David Frost on BBC Television, though, he said his well-known commitment to exchange rate stability did not imply an early return to the ERM. 'At the moment . . . the circumstances for our return to the ERM simply don't exist'. Stressing the lack of convergence among European economies he added: 'So I would be surprised if we were back (in the mechanism) before the end of this parliament.' In a typically forthright interview, Mr Clarke readily acknowledged his ambition ultimately to be prime minister. But, dismissing suggestions of a challenge to the present incumbent, he added that he was sure that Mr Major would remain as prime minister for 'many years to come'. Mr Heseltine also downplayed Westminster speculation that Mr Major's position will come under serious threat unless he moves quickly to restore his authority.

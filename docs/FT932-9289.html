			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Arts: Welcome showcase for British art - The Arts Council's rehang at the Festival Hall One of the good things to come out of Tony Banks's stint as cultural supremo of the old Greater London Council, in the period of its last controversial fling before abolition, was the liberating of the Royal Festival Hall. It has proved a lasting legacy. From being an echoing desert, its vast foyer was transformed at once into an agreeable and useful public space, a lively yet easy social rendezvous, with its shops and bars and cafes, its free concerts and exhibitions. Not that the actual demonstration always lived up to the principle. The eager populism of its instigators tended too much at first towards a hectic and undifferentiated hubbub of competing activities. The visual arts suffered particularly by it, regularly demeaned, as I remember, by unconsidered hangs on temporary and inappropriate screens. But the policy at large was rightly persevered with, and 10 years on is now a matter for true celebration. The practical lessons were quickly learned, the polemic quietly dropped, and the exhibitions, some 20 of them every year, soon put on with an admirable and effective professionalism. The current celebration falls into two complementary parts, the one rather longer term than the other. Home as it now is of the old exhibitions department of the Arts Council, the Festival Hall is also home to the Arts Council's by now huge collection of modern British art, that fuels its loan and touring exhibitions. It amounts to some 7,000 drawings, paintings and sculpture, prints and photographs. The Festival Hall is itself a handsome building, well worth celebrating, and what could be better than to put out a few choice items of the collection to occupy those long clean walls and wide lobbies, landings and terraces. The latest rehang does just that, spreading nearly 50 assorted works around the place, on every level from 1 to 6 and dating from 1951 and the opening of the Hall itself, up to the day before yesterday. The point is less to present a coherent if scattered exhibition than to offer the works for themselves on their own terms, to be come upon in the course of the building's natural public use, just as they might be, mutatis mutandis, in any other miscellaneous collection, public or private. On the Green Side are the quieter and more contemplative pieces, on the Red the more challenging and confrontational. And from Reg Butler, Prunella Clough, Victor Willing and Richard Long downstairs to Paula Rego, Peter de Francia and Elinor Bellingham-Smith at the very top, it is a point well made. The more temporary and particular exhibition in the main foyer itself, of Recent British Painting and as well set up as ever, is somewhat more questionable. Malgre the more strident of my critical colleagues to the left of me, the more theoretical and doctrinaire of my curatorial friends to my right, I can tell you now that painting is not dead, nor even moribund. It never was. The only question is: what sort of painting do we mean? Here, of the currency of recent years, is what has lately caught the Arts Council's collective eye, and it includes, I must admit, work by artists, such as Edwina Leapman, Peter Joseph, Yuko Shiraishi and Mikey Cuddihy, whom I respect. The elegant minimalism of Joseph and Miss Leapman, oddly rich and expressive and nervously intuitive respectively, particularly intrigues me. I have never disavowed abstraction as such, nor do I intend to do so now; but here, in what is almost uniformly an abstract show, even the work I admire most seems now diminished, if only by a little, by an evident orthodoxy. The fault lies not with the artists themselves, who are ever free to work in whatever way they feel most appropriate to what they wish to achieve. Abstraction, after all, along with expressionism and surrealism, conceptualism and all the rest of it, is the legitimate gift of modernism, and it is not going to go away. But when we begin to feel that the artist must now work only in a certain way in order to be noticed, let alone taken seriously, then a certain resigned despair does set in. Here we have, for the most part, conventionally large canvases, on which a colour or tonal field is activated by a graphic or gestural incident of some kind. It may be delicately done, done even with an exquisite aestheticism  - but how soon such stuff sinks back into the formulaic and the merely decorative. What little figurative reference there is tends to be perfunctory and symbolic  - symbolic, that is to say, in the sense that the mere proposal of the image is enough, and the realisation may be taken as read. Has Peter Doig, with his 'Red Deer', ever sat out in the forest, and drawn the trees and the deer, indeed ever looked at more than a photograph of his animal friends? I think not. And are those who collect thus on our behalf really saying that nothing else of interest has been done these past 10 years or more? Is it now truly passe, irrelevant, a waste of time, to set up a still-life for proper scrutiny, to work from the head or the figure, to sit out in the field and paint the landscape? Is that the kind of painting that has died? They would indeed seem to say so, by so narrow a choice as this. If there is a proper subject of current debate in the visual arts, it is not at all to do with the variety or even the perversity of particular interest or activity, but only this. It is simply the fashionable, narrow, unthinking exclusivity of our cultural officers, in the interests they pursue and decisions they take on our behalf, a narrowness never excused, never defended, never explained. We are all ears. Moving into View: Recent British Painting, New Acquisitions &amp; Works from the Arts Council Collection. Royal Festival Hall, South Bank SE1, until May 23</p>

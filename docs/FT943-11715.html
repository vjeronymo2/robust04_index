			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Northrop Grumman's Dollars 65m debut Northrop Grumman, the product of a Dollars 2.2bn merger in April between two of the best-known defence contractors in the US, yesterday reported net income of Dollars 65m, or Dollars 1.33 a share, for the second quarter. It is the Los Angeles-based group's first set of results since Northrop defeated Martin Marrietta in a hotly-contested bid battle for Grumman. In the same quarter a year ago, before the merger, Northrop earned Dollars 53m, or Dollars 1.12 a share. Although the group said that sales, which rose 28 per cent to Dollars 1.31bn, would have declined by 13 per cent without Grumman's contribution, Northrop is sticking to its original estimate that the deal will be earnings neutral until early next year. This is when they expect the merger's positive benefits to start feeding through. The cost of the deal has left Northrop with Dollars 2bn in debt, compared with Dollars 425m a year ago and Dollars 160m before the merger. The group expects to eliminate the debt by the end of the decade. The group said its backlog of business was valued at Dollars 12bn at the end of the quarter, compared with Dollars 7bn a year ago.</p>

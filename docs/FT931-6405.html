			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Unfair dismissals 'increasing' EMPLOYERS are increasingly sacking staff just before they qualify for protection against unfair dismissal, the National Association of Citizen's Advice Bureaux said yesterday. The association pointed to 'growing exploitation' of employees during the recession, reflected in an increasing number of complaints to bureaux on employment issues. Such complaints represent the third-largest category of inquiries dealt with by the service after consumer debt and social security. The association yesterday published a report on the problem and pointed to several cases which, it said, illustrated exploitation. Bureaux also reported an increase in employers unilaterally changing employees' terms and conditions, particularly in hours and pay. The association's report made several recommendations to restrict exploitation. It wants employees with six months' service to be able to claim for unfair dismissal. The current threshold is two years. At present full-time employees must have accumulated two years' continuous service before they can claim unfair dismissal. Part-time workers working between 8 and 16 hours a week have a qualifying period of five years. Job Insecurity. Social Policy Section, National Association of Citizen's Advice Bureaux, 115-123 Pentonville Road, London N19LZ. Pounds 6.</p>

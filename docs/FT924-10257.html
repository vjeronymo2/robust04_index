			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Meagre rise in top Whitehall women THE PROPORTION of women in the top three grades of the Civil Service has risen half a percentage point over the past two years, an analysis of government figures shows. The analysis, carried out by the FDA top civil servants union, shows that women make up 7.7 per cent of top civil servants, compared with 7.2 per cent in 1990. The FDA said the figures showed some departments with no women in the top three grades, such as the Inland Revenue, where 60 per cent of the staff are women. Other departments had 20 per cent women at the top and the Home Office 25 per cent. The analysis shows that out of a total of 647 top Civil Service jobs, 50 were held by women by the end of June, compared with 43 out of 688 at the same time last year. Mrs Barbara Mills, the director of public prosecutions, is the only woman in grade one. Mrs Stella Rimington, head of the security service, is her equal in grade but is not strictly a home civil servant. The proportion of women in grade 3 is lower than that in grade 2, with only six out of 70 posts held by women. The FDA said: 'This suggests it will take a determined recruitment drive for women at grade 3 for there to be improvement.'</p>

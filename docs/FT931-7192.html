			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Banks fail to agree terms for Nippon Housing rescue NINE banks which back the Nippon Housing Loan group, the Japanese financial institution which has been worst hit by the implosion of the property market, yesterday failed to agree on a rescue package for the company. The future of the group, thought to have bad loans worth more than half its outstanding loan book of Y2,200bn (Dollars 18.9bn), is the most sensitive issue facing the troubled Japanese banking industry. Nippon Housing Loan, which aggressively expanded its property lending in the 1980s, has become a test case for whether the commercial banks can find a co-operative, private sector solution to the bad loans afflicting Japan's banking system. The rescue talks have been orchestrated by the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance. As yet, the government has insisted it will not fund a rescue package. However, if the banks which are the main lenders to Nippon Housing cannot agree a rescue plan, pressure for government intervention will grow. The nine commercial banks, which include Sanwa Bank and Sakura Bank, set up Nippon Housing Loan in 1971 to lend to home buyers and property developers. Agricultural banks, led by Norinchukin, later became large lenders to Nippon Housing. The banks yesterday rejected a restructuring plan presented by the company, which called for all fresh loans to be made at the short-term prime rate of about 4 per cent. The banks were also asked to forego interest payments on outstanding loans for the next 10 years. About 30 per cent of Nippon Housing's finance is provided by the commercial banks. Nippon Housing is estimated to need about Y60bn in fresh loans by the end of March 1994 to help it to reimburse maturing mortgage securities, which it marketed aggressively in the late 1980s. The outstanding securities are worth about Y300bn. Nippon Housing asked the agricultural banks to cut their interest rates on loans to 4.5 per cent and other institutions to 2.5 epr cent. The financial authorities are likely to encourage the banks involved to resume the talks as soon as possible to avoid risking triggering a crisis of confidence in the bank.</p>

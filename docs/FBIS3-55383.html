This Is the Only Way  of Reaching Agreement in East and West Europe": "While  Politicians Argue, Czech Army Switches to NATO Regulations"]    [Text] Prague -- "In the past Czechoslovakia played a key  role in winding up the Warsaw Pact -- that instrument of Soviet  hegemony," Czech President Vaclav Havel said recently. "Our  efforts were not only designed to eliminate the last obstacle to  participation in the system of collective defense of European  democracy, but were also aimed at eliminating the last obstacle  to the North Atlantic alliance's being turned into a European  instead of a West European structure."    Some politicians here were surprised that the president  devoted the second speech to deputies during his presidency not  to the republic's domestic political problems, but to joining  NATO. This speech was most likely directed not at Czech  parliamentarians but at Western politicians and Moscow.    What arguments did the first president of the Czech Republic  adduce in favor of NATO membership?    First, the Czech Republic is at the very heart of Europe and  is the traditional meeting point of geopolitical interests; many  wars have begun or ended here. Incidentally, this was in the  past one of the arguments for Czechoslovakia joining the Warsaw  Pact. "Historical experience shows that we cannot worry only  about ourselves, but for our own benefit we must show interest  in the all-European process, which, whether we like it or not,  concerns us more than other countries," Vaclav Havel believes.  "Our endeavor to accede to the alliance is not merely a desire  to receive international guarantees of our own security, but is  also based on our wish to assume some responsibility for the  situation on our continent...."    Second, the Czech Republic shares all the main values of  Euroamerican civilization, including a civil society,  parliamentary democracy, political pluralism, a rule-of-law  state, and respect for the individual. Since NATO's task is to  defend these values, the Czech Republic cannot remain aloof.    Third, based on historical experience, tragic experience  included -- primarily Munich 1938 -- the Czech Republic feels  the need to be included in a system of active collective  security.    In Vaclav Havel's opinion, Central Europe is currently in  the  foreground of the struggle for democracy and stability on the  whole continent. "I therefore believe," he said, "that the  Central European states should logically be prime candidates for  NATO membership."    The Czech president devoted a considerable portion of his  speech to Russia:    "To all appearances, NATO's relations with Russia and the  other republics of the former Soviet Union will be far more  complex. I think that there are just two options: Democratic  forces win victory in Russia, forces aware that NATO is not  Russia's enemy but an extremely promising partner and that  NATO's drawing near Russia's border does not mean the approach  of an enemy but a zone of democracy and prosperity, and that  this process accords with Russia's vital interests. But there  is also another option. Forces that are unable to give up the  imperial ambitions of the former Soviet Union, chauvinist, great  Russian forces...may gain the upper hand in Russia --  temporarily of course. They would undoubtedly protest NATO's  being expanded by the admission of the former Soviet satellites  and the alliance's drawing closer to Russia's borders.... I  think that the West would be making a fatal error were it to  succumb to their pressure. That would herald a return to Yalta  and the `cold war' period...."    It is hard to say whether Vaclav Havel convinced Western  politicians, but Czech parliamentarians viewed with approval the  -- albeit not that immediate -- prospect of acceding to the  North Atlantic alliance. It was only J. Ortman, chairman of the  Leftist Bloc deputies' club, who opposed the Czech Republic's  joining any military alliance and proposed that the question of  NATO membership not be resolved in parliament but by means of a  national referendum. Premier Vaclav Klaus was somewhat more  restrained than the others. In response to questions from  TELEGRAF newspaper readers he said:    "I think that the question of joining NATO is not on the  agenda now. We are still not ready for this and no one is  offering us membership at the moment. So, it is simply  pointless and unfeasible at the moment to raise the question of  a referendum. But I am convinced that NATO has played, is  playing, and will play its role in Europe, that is, the region  where the Czech Republic is situated. From this viewpoint it  would of course be good for us to be members of NATO."    Defense Minister Antonin Baudys believes that "the earlier  we  join NATO the better." Speaking about the October events in  Russia in an interview with LIDOWE NOVINY he noted: "Personally  they made me want to speed up the steps in NATO's direction.  This was an example of the possible danger. Today NATO is the  only functioning, well-organized military pact in the world.  Our only chance is to get full membership thereof...."    But FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, during an official  visit to Prague, recalled that the question of expanding NATO  eastward cannot be decided without considering Russia's  interests. "Russia is an extremely important factor for  stability in Europe," he said during a meeting with journalists.  "Stability can only be achieved `with' Russia but not under any  circumstances by uniting `against' Russia."    Nonetheless the problem of the Czech Republic's joining NATO  is still featuring in the Czech press. "The question of our  secure future is today closely linked with whether Russia joins  the West or not," PRACE wrote. "But if that does not accord  with Russia's wishes, we cannot abandon our intention of  becoming full-fledged members of the North Atlantic alliance."    A summit of all 16 NATO countries will be held in Brussels  in  a few days and important decisions on the bloc's future are  expected. "If the January political decisions on the North  Atlantic alliance's future strategy are extremely positive for  us, that does not by any means signify that the Czech Republic  will become a full-fledged member of this organization  overnight," Vaclav Havel believes. "At best this will be just  the start of a lengthy, fairly complex process...."    But, before the verdict is in, there is every indication  that  the Czech Army has already joined in this process. According to  Major General Pavel Jandacek, deputy chief of the General Staff  of the Czech Army, steps are being taken "to close the gap  between us and NATO armies and structures where possible in the  near future." In particular linguistic and professional training  is already under way, bearing in mind the Czech Army's future in  NATO. Over 160 officers and men have been sent to military  schools and courses in NATO, the United States, Canada, France,  Britain, the FRG, and Holland.    While the politicians are arguing, the military is acting.</p>

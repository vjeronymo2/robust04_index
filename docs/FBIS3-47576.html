Hosokawa made the comment in response to reporters'  questions  on market developments in connection with the government's  monthly economic report, released earlier in the day.    The report said the nation's economy remains at the worst  stage of the recession.    The dollar opened the day at 111.80 yen in Tokyo, down 0.50  yen from Thursday's close, and the 225-Nikkei stock average, a  key barometer on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, fell 90.91 points to  18,486.35 in early trading.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> HAWAII;  </P> <P> LAVA GOBBLES MORE KALAPANA BUILDINGS  </P> <P> Lava boiling out of Kilauea Volcano destroyed two more buildings in Kalapana,  Hawaii.  </P> <P> The fresh damage brought to 165 the number of homes and other structures  devastated since Jan. 3, 1983, when the volcano began erupting. The Kalapana  area once thrived, but only 18 homes remain: one in the old village, nine in  the old homestead area, and eight in Kalapana Gardens housing area. The last  home in the old village was in imminent danger as lava flowed just yards away,  and one flow came within seven feet of the home before stagnating, civil  defense spokesman Lanny Nakano said.  </P></p>

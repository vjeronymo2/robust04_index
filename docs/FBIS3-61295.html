			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [INTERFAX--SEGODNYA report: "Foreign Companies Have Invested </F> $7 Billion Into the Russian Economy; 60 Percent of the Investors  Are German Companies"]    [Text] The acceleration of the process of privatizing  Russia's large industrial enterprises, including those in the  fuels and power generation and the military-industrial  complexes, assumes an increased foreign investment in privately  owned and joint-stock companies. The improved legislation, which  gives foreign investors the right to participate in  privatization on a par with Russian citizens, should, in the  opinion in government experts, stimulate an increased inflow of  foreign capital into the Russian economy. The prime minister of  the Russian Federation is expected at any time to sign a  proposal drafted by the Russian Federation Committee on the  Administration of State Property [GKI], which gives foreign  investors the right to buy privatization vouchers and exchange  them for stock of enterprises without the concurrence of the  Russian Federation Ministry of Finance (actually, even before,  this requirement had been a mere formality).    In the estimation of government experts, foreign investment  into the economies of Russia and the former USSR republics,  including joint enterprises, by the fall of 1993 amounted to  only $7 billion. German companies comprise 60 percent of the  foreign investors, and Italian--20 percent; Austria,  Netherlands, and Belgium account for 10 percent, United  States--5 percent, Great Britain--2 percent, and the countries  of the Far East (Japan, Korea, and China) account for the  remaining 3 percent. This is due primarily to the fact that the  Germans began to penetrate the Russian market and form joint  enterprises with Russia much earlier than representatives of  other countries. According to GKI data, lately German companies  give a priority in capital investment to the chemical industry,  as well as machine building and food processing.    The Zellstoff und Papier company purchased 30 percent of the  stock of Zhukovskiy refrigeration plant. The company plans to  invest $2.03 million into the plant's development. The  Termozvukoizolyatsinnyye Izdeliya plant (Krasnoyarsk) sold 35  percent of its charter capital. The bid winner--the Knauf  Verwaltungsgesellchaft Iphofen--will invest 7.535 million German  marks [DM] into the plant. The Ceziwid Elektrowarme GmbH company  purchased 30 percent of stock of the Podolsk refractories plant.  The investment will amount to $1.2 million. German  electrotechnical giant Siemens acquired 10 percent of the  charter capital of Kaluzhskiy Turbinnyy Zavod joint-stock  company, which produces 50 percent of the turbines on the  territory of the former USSR. According to the auction terms,  the concern will supply the plant with DM2 million worth of  equipment for the reconstruction of two shops. A major German  company, Kautschuk Gesellshaft GmbH, purchased for privatization  vouchers a block of 19 percent of stock (at the cost of 91.795  million rubles) of one of the oldest enterprises in Tula  Oblast--Yefremovskiy Zavod Synteticheskogo Kauchuka. According  to the auction terms, the Kautschuk Gesellshaft GmbH company,  which has been working with the plant for about five years, is  to invest in its development DM1.48 million within four months  from the date that the deal is registered.    Italian firms prefer to set up joint enterprises with Russia  in the area of construction and construction materials  production. In the opinion of experts, Italian investors coming  into the Russian market are predominantly small and medium-sized  firms.    The United States began their penetration of the Russian  market considerably later than the Germans and Italians--in  1992. They invest money in a variety of national-economic  sectors--chemical, tobacco, mining, and electronics.    The American tobacco company Philip Morris acquired at an  investment auction a block of 20 percent of stock of the  Krasnodar tobacco factory. According to the terms of the bid,  $60 million will be invested in the plant's development over  five years. American company Procter &amp; Gamble--one of the  world's leading producers of synthetic detergents--acquired at  the investment auction 14 percent of the Novomoskovskbytkhim  joint-stock company (Tula Oblast)--the largest in the CIS and  Europe producer of household chemicals, which produces 30  percent of the laundry detergent in Russia. The company  undertook an obligation to invest up to $50 million in the  plant's development over five years.    Great Britain has been the latest entrant into the Russian  market--since the middle of 1993. British investors working with  Russian enterprises prefer to work with tobacco and light  industry enterprises. One of the largest textile companies in  Europe--the British company Illingworth Morris Ltd.--acquired at  the investment auction a block of 49 percent of stock of Moscow  factory Bolshevichka. The firm promises to invest $5.5 million  into the factory over five years, to purchase new materials for  Bolshevichka, to equip the factory with a new clothes-making  production line, and to make its network of stores available for  selling the goods produced by Bolshevichka.</p>

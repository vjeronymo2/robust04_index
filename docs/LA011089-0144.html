			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> PAM SHRIVER EASILY WINS OPENING GAME IN NEW SOUTH WALES  </P> <P> Defending champion Pam Shriver, returning after a five-week break, easily won  her opening match of the $350,000 New South Wales Open tennis championships at  White City today.  </P> <P> But Henri Leconte of France, top seed in the men's field, was upset in his  first-round match on the second day of the weeklong tournament.  </P> <P> The event is serving as a preliminary to the Australian Open starting in  Melbourne on Jan. 16.  </P> <P> Shriver, seeded second behind Martina Navratilova, scored a 6-1, 6-4 victory  over Australian teen-ager Jo-Anne Faull.  </P> <P> The victory advanced the American into the third round of the 56-draw Virginia  Slims women's event, being staged in conjunction with a 32-draw Nabisco Grand  Prix men's event.  </P> <P> The top eight women's seeds have byes through the first round.  </P> <P> Leconte, ranked ninth in the world, also was returning after a rest but found  the heat-wave conditions and Sweden's Peter Lundgren too much, losing 6-4, 6-3  in a first-round match.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I Couldn't Move'  </P> <P> Leconte, winner here in 1985, blamed a lack of match play and the hot weather  for his loss. He had not played since the Nabisco Masters in New York early  last month.  </P> <P> 'It always takes me a while to get going. It was very hot out there today and I  couldn't move," Leconte said.  </P> <P> Lundgren, ranked 66th in the world, counts Pat Cash, Mats Wilander and Ivan  Lendl among his victims.  </P></p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / European bank loans earmarked for CIS THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will reallocate loans, guarantees and equity investments following the decision to admit 11 former republics of the Soviet Union as members. Under recommendations made this week, 60 per cent of the bank's loans will be earmarked for all the countries of eastern Europe and the three Baltic States, while the remaining 40 per cent will be allocated to the 11 republics of the CIS. Georgia is the only former Soviet republic which has not yet joined the bank. However, the EBRD has decided that the number of shares to be taken up by republics in the CIS should not exceed the capital stock held by the former USSR. The USSR originally held 60,000 shares in the EBRD or 6 per cent of the total. These shares have now been distributed among the 11 republics, with the Russian Federation holding the largest share (40,000) and Turkmenistan holding the smallest (100). The republics are expected formally to join the bank in April, during its first annual meeting in Budapest. In a separate development, the EBRD unveiled its Energy Operations Policy, which is closely tied to the bank's environmental brief. The energy policy will be focused on four areas: repairing and rehabilitating existing supply facilities; completing existing projects which are urgently required; helping the countries of eastern Europe diversify their energy supplies as a means of weakening their dependency on the CIS for oil and gas supplies; and promoting private sector projects.</p>

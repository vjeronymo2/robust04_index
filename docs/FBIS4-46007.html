			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Journalist Venkatnarain] </F>   [Text] India appears all set to induct and deploy the short  range surface-to-surface missile, Prithvi, with the Army  successfully conducting the second user trial of this  indigenously developed world class weapon system yesterday.  Prithvi was already tested a dozen times by the Defense  Research and Development Organization over a five-year period  between 1988 and 1993. Last Saturday, the Army began the  crucial preinduction trial phase with its first user trial.  Yesterday's launch was to the missile's maximum range of 250  kms and all the mission requirements were achieved. The entire  exercise of the user trials is likely to be completed by the end  of next month. Prithvi will then be cleared for induction into  the defense forces. There may be at least six more user trials  in battlefield conditions.    The Army has opted for Prithvi with a shorter ranger of 150  kms. These missiles have the capability of carrying the more  lethal one ton warhead payload. However, the Indian Air Force  is opting for the 250 km range version to safeguard its forward  air bases as well as to bring enemy forward bases within  Prithvi's range. This will carry half a ton warhead.    When Prithvi's first experimental launch was successful in  1988, Western security analysts could hardly believe that India  could develop the missile system entirely on its own. When  Prithvi's induction and deployment seemed imminent in 1992, the  United States imposed trade sanctions on India. They are still  in force, but have not prevented our scientists from developing  this liquid propelled new generation ballistic missile.  Prithvi's liquid engine enables its flight to be controlled  through real time commands on board computer. [sentence as  heard] Its altitude and range thus become greatly flexible and  it has six alternate preprogrammed trajectories. All these make  it far superior to the Patriot and Scud missiles which performed  dismally during the Gulf war. Prithvi's designers and main users  see it as an accurate weapons system that can deliver very  specific military objectives ranging from a tactical  battlefield, heavy artillery support system to long range  knocking off of enemy supplies by striking at bridges, roads,  air fields, railroads, marshalling yards, and so on.    Prithvi's induction and deployment into the defense forces  will certainly enhance India's overall security by acting as a  deterrent. Once its sister missiles like the Trishul, the Akash,  the Nag, and the Agni make their way into the defense forces,  any enemy will have to think more than twice before launching a  conventional military adventure against India.</p>

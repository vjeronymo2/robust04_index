			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: ASC removes investment barrier THE Australian Securities Commission (ASC) is to facilitate local investment in foreign companies by removing the need for these companies to register an Australian prospectus. Mr Tony Hartnell, ASC chairman, said yesterday that Australian investors had in effect been excluded from issues of foreign securities because of the small local market and the practical difficulties of complying with local prospectus requirements. The result had been to exclude Australian investors from scrip issues by foreign companies, or from take-over offers for foreign companies in which they already held shares. Mr Hartnell indicated that rules would be relaxed to allow approved foreign companies to offer securities on Australian markets through a prospectus registered overseas. He said the ASC wanted to ensure that Australian investors had a wider choice of securities 'while retaining key elements of investor protection'. The change follows a public hearing into the matter in February this year.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> SOLUTIONS SOUGHT TO SCHOOL CROWDING  </P> <P> Facing increasing enrollment at a number of its westside schools, the Orange  Unified School District is considering a variety of options to accommodate more  students that range from condemning property for construction of new schools to  establishing year-round schedules.  </P> <P> This week, principals, administrators and parents are being asked for their  input on the plans presented to the Board of Education last week by Skip  Roland, the assistant superintendent for elementary school education.  </P> <P> Among the long-term solutions are proposals to shift some schools to a  year-round schedule, construct additions or add portable classrooms to some  schools, move sixth-graders to a middle school in selected areas, bus students  to currently closed sites, redraw district lines and condemn property to build  new schools where there is no open land.  </P> <P> Roland said portable classrooms must be added or renovated at eight elementary  schools. These include Cambridge, Chapman Hills, Fairhaven, Fletcher, Lampson,  Panorama, Sycamore and West Orange elementary schools. Estimated total cost for  renovations is close to $500,000, he said but added that the cost could be  reduced by moving existing portables from other sites.  </P> <P> Roland said enrollment is growing because of the increasing number of young  families moving into the Orange area.

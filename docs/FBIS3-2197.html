			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yu Jun (0060 0193): "Experts Suggest Carrying </F> Through the Plan for Free Exchange of Renminbi at an Early Date"]    [Text] Shanghai, 22 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Financial  experts here pointed out that it is necessary for China to  create conditions to achieve free exchange of renminbi to  restore its signatory state to GATT at an early date. Hence,  the problem of foreign exchange system reform must be placed  high on the government agenda.    Commenting on Shanghai's strategy for economic development,  Shanghai CPPCC (Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference) members, who are now attending the second session of  the eighth municipal CPPCC, believed that the reform of the  foreign exchange system will have different impact on the  economy of different areas. For Shanghai, which is set to  develop itself into an international economic, trade, and  financial center, the reform will mean more opportunities for  development, they said.    Shanghai is presently the place where China's biggest stock  exchange and biggest foreign currency swap center are situated.  As China opens wider to the outside world, especially as it  presses ahead with the foreign exchange system reform, spot  foreign exchange markets, forward foreign exchange markets, and  offshore financial markets will certainly be set up in turn.  If Shanghai plans to become an international financial center,  an important task is to energetically create conditions to  establish itself as a center of all these financial markets.  Shanghai CPPCC last year organized financial and trade experts  into several panels to conduct investigations and studies.  These panels presented their findings report at the current  CPPCC session.    The report entitled "Free Exchange of Renminbi and  Shanghai's  Financial Status" proposed principles for free exchange of  renminbi: Unifying exchange rates of renminbi and relaxing  control over foreign exchange. Free exchange of renminbi can  start with the current account of international payment and then  apply to capital account. Non-resident convertibility should be  allowed first and then resident convertibility. Along this  line, renminbi will finally become international money. To this  end, the key task is to expand exports at a greater pace, strike  a balance of international payments, and manage to reserve more  foreign exchange. In addition, efforts should be made to  stabilize currency values at home to lay a solid foundation for  free exchange of renminbi.    Shanghai should, in line with present conditions, relax  control over foreign exchange and vigorously develop a national  foreign exchange market to create the necessary conditions for  achieving free exchange of renminbi.    To achieve this, the findings report tabled specific plans:  With the support of the People's Bank of China, setting up a  national foreign currency swap center in Shanghai and gradually  changing it into a spot foreign exchange market; instituting a  well-managed unitary floating exchange rate system; setting up a  forward foreign exchange market in Shanghai as soon as possible;  appropriately relaxing control over foreign exchange; making  loans in renminbi to certain foreign-funded financial  institutions; and exploring ways for opening a limited offshore  financial market in Shanghai.</p>

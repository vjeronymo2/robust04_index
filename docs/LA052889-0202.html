			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VICTORY FOR PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> Major developers, with their money and political clout, have the reputation in  Orange County of being able to build virtually anything they want anywhere they  want it. But that is not always true.  </P> <P> In areas that are the most environmentally sensitive, like Upper Newport Bay  and the Bolsa Chica Wetlands, the protective instincts of residents are  aroused. And although success does not come quickly or easily, conservation and  common sense have prevailed.  </P> <P> The latest victory came Monday with the disclosure that, after nearly 20 years  of conflict, a compromise had indeed been agreed upon between the property  owner -- Signal Landmark Corp. -- city, county and state officials, and Amigos  de Bolsa Chica, the local environmental group formed 15 years ago to protect  the wetlands and the public interest.  </P> <P> All parties involved in the agreement deserve praise, but the community owes  Amigos de Bolsa Chica a grateful and special vote of thanks for its bulldog  determination and dedication to protect and preserve the irreplaceable  wetlands.  </P> <P> Some details must still be worked out, and the plan must be formally approved  by several local, state and federal agencies. But the compromise has produced a  scaled-down version that significantly reduces original development plans and  will restore more than 1,100 acres of wetlands, making it one of the largest  restored wetlands preserves in the state.  </P> <P> It is a major victory for the community. And the environment. And for  generations to come.  </P></p>

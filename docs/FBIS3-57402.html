			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius met  With Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt in Stockholm on 24  January. The prime ministers discussed problems of bilateral  security and the security of the Baltic Sea region, the  positions of both countries on the Partnership for Peace plan,  and the possibilities and areas of cooperation between Lithuania  and Sweden.    We are grateful to the Government of Sweden for the huge  help  granted to us in all areas, starting with the Ignalina nuclear  power station and ending with environment protection, Prime  Minister Adolfas Slezevicius told the ELTA correspondent.    Sweden welcomes the acceleration of the process of  integration of the Baltic states. The Swedish prime minister's  evaluation of joint efforts by the Baltic states to strengthen  the control over the eastern borders, while implementing joint  projects on the control over the airspace and maritime borders,  was very positive.    Sweden will also help us to organize the training of the  joint peacekeeping unit. It has been agreed that Sweden,  together with other Scandinavian countries, will take part in  the drawing up of a project of a trunk gas pipeline from the  North Sea to the Baltic states. All the Scandinavian countries  have interest in this project.    We proposed to Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt that the  Baltic Institute in Karlsten should open a branch in Klaipeda.    The trade volume with Sweden in the overall balance of  Lithuania's imports and exports comprises 3-4 percent. More  than 70 Swedish-Lithuanian joint enterprises have been set up.    Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are setting up a council of  ministers of the Baltic states similar to the currently existing  Nothern Council of Ministers, which comprises five countries,  including the Scandinavian countries.    Much attention was given at the meeting to the problems of  the Kaliningrad region. It has been agreed to give support in  various ways to the so-called Balladour plan and to aspire that  a common concept on the demilitarization of this region as a  guarantee to our security be formed. Dialogue between Lithuania  and the Kaliningrad region is also important; therefore, the  possibility of participation in this dialogue by the Western  experts was discussed. The participation of Western experts in  the preparation of agreements on military transit was touched  upon. The experience of Western countries in this sphere is of  great value to us; apart from this, the military transit through  Lithuania should be coordinated with our neighbors, Adolfas  Slezevicius told the ELTA correspondent.</p>

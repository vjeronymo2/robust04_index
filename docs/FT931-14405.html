			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clause four returns to opposition agenda LABOUR'S most sacred cow - the controversial clause four of its constitution, widely interpreted as a commitment to state-ownership - is soon to be drawn into the increasingly vocal and public debate over the party's economic and industrial policies. In spite of clear reluctance from the leadership to hold a potentially explosive discussion of the clause, Mr Jack Straw is to publish a pamphlet next month putting the case for its terms to be reworded. Last week the shadow local government minister made his first tentative attempt to put reform on the agenda by presenting his conclusions to a meeting of the Tribune group - the soft-left grouping of the parliamentary party. Next month the Fabian Society will join the debate when it publishes a new model constitution for the party that is expected to drop the clause in favour of a new statement of essential aims and values. However, only a week ago, Mr John Smith, the party leader, repeated his scepticism over the value of a debate, telling Sir David Frost in a BBC interview that it was a 'theological' issue of little importance on electors' doorsteps. Mr Straw nonetheless has indicated to shadow cabinet colleagues that he disagrees with this view. He says that, while the clause itself may not be raised, there is plenty of doorstep evidence that Labour is still perceived as the party of nationalisation. The clause, drawn up 75 years ago by Sidney Webb, led to a fierce split in the party in the 1950s when Hugh Gaitskell, then leader, argued vigorously for its abandonment against strong and ultimately successful opposition. The clause's most contentious paragraph reads: 'To secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange . . . ' Defenders of the wording say that it is subject to wide-ranging interpretation and does not represent a blanket commitment to state ownership. While some at last Wednesday's Tribune group meeting suggested that an open debate could add a useful creative spur to reassessing Labour's goals, others warned that it could be misinterpreted as the party abandoning its core beliefs and 'throwing the baby out with the bathwater'. Mr Straw yesterday said Labour should advocate a substantial scaling-down of the British monarchy along the lines of the Dutch or Scandinavian models. He told his Blackburn constituency that the current royal system 'with its large number of participants and its emphasis on showbusiness has little serious future'.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / US governors of flood states press for aid GOVERNORS from flood-damaged US states arrived in Washington yesterday to try to ensure that Congress does not delay the disaster aid they have been promised. Delegations from at least six of the eight states most affected by the flooding in the Mississippi and Missouri river basins will hold talks today with Senate and House of Representatives leaders and urge them to set aside the dispute that last week held up a vote on a preliminary flood relief bill to spend Dollars 2.98bn. The House last week delayed considering the bill after Republicans had been joined by 45 fiscally conservative Democrats, including some from flooded districts, to block debate unless the new money were offset by spending cuts elsewhere. The House is expected to reconsider the bill today. Democratic leaders have not changed it, but have allotted more time for debate. Officials from the mid-western governors' offices said they wanted to be on hand to twist arms and ensure that at least their own state congressional delegations would not block the aid sought. 'Presumably they have made their partisan point and will now do the right thing,' said one aide. With another record crest of water expected on the Mississippi this week, the system of earth and concrete levees that has so far averted even worse flooding is rapidly crumbling. Water levels have been well above normal since April, and waterlogged levees which had resisted earlier floodwaves have now begun to give way under this renewed assault. Several more towns along the Mississippi and Missouri were evacuated yesterday when it became clear their levees were about to break, and drinking water has had to be rationed in towns whose water treatment plants have been inundated. Although the flood aid bill under immediate consideration is for Dollars 2.98bn, the Clinton administration has already said it will raise its flood aid request to Dollars 5bn, and has acknowledged that even this is unlikely to prove adequate. Estimates of the damage throughout the affected area now amount to Dollars 10bn-Dollars 12bn.</p>

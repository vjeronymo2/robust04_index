			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / NY incentives stave off Morgan Stanley move MORGAN STANLEY, one of New York's leading investment banks, has scrapped its plans to leave Manhattan after being offered incentives that will save it about Dollars 39.6m (Pounds 23m) in the next decade. The move underlines the growing efforts of the administration of Mr David Dinkins, New York's mayor, to persuade big companies to remain in the city. There were growing fears that a wave of departures was threatening the city's economic and employment base. In August, Prudential Securities, the country's third biggest brokerage house, said it would keep its headquarters and back-office operations in Manhattan after it was offered a Dollars 106m incentive package of tax and energy rebates. In the same month the city agreed to pay half the cost of a new Dollars 150m trading centre to encourage three of New York's five commodities exchanges to remain in the city, preserving 9,000 jobs in downtown Manhattan. The city's onerous corporate tax structure, along with high crime rates and high rental costs, have driven several big investment houses to move their back-office operations from the city. Morgan's decision to stay represents a considerable feat for Mr Dinkins' administration. The bank had earlier announced plans to move to Connecticut, had acquired an option on a building site and developed architectural plans. Mr Dinkins said Morgan Stanley was expected to contribute nearly Dollars 911m in direct taxes to New York city and state in the next 10 years. He said the bank generated more than Dollars 2bn a year in economic activity in the city. The bank will retain about 4,100 jobs in Manhattan and Brooklyn. In addition to the Morgan Stanley offer, the administration announced plans to freeze corporate tax rates for four years. This is in addition to a previous commitment to freeze real property tax rates.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: BellSouth teams with Telecom on French network BELLSOUTH, the US tele-communications group, is to co-operate with France Telecom, the state-owned operator, to build a mobile data transmission network, worth more than Dollars 80m, in France. The US group is to take a 12.5 per cent stake in the French company's recently-created mobile data business, France Telecom Mobiles Data, for an undisclosed price. This is the latest of a series of foreign partnerships struck by France Telecom in the two years since it was given semi-autonomy from the telecommunications ministry. But it is believed to be the first time a foreign company has worked with France Telecom on an important project on its home territory. The network, which will allow computer data to be sent by portable telecommunications sets, will be introduced in Paris this year and other cities in 1994. The two companies will co-operate on development and marketing and plan other alliances with equipment makers, software providers and computer systems groups. France Telecom and a private operator have been licensed to run two competing systems, as is already the case in mobile voice telephones. The data network will use technology by Ericsson, the Swedish group, which is already in use in the UK, north America, Finland, Norway and Sweden. BellSouth also announced it would develop a nationwide mobile data network in the Netherlands, AP-DJ reports. Initial construction of the system has begun with service expected to be available in several markets by the end of the year. When the network is finished in 1994, it will provide in-building coverage in important commercial centres such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague, and comprehensive mobile coverage in smaller cities and major traffic corridors.</p>

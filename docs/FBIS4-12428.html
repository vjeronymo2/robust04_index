			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Mourad Benachnou by </F> unidentified correspondent; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Correspondent] As I had announced earlier, our  guest tonight is Economy Minister Mourad Benachnou. Welcome  minister. The first question I will put to you is the following:  today the Bank of Algeria announced a 40.17 percent devaluation  of the dinar as from 10 April. First, what will be the economic  impact of this devaluation? Second, will this devaluation take  place in one go or will it be introduced gradually?    [Benachnou] First, in the name of God, the Merciful, the  Compassionate; as you know, the value of a currency depends on  the law of supply and demand. What is happening in Algeria is  that revenues in hard currency dropped for several reasons, the  first one being a decline in oil prices. This required an  adjustment in the value of the dinar in relation to the hard  currencies, which are in huge demand but are not in sufficient  supply.    As for the repercussions of the devaluation of the dinar, I  will say that these will be both positive and negative. First,  the positive repercussions will include an increase in tax  revenues for the state as a result of higher oil revenues when  the latter are converted into dinars. Second, this will enable  us to give a greater freedom to imports. Third, this  devaluation will in the near future, God willing, encourage  exports other than oil.    As regards the negative repercussions, the first one will be  on prices. However, I must point out that the parallel market  [black market] was ahead of the state as far as the exchange  rate of the dinar is concerned. You know that in the parallel  market the dinar is lower than the official rate.    [Correspondent] As we have just heard, the International  Monetary Fund has expressed its full satisfaction. Does this  mean that the agreement with the IMF has been signed, and if it  the case, what are the contents of that agreement?    [Benachnou] We signed a letter of intent this evening after  the government discussed and approved the contents of the  letter. On the whole, the letter of intent sets out the  economic, financial, and monetary policy the Algerian Government  intends to follow until the country returns to the path of  development and to a stability in prices and until it checks  inflation and boosts investments again so that enough new jobs  can be created to keep up with the number of youths entering the  job market every year.    The contents of this letter are all built around these  objectives. By way of illustration, I will now give some of the  points this letter addresses. The first point is the rate of  the dinar. We have already talked about this. The second point  is linked to the lifting of all restrictions on imports to allow  our economy to be financed effectively and in a way that  reflects the real requirements of the economy and not decisions  taken by civil servants sitting in their offices who do not know  how the economy or companies are run by operators who are  directly responsible for production.    There is also a measure concerning the budget because  several  deficiencies we notice in our economy are the result of a lack  of restraint on the part of the state in terms of expenditure.  At times this expenditure exceeded the revenues, and  consequently the state had to borrow money from the Central  Bank. This in turn led to the inflation Algeria is now  experiencing.    As regards the policy of managing public funds, I can say  that we will achieve a greater restraint and that this restraint  will enable us to curb the price rises we are currently facing.    This letter addressed another problem, namely the  restructuring of state-owned companies. We are aware of the  huge delay in tackling this problem. In any case, the  state-owned companies contribute to the national income with 60  percent, but this contribution is well below their capacity.  These companies have a higher capacity of production, and we  must give them the means to maximize it in the best way possible  and with the necessary standard.    There are other measures that are purely technical, and this  may not be the best place to talk about them. However, I must  stress that this letter will enable us to receive first of all  $1 billion from the IMF, as its director general announced. We  will also receive some loans that had been suspended and that  had been linked to this letter. These loans are coming to us  from the World Bank, $175 million; Japan, $150 million; the  European Union, $180 million; and finally the Arab Monetary  Fund, $100 million.    This will be the first tranche. For the second tranche, we  have started talks with a number of states such as France,  Spain, Italy, and Belgium and with other institutions to enable  us to finance our balance of payments to meet the imports  requirements and the requirements linked to the servicing of our  foreign debt.    As regards the foreign debt, its problem is also linked to  the signing of this letter of intent. As the IMF director  general said, and I can only repeat what he said, we will be  able to enter talks with our creditors when we achieve a  significant reduction in the servicing of our foreign debt, and  I mean a very big reduction.    [Correspondent] Thank you minister. I hope we will meet  again for more information on other economic matters. Thank you  again.</p>

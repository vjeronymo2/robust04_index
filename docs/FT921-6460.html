			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Abbey launches Pounds 60m mortgage rescue plan ABBEY NATIONAL, the retail banking group which is the UK's second largest mortgage lender, has launched a Pounds 60m mortgage rescue scheme aimed at saving 1,000 of its customers from eviction. The scheme will operate through a new company called Homesave, which Abbey National has set up. It will buy the homes of customers who have jobs but are substantially in arrears with mortgage payments. Home owners will remain in the property and become tenants of Abbey National. This will be on a short tenancy basis, initially for six months and a day. The scheme is being operated throughout England and Wales. Rent will be set at market levels. Before entering the scheme likely candidates will be visited by Abbey National branch staff. They will also have to obtain independent legal advice, for which Abbey National will advance up to Pounds 150 where neces-sary. The bank will start a review of arrears cases before contacting those for whom the scheme may be suitable. The review should be complete by the end of next month.</p>

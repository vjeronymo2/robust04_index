			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Meng Xian (1322 6007 1344), XINHUA </F> reporter Wang Zhiyun (3769 1807 5089), and XINHUA correspondent  Meng Junyi (5536 0193 1837)]    [Text] Xian, 9 May (XINHUA) -- In the past three  consecutive years, the Shaanxi Military District has been  "investigating 1,000 companies." A large number of leaders and  organ cadres have been visiting localities, inspecting actual  situations, and performing concrete tasks. They have found a  new way of performing economic tasks in an effort to properly  develop the militia and reserve forces. The General Staff and  General Political Departments recently conveyed their  experiences to all military units.    To enable Shaanxi's militia and reserve forces to play their  full roles as a new force in facilitating the material and  spiritual civilization drive, the Shaanxi Military District  party committee has been organizing and conducting the campaigns  since 1991. It has been investigating 1,000 companies annually  and has checked all of Shaanxi's grass-roots companies once.  More than 400 leading cadres at army, divisional, and  regimental levels and a large number of organ cadres have  visited various townships, towns, rural areas, plants, and mines  to conduct investigations and studies. They have thoroughly  understood the situation of 3,337 grass-roots companies, and  have rendered responsive assistance to their various  construction endeavors.    While eating, staying, working, and training with officers  and men of various grass-roots units, leading cadres at various  levels and organ cadres have understood many conditions that  could not have been learned if they remained in their offices.  They have also resolved many problems that had been obstructing  grass-roots units' progress for a long time. Shangluo  Prefecture, situated in the Qinbashan hilly areas, produces  abundant special local products. However, the masses had been  poor for a long time because they had a poor concept of  commodity economy and thick forests and deep ravines had  hampered the smooth distribution of goods. Some 130 cadres from  Shangluo Military Subdistrict and various county and city  people's armed police departments have visited the rural areas,  and have held over 30 training classes on commodity trade in  separate localities. Moreover, through various channels, they  have also raised and established special funds and have  organized a large contingent of long-distance transporting and  marketing personnel consisting some 50,000 militiamen. They  have transported lots of mountain products and special local  products to large and medium cities, including Xian, Baoyi, and  Xianyang. Their annual sales have amounted to over 100 million  yuan and the militiamen's annual per capita income has reached  more than 1,700 yuan. While changing their operating  mechanisms, some large and medium enterprises and military  industry enterprises in Xian city have encountered problems. To  resolve the problems, some 30 leading cadres from the Xian  Military Subdistrict and from its people's armed police  departments have led task forces to conduct studies and  ideological and political work on young militiamen of more than  120 large and medium enterprises. They have provided technical  training to young militiamen who were temporarily laid off, and  encouraged them to engage in tertiary industries. In addition,  they have established more than 600 comfort-extending militia  units, and have raised over 70,000 yuan to help impoverished  families. Consequently, they have resolved the problems,  thereby creating conditions for enterprises to deepen reform.    The investigative and studying process has also been a  process of summarizing and accumulating experiences. By  conducting the "investigation of 1,000 companies" in the past  three years, the Shaanxi Military District has formulated a set  of new concepts and methods, and has accumulated new experiences  in various aspects, including ways to organize the militia and  reserve forces to join in the material and spiritual  civilization drive, to facilitate tasks on comprehensively  rectifying social order, to perform rescuing and  relief-supplying work, to participate in key construction  projects with a regularized system, and to support military  training with productive labor. According to statistics, in the  past three years, the militia has participated in over 500 key  construction projects, and has established more than 3,200  economic entities that support military training with productive  labor. The militia's role as a "front army" in economic  construction has become more and more prominent.    The large number of investigative and studying activities  have changed the workstyle of leading cadres at various levels  and organs in Shaanxi Military District. A situation has  emerged whereby people, labor, and funds have been moving toward  grass-roots units. Shaanxi Military District commander Wang  Zhicheng has visited all the people's armed police departments  in 107 Shaanxi counties and cities, and has conducted  investigation and studies in more than 900 militia companies.  He has gone deep into the Qinbashan area, has slept on common  beds with militia companies and militiamen who are guarding  railway tracks there, and has drunk water from the same wells as  they. He has conveyed instructions and provided assistance and  guidance to various militia companies. To help impoverished  areas develop endeavors that would support military training  with productive labor, Zhao Lianchen, political commissar of the  Shaanxi Military District, has visited over 50 of Shaanxi's  poorest counties in more than two months. He has mulled and  sought methods and measures with grass-roots cadres, and has  proposed, after carrying out studies, four suggestions with  guidelines. The suggestions have been approved by the  provincial authorities. When commenting on their feelings about  going deep into grass-roots units, many cadres said: Our work  style has become more realistic, obstacles have been cleared,  and our relations with the masses have become closer. We have  eventually eliminated the old concept that people's armed police  work was not important.</p>

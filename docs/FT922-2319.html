			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Foreign Affairs: End this Maastricht agony - Ireland should follow Denmark and reject the treaty, because it is not federalist enough Jokes based on national stereotypes are usually in bad taste, and English jokes about the Irish are among the worst. Yet it has to be said that the Irish bishops, in advising their flock how to approach tomorrow's referendum on the treaty of Maastricht, have lived up to English expectations. Their argument can be summarised as follows: 1 'The substantive and fundamental issue is the right to life of the unborn child.' 2 This will, whatever the outcome of tomorrow's vote, have to be settled by another referendum, on a new amendment to the Irish constitution. 3 If Maastricht is approved, such an amendment may be ineffective. 4 If Maastricht is rejected, the issue will remain unresolved. 5 So decide for yourselves. I am not a bishop, nor even a Roman Catholic, but I think I can do better than that. The issue of the unborn child - unquestionably important though it is - has nothing to do with the case. The Irish government itself took great care to ensure that that would be so, by persuading its 11 partners to accept a protocol saying that nothing in the treaty should be interpreted as overriding the provisions of the Irish constitution on that matter. Since then, Irish public opinion has been thrown into turmoil by the case of the 14-year-old rape victim. At the time most people in Ireland seemed to feel that she should be allowed to go abroad to have an abortion, and that if Maastricht guaranteed the right of European Community citizens to travel within the EC, then Irish citizens should not be excepted. Bowing to this wave of public feeling, the Irish government asked its partners to rescind the protocol, only to be told that as part of the treaty it was carved in letters of stone and could not be changed. But that whole argument was based on a false premise. The right of EC nationals to be admitted to each other's countries is already guaranteed by the Single European Act, and the right of Irish citizens to leave the republic if they so wish is not dependent on anything to do with the EC at all. It is guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights, which binds all members of the Council of Europe. And since the Irish Republic forms a passport union with the UK, there is in any case no way to stop Irish citizens from going to the UK if they so wish, unless by subjecting them to preventive arrest, which would surely infringe their rights under other articles of the constitution. Finally, the Irish supreme court decided that the rape victim could legally have an abortion even within the republic, in spite of the constitutional prohibition, on the grounds that her life was in danger. This decision had nothing to do with Maastricht, and there is nothing in Maastricht that would prevent the constitution being amended to close this loophole, if that is what the Irish electorate really wants. So, pace the bishops, tomorrow's referendum is not about the rights of the unborn child. In fact, legally it may turn out to be about nothing at all, since voters are being asked to ratify a treaty which can only come into force if ratified by all 12 member states, and one of them has already rejected it. Politically, however, it is very important. If the Irish voters follow the example of their Danish counterparts, Maastricht will be politically as well as legally dead. It is inconceivable that the other 10 member states will soldier on with the battle to ratify a treaty that two have already rejected. Renegotiation will have become unavoidable. If on the other hand the Irish vote 'yes', there is still a chance that some way will be found of salvaging the treaty, either by so sugaring it with interpretative declarations on subsidiarity that the Danes can be persuaded to change their minds, or by working out some legal fix which would enable 11 members to implement the treaty, while Denmark's relations with them continue to be governed by the pre-Maastricht rules. Personally, being no more a lawyer than I am a bishop, I very much doubt if either of these devices would work. But Maastricht itself is such a monumental fudge, and so many powerful people have invested so much of their reputations in it, that one should not rule out some even more grotesque fudge being dreamt up to rescue it. So, bishops or no bishops, I hope the Irish voters will find the courage to strike the coup de grace, and put Maastricht out of its agony. Saying that will probably lose me quite a few good friends, who thought of me - rightly  -as a fellow 'European'; and will win me a lot of new ones, whose company I shall not much relish. But the fact is that I have never much liked Maastricht. It is not that it is too federalist, but that it is not federalist enough, leaving too many decisions to be taken by committees of national ministers behind closed doors, with no clear accountability. I should like to see a European union with a federal constitution, in which certain clearly defined powers would be exercised by a federal executive responsible to a federal parliament, and everything else would be left to member states, or indeed to smaller units of government - which, as I understand it, is what 'subsidiarity' is all about. The federation would have just enough power to ensure genuine freedom of movement for people, goods and services within the geographical space that it covered, and to conduct an effective common foreign and defence policy. It has never been entirely clear to me whether such a union really needs a single currency, but I am increasingly inclined to think not - or at least that it should come only after a very high degree of economic convergence has already come about, not by administrative fiat but through the operation of market forces. Economic and monetary union in its Maastricht form - essentially a Franco-Italian bid to hijack the D-Mark - looks to me increasingly misguided, because it is all too likely to provoke a German nationalist reaction, the beginnings of which we are now witnessing. What I valued about Maastricht was that it at least attempted to bring about a common foreign policy, and to make possible, through the Western European Union, a common defence within the Atlantic alliance. But the machinery it set up for this purpose would have needed to be improved before long. You cannot run an effective foreign policy when every decision has to be agreed by 12 separate governments, as the lamentable EC performance over Yugoslavia has amply demonstrated. An enlarged community would be even more helpless with this machinery. What is needed is a single foreign ministry, headed by a politically accountable foreign minister. I admit that I lacked the courage to condemn Maastricht outright, because I feared that its failure would mark the victory of nationalism and might lead to the fragmentation of the EC. I still fear that, but it need not be so. We should start work as soon as possible on building a real European union - one which knows what is and what is not its business, and can do its business in an efficient manner, under democratic control.</p>

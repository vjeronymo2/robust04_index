About 50 posts of laser medicine have appeared in Russia  over  the past three years. In order to put this branch of public  health (it is literally occupied by ``healers'' with dubious  reputation) under control and ensure the professional training  of physicians the Russian Federation's Ministry of Public Health  has set up an All-Russia State Research Center with a training  base on the basis of the Laser Medicine Research Institute.    For bloodless dissection of muscular tissue and the  resection  of the internal organs (kidneys, gallbladder) the medical  workers of the State Centre use the Raduga-1 contact aluminium  laser produced by conversion at the Moscow Polyus  Scientific-Production Association. The other development project  of the defence industry--the Raduga-1F laser produced by the  Istok Scientific-Production Association, near Moscow, is used  for endocoagulation.    Foreign businessmen are greatly interested in the work of  the  State Centre. In July a contract was signed on the delivery of  laser equipment to India, on training Indian doctors in Moscow  and on setting up a branch of the Centre in Dharwar.  Negotiations are under way with the representatives of the  Ministry of Public Health of the Philippines, private clinics  from Paris and Madrid and the Turkish Asia Ltd, company.</p>

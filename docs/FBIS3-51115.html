			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nancy Pazos copyrighted by CLARIN] </F>   [Text] Early yesterday morning the secretary general of the  presidency, Eduardo Bauza, received the best birthday gift he  could have hoped for: the leaders of Argentina's most important  chambers of commerce came in person to his Casa Rosada office to  announce their support for the political agreement that Carlos  Menem and Raul Alfonsin sealed last Sunday in Olivos.    The meeting began at 0830 sharp with almost perfect  attendance. The only person missing was the head of the  Argentine Rural Society, Eduardo de Zavalia, who--as his peers  explained later--could not postpone an already scheduled trip to  Brazil.    Consequently, those attending were: Jorge Blanco Villegas  (Argentine Industrial Union); Roberto Sanmartino (Argentine  Union of Construction Enterprises); Monir Madcur (Argentine  Construction Board); and Jorge Berardi (Commodity Exchange).    Other members of the delegation were: Francisco Macri  (Association of Automotive Manufacturers); Jorge di Fiori  (Argentine Chamber of Commerce); Osvaldo Cornide (Coordinating  Agency for Commercial Activities); and Eduardo Escassany  (Banking Association of Buenos Aires).    The meeting lasted until exactly 0940, enough time for just  one round of coffee or tea and pastries, and a short individual  explanation of the benefits of this political accord for the  economic future.    On that point, nobody heard or said anything different from  what was stated last Monday, when these associations expressed  their approval of Menem and Alfonsin's handshake the day before,  thus opening the way toward constitutional reform.    Some of them, like Macri and Madcur, expressed hope that in  the midterm period this consensus would move to the economic  terrain in a more effective manner, but both Bauza and the other  business leaders hastened to recommend that "for now it is  better not to introduce points of disagreement."    What was explicitly stated was a request from the secretary  general to his visitors: help drum up support for the reform  bill, not only among the business community, but also by  speaking out to help mitigate points of resistance in public  opinion.    The businessmen agreed to do so, and some even said they  would call upon their contacts among the Radicals to persuade  the most reluctant leaders about this before the party  convention on 3 December so that the convention will give a  mandate to the UCR [Radical Civic Union] deputies to vote for  the reform as a way to strengthen the agreement.    At about the middle of the meeting, Bauza let drop a phrase  that sounded more like a suggestion than a question: "Are you  also going to meet with Alfonsin to show him your satisfaction  with the agreement?" he asked.    The businessmen had actually already discussed that  possibility, but it was a cause of some controversy. It seems  that some of the leaders are more "pro-Menem" than others. They  are the ones who said that "it is not necessary" to have a  meeting with the former president, for the simple reason  that--at least for now--they did not visit Carlos Menem.    On the other side were those who believe the meeting with  the  Radical leader "is appropriate" in order to maintain balance in  a situation like the one that brought them together yesterday.  It now seems that this view has carried the day, since some of  them assured CLARIN that the meeting with Alfonsin "will take  place this week."    The moment of tension that arose in that part of the meeting  was quickly dissipated. Bauza himself eased the climate by  telling stories about the conclusion of the negotiations at  Olivos.    All the businessmen said yesterday they had not been brought  together by Bauza, but that the meeting had been arranged at the  spontaneous initiative of some of the business leaders. "We set  it up with three or four telephone calls," they explained.  Still, it was obvious that the personal intervention of the  secretary general had a great deal to do with the holding of the  meeting (see following section).    However, reports about the meeting that this newspaper heard  did not agree on one fairly important point. The majority of  those contacted said they were attending the meeting  representing their respective groups.  <H5>  Bauza Seeks Supporters </H5>   The breakfast meeting between Eduardo Bauza and Argentina's  top business leaders did not come about spontaneously. The  operation that ended with the visitors' public "approval" of the  Olivos pact was the result of a political operation that began  on the very day the private meeting between Carlos Menem and  Raul Alfonsin came to light.    After the political stir aroused by the announcement of this  first summit meeting, Alfonsin was not the only one who had to  close ranks among his supporters. While the government did not  need to line up its troops behind the accord, its principal  operators did have to smooth things over with their economic and  political associates who had been left on the sidelines by this  maneuver.    So the secretary general of the presidency did not hesitate  to telephone some of the friends of the government in the  business community. On that same Monday when the news broke, a  few privileged people began to hear in advance about the  negotiations with the opposition. Bauza, in some way, wanted to  resume the code of mutual "information loyalty" that they owed  to each other.    Menem's preferred operator had begun a painstaking effort  with the sector as soon as he entered his present office. It was  he who had assigned the secretary of legal and technical  affairs, Carlos Corach, the task of holding luncheon meetings  once a week with a business group.    Starting on Monday, 7 (November) [as published], the circle  of businessmen who were kept informed expanded daily along with  the amount of news published. Bauza's final move toward the  business establishment came on the very day of the accord. On  that night Bauza gave up the roast lamb awaiting him at the home  of Hugo Anzorreguy to tell, by telephone, the details of the  meeting to the group of the elect.    Between one dialogue and the other, they mutually arranged  yesterday's meeting.    In fact, the breakfast meeting was a way of returning mutual  favors. For Bauza, it was because he thus became the favored  contact of the business groups (a by no means inconsiderable  factor in the government), and for the visitors, it was because  they could demonstrate that the renowned national business  community was not left "out in the cold" from a political accord  that may go down in the history books.</p>

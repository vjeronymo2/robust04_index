			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: IT'S NOT ALL THAT IT SEEMS BEHIND SCENES  </P> <P> In his new book, "Pond Scum and Vultures," Times staff writer Gene  Wojciechowski documents the often less-than-glamorous lifestyles of his  sportswriting colleagues.  </P> <P> Wojciechowski tells the story of New York Times writer Michael Janofsky, who  once worked for the Baltimore Evening Sun, where he covered several Oriole  games.  </P> <P> At a restaurant one evening, Janofsky spotted Oriole Manager Earl Weaver and  his wife across the room. Both men finished eating at about the same time.  </P> <P> Janofsky, paid his check, walked outside and gave the valet his parking slip.  Weaver and his wife soon came out.  </P> <P> Wojciechowski writes: "Figuring this would be a nice time to reintroduce  himself to Weaver, Janofsky moved toward the manager and extended his hand.  Weaver looked at Janofsky, reached into his pocket, pulled out a ticket stub  and said, 'It's the white Cadillac.' "  </P> <P> Trivia time: Which NFL team holds the record for most overtime games played in  one regular season?  </P> <P> Why?: From Associated Press: "New York Yankee manager Stump Merrill said Friday  he would like to see George Steinbrenner get involved with running the club  again some day."  </P> <P> Man coverage: You remember McArthur towels, the company that contracted with  NFL Properties to provide 2,100 terry-cloth robes and wraps for players,  following the recent round of female-reporters-in-the-locker-room debates.  </P> <P> Seems the company manufactured them in one size. Trouble is, one size doesn't  fit all.  </P> <P> Said Greg McArthur, the company's executive vice-president: "The Green Bay  Packers' equipment manager called and said the terry wrappers we sent weren't  large enough to fit five of their 300-pound players."  </P> <P> Or thereabouts. The Packer roster lists one 300-pounder, tackle Tony Mandarich,  and five others at 285 or more.  </P> <P> Zone coverage: The NFL has shipped ten tons of officially licensed merchandise,  including football jerseys, towels, caps, sun visors, sunglasses, sweatbands  and copies of its printed products -- such as GameDay magazine, Prolog magazine  and Pro Set trading cards -- to U.S. military personnel in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> Said NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue: "This is our way of bringing a little  piece of home into their lives at a very trying time."  </P> <P> Bo knows she knows Bo: In an interview for today's Parade magazine, Bo Jackson  talked about growing up without his dad.  </P> <P> Said Jackson: "My mom is my dad. She's the only mom and dad I know. Whenever  she needs me, I don't care what I'm doing, I'm gonna drop it and go to her,  'cause that's all that matters.  </P> <P> "We never had enough food. But at least I could beat on other kids and steal  their lunch money and buy myself something to eat. But I couldn't steal a  father's hug when I needed one. I couldn't steal a father's whipping when I  needed one."  </P> <P> Bo, Derrick both know: Jackson, who led the Kansas City Royals this season with  28 home runs, returns to town as a Raider today.  </P> <P> Bo and Chief linebacker Derrick Thomas, who played against each other when  Jackson was at Auburn and Thomas was at Alabama, will face off again.  </P> <P> The Raiders-Chiefs game has been sold out for a month, and Thomas told Dick  Brinster of the Associated Press: "The intensity (in Missouri) reminds me of  the Alabama-Auburn rivalry when the whole state shuts down prior to the game. I  get the same feeling I used to get just before the Alabama-Auburn game every  year."  </P> <P> Slug here: The Green Bay Packers, with five in 1983.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Chicago Bull Coach Phil Jackson, on the score-happy Denver Nuggets:  "I think they're playing defense on the wrong end."

There is no  need for preambles or introductions. We wish to thank Lt. Col.  Chavez for this exclusive interview with the 24 Hours program.    My first question is: What have you learned as a result of  the 4 February and 27 November movements?    [Chavez] Thank you, Carlos. We thank you for inviting us  here and allowing us to continue in our effort to contact the  Venezuelan and Latin American people. The media play a very  important role in this.    What did we learn? Let us talk about priorities. Now that I  am here, now that I have seen the people gathered outside the  Athenaeum -- this is something that truly encourages a person to  strive to further identify oneself with Venezuela -- I would say  that this is the most important thing I have learned. I told my  fellow countrymen who have gathered out there that there are  people who stood up, flag in hand, for their dream of a nation  in the future. I believe that is the most important thing I have  learned about this historic time in which we are living.    [Fernandez] Do you believe all of them know what you fought  for during the 4 February and 27 November movements? It is  said, and very few will deny this, that after the 4 February and  27 November movements an important change occurred within the  democratic structure of our country. However, I seem to sense  that Hugo Chavez Frias has his doubts. What does Hugo Chavez  think? What will he do?    [Chavez] I do not believe the traditional Venezuelan  politician understands what has happened in Venezuela since 4  February 1992. We see this in the National Congress. It  continues to be a redoubt for groups and the party inner circles  who reach agreements behind the backs of the people and against  the interests and hopes of the people.    [Fernandez] However, you have seen that important changes  did  take place after 4 February. The historic sum is tremendous.  In some way the Venezuelan democratic structure was moved. I  would say that the results we saw on 5 December 1993 are, in  some way, the result of something that began with the 4 February  movement and ended with the 27 November movement.    [Chavez] There have been some changes. I must admit that  there have been some changes in the country. However, as I said  earlier, Carlos, and I reiterate it to all the Venezuelan people  who are watching at this moment, the changes are only  superficial. The Venezuelan crisis is so deep that it calls for  deep solutions. We must go very deep to find solutions. The  economic structures and the political structures remain  unchanged. They were shaken, they were cracked, but they are  still there. I believe that one of the biggest responsibilities  the new sectors have is to continue digging the graves for those  structures. They must be crushed and new economic and social  structures built if we want to see real changes. If the  structures are not changed, then there can be no real change in  the situation. We must not let ourselves be fooled, fellow  country.    [Fernandez] Do you know how strong you are? Are you aware of  your political responsibility?    [Chavez] We are trying to gauge this.    [Fernandez] It is not easy.    [Chavez] No, no, no, this is not easy. Remember that....    [Fernandez, interrupting] You are very strong.    [Chavez] Yes Carlos, and it truly commits us. I wish you  could have visited us while we were in jail so that we could  have talked to the people. After more than two years in jail,  after our shaken nation experienced four governments, we are now  seeing the faces of the children and the people. We can now see  what is happening. We can talk to you freely, and we can listen  to the people and tell them about our ideas. Now is when we are  truly beginning to gauge the results of our actions in every  sense.    [Fernandez] You have said that the political factors remain  unchanged. However, since 5 December there has been a  readjustment of forces within the National Congress, as well as  a readjustment of the people's awareness. This is very  important. This is why I insist on asking whether you are sure  of the path you are undertaking. Are you sure of the ground you  are stepping on? Are you aware of the obstacles, barriers, and  enemies you are confronting?    [Chavez] Let us say that we are not totally clear on that  because there is a terrible, tremendous darkness surrounding us.  Since you have insisted, I will tell you that I do not believe  important changes have occurred in the composition of the  political forces. Some progress has been made among the  so-called different sectors, but, for example, what kind of  decisions has the National Congress made in these past two  months? What decisions has it made to show us that it wants to  change the current situation? What we are seeing are things that  did not exist before. We are seeing assemblies during which the  party inner circles reach agreements to remove governors. We  are headed for national anarchy; this is even more worrisome.    [Fernandez] There are those who say that Caldera's victory  rides on the 4 February and 27 November movements and that the  readjustment of forces seen within the National Congress and the  support the Radical Cause Party got during the elections also  ride on these movements. What do you think of that?    [Chavez] That is a good description of the changes, but the  changes are still superficial. However, we have to admit that  changes have been made and that the people's awareness has also  changed. The people are aware that we are in a labyrinth and  that we must find a way out. A sector, a minority sector, tried  to do this, but just look at what a fraud the elections were.  They were a mortal blow to the people's hopes of finding  solutions along that path.    [Fernandez] [Words indistinct] a big fraud?    [Chavez] Yes, they were. We still have a Supreme Electoral  Council in the hands of the traditional parties, from the  highest office to the lowliest organization in the most distant  municipality. If the system and the leaders do not understand  that this must be changed, then social unrest will continue in  the country. I hope this will not occur.    [Fernandez] Why not? Because of the violence?    [Chavez] Not necessarily. I will only say I hope this will  not occur. We have been sending out a message and I wish to  repeat it. We believe that one of the few ways to attain peace  is a Constituent Assembly, not one handled by the political  parties. Please. It should not be a Constituent Assembly  handled by the traditional parties, but one handled by people  outside the framework of political parties and the traditional  sectors.    [Fernandez] Do you not feel that political tension in our  country has somewhat lessened following the 5 December  elections? Do you not believe there is more trust among the  people and that the people have placed their hopes on the new  government?    [Chavez] Listen: Generally, when a government begins there  are many hopes, regardless of its legitimacy or the number of  votes received. The legitimacy of the current government is  there, but it is very low. This must be recognized; we must not  deceive ourselves. Regardless of the government's legitimacy or  political support, normally when a government begins the people  have a great deal of expectation.    Carlos, five years ago I was working at Miraflores Palace  when Perez came to power. I did not serve in the military  detachment there but as an aide for the Defense and Security  Secretariat. I witnessed the people's joy when Perez won in  Caracas. I remember that a truck packed with Perez supporters  crashed into the gate of Miraflores Palace and there was a  serious problem. I was there that evening. In other words,  there was a great deal of expectation over Perez' victory, but  look at what happened in less than a month. All the  expectations collapsed.    [Fernandez] Do you not think Perez' proposal was perhaps  deceiving?  proposed to break with the IMF, and a month later, in the most  hypocritical and shameless manner, an agreement with the IMF was  announced that established fuel increases, etc. We all know  that story.    [Fernandez] Now, on the position that you are going to  assume as a political movement with Caldera's government: How  are you going to organize yourselves. What is your opinion of  Caldera's government? Do you believe that the first steps being  taken could serve as a point of reference to attempt to correct  the nation's crisis?    [Chavez] It may be possible for Caldera's government to take  an important step toward a road for significant changes. Up  until now I personally have not seen any strong decision to lead  the nation on that road. Nevertheless, look here, the  president....    [Fernandez, interrupting] He did not even have an economic  plan set out....    [Chavez, interrupting] I was just going to make reference to  precisely that. All of us know about the Sosa Plan, but there  is no strategic plan to recover the nation from this dramatic  economic situation. A plan is fundamental to being able to  recover from and end this [word indistinct] chaos. To sum it up,  it will depend on the Caldera government's political actions. I  must say it; I must confess it; I am concerned, because up until  now we have not seen this. We have not perceived this in a  little over a month -- which is a short but decisive time.  Remember the 100-day factor. [words indistinct]    [Fernandez] These [first 100 days] are crucial for a  government's development.    [Chavez] I think that is true, because after that time the  government loses some of its motivation, the people's support,  and initiative. It then falls into inactivity. In my opinion,  Caldera's government has remained in a state of exasperating  inertia. I invite the government to leave behind that state of  inertia.    [Fernandez] An important initiative has been presented by a  [word indistinct] political party which is the Special Powers  Law that could serve as a support. This could be political  parliamentary support for the government to start making  decisions. Commander Chavez, do you think that this Special  Powers Law could be used to take emergency or special measures  in the financial and economic sectors?    [Chavez] This could be, but no one can guarantee that the  Special Powers Law will assure that the most appropriate  measures will be taken.    We must recall that a Special Powers Law was available to  Carlos Andres Perez, and all he did with it was cut off all of  Venezuela's chances -- despite all the resources available to  him -- to be led into a true national project. Subsequently,  what was implemented was the Great Venezuela plan, which led us  to the most tragic chapter in Venezuelan history.    [Fernandez] Commander Chavez, I would like to talk about the  ideological inspiration of the Bolivarian movement. Obviously,  great national inspiration permeates from the thoughts of  Bolivar and other heroes, but is there, in any way, an  international inspiration to the Bolivarian movement?    [Chavez] Well....[pauses]    [Fernandez] I am asking you this because at some time,  around  4 February, a series of speculations and conjectures arose.  Namely, Bolivar was compared to Argentina's Painted Faces and  other military movements all over Latin America. You did  respond to those speculations, but there are some who still  believe that there is somewhat of an international inspiration  involved.    [Chavez] Yes, unavoidably, there are people who believe and  will continue to believe that. We have been linked to extreme  rightist sectors -- that is where I believe the Argentine  Painted Faces came up -- and we have also been linked with  extreme leftist sectors such as the [words indistinct], the  Third Path, and Cuba's Castroism. In other words, this  association depends on who is making the associations, their  ideologies, and the interests involved in establishing links  between us and other movements. We have talked about the  reemergence of an ideology, which indeed has international  undertones, or, as I prefer to say, it has international  repercussions. At this moment, I believe that the ideological  weight represented by the Mayan Indians in Mexico....    [Fernandez, interrupting] [Words indistinct] of the Zapatist  National Liberation Army?    [Chavez] That is right. There is a relation there that we  would have to take apart carefully and analyze with documents  regarding the proclamations and the demands behind the discourse  of the Zapatists. However, my instinct tells me that an  ideological connection exists there, without the existence of a  previous agreement.    Now, I want to reiterate the essence of our national  project.  Currently, what we have is a national [word indistinct]  Bolivar-Zamora-Rodriguez. This is not about us putting a  hundred -- just to give a figure -- national heroes in a box and  deciding to pick three out of it. No, no, no. We in the Army  conducted a study on the political, social, and pedagogical  ideas of these three Venezuelan heroes. Simon Rodriguez  represented an original path for Latin America. Rodriguez urged  Venezuelans and Latin Americans to finish the political  revolution Bolivar started with, for instance, an economic  revolution. He had designed a thorough plan for popular  education, which conveyed the idea that Latin America must  follow original models, plans, and governments. Back in 1842,  Rodriguez warned Latin Americans to avoid deceptions and argued  that there were no republics in America because there were no  peoples, and the former could not exist without the latter.  This shows the ideological weight that existed back then.  Bolivar called Rodriguez the Socrates from Caracas. Rodriguez  joined forces with Bolivar, who presented two constitutional  drafts and proposed the idea of a moral and electoral power. It  was also Bolivar that claimed that the people were sovereign and  ordered the military to take up their swords to defend social  guarantees. He was the one who joined Rodriguez, his mentor, and  Ezequiel Zamora, the general of the sovereign people who  instilled a high social content in the Bolivarian project.    [Fernandez] Is that what marks the difference between the  Bolivarian movement and the remainder of the political  organizations of our country?    [Chavez] I believe that is one of the basic factors that  makes it different. Why? Because I believe none of the  political organizations in Venezuela have a clear ideological  banner. If you make a distinction between Democratic Action and  COPEI [Social Action Party]....    [Fernandez, interrupting] Could we then say that you had  some  international inspiration in the socialist movement, in the  Bolshevik movement of the early century? In other words, we  could then look back into all of that and reach some conclusion  to that effect. Could we also point out that the Bolivarian  movement will be an autochthonous movement in the political  movement from now on?    [Chavez] Yes, I believe it is autochthonous. Nonetheless,  through reading, experience [two-second break in transmission]  premilitary if you wish, in military youth, in contacts with  other countries, we could say it is seeking, it is attaining  ideological impact from an individual point of view. However, as  a group our creation in the National Army now offers the country  and -- why not -- Latin America an autochthonous ideological  project.    [Fernandez] Friends, that was an interview with Commander  Hugo Chavez Frias. We thank Commander Chavez Frias for allowing  us this interview, this contact, this exclusive dialogue for "24  Hours."</p>

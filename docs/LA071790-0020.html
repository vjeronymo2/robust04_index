			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> Bernstein Bows Out of Tour: Conductor Leonard Bernstein has canceled several  performances in Japan due to exhaustion and lingering illness, and was escorted  back to New York Monday by his physician, Dr. Kevin Cahill. "Leonard Bernstein  is suffering from exhaustion as a result of trying to fulfill his professional  obligations while not having fully recovered from several ailments he suffered  this spring," including severe influenza, pleurisy and pneumonia, said Cahill,  who has ordered the 71-year-old conductor to rest "for an extended period."  Bernstein had been scheduled to conduct the London Symphony Orchestra in four  performances in Japan. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

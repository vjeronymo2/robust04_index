			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Bock defends move to appoint non-executive directors at Lonrho MR DIETER BOCK, joint chief executive with Mr Tiny Rowland of Lonrho, is expected to tell a board meeting on Tuesday that the appointment of two non-executive directors he has nominated is 'non-negotiable'. He has told some directors of the international trading conglomerate that if they block the appointments he is prepared to call an extraordinary general meeting and put the issue to shareholders. Last week the board delayed the appointments after pressure from Mr Rowland. However, Mr Bock hopes the board will vote in favour of the proposal that Mr Peter Harper, a Hanson director, and Mr Stephen Walls, chairman of Albert Fisher, the food group, should become Lonrho's first non-executive directors for two decades. Mr Rowland has been opposed to non-executives since 1973 when the so-called 'straight eight' directors, led by Sir Basil Smallpeice, then deputy chairman, tried unsuccessfully to remove him as chief executive at an extraordinary general meeting. Two decades later, Mr Bock is prepared to use the same forum to put his case direct to shareholders if he feels there is no alternative. The appointment of Mr Harper and Mr Walls would tip the balance on the board irreversibly in favour of Mr Bock, who is expected to use this influence to recruit further non-executives. In the longer term, he is expected to seek to reduce the 12 full-time executives on the board by as much as half. Mr Bock, who bought 18.8 per cent of Lonrho's shares at the start of the year and then became joint chief executive, had hoped a board meeting last week would ratify their appointment. However, the decision was postponed after pressure from Mr Rowland. It is understood a Lonrho director suggested the board should appoint one of the non-executives proposed by Mr Bock and another chosen by Mr Rowland. However, Mr Bock has rejected this after several of Lonrho's institutional shareholders opposed the plan. Lonrho's leading institutional investors support the appointment of Mr Harper and Mr Walls.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Football clubs accused of exploiting young fans TOP FOOTBALL clubs are today criticised by the Consumers' Association for charging high prices for new playing strips sold to youngsters and adult supporters. Check It Out] - the Consumers' Association magazine aimed at younger readers  -says all but three English Premier League teams charge more than Pounds 40 for a junior strip in a commercial exercise which has become an important money-spinner for the most popular clubs. Newcastle United (Pounds 46 for junior strip, Pounds 57 for adult) is understood to have sold more than Pounds 4m of strip in the approach to the new season. Other clubs, such as Manchester United, may have sold more. Junior Celtic and Chelsea kits were the most expensive at Pounds 51 and Pounds 50 respectively. Ms Sue Harvey, Check It Out] editor, said: 'The clubs are using the loyalty of their supporters to charge big prices. Young fans feel under pressure to support their teams - which can put major financial pressure on their parents.' Under the Premier League's rules its 22 clubs are required to register any change of colours before the start of each season. Each club has at least two strips, with different colourings and designs. Changes of style do not require prior Premier League clearance. An official of the Premier League said yesterday that no club had changed its first strip between last season and this. Some had changed their second and third strips but 'the vast majority' had altered some aspect of their strips' styling, making it clear to the young and fashion conscious which was last season's kit and which is this year's. Check It Out] singled out clubs which it said resorted to regular strip changes, such as Manchester United. The club has used three different strips in the past 12 months according to When Saturday Comes, the supporters' magazine. The club is perfectly entitled to have done so and has broken no Premier League rules.</p>

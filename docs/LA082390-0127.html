			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SLATER ONLY GETS PROMISE, REJOINS RAMS  </P> <P> When it comes to playing football, the Rams are pretty good. When it comes to  playing hardball, nobody does it better.  </P> <P> Tackle Jackie Slater ended his 28-day holdout Wednesday and reported to Rams  Park. The six-time Pro Bowl selection didn't get his contract renegotiated,  however. He obviously didn't get the trade he demanded three weeks ago, either.  And he apparently didn't get the Rams to waive the fines levied against him,  which could total $42,000 if he was fined the NFL maximum of $1,500 a day.  </P> <P> Slater, 36, a 14-year veteran who will earn a reported $550,000 this year, was  seeking a deal that would put him on a level with the league's highest-paid  offensive linemen. Anthony Munoz of the Cincinnati Bengals, for example, earns  $875,000 a year.  </P> <P> Instead, Slater apparently got an oral guarantee that he would be better  compensated in 1991, when he will set a club record for longevity, breaking the  mark of 15 seasons established by Charlie Cowan, Joe Scibelli and Merlin Olsen.  </P> <P> "I had the opportunity to sit down with the organization, and we mutually  agreed on some things that addressed the problem that I was having, so here I  am," said Slater, who answered direct questions about his contract and the  fines by saying, "It's Rams' policy not to renegotiate contracts" and "It's  Rams' policy not to waive fines."  </P> <P> That much, of course, he knew before he decided to hold out. So why did he  return?  </P> <P> "We had a meeting of the minds, and everyone concerned feels that my goals are  realistic, and I should be given the opportunity to obtain them," he said. "We  agreed on the fact that I will be playing here next year. All the details  haven't been ironed out, but I'll be here and I'm very pleased with the way the  Rams ended up handling my situation."  </P> <P> However, Slater said he was "certainly serious" when he requested that the Rams  trade him.  </P> <P> "My feeling was that I was able to play two more years, regardless of where it  was," he said. "When I felt I wasn't going to be here, I looked at it as an  opportunity to see what was inside me, to go to a different system at my age,  be impressive enough to make the club and then start in a different offense. It  was a challenging thought, to say the least."  </P> <P> During the early days of the holdout, Coach John Robinson lashed out at Slater,  pointing out that Slater was under contract and ought to think about his  obligations to the team. But Slater said he carried no ill will with him when  he returned to Rams Park.  </P> <P> "I don't have any hard feelings about what was said in the past," he said.  "Hopefully, this will all be put to rest now and we can concentrate on trying  to accomplish some of the team goals that we have."  </P> <P> Robinson, not surprisingly, was behind that line of reasoning.  </P> <P> "I'm sure I irritated and frustrated him," Robinson said. "But I was frustrated  at the time, too. Relationships between human beings have frustration involved.  Unfortunately, (our relationships) undergo the scrutiny of the press. Those are  things you just have to get by."  </P> <P> Slater, who has been working out on his own during the holdout, said he plans  to play in Saturday night's exhibition against the Phoenix Cardinals.  </P> <P> "Football shape and just what I've been doing are a lot different, though," he  said. "The next couple of days will tell the story to me about how much I can  play (Saturday). But I've got two solid weeks of work before the season opener,  so I'll be ready by then."  </P> <P> While admitting he was angry and very frustrated at times during the past  month, Slater said he never gave up hope of reaching an agreement with the  Rams.  </P> <P> "There was always dialogue and there was never a closed ear, on my part or  theirs. Fortunately, there was always a thread of hope, despite the gloomy  circumstances that existed at one time. That thread turned into a couple of  strands and from there into a rope."  </P></p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Co-operating on a voyage into uncharted territory - The complexities of the transatlantic administration of Maxwell Communication Corporation LAST WEEK'S legal rulings on the control of Maxwell Communication Corporation mark an unprecedented attempt at transatlantic co-operation in insolvency practice - but one that represents, at best, the end of the beginning. The courts have approved an interim order which allows MCC to be run under both UK administration and US Chapter 11 proceedings. Three partners in Price Waterhouse have been given authority to take over from the directors and run the holding company while developing a strategy for its future, in co-operation with a US court-appointed examiner. MCC's creditors have the chance to object to the arrangement in the US courts on January 15. Even if the order is extended, the administrators face uncharted territory with every subsequent step they take. 'We've done all this work and now we've reached the beginning,' says Mr Colin Bird, one of the joint administrators, who can now start turning his attention to issues other than legal ones. A draft agreement was hammered out at the start of last week and backed by the High Court in London. It was approved by Judge Tina Brozman in the US bankruptcy court in New York on Friday. At its heart is the concept of 'mutual recognition'. Mr Mark Homan, Mr Colin Bird and Mr Jonathon Phillips of PW are allowed to operate as administrators to MCC much as they would under UK insolvency law, but they are also recognised by the US court. At the same time, Mr Richard Gitlin, a partner with Hebb and Gitlin, a Connecticut law firm, is the examiner, appointed under US bankruptcy law. He acts as an officer of the US court, and is also recognised in the UK courts. The administrators are recognised as the 'corporate governance' of MCC, and are effectively empowered to run the company. They are generally allowed to make disposals and obtain loans up to a value of Pounds 7m without further approval. They may also investigate the financial dealings of the subsidiaries and dismiss or reduce the powers given to executives within the group. However, to make disposals or arrange loans worth more than Pounds 7m they must seek the approval of the examiner. For disposals or loans of above Pounds 25m they must go directly to the US court for approval. Within the MCC group, Macmillan and Official Airline Guides, and 15 subsidiaries held by these two companies, are granted special status within the court order, where they are called the 'M&amp;O Group'. The order states that Mr David Shaffer, chairman of both companies, should continue in his role overseeing M&amp;O, but should make no disposals or bankruptcy petitions without the approval of the administrators and the examiner. If the administrators in turn want to place parts of the M&amp;O group into UK insolvency proceedings, they must give reasonable notice to the examiner, and place these companies into parallel Chapter 11 proceedings where relevant. They must also seek the examiner's approval if they have other plans for the M&amp;O companies such as requesting any of them to borrow funds or pledge any assets or reducing Mr Shaffer's powers. Separately, the order states that the examiner or the administrators are also empowered to employ an investment banker if they see the need, and the examiner can delegate some investigations functions to PW where there is no conflict of interest. Mr Bird says there will be frequent meetings with the examiner, and progress reports probably every week. 'I don't mind these arrangements as long as it helps things to go smoothly,' he says. Mr Evan Flaschen, a partner in Hebb and Gitlin, admits that the examiner has been given considerable powers, while more normally the function is confined to investigating allegations made to the US courts. 'It's a hard role to understand,' he says. He stresses that the examiner, while appointed by the court, cannot take on the court's powers. For example, the administrators can still appeal to the US court if they disagree with the examiner's decision. 'The examiner is more a form of quasi-management,' he says. While MCC is a UK-registered company, he says that the US courts claim jurisdiction when there are directly-owned assets or substantial receivables in the country. Although there are often clashes between the US and other national courts over jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases, particularly with Canada, he says: 'This is the first consensual approach I am aware of.' MCC's creditors meet in London tomorrow to determine their reaction. If they accept, the administrators could sell businesses during the coming weeks. If they try to keep the group, or parts of it, together, they have three months under UK insolvency law to draft a plan for approval by creditors. Under US bankruptcy law they have 120 days to propose an 'exit strategy' to the courts. 'The same commercial plan will result, but the mechanics will be different in the two jurisdictions,' says Mr Bird. 'I hope we can take it that if we get the right commercial plan we can find the mechanics to get it approved - although it won't be easy.' In the meantime, Chapter 11 requires regular formal meetings with creditors. While these are not required in the UK, Mr Bird says most successful administrations have regular informal creditors' meetings to win their approval, so the process will involve little extra work. 'We will try to dovetail the two,' he says. Mr Flaschen adds: 'What strikes me is that with all the legal differences this is a business solution. So far we have been able to persuade the two courts that it makes sense even though it is not normally done. There are so many issues to grapple with in the short term. But our focus now is January 15.'</p>

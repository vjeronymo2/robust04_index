			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Books: Passionate letters with poetic licence JOHN BETJEMAN: LETTERS VOLUME I 1926-1951 edited by Candida Lycett Green Methuen Pounds 20, 584 pages The Teddy Bear was his mascot, preservation of England's green and pleasant land with all the Victorian buildings still standing was his passion. Contemplation of idyllic moments in town or country shattered by the consciousness of death was his trump-card. He played it over and over again in his poetry. But what was John Betjeman really like? With the publication of a volume of his letters up to 1951, we have a chance to discover. While he was engaged to Penelope Chetwode he was also paying court to Wilhelmine (Billa) Cresswell, who married Roy Harrod. Betjeman continued to love the latter during his engagement to the former; and after he was married to Penelope we have many letters here in which the poet lets his passionate feelings about other women rip. He seems to have had a poetic licence from his friends to write to their wives in the most intimate terms. The poems about Myfanwy and others were not pure fantasies. There are few letters to his own wife and those are either partly or wholly in the stage dialect of a country yokel ('Oi love yew . . .') rendering them difficult to interpret. Why should he wish to play-act about something so important? The tension of what was always, we gather, a stormy marriage, increases to breaking-strain when Penelope converts to Roman Catholicism and Betjeman, in spite of ruthless pressure from Evelyn Waugh, stands firm within the High Anglican fold. That was in 1949. 'It was a watershed,' his daughter Candida the editor explains, 'for it saw the beginning of JB's being able to love other women while continuing to love my mother'. Soon afterwards he addressed a meeting of the Poetry Society in Swindon and spoke about Tennyson. 'Hands up anyone here from Lincolnshire?' he said. Margaret Wintringham - 'blonde, full-bodied, beautiful and wind-blown' - put up her hand and in spite of the fact she was a Communist (and married) she became the object of his devotion for the next year or so. No doubt we shall learn more about Betjeman's post-watershed crushes when Volume Two is published. A rather different sort of watershed occurred at Oxford when he was a pupil of CS Lewis's at Magdalen (before Lewis had been surprised by Joy). At tutorials Betjeman mobbed Lewis up mercilessly. In the end he went too far and got sent down. Afterwards, Lewis refused to write a testimonial for him when he went in for a job as a schoolmaster. The slight rankled for years. A letter to Lewis, written in 1939 when Betjeman was a mature successful writer, attempts to excuse his behaviour on the grounds of indignation that Lewis, who lived in one of the most beautiful buildings in Oxford, should have been so lacking in visual sense that he failed to appreciate it. This letter appears never to have been sent. Such arrogance is fortunately rare. Most of the time Betjeman was an amusing high-spirited and charming letter-writer, an energetic correspondent even when burdened by a full-time job, or working as a book-reviewer of trashy books, on the Daily Herald. His letters are full of jokes and ad hoc rhymes frequently embellished by little drawings, happily reproduced in the book. He enjoyed teasing, penning letters purporting to be from people he had invented or real ones; and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the spoof letter from the genuine article. Aspects of his career may be traced in sequences of letters to individual correspondents - his poetry in those to Jock Murray, his early broadcasts in those to George Barnes of the BBC, his work for the Shell Guides in those to Jack Beddington, the innovative publicity director, and to John Piper with whom Betjeman closely collaborated on the Guides. Betjeman would take infinite trouble over the most routine letter. One, accompanying a manuscript returned to its author, amounts to an essay and reading-list on poetic technique. The arrival of an envelope penned by Betjeman (he insisted it should be pronounced ON-velope) must have given great anticipation of pleasure to the addressee.</p>

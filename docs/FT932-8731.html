			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / EC aid to industry questioned EUROPEAN COMMUNITY governments should be more strictly controlled in their use of aid for industry, the Commons Trade and Industry Committee said yesterday. In a report on trade with Europe, the cross-party committee of MPs attacked the slowness of European Commission investigations into alleged illegal state aid, calling for aid to be frozen during any such inquiry. The UK is, with Germany and Denmark, one of the lowest users of state aid, in part because of the dwindling role of publicly-owned companies in manufacturing. The report highlights concern that UK companies may be disadvantaged in competition against companies elsewhere in Europe - in particular in Italy, Portugal and Ireland - where government aid to industry is comparatively high. It notes that even though absolute levels of aid are declining, 'what matters is how seriously state aids are distorting competition in the single market, and how seriously they are damaging UK companies.' Of particular concern is the opaque relationship that frequently exists between public authorities and public companies, the report says. A total of Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.95bn) of state aid to public sector companies was not notified to the EC between 1985 and 1990, it said. Opaque relationships are also of concern in the area of public procurement, accounting for 15 per cent of the EC's gross domestic product. Trade with Europe, second report of the Trade and Industry Committee. HMSO Pounds 12.50.</p>

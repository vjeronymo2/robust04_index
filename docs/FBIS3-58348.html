Speaking on the TF1 television channel, he also said that  his  government would see to it that there would be "no additional  tax burden on the French people's income" in 1994.    The French economy was in recession for most of last year,  and the unemployment rate now stands at 12 percent. It is  universally expected to rise further in the coming months.

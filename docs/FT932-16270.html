			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Company News: Oki Electric production to be cut as demand falls OKI Electric, the Japanese telecommunications and data processing company, is closing a plant in Tokyo and reducing activities at two other plants. The decision to close the plants, which manufacture control and information communication equipment and semiconductors, follows a severe downturn in capital investment by Japanese companies. Oki has been hit by a fall in orders for information communication systems from financial companies and a downturn in semiconductor demand. The company is forecasting a fall in sales to Y560bn (Dollars 4.7bn) in the year to the end of March 1993, down from a previous forecast of Y585bn. It is also predicting pre-tax losses of Y39bn, against its earlier forecast of Y1.28bn profits. It expects to cut capital spending to Y47.7bn in the year to March and to Y20bn in fiscal 1994, compared with Y68.4bn in the year to March 1992. Oki has been restructuring its businesses, cutting recruitment from 1,000 last year to just over 400 this year and about 100 next. It hopes to reduce its workforce by 2,000 by 1995. Kenwood, the Japanese audio manufacturer, revised down its forecast net result by Y7.5bn for the year to March 1993 and now expects to report an after-tax losses of Y5.5bn, compared with a previous forecast of Y2bn profit. The expected deficit comes after an extraordinary deficit comprising currency losses incurred through the sale of shares in a US subsidiary, writing off losses from selling securities, and unrecoverable loans made to a struggling financial subsidiary. The company expects to report a pre-tax profits of Y4bn, down from Y6.1bn the year before.</p>

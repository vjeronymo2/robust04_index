			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By D. Kokko and V. Gonchar from St. Petersburg's "Severnyy </F> Zavod" Production Association; from the "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] [Kokko over video of missiles] A couple of years  ago TV crews could not even dream of gaining access to this  enterprise. For many years the "Severnyy Zavod" Production  Association produced nothing but missiles for air defense  systems. Nowadays the need for conversion is felt even here,  although views differ on how to tackle the problems which have  arisen.    According to the plant's director, owing to shortsighted  government policy Russia currently has no real chance of  entering the world market in defense weapon systems. Production  is declining, but we simply must preserve our high-tech  facilities. This gave birth to the project to build a spherical  Tokamak. Previously this argon chamber was used to make wings  for missiles. Now it is used to make titanium ice-axes for  Norway.    However, recently a project was drawn up in cooperation with  physicists from the Ioffe Institute to build a spherical Tokamak  for research in the field of thermonuclear reactions.  Theoretical studies have already been carried out and a  1:10-scale model has been built. If it proves possible to  translate the project to build a spherical Tokamak into reality,  Russia will undoubtedly take up a leading position in the world  in the sphere of thermonuclear fusion.</p>

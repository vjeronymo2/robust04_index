			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / US, German air talks near climax NEGOTIATIONS between the US and Germany on a new aviation agreement between the two countries are expected to reach a climax this week and threaten to have significant repercussions for airlines on both sides of the Atlantic. If agreement is reached during the latest round of talks starting in Bonn today it would clear the way for a far-reaching collaboration deal between Lufthansa, the German airline, and United Airlines, one of the three biggest US carriers. However, both sides are still deadlocked on a series of controversial issues. Germany has already threatened to abrogate the existing bilateral aviation agreement which expires at the end of next month. It would follow the example of France which has already abrogated its aviation agreement with the US. Germany, like France, has complained that US airlines have had an unfair advantage over their national carriers because old bilateral accords have given US carriers virtually unbridled access into their markets without similar access for their airlines in the US. Lufthansa has suffered a drastic loss of market share on north Atlantic routes since 1989 when US carriers started intensifying their drive into the German market. The German airline has seen its market share drop from 40 per cent to barely 25 per cent during this period. Lufthansa urgently needs to improve its yield on transatlantic routes which account for about 20 per cent of its overall business and contributed significantly to an operating loss of DM482m (Pounds 195m) in the first five months of this year. The German government is seeking two important concessions from the US including a three-year freeze on capacity on North Atlantic routes and agreement to allow Lufthansa to enter a code-sharing partnership with United Airlines. Code-sharing, a marketing arrangement between two airlines, allows them to use each other's identification codes in computer reservation systems. This would allow Lufthansa to book passengers to far more US destinations and in turn offer the same advantage to United in Germany. It would also place Lufthansa on a more competitive footing against British Airways, which has an equity partnership and code-sharing deal with USAir, and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, which has a similar arrangement with Northwest Airlines. Air France has also recently negotiated a commercial agreement with Continental Airlines. But the US in return is asking Germany to allow Northwest the right to extend its Amsterdam services to the German market through its code-sharing arrangements with KLM. This has been opposed so far not only by Lufthansa but also by another US carrier, Delta, which has invested heavily in developing a hub at Frankfurt by acquiring the German business of the now defunct Pan American Airways.</p>

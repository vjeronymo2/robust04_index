			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 17 (CNS)--Director of the Financial  and Economic Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC)  Mr. Liu Suinian said this morning that the government had to be  determined to streamline its structure by strictly controlling  the financial spending in order to alleviate the state's  financial difficulties.    Mr. Liu made these remarks at the session of the presidium  of  the 8th NPC when he delivered a report on a review of the state  budget for 1993 and a draft budget set for 1994. There are now  nearly 25 million persons on the state payroll which is part of  financial spending, 50 percent more than in 1985.    The committee believed that a too big government structure  and redundancy of staff were the main reason for excessive  financial spending. The committee suggested that China should  make reference to other countries and make a decision to  streamline government structure.    Other proposals put forward include cutting the financial  deficit by every possible means, increasing financial revenue,  maintaining the growth of financial revenue and the gross  domestic product at the same pace and raising the input of  capital to support development in economically poor areas.    According to the draft state budget for 1994 made known by  the Minister of Finance Mr. Liu Zhongli, China will borrow loans  of over RMB129.2 billion this year. The committee believed that  it was inevitable that a deficit and loan-making would take  place at a time when China was now seeing rapid economic  development and a change in its system. It said, however, that  the authorities had to pay much more attention to controlling  spending on new items of basic construction while subsidies for  the making up of losses should be kept under control and  reductions or exemptions of tax not in line with the law should  be prevented.</p>

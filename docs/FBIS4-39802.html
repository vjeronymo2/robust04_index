			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by O. Volodin: "Only Together Can We Work </F> Efficiently"]    [Text] Participants in the briefing held by Crimean Deputy  Prime Minister Ye. Saburov on 28 May for media representatives  assessed the events in the Crimean Supreme Soviet of the  previous week when a number of deputies protested against the  government's program, without even reading it.    Ye. Saburov read a statement calling the incident "a  constitutional coup exemplified by the legislature's desire to  replace the Executive Branch." According to the deputy prime  minister, this scenario is identical to the developments in  Moscow, cited by Saburov, when the former Russian Supreme Soviet  embarked on a path of dangerous opposition against the Executive  Branch represented by the president of the Russian Federation.  Meanwhile, the paradox of the Crimean situation lies in the  fact that numerous members of the Russia deputies' bloc opposed  President Meshkov, those very people who used to pledge their  loyalty to the president a while ago.    Saburov believes the banal fight for ministerial portfolios  to be the primary cause for the parliamentary "mutiny." It is  understood that the Russia bloc has the right to recommend its  candidates for the posts in the Crimean Government. However,  the deputy prime minister maintains that he is ready to consider  only the candidacies of highly-competent professionals.    The views of the Crimean president on personnel issues  coincide with those of Saburov. Unfortunately, their opponents  in the legislature take an absolutely different approach. That  is why they are persistently supporting the myth of the  "invasion of bureaucrats from Moscow," despite the fact that  only five Muscovites are actually working in the government.    The deputy prime minister rejected the accusations by  lawmakers who claim that the government has no distinct program  for overcoming the crisis. Saburov pointed out: "We have  already started implementing this program despite the  clandestine sabotage by a number of senior officials, including  the management of Crimea's National Bank. Due to the fact that  the latter refused to obey the Crimean president's edict  granting local enterprises the right to sell currency at market  prices, Crimea has probably lost several million dollars. The  implementation of the program is also being upset by populist  claims by a number of deputies who are demanding  "liberalization" of taxes, in disregard of the fact that the  government is facing grave difficulties financing the Crimean  budget."    Putting spokes in the government's wheels in the current  critical period, planting a mine under the relations between the  president and the legislature of Crimea, the people's deputies,  according to Saburov, push Kiev officials toward harsh measures  against Crimean autonomy.    Asked by a KRYMSKAYA PRAVDA reporter about possible measures  to be taken by the government in case the Supreme Soviet takes  no steps to meet the Executive Branch half-way on personnel  issues, Saburov briefly answered: "The government will continue  to perform its duties proceeding from the interests of the  people of Crimea." He strongly recommended the legislature not  to stand in the government's way and to finally get down to  serious lawmaking. Saburov stressed: "Only together can we work  efficiently."</p>

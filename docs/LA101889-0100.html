			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BENJAMIN HAS LEFT L.A.; CLIPPERS WILL FEEL EFFECTS OF DEPARTURE  </P> <P> Out of sight, out of mind?  </P> <P> Not at about $20,000 a month.  </P> <P> That's how much the Clippers will still be paying Benoit Benjamin in deferred  compensation from his original contract four years ago, even as Benjamin begins  a separate one-year deal with Philips Milano in Italy. Payments to the  fifth-year center will run the length of the National Basketball Assn. season.  </P> <P> The Clippers' most recent offer to their former team captain also included  deferred payments, which didn't seem to bother him nearly as much as the  proposed incentive payments to keep his weight under control. The complete  package, including bonuses, could have been worth more than $3 million for two  years, the Clippers holding the option on the second season.  </P> <P> "We made it clear we were willing to pay based on performance and not  potential," said Clipper General Counsel Alan Rothenberg, who handled the  negotiations. "We were not interested in paying Ben millions of dollars and  then watching him struggle to get through practices. He didn't want any part of  the weight clause, which made us believe that he wasn't ready to put forth the  right effort."  </P> <P> Benjamin, typically soft-spoken around strangers, arrived in Milan Tuesday  night and talked to about 20 reporters as if he were back at the news  conference in the Inglewood YMCA. He said he's in good shape, ready to play and  looking forward to Italian basketball.  </P> <P> The loss of Benjamin leaves the Clippers with no center capable of the same  impact as the league's sixth-best shot blocker. Coach Don Casey, who stays out  of contract negotiations, knows only that he needs bodies.  </P> <P> They do seem to be in short supply for the Clippers, who since July 1 have  lost:  </P> <P>  -- Quintin Dailey, who for all his problems (see: Lakers, 1989 training camp),  did average 16.1 points a game last season before the Clippers decided not to  pick up the option on his contract.  </P> <P>  -- Danny Ferry, who also signed to play in Italy.  </P> <P>  -- Benjamin.  </P> <P> Overall, the Clippers' starting center, starting shooting guard and their No. 1  draft choice are gone, with nothing to show in return.  </P> <P> The only additions to a team that went 21-61 and finished last in the Pacific  Division for the third consecutive season are a pair of second-round choices,  Jeff Martin and Jay Edwards, although a couple of the free agents figure to  stick, too.  </P> <P> Partly because of bad luck, partly because of bad decisions, the draft in  recent years hasn't yielded much more than a quiet breeze to the 1989-90  Clippers, at least with the No. 1 picks. Among them are:  </P> <P>  -- 1989, Ferry, arrivederci.  </P> <P>  -- 1988, Danny Manning, who will not be back until December at the earliest  after suffering a knee injury last season.  </P> <P>  -- 1987, Reggie Williams, the current starting shooting guard.  </P> <P>  -- 1986, Dwayne Polee, gone.  </P> <P>  -- 1985, Benjamin.  </P> <P>  -- 1984, Lancaster Gordon, gone.  </P> <P> The three years before that yielded starters, who became stars, but with other  teams -- Byron Scott, with the Lakers; Terry Cummings, with the Milwaukee  Bucks, and Tom Chambers, with the Seattle SuperSonics.  </P> <P> Clearly, the Clippers have been left empty-handed before. But Benjamin's  departure apparently marked an end of innocence. They became so fed up with  paying someone who had been so roundly criticized around the league that they  stood their ground.  </P> <P> Two weeks earlier, management, pleased with the progress of guard Gary Grant,  tore up his three-year contract and rewarded him with a new four-year deal. A  similar deal was also completed Tuesday with Ken Norman, who was beginning the  final season of a three-year contract that would have paid him $450,000 for  1989-90. The new package is four years at $4.4 million. Money was not the main  issue with Benjamin.  </P> <P> Unlike a year ago, when the salary cap was a major concern with Manning coming  in, there are no such worries this time. Raises are being handed out;  Benjamin's $1-million price tag for 1988-89 will remain on the payroll as the  Clippers retain his NBA rights as a restricted free agent, and there's still  room to spare if a trade opportunity comes along.  </P> <P> They barely went over the limit last season, and the cap increased from $7.232  million to $9.802 for 1989-90, without the Clippers having to sign a  high-priced first-round draft choice.  </P> <P> Or a high-priced center.  </P> <P> Clipper Notes  </P> <P> Don Casey, who spent a brief time as coach of Club Scalavini in Italy, on  Benoit Benjamin's decision: "I think he was very anxious and would have liked  to get (his contract) resolved. But I don't think this was a good basketball  decision for him."  </P></p>

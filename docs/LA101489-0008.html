			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PERESTROISHCHIKI SPEAK OUT;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: FOUR PEOPLE ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF THE GORBACHEV REFORMS GIVE A  CANDID APPRAISAL OF WHAT LIES AHEAD.  </P> <P> Between June, 1987, and this past May, two Americans with longstanding  interests in Soviet affairs conducted a series of interviews with 14 of those  Soviets who have come to be known as perestroishchiki -- outspoken proponents  of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's most radical reforms. From that work has come a new  book, "Voices of Glasnost," by Stephen F. Cohen, a professor of politics and  director of the Russian Studies Program at Princeton University, and Katrina  vanden Heuvel, an editor at The Nation. Following are excerpts from four  interviews.  </P> <P> Nikolai Shmelyov is a vivid example of people brought into the limelight by the  politics of perestroika and the possibilities of glasnost. A noted economist,  he has also become a major Soviet literary figure.  </P> <P> Question: If the situation in the countryside is so dire, why didn't Gorbachev  begin his economic reforms in agriculture, as the Chinese did when they  undertook their own perestroika in the late 1970s, rather than in industry?  </P> <P> Answer: I think there were two reasons. It is less risky to make changes in  industry because it is not so painful if production declines for a while during  the transition. The risks in agriculture are much greater because if total  output falls even for only a year or so, it is very painful. In addition, to  begin radical reforms in the countryside, Gorbachev would have needed the full  support of the entire party structure, and I doubt that he had it. Major  economic reforms aren't possible unless the party gives up its economic  functions. Here, too, it is easier in industry, where the party has fewer  functions than it does in agriculture. In the countryside, the power and  influence of every district party secretary is based on his economic authority,  which makes him 100% master of the district. If he gives up that authority, he  may still be master, but not a 100% one.  </P> <P> Incidentally, in 1986, at the 27th Party Congress, Gorbachev announced that  state and collective farms could market freely about 30% of their produce, as  they saw fit. Well, that reform was never implemented. There is an enormous  administrative-bureaucratic pyramid in the countryside that exists solely for  the purpose of extracting obligatory deliveries. There may be 3 million of  these rural administrators. They are stifling reform because it would topple  their pyramid. They're blocking the transition to family leasing and market  relations. They ought to be punished and an example made of them.  </P> <P> But whether we are speaking of agriculture or industry, the whole problem is  peeling all the layers of state bureaucratic administration off the economy.  The state has an important role to play in the economy, but it should play it  through economic means such as prices, interest rates and taxes, not by using  its fists and commands. If you look closely at the existing administrative  system, with all its bureaucratic layers, you'll see that the top layers are  completely irresponsible economically, whatever incentives exist have nothing  to do with the actual productivity of enterprises or workers, and nobody knows  what anything is worth or costs because of the administered system of distorted  prices.  </P> <P> But when we talk about dismantling the administrative system, do you know what  many of our economic officials say? They say it will cause economic anarchy and  the growth rate will fall. Except in some areas of consumer goods and service,  it would be healthy if our growth rate fell. The main problem isn't quantity  but quality and marketing. The Soviet Union isn't a backward country in  production. We produce more shoes than any country in the world, but they  aren't any good and nobody wants them. We produce twice as much steel as the  United States and just as many machine tools. We produce many more farm  tractors and combines than you do, but we buy grain from you. Even in  agriculture, the most pressing problem is not producing more but using what we  actually produce: 20% of the grain and well over 50% of the fruit and potatoes  never reach any consumer. We lose more food than we import. Again, layers of  bureaucracy and administrative tyranny are responsible for this mess.  </P> <P> Tatyana Zaslavskaya is an economist turned sociologist who today heads the  newly formed Center for the Study of Public Opinion in Moscow.  </P> <P> Question: Do you see a special role for women in perestroika? On several  occasions you have complained that your male colleagues in the social sciences  are too often passive and lacking in civic courage. And as we watch the  unusually prominent role played by Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, in Soviet public  life, we get the impression that he and she are consciously encouraging Soviet  women to be much more active participants in public affairs than they were in  the past.  </P> <P> Answer: I have personally heard Gorbachev say that he hopes women will play an  important role in perestroika, but I do not see a special role for them. It is  certainly true that women drink less and are more stable than men. It is also  true that women are generally under- utilized in our society, even though 94%  of them are in the work force. Few of them rise to the top in their  professions. In the Academy of Sciences, for example, it is rare to find women  serving as section or department heads at institutes. Nor have I yet to see  women playing an active role in perestroika. At the many meetings I've  attended, it's always men, men, men.  </P> <P> But it is not only the system that holds a woman back, it's also life itself  the moment she starts a family. Take my own case. I have two daughters, which  made things very difficult. But I would have been a very unhappy person without  a family and children. There was a time when life was hard. I had to write my  dissertation, and the four of us were living in a cramped communal apartment.  Even together, our salaries, mine and my husband's, were meager. Constantly I  was taking one daughter to kindergarten and the other to the doctor. It was  only because I was irresistibly drawn to scholarship that I was able to do so  much. So it is not surprising that many Soviet women would like to leave the  work force if their husbands' salaries were large enough. And this may not be a  bad thing. We have a generation of children raised without mothers who were all  out working -- an abandoned generation. These children have a lot of problems,  including a sharp drop in morality among them. No one can replace a mother.  </P> <P> But whether we are talking about men or women, perestroika has to give people  faith in its goals and the freedom to be active and creative. Otherwise there  will be no social revolution in our country. Working people are watching and  waiting to see if the changes are really going to affect their lives. They've  grown accustomed to a discrepancy between words and deeds. The greatest danger  is that we will disappoint them again and lose their support.  </P> <P> Alexander Bovin, a specialist at Isvestia in the field of international  affairs, has long been one of the most popular journalists in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Question: Are you now free to write about and say whatever you want?  </P> <P> Answer: I can't, not yet, but you have to understand the special problem here.  We ought to have full glasnost in our coverage of Soviet foreign policy and  world affairs, but we still are limited by concerns of the Foreign Ministry and  the government. We can criticize what happened before 1985 -- the deployment of  the SS-20 missiles in Europe and the invasion of Afghanistan, for example --  but I can't disagree with what Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said today,  yesterday or last year. And the reason is the old habit, yours and ours, of  associating everything that appears in Soviet newspapers with the Kremlin. We  don't have a tradition of journalists expressing their own personal views on  foreign affairs. So if I write something sharp or critical or new, foreign  governments and observers say it is the opinion of the Kremlin. Similarly, I  can't write critically about things I don't like in Eastern Europe or elsewhere  in the world Communist movement. Leaders of those countries and parties  immediately complain to Moscow. Or they say the Soviet Union is interfering in  their affairs. It's also why it is not easy for me to write my opinion of (the  late Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini or Moammar Kadafi.  </P> <P> We have to establish a tradition that enables journalists to speak only for  themselves and express what is clearly their own personal opinions, so that  nobody will identify them with the Soviet Foreign Ministry or the Kremlin.  Everybody agrees that this is sensible, that we should do it, and we have made  some progress. But there still are problems. It is a matter of perceptions and  reactions abroad.  </P> <P> There's a much worse example. When Ayatollah Khomeini sentenced Salman Rushdie  to death for his novel "The Satanic Verses" in February, the Soviet government,  unlike many others, did not publicly protest. It feared that a protest would  jeopardize the government's diplomatic relations with Iran. Though I wrote a  protest in Moscow News, most of our journalists were silent. I was ashamed that  Moscow was silent. Politics prevails over morals. And glasnost again came only  in dribbles.  </P> <P> Alexander Yakovlev is widely considered to be the staunchest Politburo  supporter of Gorbachev's radical reforms and the "architect of glasnost."  </P> <P> Question: Let us assume, for the sake of discussion, that all these political  reforms will actually be enacted and that a democratized Soviet political  system emerges sometime in the future. Will such a Soviet democratic system be  like the American democratic system or will it be different?  </P> <P> Answer: Certainly it will be different. After all, democracies with the same  kind of social and economic system -- the United States, England and France,  for example -- are different. Since we have a different kind of social and  economic system, it is logical to expect that our democracy will be different.  Of course, there will be some common aspects -- pluralism of opinions,  multicandidate elections, nominations and voting and other technical aspects of  democracy. But the differences will be more substantive, though I don't rule  out the possibility that we can learn from each other.  </P> <P> First of all, in our socialist country, democracy will be at the disposal of  the people as a means to solve its problems and achieve its goals. So far as I  can judge, this is not a primary task of American democracy. Secondly, we  interpret democracy more broadly than you do. We don't limit it to  participation in elections. We want to put it into practice in our everyday  life, including at the workplace. For us, it is the way to overcome people's  centuries-old alienation from political and economic power -- and this  alienation still exists in our socialist system -- and to give people the  chance to make their opinions felt in all kinds of decision-making. Of course,  this is a future perspective, but we intend to move precisely in this  direction. Finally, I think that as our reforms develop and as we continue to  put our socialist principles and values into practice, the constitutional  aspects of our democracy will be more dynamic than they are in America. Our  constitution will be developing and changing, along with our society. I think  that some of those changes will bring us closer, for example, in the area of  human rights. But for the foreseeable future, yes, we will be very different.  </P></p>

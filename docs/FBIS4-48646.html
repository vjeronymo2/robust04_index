			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stefaans Bruemmer] </F>   [Text] Whites, who were marginalised, banned, detained,  jailed and forced into exile under the old regime, are moving  into positions of power and influence in the new. To a far  great extent than in other liberation movements on the  subcontinent, whites played an important role in the fight  against apartheid. They made a distinctive contribution in  student politics, the trade unions and the legal sphere. During  the 1950s and 1960s they were prominent in the South African  Communist Party and its successor, the Congress of Democrats,  and in the ANC's trade union arm, the South African Congress of  Trade Unions.    White intellectuals and student activists again played a  vital supporting role in the resurgence of black unionism in the  1970s, and in the rise of the United Democratic Front a decade  later.    Here are eight who, by historical irony, already hold or are  on the threshold of high public office:  <H5>  HALTON CHEADLE </H5>   Tipped as the new director-general of manpower, Cheadle (44)  is a lawyer with impeccable "struggle" credentials. After  whetting his appetite for union affairs as a student on the  University of Natal's Wages Commission, he became a national  organiser for the Textile Workers' Industrial Union. His  ground-breaking work in organising black workers in 1972 and  1973 -- when the Industrial Conciliation Act did not recognise  black labour unions -- earned him the wrath of the security  police. "Anyone who organised black workers clearly constituted  a threat to the state," says Cheadle. He had a five- year  banning order slapped on him in 1974, but it lapsed after two  years.    During his "house arrest" he completed a law degree with  Unisa [University of South Africa]. Afterwards he joined the  Centre for Applied Legal Studies at Wits [Witwatersrand  University], where he still holds a teaching chair.    In the 1980s he started the legal firm Cheadle, Thompson  &amp;  Haysom with Nicholas Haysom in Johannesburg. "Hundreds" of  labour cases and a number of human rights cases put Cheadle's  firm on the legal map.    In 1985 Cheadle and his partners represented the Uitenhage  community in the Kannemeyer Commission of Inquiry into the death  of 21 marchers at the hands of police, and the following year  there was an interdict against the police when Port Elizabeth  district surgeon Dr Wendy Orr spilled the beans on police  torture. That same year the firm's challenge against the  second State of Emergency on behalf of a trade union grabbed  headlines.    Cheadle made his mark on constitutional law last year when  he  served on the Ad Hoc Committee on Fundamental Rights at the  World Trade Centre negotiations.    What motivates him? "Certainly not the money. I suppose  the best is the people I work with. The people in the struggle  are the most extraordinary people." On the director-generalship  he says: "I am talking to people, but I like my life at the  moment."  <H5>  JOHN DANIELS </H5>   A foreign affairs expert and professor of politics at the  University of Durban-Westville, Daniels (50) seems a likely  candidate for a top Department of Foreign Affairs position by  virtue of his close connections to the ANC task group on foreign  policy and his training of diplomats for the new order.    Daniels cut his anti-apartheid political teeth in the  student  movement. He says he came out of school a supporter of the  United Party, but underwent a "radical political conversion  through NUSAS [National Union of South African Students]. "For  the first time I found myself working in a non-racial  organisation."    He was president of the University of Natal-Pietermaritzburg  SRC [Students Representative Council] in 1965 and vice-president  of NUSAS the following year. He took over as NUSAS president  when the incumbent, Ian Robertson, was banned.    He soon attracted the attention of authorities, who refused  him a passport when he wanted to study overseas in 1967. In  1968 he was re-elected NUSAS president, but things became too  hot and he went into exile until 1991. He did a PhD in the  United States and became a professor of political studies in  Swaziland -- where his association with the ANC started. Swazi  authorities deported him in 1985, after which he worked as a  researcher in Holland and for a leftwing publisher in London.    On his return to South Africa he joined the Rhodes  University  department of politics, where he headed a diplomacy training  programme. He moved to the University of Durban-Westville last  year.    He says the area of international affairs may hold far fewer  difficulties for the new government than domestic  transformation. He expects pressures on the Reconstruction and  Development Programme, which may mean a retreat on some  promises. "I fear cynicism, bitterness and slow delivery."    President Nelson Mandela's "incredible international  stature"  will smooth the way for South Africa's reentry to the world  arena, says Daniels, and the new government can play an  important role in giving the Third World a greater voice in the  United Nations.    Daniels says he is in two minds about the possibility of  taking public office. "If offered a position in the Department  of Foreign Affairs, I would seriously consider it, although I am  also very committed to academic life."  <H5>  ALEC ERWIN </H5>   Erwin (48), an economist who made his career in the trade  union movement, has been named deputy minister of finance in the  new national cabinet. He is an ANC MP in the National Assembly.  Like his contemporary Halton Cheadle, he graduated from Wages  Commission to union involvement.    He helped found the Institute for Industrial Education in  1973 and made his name as one of a number of whites who played a  critical role in the reconstruction of the trade union movement  after Sactu [South African Congress of Trade Unions] was smashed  and forced into exile.    During a wave of bannings and detentions in the mid-1970s  Erwin was put under surveillance, was targeted in police raids  and had is passport withdrawn.    In 1979 Erwin became the first general secretary of the  newly  launched Federation of South African Trade Unions (FOSATU),  which was to form the backbone, with the National Union of  Mineworkers, of COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions].  He served COSATU, and later the National Union of Metalworkers  (Numsa) as education secretary. He became involved in ANC  structures in Durban after the oragnisation's unbanning and  represented COSATU on the National Economic Forum.    Erwin hopes for a constructive relation between labour and  government, but "it is crucial the union movement maintains its  independence and organisational strength."   <H5>    DEREK HANEKOM </H5>   Hanekom (41) was appointed minister of land affairs last  week  -- eight years after he walked from prison in Pretoria following  a terrorism conviction. In 1990 he became co-ordinator of the  ANC land and agricultural desk.    Hanekom matriculated from Jan van Riebeeck in Cape Town and  did his national service in Potchefstroom, after which he  travelled and did assorted jobs -- including farming -- in  Europe, America and Israel.    From 1978 to 1983 he was a dairy, poultry and vegetable  farmer in the Magaliesberg, where he started facilitating  linkages for the ANC. But he was arrested -- with his wife,  Trish -- and sentenced to three years in jail. He served the  full term. Trish, a Zimbabwean citizen, was later deported to  Zimbabwe and Hanekom followed. He was appointed co-ordinator of  the Popular History Trust in Harare. He returned in 1990 to  take up the ANC position.  <H5>  NICHOLAS "FINK" HAYSON </H5>   "In another society my first concern may have been rugby,  which is my passion," says Haysom. But "in South Africa it has  been difficult to live a normal life while there are glaring  inequalities and injustice".    Like his partner Cheadle at the labour and human rights law  firm Cheadle, Thompson &amp; Haysom, Haysom has a long "struggle"  track record and is likely to be the legal and constitutional  advisor in Mandela's office. He is a human rights,  constitutional, and security expert and ANC appointee to the  Police Board established in terms of the National Peace Accord.    He was "something of a liberal even at school", and got  caught up in progressive student politics at the University of  Natal, where he was SRC vice-president from 1973 to 1975. In  1977 he was elected SRC president at the University of Cape Town  and president of NUSAS [National Union of South African  Students].    Haysom was detained without trial for short periods in 1976  and 1980, and for about five months in 1981, when the government  cracked down on the trade union movement. Like Cheadle he  joined the Centre for Applied Legal Studies at Wits, where he is  an associate professor. He is member of the ANC's committee on  constitutional affairs and took part in the Codesa [Convention  for a Democratic South Africa] and World Trade Centre  negotiations.    Of the "new South Africa" he says: "It's exciting, but I'm  also sure it's going to be difficult to transform a society and  civil service that has worked in a particular culture of  authoritarianism and militarism to one that is transparent."  <H5>  JANET LOVE </H5>   Once branded on police posters as "armed and dangerous",  Love  (38) made a rapid ascent to transitional structures after being  granted indemnity three years ago -- her current position is  deputy executive director of the Transitional Executive Council  [TEC].    Her political life started at Wits University, where she was  elected to the SRC and the NUSAS executive in 1975. A year  later she started working covertly for the ANC. She facilitated  communication between ANC cadres outside the country and  internally, and between banned people.    In 1978 Love left the country for "a short period that  turned  out to be 10 years". In Europe and Southern Africa she was  involved with SACTU [South African Congress of Trade Unions] and  was trained as an Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC  military wing (MK]) guerrilla.    In 1987 she returned illegally and lived under a series of  assumed identities, and took part in MK's Operation Vula. "In  1990 the SAP [South African Police] got wind that I was here and  put out a series of mug shots of me, saying I was 'armed and  dangerous'." She spent a year on the run.    In June 1991 Love was granted indemnity, and the following  year was elected to the ANC's PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] regional executive, where she helped set up the  Codesa negotiations.    As the TEC winds down, she has been mentioned as a possible  appointee to the President's Office, but says nothing has been  finalised.  <H5>  CHARLIE NUPEN </H5>   A lawyer and a big man ("Isn't it one of the ironies of life  that he is called Charlie when he is about eight feet tall,"  quipped an IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] staffer),  Nupen (43) shot to broad public attention as commissioner of the  Independent Electoral Commission.    As NUSAS president in 1974 he led a campaign for the release  of political prisoners such as Mandela and Walter Sisulu. For  that he spent a year on trial in 1976, but was acquitted. After  university he practised as a labour attorney in Cape Town and  from 1980 to 1987 was an attorney with the Legal Resources  Centre -- where he helped establish a jurisprudence in the  Industrial Court. After that he was appointed national director  of the Independent Mediation Service of South Africa.    Nupen says he is optimistic. "I'm incredibly pleased about  the security situation now; that has been one of the most  impressive aspects of the electoral process."    Economic development is predicated on stability, he says. ?  "If (peace) can be sustained, it augurs incredibly well for  investment, development and Reconstruction and Development  Programme."    Nupen may consider another public office -- and there have  been discussions around a Department of Manpower position -- but  Independent Electoral Commission legislation precludes him from  holding one for 18 months.  <H5>  DR TIM WILSON </H5>   Wilson (50), tipped for a senior Department of Health  position, has a strong community health background, both as  practitioner and as the ANC's health policy co-ordinator.  Wilson's godfather was Professor Z.K. Matthews, ANC Cape leader  in the 1940s, and his association with the ANC started at birth,  he says. He kept the struggle in the family by marrying SACP  [South African Communist Party] legend Braam Fischer's daughter,  Ilse.    While Wilson was completing his medical studies in England  his passport was withdrawn, presumably because of his  association with ANC activists. He returned in 1970. "I was  lucky only my passport was withdrawn. There were people who had  it tougher than me," he says.    In the late 1970s he became involved in community health,  and  led a research project in Soweto. He was one of a group of  doctors who took the South African Medical and Dental Council to  court for its failure to censure doctors involved in the  cover-up of Steve Biko's death.    In 1986 Wilson was appointed director of the Alexandra  Health  Centre, where he felt the brunt of informal repression. After  he and other staffers refused to hand over records of patients  to police, a series of arson attacks was launched against the  centre. He moved into ANC health policy structures in 1990.    Wilson says first priority is to overcome the fragmentation  of health services. When a unified health policy is introduced  "we can raise the level of health care in this country,  infinitely, with the current resources we have."</p>

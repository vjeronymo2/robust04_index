			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: IBM extends workstation range INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer, raised the temperature in the workstation market sharply yesterday with the launch of a range of powerful systems which sets new standards of price and performance. The workstations, an extension of the company's RS/6000 family, range in price in the UK from a basic Pounds 2,772 to Pounds 51,400. (Dollars 92,000). Complete with memory and screen, costs range from Pounds 4,948 to Pounds 214,957. Performance has been increased and prices kept down through the integration of all the processor functions on a single silicon chip. The launch marks IBM's move into the low end of the workstation business, dominated by Sun Microsystems. From a standing start, it has already captured 16 per cent of the workstation market in two years. Workstations, powerful personal computers with high-definition screens capable of being linked together in networks, have traditionally been used by scientists and engineers. They are increasingly being used in business for industrial design and the calculation of financial yields. The workstation market is continuing to grow at 10 per cent or more a year while other areas of the computer industry have slowed to 5 per cent or less. IBM's lead, however, may be short-lived. Last week, Hewlett Packard launched a Dollars 5,000 low-end workstation, while Digital Equipment announced a Dollars 4,000 systems last month. Sun Microsystems, which has about 40 per cent of the whole workstation market, is expected soon to launch a new generation of machines which will, in turn, set new standards. Management, Page 9</p>

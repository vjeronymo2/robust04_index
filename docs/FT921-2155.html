			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Kumagai Gumi to cut work abroad KUMAGAI Gumi, the aggres-sive Japanese contractor, yesterday forecast that pre-tax profit for the year would fall by 24.7 per cent, and predicted that the value of its international contracts would plunge to Y50bn (Dollars 378m) next year from Y150bn. The company, which had been one of the most international of Japanese contractors, had indicated that it would reduce the ratio of contracts abroad, but the suddenness and scale of the retreat came as a surprise yesterday. Kumagai said that orders received during the year to end-March are likely to total Y1,250bn, down Y150bn on a previous forecast, with a pre-tax profit of Y38bn on sales of about Y1,150bn, a 4 per cent fall on a year earlier. It said that calculating net profit has been complicated by the Tokyo stock market's volatility, which has affected stock appraisal losses for the period. Those losses are expected to total more than Y5bn, and net profit could be down about 12 per cent to Y16bn. Japanese contractors report that the weakness of the domestic property market has forced the postponement of a growing number of projects, and Kumagai said that it was also bruised by an increase in delayed payments from clients. The decline of the Japanese property market has been uneven, although land prices are reckoned to have fallen 30 per cent nationally over the past two years, with some apartment prices in the west falling by as much as 50 per cent. Kumagai has intended to sell as much as Y1,125bn in overseas property holdings to reduce its debt burden, but this has been delayed by the slump in the international market, in which it had been an aggressive developer, with projects in New York, London, Sydney and Beijing. Two years ago, the company reported that overseas contracts made up about 26 per cent of its total operations, but the level fell to 14 per cent last year and is likely to be less than 5 per cent next year.</p>

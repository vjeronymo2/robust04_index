			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Brewery shares fall after OFT warning SHARES in Allied-Lyons and Whitbread, the UK brewers, retreated yesterday after a warning from Sir Gordon Borrie, director general of fair trading, that he may take action against brewers' long-term beer supply agreements with pub retailers. Sir Gordon said he was concerned that such agreements were emerging as an alternative to the brewers' tied (exclusively supplied) pub estates now being reduced by the government beer orders. 'There are powers available to me both in the Fair Trading Act and in the Competition Act which I will most certainly consider using if I believe that the long-term supply agreement is being used to frustrate the loosening of the tie,' he said. Sir Gordon's remarks seem to be aimed at Allied-Lyons in particular. He has already told the brewer that 734 pubs it has leased to Brent Walker, the leisure group, will not count towards the 2,380 pubs it must release from tied beer supplies unless it alters the terms of its seven-year supply contract. Allied, which has also leased 142 pubs to Burtonwood, the north-west brewer, has indicated it is prepared to contest the issue in the courts. Allied's shares closed 12p off at 633p yesterday. Shares in Whitbread, which last week announced it was leasing 60 pubs to Shepherd Neame, the Kent brewer, in the first of an expected series of short-term deals with pub operators, closed 6p lower at 425p. Sir Gordon said that the creation last year of Inntrepreneur Estates (IEL), the Courage/ Grand Metropolitan pub retailing venture, should not be seen as a precedent in the brewing industry. Sir Gordon suggested that the effect of measures to stimulate competition in the brewing industry could not be assessed before they had run their course. 'But that is not to say that, in the meantime, the competition authorities should sit on their hands,' he said. Turbulence that had resulted from government action and the response of the brewers was damaging to some interest groups, Sir Gordon acknowledged. However, consumers would gain from increased pressure on brewers and publicans to provide a better mix of price, quality, and amenity.</p>

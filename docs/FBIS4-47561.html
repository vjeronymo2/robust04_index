Izzatullayev, Zoology and Parasitology </F> Institute at the Tajikistani Academy of Sciences, Dushanbe; UDC  [594:574.63](28)(575)]    [Abstract] The lack of published studies where mollusks--as  pollution indicators--are treated without regard to other  aquatic life forms, and their unique ability to filter off  organic contaminants as well as the stringent requirements the  mollusks impose on the water quality prompted the use of the  mollusk presence in aquatic biocenoses as the principal  indicator of water purity. In a toxic medium, mollusks do not  feed and close up, while when they pass all water through  themselves, mollusks, especially such bivalves as the 9-11 cm  long Colletopterum piscinale and 25-27 cm long  C. cyreum sogdianum, are capable of filtering up to  60-70 and 180-200 l per day, respectively, and stopping all  suspended particles. The incidence of 63 species of Gastropoda  and Bivalvia indicator mollusks in various types of Central  Asian reservoirs and streams is summarized. The mollusk  distribution by the water body type as a pollution indicator in  Central Asia is a first of its kind in scientific literature. In  all, 56 out of the 63 species are recommended for the first time  as bioindicators. The findings show that out of the total of 63  species, 15 inhabit only catarobic and oligosaprobic bodies of  water and are excellent water purity indicators, 15 are good  indicators only of oligosaprobic slightly contaminated water, 16  are indicators of only beta-mesosaprobic mildly contaminated  water, and two species inhabit only alpha-mesosaprobic  moderately contaminated water.

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Tunnel's friends dig in 100 feet down Eurotunnel may be late, over budget and widely scorned. But it knows how to throw a party. On Saturday it invited 800 people to lunch 100ft below the seabed and 7km out from the British side. For the occasion a cavernous crossover point of the tracks became a giant banqueting hall with 100 tables and twinkling tricolour lights, video screens and a string quartet. The event, inspired by Brunel's 1827 dinner in his recently completed Thames Tunnel, was Eurotunnel's way of saying 'thank you' to all the friends who helped it through the agonies of its eight-year life. The British guests, who had to be brought in by British Rail because Le Shuttle is not ready, arrived 90 minutes late but were delighted to find that they had beaten the French. Lady Thatcher, the guest of honour and, according to her hosts, the 'main inspiration' for the project, proclaimed the triumph of private finance. 'Without it, this would never have happened,' she said. 'The paper we signed to make this possible was worth a lot more than all the other bits of paper we signed in the second half of this century.' Mr Jacques Delors was not among those present. The timing of this grandiose event, with its proclamations of amitie, was not the best, coming as it did at the end of a week which had seen the publication of 'Chanteclair's' anti-British diatribe and a further move by the Paris government to prevent the anglicisation of French. Eurotunnel's friends evidently do not include members of the British government, whose dithering over the rail link added to its difficulties. The most prominent active politician present was Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary. But the Bank of England, the big clearing banks, merchant banks and stockbrokers were there.

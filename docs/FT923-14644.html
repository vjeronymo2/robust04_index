			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: New receivers appointed at IBH THE future of Foster's Brewing, the Australian brewery, came into clearer focus yesterday with the appointment of receivers to the group's leading shareholder, International Brewing Holdings (IBH). The appointment means two sets of receivers have now been appointed to IBH, which is controlled by Mr John Elliott, Foster's former managing director. IBH owns 38 per cent of Foster's. Last night's appointment by Wardley Australia as agent for a consortium of creditor banks known as the Vextin syndicate, takes precedence over receivers earlier appointed by Broken Hill Proprietary, which is also a leading IBH creditor. BHP has been negotiating to buy out Vextin's ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 890m) debt exposure to IBH since appointing its own IBH receivers on June 2. But a number of complex disagreements have apparently arisen. Vextin's hand may also have been forced by last week's court action by another group with IBH exposure, the National Mutual Life Association, to have the BHP receivers removed. A Wardley spokesman said last night it would have been normal for Vextin, as IBH's first mortgagee, to appoint a receiver as soon as BHP made its appointment. 'The syndicate initially delayed taking this step to allow discussions to continue. The legal and commercial complexities involved, however, mean the discussions have taken longer than expected. 'This, in turn, has created a period of uncertainty which doesn't serve the interests of any of the parties involved and the syndicate felt it should draw that period to a close,' Wardley said. Vextin's receiver yesterday moved to squash speculation that his appointment could lead to a quick sale of IBH's stake in Foster's. BHP had earlier said there would be no fire sale of the shares and the company was prepared to purchase and hold them, if necessary, until a suitable buyer could be found. Asia Pacific Breweries has acquired an interest in Austotel Trust Australia, which owns a chain of pubs in Australia, Reuter reports from Singapore. The deal was completed through a joint venture equally owned by Asia Breweries and New Zealand's Brierly Investments.</p>

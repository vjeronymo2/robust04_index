			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tallinn, 22 Apr, BNS -- Estonian Defense  Minister Indrek Kannik continued his visit to Ukraine Thursday  [21 April] in a meeting with Minister Dmytro Chernenko, the  chief of Ukraine's military industries.    Kannik told BNS after the meeting that Chernenko and the  high-ranking officers who attended the meeting offered Estonia  extensive cooperation in the defense sphere. Ukraine is  prepared to advise Estonia in hi-tech manufacturing of military  hardware and consider selling military technology and armaments  to Estonia. Ukraine also proposed that Estonian servicemen  might rest at Ukrainian resorts and vice versa.    Rein Helme, the chairman of the parliamentary defense  commission who accompanies Kannik on his visit to Ukraine, told  BNS that the Ukrainian Defense Ministry was interested in the  output of the Estonian light and food industry, especially fish  products and textiles.    The meeting discussed the possibilities for producing and  procuring ammunition, but no concrete agreements were made. The  parties decided to set up working groups to explore and resolve  the issue. They also touched on the possibility of repairing  Estonian armaments in Ukraine. [passage omitted]</p>

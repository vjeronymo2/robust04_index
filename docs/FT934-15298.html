			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hamlet opens firmly The stock market debut of Hamlet, the clothes importer supplying the retail trade, was marked by a strong performance from the shares. They opened at 140p - a 10p premium to the issue price of 130p and traded firmly with volume reaching 5m. Hamlet, which supplies low-ticket items to almost all the main clothing retailers except Marks and Spencer, had been expected to make a substantial mark on its first day of share trading. But the high turnover surprised at least one analyst who said the volume had been expected to be nearer 2 1/2 to 3m. Much of the activity was attributed to large institutions securing positions in the stock and trading was steady throughout the day. A little profit-taking knocked some of the shine off the price and the shares closed at 139p. Property shares again showed good gains following recent bullish broker comments and positive weekend press coverage. The leading stocks again recorded healthy advances, with Friday's James Capel recommendation still echoing in investors' ears, and second liners also caught the upbeat mood. Among the former, British Land rose 10 to 423p, Land Securities, busy in the options market, 11 to 714p and MEPC 9 to 519p. Elsewhere, Town Centre advanced 5 to 133p, Asda Properties 5 to 120p, Chesterfield 7 to 523p and Dencora 7 to 164p. Investor enthusiasm for water and electricity utility shares showed no signs of waning, both sectors surging on yield considerations. Among the Recs, London climbed 12 to 593p, Yorkshire 10 to 619p and South Wales 9 to 534p. Selected water stocks advancing included, Thames, up 8 at 563p and Yorkshire 8 to 572p. Boots responded to continued talk that its results early next month would herald announcements over either a restructuring at its Do It All business and or the merging of its drugs division. Gossip at the end of last week linked the latter concern to Fisons, the pharmacuetical group, with suggestions that the two could link-up their non-ethical drug businesses. Boots shares, with UBS also said to be positive. gained 5 to 494p. Fisons edged forward a half-penny to 166p. Reports that US executives of leading brand name companies were buying their own stock led some optimistic dealers to decide that the war on brands was over. However, this failed to affect the UK's leading brand producers, with Unilever off 2 at 1050p and Tate and Lyle 6 at 370p. Hillsdown Holdings, up 8 at 167p, was said to be responding to a BZW 'buy' note. Speculation that construction projects may be a target for the UK government's plans to cut public spending wiped value off some building stocks. But with share trading volumes generally low, industry analysts thought the market was treating the stories cautiously rather than seriously. RMC lost 5 to 818p and Redland gave up 6 to 536p. Redland may also be weaker as the date for a placing of scrip dividend shares, expected in three to four weeks, moves closer. In banks, Lloyds, left behind in recent sessions found admirers and ended the day 10 up at 570p. A broker's recommendation at the end of last week along with weekend press reports of rationalisation plans boosted National Westminster and the shares gained 8 to 549p. Talk of a negative broker's note saw TSB run back 3 1/2 to 220p. Some rebalancing of positions in SmithKline Beecham after the confirmation last week that it was to retain FT-SE 100 status was cited as the reason for much of the activity in the stock. The A shares fell 6 to 412p while the units fell 3 to 367p in substantial trading. Interest in SmithKline will be largely pegged to next week's anti-infective conference in New Orleans as will that in Wellcome which made a gain of 5 to close at 728p. The conference is expected to hear new results that will mark out the competitive position of the two companies which are both very active in anti-viral drugs. However, one analyst said that similar interest ahead of a recent conference in Copenhagen had proved to be largely misplaced and the event had turned out to have little impact. Trafalgar House shed 4 to 103p, with SG Warburg said to be cautious on the stock. Weekend reports of board room changes at the group were also said to have weakened sentiment. Uncertainity about board room changes at international trading group Lonrho undermined the shares and they declined 4 to 117p. Bargain hunters thought to be from the US, together with renewed bid talk, saw shares in Tiphook, the troubled container leasing group, advance 15 to 138p. Automated Security, whose joint broker BZW resigned on Friday after it issued a profits warning, attempted a rally but finished just a penny ahead at 103p. Westland Group also firmed a penny to 224p, following news of a Pounds 250m contract for one of its subsidiaries. Oil discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico and further acquisition of land in Texas for exploration pushed up the shares of British Borneo. The stock climbed 6 to 203p in the face of a downward trend afflicting most of the oil sector. Burmah lost 3 to close at 767p; Shell gave up 2 at 682p and BP ended a half-penny down at 322 1/2 p. Theme park operator Euro Disney slumped 35 to 610p as reports from Paris suggested that a leading French broker had turned negative, prompting old worries over the need for a bumper rights issue. Ladbroke, still embroiled with claims and counter-claims with a Sunday newspaper over the company's debts, recovered 4 to 182p in heavy turnover of 9m. Dealers said positive comments from Hoare Govett and house broker Smith New Court had garnered some support. Other statistics, Page 25.</p>

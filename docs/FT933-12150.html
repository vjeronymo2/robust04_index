			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Arts: Choral Proms at the Albert Hall This year's Promenade season has the look of a holding operation in anticipation of the 100th season in 1994. Budget constraints and a shortage of visiting orchestras from overseas (no doubt for the same reason) have left the director, John Drummond, calling on every ounce of his ingenuity. Early music must have seemed an irresistible answer to his problems. The performing groups are small, presumably cost-effective; the audience response is likely to be good. I was surprised last year to find one early music programme, not especially popularist and taking place on a Monday evening which is always difficult to sell, attracting a full house with queues for returns straggling around the Royal Albert Hall. So, for the BBC Proms 93 there is a proud parade of leading international early music groups. The Cologne Chamber Choir, formed in 1970, has been raising its profile through recordings of late. On Wednesday last week it came to London for a performance of Bach's B Minor Mass under its conductor and founder, Peter Neumann. Heard live, the choir did not disappoint: a youthful, well-balanced sound, clear and nimble, when asked to show its paces. Even in the grandest Bach choral works, pace is essential these days. Neumann is an interpreter in the 'authentic' style. For all its accomplishments, the performance was not very individual and is best described in terms of what it was not - not as soul-searching as Parrott, not as outgoing and public as Gardiner. The lightly-dancing Bach of Gustav Leonhardt is probably Neumann's nearest equivalent. In the last resort the Albert Hall seemed too grand for a performance on this scale (swallowing up the delicate wind solos in the opening 'Kyrie', for example, so that the strings' wisps of counter-melody strangely took the spotlight). The Collegium Cartusianum was the orchestra. The five able soloists were Christine Schafer, Ursula Eittinger, Annette Markert, Christoph Pregardien and Gotthold Schwarz.</p>

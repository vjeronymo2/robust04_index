			<p>BFN     [Text] In his exclusive interview with Interfax, Bashkirian  Premier Anatoliy Kopsov gave a high appraisal to the package of  the inter-governmental agreements between Russia and  Bashkortostan signed on May 25 in Moscow. In his opinion,  conclusion of such agreements between the center and the  republics "would facilitate strengthening of the truly  federative principles of Russia's existence."    Moscow and Ufa have signed a package of 10 agreements  including those on economic interaction, on division of  authorities in the sphere of international relations and foreign  economic activity, on interaction in the sphere of education,  development of defense branches, crime fighting, etc.    Kopsov expressed hope that two agreements on which the  parties failed to find mutual understanding, namely on budget  relations and on relations between the Central Bank of Russia  and National Bank of Bashkortostan, would be also initialled in  the near term. In his words, the Bashkirian side insists on a  one-channel system of the budget's formation and Russia -- on a  tow-channel one.    Kopsov also deems it necessary to put in place additional  powers for the National Bank of Bashkortostan, in particular  regarding fiscal and currency regulation.    Kopsov declared that Bashkortostan would like to fix its  right to use the gold reserve totalling 250 kilograms of gold  which was left in Ufa for storage from the "pre-perestroika"  times as collateral for currency credits received by  Bashkortostan.</p>

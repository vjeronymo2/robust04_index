			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CITY ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> THE PROPOSITIONS;  </P> <P> 3 BOND MEASURES, 1 CHARTER CHANGE PASS  </P> <P> Los Angeles voters approved three bond measures to improve libraries, police  stations and other city facilities but narrowly rejected another one that would  have helped finance rehabilitation of aging, low-income housing and would have  provided $10 million to shelter the homeless.  </P> <P> With the rejection of Proposition 3, some low-income housing advocates were  already calling on the City Council to head off the loss of thousands of homes  for the poor. Most of the buildings are in some of the city's poorest  neighborhoods in East and South-Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Low-Interest Loans  </P> <P> The bond measure, which drew just 64.8% of the 66% yes votes needed to pass,  would have provided low-interest loans for the buildings' owners, many of whom  cannot get conventional financing, to bring them up to earthquake safety  standards.  </P> <P> Proposition 1, a $53.4-million bond measure to build three branch libraries in  the San Fernando Valley and to improve 26 other branch libraries throughout the  city, passed with 68.3% of the vote. Proposition, 2, which calls for $176  million in bonds to build and remodel police stations, drew 68.7%. Proposition  4, a $60-million bond issue for installation of fire sprinklers and removal of  asbestos in municipal buildings, won with 68.4%  </P> <P> Voters approved one proposed amendment to the City Charter but rejected  another. Charter Amendment 5 would have reduced the number of votes required on  the 15-member council to approve employee pay raises but was defeated 42.3% to  57.6%. But Charter Amendment 6, which raises the limit on funds that can be  transferred within the same city department without approval of the mayor and  City Council, won 58% to 42%. Both Charter proposals required only a simple  majority to pass.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Older Buildings  </P> <P> The rejected $100-million housing bond measure would have helped preserve an  estimated 15,000 older brick buildings. Housing advocates fear their loss would  sharply exacerbate the city's affordable-housing crisis.  </P> <P> "The City Council and the mayor have to do something or else we'll be  displacing thousands of people," said Alice Callaghan of the Skid Row Housing  Trust.  </P> <P> If the buildings are condemned, many of the poor residents could end up  homeless.  </P> <P> "We'll pay for it one way or another," said Susan Romeo, co-manager of the  Proposition 3 campaign. "We can save the buildings or we can pay for the  homeless."  </P></p>

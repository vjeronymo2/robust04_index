			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Z.P. Osinchuk, VO (production association </F> ``Ukrgazprom'')]    [Abstract]Like several other countries of Western Europe  Ukraine does not possess sufficient energy sources. However,  unlike the former, the Ukraine meets most of its demand (up to  80% in 1990-1992) by importing gas from only two places )  Russia and Turkmenistan. Ukraine's energy consumption per capita  is around 6.5 tonnes of equivalent fuel. Energy consumption per  $1 of GDP is 4 to 6 times higher than in the USA, Western Europe  and Japan. Natural gas consumption for 2000-2010 is forecast at  70 to 80 billion m[.sup]3[/] a year. The article lists  possible sources that could satisfy the demand more efficient  utilization of Ukraine's gas resources; the use of  nontraditional sources; receiving gas as payment for the use of  Ukraine's gas pipeline system by Russia, Turkmenistan and other  countries; buying gas from the Russian Federation, which makes  economic sense for both Russia and Ukraine; buying natural gas  from Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Algeria, Norway  and Netherlands; and buying liquefied natural gas from Algeria,  Libya, Qatar, Nigeria and other countries. Ukraine could also  use her intellectual and industrial potential and participate in  projects of exploitation of natural gas fields in other  countries and transporting the gas via Ukraine. Diversification  of gas supply sources will create necessary conditions for  reliable and safe functioning of the national economy of  Ukraine.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sum from Vienna] </F>   [Text] With North Korea's positive reaction to the  resumption of inspections, the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] is having contacts with North Korea to smooth the  way for inspections of North Korea, IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer  disclosed on 21 April.    The spokesman, however, declined to disclose whether the  North side's letter hinting of the resumption of inspections  implies additional overall inspections [chuga chonmyon sachal]  of the radiochemical laboratory or the replacement of the  surveillance equipment -- as has been insisted by North Korea.    The IAEA is closely examining to what level North Korea  would accept inspections and the real intention behind its hint  of resumption of inspections.    The IAEA, while delivering the resolution adopted at the  special Governors meeting held last March, had strongly called  on the North side to accept additional inspections of the  radiochemical laboratory and stressed the necessity of replacing  the surveillance equipment, including the reloading of film in  surveillance cameras.</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE!: CLUES TO FAMILY CHURCH AFFILIATION  </P> <P> Americans, being a mixture of national and ethnic groups, differ greatly when  it comes to religion. Knowing the ethnic origins of your families will provide  clues to their likely church affiliation. However, other factors must be  considered when you begin to search for church records.  </P> <P> Where your families lived is important -- and when. For example, if you have an  early New England line, they probably were Congregationalists, Baptists or  Quakers; if you descend from pioneers of the Middle Colonies, your families may  have been Dutch Reformed, Lutheran, Quaker, Presbyterian or Catholic. Possibly  they were Mennonites, Amish, Moravians, Baptists, Methodists or another  Christian denomination. On the other hand, if yours are Deep South roots, your  ancestors may have belonged to the Church of England or Anglican, which was  called Protestant Episcopal after the Revolution, or they could have been  Quakers, Moravians, Baptists, Presbyterian or Methodists.  </P> <P> Most Colonial Dutch families belonged to the Dutch Reformed or were  Anabaptists; Scandinavia and northern Germany ancestors were usually Lutheran  or Reformed Lutheran. Swiss and German families from the Rhineland, Westphalia  and Holstein often were Pietists, Anabaptists, Mennonites, Amish or Moravians.  French ancestors may have been Catholic or Huguenots.  </P> <P> In those denominations that practiced infant baptism (christening) you will  find the full name of the person baptized, his age or date of birth, the place  of birth or christening, names of parents, places of residence and the names  and relationships (sometimes) of witnesses or sponsors. Some church records do  not include birth or baptism entries -- but you may find other information such  as admissions, removals, certificates of membership, communicant lists, lists  of ministers and disciplinary proceedings.  </P> <P> Some church records include marriage records. Special marriage registers were  kept by many churches, but others merely listed marriage information among  other entries in church books. Even if the church records do not include  marriage information, careful reading of church minutes will enable you to  pinpoint an approximate date if you note when Amanda Jones ceases to be  mentioned and John Henderson and his wife, Amanda, are.  </P> <P> Church records also often include information pertaining to death, burials,  funerals and memorials.  </P> <P> Start your search for church records in the microfilmed records of the LDS  (Mormon) Family History Library. This library has the greatest single  collection of church (all denominations) records in the world, and through its  hundreds of branch libraries you may borrow via interlibrary these films.  </P> <P> Determine the likely church of your ancestors. Next, study the history of the  particular locality where they lived. Determine which churches existed at that  time. Most local histories will include information about the early churches  with formation dates of churches in that town or county.  </P> <P> Once you have this information, consult the Locality microfiche at the LDS  Family History Libraries. Check under both "State/Churches" and  "State/County/Churches."  </P></p>

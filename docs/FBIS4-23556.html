			<p>BFN     [Text] Relative calm prevailed in the city of Kuito this  morning. UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola] rebels have scaled down their shelling and attacks  against the martyred city.    Right now, sporadic shelling is in progress. Snipers  continue to shoot at everything. Reliable military sources with  the Bie Provincial Operational Command said this morning's  relative calm was due to rebel forces making arrangements for a  new attack on the city of Kuito over the next few hours.    Meanwhile, famine is beginning to reach alarming  proportions.  The World Food Program, Caritas [International Conference of  Catholic Organizations for Charitable and Social Action], and  the International Red Cross have already distributed their food  stocks to the residents. Although snipers control Kuito's  streets, the residents have left their hideouts in search of  food.    In Malanje, government forces have extended their defensive  areas. Units of the Angolan Armed Forces, National Police, and  Civil Defense are heading to the west of Cambondo, 19 km from  the city of Malanje. UNITA soldiers have suffered heavy losses.  In a press release issued today, the Northeastern Front Command  says combined government forces this morning repelled a group of  the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola intending to  attack (Tocamba) locality. In their hasty retreat, UNITA rebels  abandoned four AKM clips, 209 rounds of ammunition, seven M-69  hand grenades, and one knapsack. UNITA used long-range weapons  in its attack, though no losses were reported.</p>

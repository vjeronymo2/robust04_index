			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram board silent Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms group, remained silent yesterday on possible board changes to meet shareholder criticism following reduced profits and false accounting at a subsidiary. The board met on Monday and was likely to discuss the outcome with NM Rothschild, its merchant bank, and Panmure Gordon, its broker, before making an announcement. The agenda included whether to part company with Mr Stuart Greenwood, finance director. Other issues concerning shareholders are the role of Mr Bill Rooney, effectively both chairman and chief executive, and the slow progress towards appointing non-executive directors.</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Markets: Wellcome shares catch a cold - The Bottom Line THURSDAY was a bad day for John Robb, Wellcome's chief executive. Admittedly, it started well enough as he revealed pre-tax profits for the first six months up 33 per cent - a figure at the top of expectations. Yet the impressive earnings rise was followed by a collapse in his company's shares which fell 72p to 818p. Yesterday, they tumbled a further 25p. Robb confessed he was mystified by the fall. 'I think the figures are pretty damned good given the environment has changed considerably over the last 12 months,' he complained The problem with the results was their composition. Wellcome was touted during its share sale last year as one of the world's fastest growing drugs companies. Analysts were predicting annual growth of 20 per cent. Yet the underlying sales growth in the figures revealed this week was 11 per cent. The rest of the group's 22 per cent sales increase was generated by currency benefits. Analysts were also concerned that the group's margin improvement programme - pushing margins up 3.8 percentage points to 30.5 per cent - had run its course. Robb blamed the slowing growth rate on both the changing healthcare environment and problems in the over-the-counter non-prescription drugs market. Clearly, Wellcome has not proved immune to the slowdown in the world pharmaceuticals market caused by more aggressive government price controls. The annual growth of the global market could slow from 16 per cent during the 1980s to as low as 7 per cent during the 1990s, according to Duncan Moore, drugs analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. Wellcome's underlying growth for prescription medicines fell from 18 per cent for the first half last year to 13 per cent for the same period this year. The group's OTC business - 13 per cent of sales - suffered from a poor cough and cold season and increased competition in the US. Underlying OTC sales fell 7 per cent in the first six months. However, some analysts believe the market's reaction overdone. Wellcome's underlying prescription volume growth may be slowing, but it is not decelerating as much as most other drugs groups, particularly in the US. In the past, the difference in the performance of US drugs stocks was minimal. Those without products to drive volume growth compensated by raising prices. However price rises in the US are now a thing of the past and prices in Europe are tumbling. The industry is splitting into those with volume growth and those without. Wellcome's volume growth remains strong - far above the industry average. Moreover it is unlikely to face discounting pressure in the US. Wellcome enjoys the advantage of not being in highly competitive areas such as antibiotics, cholesterol-lowering treatments and ace-inhibitors (heart drugs). The group generates almost all its prescription business from anti-viral treatments, a therapeutic area which it dominates with 80 per cent of the world market. Robb has set out a strategy for his troubled OTC operations. He believes the business is too small to gain effective access to the supermarket sector or negotiate reasonable advertising rates. Sales are also too dependent on coughs and colds. The group has no intention of spending large sums to buy OTC businesses. 'Acquiring OTC products is unaffordable, unless you're Swiss,' says Robb, a jibe against Roche and Ciba-Geigy which recently bought most of Fisons' OTC businesses. Instead, Robb is negotiating a joint-venture, in which Wellcome may be a junior partner. The deal, which he hopes to conclude before the end of the year, should give the group access to the US, European and Japanese OTC markets. Robb and his company's share price, both already bruised, are likely to suffer a further battering in coming weeks. There is little in Wellcome's performance or prospects to justify such treatment, but sentiment is unlikely to improve before May when the Clinton administration reveals its healthcare reforms.</p>

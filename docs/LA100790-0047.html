			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIDEOS: REEL TOOLS;  </P> <P> HOME-IMPROVEMENT VIDEOS ASSIST THE VIEW-IT-YOURSELFER  </P> <P> Home repair was strictly learn-as-you-go when I was a little girl.  </P> <P> On weekends, my father would get out the tool chest and attack a squeaky door,  leaky faucet or stuck window in what he dubbed a "curse-and-bleed" operation.  </P> <P> That is, the job was not complete until he had split a thumb or dropped  something heavy on his toe, sending him stumbling for the medicine cabinet,  cursing loudly.  </P> <P> When my husband, Larry, and I bought a fixer house in 1983, we thought we were  smarter than old Dad. We acquired a thick stack of home-improvement books, so  we could read about our projects before tackling them. We scrutinized  complicated charts and pondered hundreds of pages of often-confusing text in  our quest for home-repair knowledge.  </P> <P> Despite our efforts, many a curse was uttered, many a Band-Aid needed. Three  years and many mistakes later, the house was finished; the hefty home-repair  manuals now occupy a shelf in our living room bookcase, where they look quite  impressive.  </P> <P> Recently, just as technology took exercise out of the gym and onto the Jane  Fonda tape, a new form of instruction for the would-be do-it-yourselfer has  emerged: the home-improvement video.  </P> <P> Home improvement on video generally resembles home improvement in real life,  with several important differences. On video, almost nobody sweats. They don't  rip or stain their clothes. They don't make mistakes, and their neighbors don't  scream at them for running the electric saw late at night.  </P> <P> Most unrealistically, they never have to go back to the hardware store, and no  one ever pays for anything. Naturally, a certain suspension of disbelief is  necessary to concentrate on the home repairs shown on the tapes.  </P> <P> Will home-improvement videos ever replace the printed word and picture for the  home handyperson? Unlikely. In fact, most of the tapes come with booklets or  books, or at least a disclaimer advising that their video may not demonstrate  everything you need to know.  </P> <P> When Larry and I wanted to learn a new skill, we would hire a professional who  would let us observe and assist. A good how-to video is like having a  professional over to your house, except the video can be rewound and watched  again -- and it doesn't charge another $50 an hour.  </P> <P> Home-improvement videos started to appear in the early 1980s, but most of the  videos on the market today have come out within the last three years. The field  is dominated by two series, both of which have the promotional advantage of  being aired as weekly television shows: The Do-It-Yourself Show and The  Hometime Show.  </P> <P> "We're happy people," said Do-It-Yourself company President Robert Roskins, and  no wonder -- he claims the series is selling 250,000 copies a year at $19.95 a  pop. "Hometime" host Dean Johnson won't reveal sales figures, but says his  series is carried in 6,000 retail outlets, and is doing "real well."  </P> <P> The Do-It-Yourself Show (D-Y-I) and tapes are hosted by professionals Curt  Burbick and Avian Rogers. They are capable, friendly and relaxed on camera.  They also clearly love their work, and their enthusiasm as they build a garage  or knock down a load-bearing wall is downright inspiring.  </P> <P> The 27 episodes available on tape are usually 30 minutes long, and always well  organized, scripted and shot. Larry points out that the show doesn't always  have enough detail for a novice, but for folks who already know their way  around a 4-foot level, these tapes are just the ticket.  </P> <P> The hosts of the "Hometime Show" are former hardware distributor Dean Johnson  and former journalist JoAnne Liebeler. They're not pros, but the show is  scrupulously accurate, with elaborate descriptions and plenty of nice big  close-ups. If you've never hung a picture in your life, this series is for you.  </P> <P> The 36 mostly hourlong tapes are sponsored by Chevrolet. This doesn't mean  there's a Chevy logo at the beginning of each tape, but Dean and JoAnne go to  the hardware store in a Chevy Astro, raving about the van all the way there and  back. Luckily, our VCR has the double-quick fast forward speed.  </P> <P> Video budgets range from shoestring to elaborate, special effects from humble  hand-drawn charts to flashy computer-generated graphics. The Hometime Show has  a more expensive look than the Do-It-Yourself Show.  </P> <P> But dollars alone don't make a good video. As I viewed more than 60 of the  tapes currently on the market, I developed the requisite "Four Reals" -- real  professionals do real repairs on real homes in real big close-up shots.  Generally, the more educational and enjoyable videos provide the Four Reals.  </P> <P> The presence -- or absence -- of "Reals" figures prominently in my notes about  each home-improvement tape reviewed below. The reviews are grouped by type of  repair, and listed alphabetically within each category (not necessarily best  tape first).  </P> <P> I haven't rated the tapes, because what's good for a beginner isn't always good  for a more experienced renovator. There isn't room for all 36 Hometime and 27  Do-It-Yourself episodes, but I've included key examples of each series.  </P> <P> I made Larry watch a number of the tapes, and his comments reflect his  experience as a remodeler and television associate producer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Carpentry  </P> <P> Fine Homebuilding Workshop -- "Basic Stairbuilding," "Installing Doors and  Windows," "Installing Trim," "Making Kitchen Cabinets"  </P> <P> These tapes are the Rolls-Royce of home-improvement video -- thorough, clear  and well-shot. Producer Taunton Press has chosen an expert in each field to  host the tape on their specialty.  </P> <P> Check out "Trim" video host Craig Savage as he makes short work of cope-edged  joints. Or thrill to the workmanship of Scott Schuttner in the elaborate  stair-building video. These tapes have all you need to know, from the basics to  inspiring advanced projects.  </P> <P> Hometime -- "Finish Carpentry"  </P> <P> Dean and JoAnne tackle simple stuff, such as installing a door/jamb assembly  and installing molding for windows, doors, baseboards and ceilings. Then they  spiral off into remodeling fairyland, making their own fireplace mantel,  stairs, banisters, folding double doors and wainscoting. Fascinating to watch,  but don't try this at home.  </P> <P> Increase Video -- "Woodworking"  </P> <P> This tape begins with a lengthy explanation of how to hold a piece of plywood.  Then, without measuring anything, host Bob McKelvey saws many pieces of wood,  while his voice on the sound track intones such sage advice as "Corneal  injuries are not something you can ignore."  </P> <P> Eventually, he assembles a cabinet in the murky darkness of his workshop, while  he talks to an unseen person off camera. Though he seems knowledgeable,  McKelvey just isn't having any fun. Neither did I.  </P> <P> You Can Do It Videos -- "Install a Pre-Hung Door," "Constructing Stud Walls,"  "Principles of Paneling"  </P> <P> Host George Giangrante brings his friend Lou along to show us how to do basic  carpentry projects in these three tapes. George seems to know what he's doing,  but the camera is placed far, far away from the action.  </P> <P> George glues up a piece of plywood, then checks to see if it's level. This is a  prescription for disaster when a novice goes to work. On the positive side,  this series is the only one closed captioned for the hearing impaired.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decks  </P> <P> Better Homes &amp; Gardens  </P> <P> This tape kills my interest with corny dialogue from our actor "couple." She:  "You know, I figure that our new deck will cost less than last summer's  vacation!" He: "You know, that's what I call a bargain." Confusing explanations  of how to build the deck follow.  </P> <P> D-I-Y  </P> <P> Curt and Avian build a simple deck at Avian's house. They cover all the basic  steps -- pier blocks, joists, decking, rails. I liked the fast pace and  real-life situation; Larry felt it skipped over too much.  </P> <P> Hometime  </P> <P> After extensive planning, Dean and JoAnne build a deck from scratch. It's all  here, in glorious close-ups. They even show how to build the joists. The tape  is full of great tips, such as which side of the lumber goes up, and the 3-4-5  measuring shortcut. They tackle a two-level deck with a cantilevered section,  and lay diagonal deck planks -- a little ambitious for the average homeowner. I  found the tape a bit plodding, but Larry liked the detailed explanations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drywall  </P> <P> Best of Wally's Workshop  </P> <P> Former "What's My Line" host Wally Bruner was a pioneer of home-improvement  video, but unfortunately, his 90-minute tapes are long on corn pone and short  on clear instructions. No surprise the 24-tape series is hard to find; I came  across a couple installments at a 20/20 Video store.  </P> <P> Wally and wife Natalie inexplicably dress and act like they're on the set of  "The Wonder Years." Wally does offer some helpful hints -- borrow tools from  your neighbors instead of buying them -- but there are no close-ups as Wally  tries in vain to smooth the joint mud.  </P> <P> D-I-Y  </P> <P> In this thorough tape, our hosts drywall an attic space, including a round  turret! It doesn't get any harder than that. Larry goes crazy when they use  lipstick on the electrical box and then press the drywall up against it, neatly  marking where to cut. "I wish I'd known that," he mutters.  </P> <P> Hometime  </P> <P> Larry put up lots of drywall at our house, and he liked this tape the best.  They don't skip the hard parts, like how to get the seams really smooth. Dean  and JoAnne warn that beginners should stay away from flat ceilings. "Too late,"  moans Larry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Electrical  </P> <P> D-I-Y  </P> <P> The action takes place in an eerie black set, but the content is good, as Avian  and Curt install plugs, switches and light fixtures with lots of close-ups and  explanations. They also add an outlet and add circuits to their fuse box.  </P> <P> Hometime  </P> <P> Dean and JoAnne cover every imaginable basic electrical project in this  65-minute tape. Some of it's over my head, but if you watch long enough, you'll  probably find the exact thing you want to learn. Beware though, they're working  on a set.  </P> <P> "In a real house," as Dean explains, lots of things will be different. And walt  a minute -- they hire a pro to work on their fuse box. Wimps!  </P> <P> Made Easy Series  </P> <P> Our hosts Shelby Grimm and Julie Morgan don't introduce themselves, and we soon  learn why. While strange, throbbing synthesizer music plays in the background,  they explain basic electrical repairs with a "See Spot Run" approach.  </P> <P> "If the light glows, stop," Shelby says. "The current is not off. Go turn it  off." There's no tough stuff, like adding an outlet or roughing-in new  circuits. And there's no way to stay awake.  </P> <P> Ortho Information Series  </P> <P> Our host, Thayer Walker, chats with us in a kitchen, drinks coffee and explains  this series is for "ordinary people, the average homeowner."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the tape is populated not with average homeowners, but with  below-average actors, who have awkward conversations about their lives while  they perform basic home repairs. Why should I believe these drama students are  doing it right? Mercifully, the actors are not credited by sequence, so you  can't tell who was responsible for any particular embarrassing scene.  </P> <P> </P> <P> General Repairs  </P> <P> D-I-Y  </P> <P> This tape covers plumbing, electrical and weatherizing repairs. There's basic  pipe soldering, replacing a cracked tile, fixing squeaky boards, plaster cracks  and other basic home repairs. But the electrical repairs confused me; I don't  think I would understand them without seeing their electrical tape first.  </P> <P> Hometime  </P> <P> Probably the best one-stop tape. Every subject is covered in detail. They don't  just install a switch -- they install one-, three- and even four-way switches.  The same thorough treatment is given to plumbing repairs, stuck windows,  sagging doors, flawed plaster, ripped wallpaper, squeaky floors, and marred  vinyl flooring. Whew!  </P> <P> Reader's Digest Videomanual: Home Repair  </P> <P> A disembodied arm and a headless man perform an exhaustive series of plumbing,  electrical and other general home repairs in this video. You could probably  learn a lot here -- if you could tolerate the "You're-a-moron" explanations.  This one's even boring in fast-forward.  </P> <P> This Old House  </P> <P> Bob Vila's home improvement series is probably the best known, but this tape is  the only episode currently available. I was surprised to find that  home-improvement legend Vila delegates a lot of the work to helpers. The tape  is well shot and scripted, and full of good tips, like putting soap on screws  for easy drilling and the old lipstick trick.  </P> <P> Besides the usual electric and plumbing repairs, we see track lighting  installed, windowpane replacement, a door lock, rain gutters, floor refinishing  and more. A good demo of a brick walkway shows the step we left out -- pouring  sand or stone dust into the bed to prevent grass from sprouting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Home Security  </P> <P> Best of Wally's Workshop  </P> <P> Wally skips lots of steps installing a combination burglar/smoke alarm,  including drilling the holes and threading the wires behind the wall. When  Wally tests it, he can only get the smoke alarm part to work. With wires draped  all over the set, he proudly announces, "This is the solution." "Yeah," Larry  howls, "now you've got wire linguine all over your house."  </P> <P> As a finale, the door lock Wally installed earlier pops open of its own accord  -- and does not trigger the alarm.  </P> <P> Made Easy Series  </P> <P> This silly tape doesn't have a single installation. They talk about storm  windows, window locks, home safes, caulking, duct wraps -- but hey, how do we  put them in?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Kitchen Remodel  </P> <P> D-I-Y  </P> <P> In this ambitious tape, our hosts destroy an old kitchen, then reframe the  walls for new French doors, knock down a load-bearing wall, install new  cabinets, and it all comes out looking great. Nothing may be too hard for them,  but this is way beyond the average do-it-yourselfer's abilities. Sure is  inspiring to watch though.  </P> <P> Ortho Information Series  </P> <P> The bad actors in this tape don't even bother to do many repairs. In one  sequence, two men discuss but do not actually replace a sink. This tape does  have the only demonstration I found of installing a greenhouse window.  Unfortunately, a good deal of time is wasted while "Dad" explains to "Son" how  much "Mom" is going to like her new window.  </P> <P> In another section, a young couple lay out their new vinyl flooring on the  driveway to measure it -- a great way to embed little pebbles in the backing,  ruining the installation. "Is the flooring square?" she asks. He replies with  the do-it-yourselfer's famous last words: "Looks square to me."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Paint and Wallpaper  </P> <P> Better Homes &amp; Gardens -- "Wallpaper Like A Pro"  </P> <P> Our expert Leonardo Torrente is affable and knows what he's doing. His  preparation is great, but once he starts hanging wallpaper, problems emerge.  Demonstrations of how to trim around windows are badly shot, and the continuity  is confusing -- first he's working toward the right, then suddenly he's moving  to the left. He puts the first piece on a new wall and then checks to see if  it's plumb -- sure disaster for a beginner.  </P> <P> D-I-Y -- "Interior Paint &amp; Wallpaper"  </P> <P> This tape covers the basics well, but it's vexing when Avian paints a ceiling  without getting little bits of paint on her face.  </P> <P> Great Living Series -- "Paint Like a Professional"  </P> <P> The disembodied arm returns in this for-beginners-only tape. The arm turns into  a whole guy later, but we never learn who he is. This tape does attempt to  settle the raging painter's controversy -- should you punch holes in the paint  can rim or not? (If you do, the paint drips back into the can and keeps the lid  from sticking. But the holes can let air in, causing the paint to harden. Their  advice: Don't do it.)  </P> <P> Hometime -- "Interior Paint &amp; Wallpaper"  </P> <P> This solid tape covers both paint and wallpaper. Good preparation, "cutting in"  and a good wallpaper demonstration of trimming around a door. There's an  interesting section on stenciling -- a simple way to brighten up a room.  </P> <P> Increase Video -- "Professional Tips for Easy Wallpapering"  </P> <P> In this 56-minute video, nervous Nancy Mitchell, a wallpapering professional,  demonstrates the easy parts of how to hang wallpaper. After a long, dull  explanation of what kind of paper and tools to use, she puts her first piece of  paper up in the middle of a wall. As we approach a window, she puts up one  piece, then presto! In the next shot, we're past the window.  </P> <P> Made Easy Series -- "Paint &amp; Paper"  </P> <P> This tape is a real cheater -- they paint a white ceiling white again. "Cutting  in" paint, masking windows and wallpapering around doors all happen off camera.  Their demonstration of sizing a wall is a close-up of the sizing can.  </P> <P> U-Do-It-Yourself -- "Wallpaper"  </P> <P> Producer Bruce Lamb brags "We think we've got the best do-it-yourself wallpaper  tape on the market" at the beginning of this tape. While the program does  demonstrate solutions to many wallpaper challenges, including doors, a casement  window, an archway and a soffit, host Larry Camp has trouble thinking like a  beginner. Pasting the wallpaper before cutting it is fine for a pro, but it's  going to be a big mess when we try it at home.  </P> <P> View-and-Do Videos -- "Paperhanging"  </P> <P> This new video is a stultifying 117-minute epic. Professional Harry Davies,  "wife and paperhanger" Louise and daughter Karrin are all stiff as 2-by-4s as  they try to explain how to hang wallpaper.  </P> <P> The script is confusing and redundant: "Before you can prevent that from  happening," Harry says, "you should know what causes it to happen." He explains  further by pointing to an incomprehensible chart.  </P> <P> Larry says, "This guy makes you want to call a professional!"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plumbing  </P> <P> D-I-Y  </P> <P> Curt and Avian start big, laying the plumbing for a whole house. But they're  not in a real house -- it's that strange black set, with a few wall studs and  no plaster. They make it look easy, but am I going to plumb my whole house? I  think not. Later, they focus on repairs. Like many tapes, they demonstrate how  to fix a toilet with a cutaway tank. I know it's hard to see in, but it still  seems like a cheat.  </P> <P> Fix-It Series  </P> <P> The disclaimer at the front of this tape says producer Morris Video "is not  claiming persons presented to be experts, nor do we endorse them or necessarily  agree with them." Gee, thanks for the vote of confidence.  </P> <P> Host and apparent non-expert Jerry Jones does a number of plumbing repairs  without ever setting foot in a kitchen or bathroom. Faucets are mounted on  little red-and-yellow boxes. He changes a shower head while holding the whole  assembly in his hand. I think it's easy that way, Jerry, but what about when  it's attached to a ceramic-tile wall?  </P> <P> Hometime  </P> <P> The best part of this tape is when computer graphics pop in to show you where  the toilet and shower will be. Repairs are well covered, but the big "rough in"  plumbing job is too confusing to follow. "We cut this pipe to the right  length," Dean explains. But how do I know what that is?  </P> <P> Made Easy Series  </P> <P> In this tape, hosts Shelby Grimm and Julie Morgan dismantle many different  plumbing fixtures, but reassemble almost none of them. They use a toilet  diagram so silly that I now understand why most tapes use the cut-away tank. At  the end of a typical repair, Julie chirps, "Now reassemble the faucet. It  shouldn't leak."  </P> <P> Larry laughed until he cried at that one.  </P> <P> Ortho Information Series  </P> <P> This tape wastes a lot of time on awkward chitchat and features stiff, stiff  actors doing home repairs. There's one informative segment, when two lovable  nerd-types fix the plumbing at their vacation home. Between the garish video  lighting and the silly scripts, this series plays like a bad soap opera. (All  My Home Repairs?)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Siding  </P> <P> Build Your Own Series -- "Reside Your House"  </P> <P> This tape is sponsored by the American Plywood Assn. Since the tape covers only  plywood, and 90% of siding is redwood or cedar, what we learn here is of  limited use. Safety is slipshod as well.  </P> <P> Hometime -- "Siding"  </P> <P> This tape features a good planning section and a good tip -- varnish the wood  before you install it. Covers plywood panels, cedar shakes, and it offers a  book bibliography in the accompanying "Project Guide" booklet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tile/Glass Block  </P> <P> D-I-Y -- "Ceramic Tile: Floors &amp; Counters"  </P> <P> I watched the tile tapes with great interest, because we hired a contractor to  tile our entry, and he messed up the job. After seeing how simple it is, I'm  sorry we didn't do it ourselves. This tape has good coverage of the basics, but  they don't tile a wall.  </P> <P> Fine Homebuilding Video Workshop -- "Tiling Walls/Floors/Countertops"  </P> <P> These three tapes are a tile-setting extravaganza! Host Michael Byrne doesn't  just slap down some tile -- he uses careful planning to create the best layout,  including a graceful curved section where two walls join.  </P> <P> Byrne starts from scratch, installing several types of underlayment. He even  demonstrates how to create a sloped shower floor. "You just can't get results  like this out of a box," he notes. No kidding. The thinking man's tile tapes.  </P> <P> Hometime -- "Ceramic Tile"  </P> <P> This tape explains why the tile in our house is coming up -- it didn't have the  cement-like underlayment that keeps the surface rigid. They work in a variety  of real situations, and even replace a broken tile. I love it when they do it  wrong, and rechalk their lines.  </P> <P> U-Do-It-Yourself -- "Glass Block"  </P> <P> This is the only tape I found on installing glass block; luckily, it's quite  serviceable. Producer/host Bruce Lamb is a little stiff, but his preparation is  very thorough, with good advice on planning ahead to avoid problems. He  actually adjusts a course of blocks to make them level, just like a real  person. The script could use some streamlining, but he tells you what you need  to know in a compact 30-minute tape.  </P> <P> U-Tile-It-Yourself -- "Walls/ Floors/Counters"  </P> <P> Bruce Lamb has three tiling tapes to address each specific job. He demonstrates  tiling an outdoor patio, then tiles over linoleum flooring in a kitchen. Each  tape starts with a thorough demonstration of tools and good tile-cutting and  planning tips. The pounding synthesizer music is a little weird, but Lamb makes  the jobs look easy.  </P> <P> I do get confused when Lamb shows how to create a sink surface for tiling, but  once he's done, there's good advice on how to work with non-square walls. Lamb  uses real house situations, and doesn't skip the hard parts, like cutting tiles  to fit around shower pipes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wood Floors  </P> <P> Fine Homebuilding Workshop -- "Sanding &amp; Finishing Hardwood Floors"  </P> <P> This tape is the most disappointing of the series -- they finish a new floor,  so it's hard to see the difference. Host Don Bollinger does create some gouges,  and then shows you how to fix them. A most useful demonstration for amateurs to  see.  </P> <P> Hometime -- "Wood Flooring"  </P> <P> Larry writhes at the thought of beginners gouging their wood floors, but I  found this tape inspiring. Our hosts refinish a battered old floor from start  to finish, and they don't shy away from the tough parts, like sanding under the  radiator. The floor looks ravishing when they're finished. They don't show any  floor repairs though.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Special Projects  </P> <P> Build Your Own Series -- "Store-It-All Barn"  </P> <P> Host Don Vandervort starts with an in-depth review of how plywood is made. You  guessed it, it's another tape sponsored by the American Plywood Assn. My review  copy came brand new in the cellophane, but had audio problems and fuzzy  picture. What I could make out of Vandervort didn't make a lot of sense. He  puts the barn together pretty neatly, but I don't think I could do it.  </P> <P> D-I-Y -- "Garages"  </P> <P> Have you been wanting to build a garage from scratch? Then this tape is for  you. This special one-hour episode epitomizes our hosts philosophy -- almost  nothing is beyond the abilities of a determined do-it-yourselfer.  </P> <P> They do break down and hire a contractor to pour their concrete slab and put up  the garage door. Curt and Avian divide the job into simple steps -- roof,  walls, windows, doors, electrical -- and then, they do it all. Amazing, but  beyond most remodelers' abilities.  </P> <P> Hometime -- "Three-Season Porch"  </P> <P> This tape is also quite impressive, but far beyond the skills of most  remodelers. Interesting camera work is used in a wonderful dream sequence where  Dean agonizes over having ordered the roof trusses in the wrong size. When he  wakes up, of course, he solves the problem. The planning is extensive, the  explanations are expansive, and I'm sure the project is very expensive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Give Up?  </P> <P> Hometime -- "Contracting a Home"  </P> <P> Has all this talk of doing it yourself made you want to melt down your tool  chest? Then consider this option: Don't do it yourself, but save money by  becoming your own general contractor.  </P> <P> This staggering 10-part, two-tape miniseries is the "Gone With The Wind" of the  do- it-yourself genre. We learn how to choose a site, read plans, get permits,  find subcontractors, schedule (ha! ha!) -- all the steps you need to take your  house from idea to move-in condition.  </P> <P> You would think after viewing all these home-improvement videos, I could fix  anything. But there's one drawback to learning from a video -- you have to find  one that demonstrates your exact repair. And after watching more than 60 tapes,  I didn't see a single one that shows this plumbing problem: When we turn on our  bathroom sink's cold tap, it slowly turns itself off. The cursing and bleeding  continues.MICHAEL EDWARDS / Los Angeles TimesPhoto styling by TRACY CROWE / Los  Angeles Times  </P></p>

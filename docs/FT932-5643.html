			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Spanish Elections: Poll could turn spotlight on Juan Carlos  -Hung parliament would hand the king a tricky role IF Spain's 30m voters next Sunday elect the hung parliament suggested by opinion polls, King Juan Carlos will face the most delicate task of his 18-year reign as a constitutional monarch. He will be required to fine tune his political instincts in order to choose a candidate for prime minister capable of gaining a majority in parliament. It is a role that Belgium's King Baudouin has often been called upon to play but in Juan Carlos' Spain it is quite novel. Under Spain's constitution, the monarch must consult the leaders of the political parties following a general election and ask one of them to form a government. The selected politician must then win the endorsement of parliament, through what is called the investiture debate. In the five elections that have taken place since democracy was restored following General Franco's death in 1975, voters returned a clear governing majority and made the monarch's task a mere formality. 'This time the king's consultations will really have a purpose,' Mr Miguel Herrero de Minon, a constitutional expert who helped frame the constitution, said yesterday. If the election does produce a hung parliament, it could take at least six weeks for a prime minister and a new government to emerge. For a start, the monarch cannot begin to sound out political leaders and assess the new balance of power until the 350-member parliament elects its speaker on June 29 when it first meets. The constitution says the monarch can only summon politicians to the royal palace by issuing invitations through the speaker. This time gap is to allow for recounts in contested seats. The vote for speaker should indicate what political alliances the parliamentary parties can be expected to forge in the subsequent investiture vote to endorse the king's candidate for prime minister. At present the investiture vote is tentatively scheduled to take place in mid-July, One snag could be that the parties might be unable to agree immediately on a speaker, a development which could further delay the emergence of a government. The monarch is not obliged by the constitution to nominate the leader of the parliamentary party that has won the most seats in parliament. The purpose of his consultations with the politicians will be to choose which of them will be most likely to pass the investiture hurdle and lead a strong coalition government. The closer the vote on Sunday, the more lengthy the consultations are expected to be. On the basis of the opinion polls the two majority parties, the Socialist and the centre-right People's Party, will be so far short of a working majority that they will need the support of at least two minority parties to form a government. The potential partners for either are the Catalan and the Basque nationalists, but it will, in all likelihood, be up to the king to broker such an implicit or explicit coalition. Should Juan Carlos's initial candidate fail to be endorsed in the investiture debate next month, the constitution lays down a new round of consultations and the nomination of a second candidate. There is no limit to the number of candidates the king can propose, nor does he, according to strict letter of the constitution, have to nominate an elected member of parliament. In the event of a deadlock, Juan Carlos can in theory nominate an independent candidate, much in the manner that Italy's President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro invited Mr Carlo Ciampi, the former governor of the central bank, to form a government. However, unlike Italy's constitution, Spain's has a built-in safeguard to a prolonged parliamentary paralysis. After the parliamentary vote to elect Juan Carlos's candidate, the constitutional clock starts ticking. Should the new legislature fail to elect a new prime minister within two months, it is automatically dissolved and new elections will have to be held not later than two months later.</p>

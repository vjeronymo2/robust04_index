			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: QUIBBLES &amp; BITS  </P> <P> . . . Showtime is touting "Homeboy," the Mickey Rourke boxing picture that was  never released theatrically, as a "Showtime original movie exclusive" (due in  May). It's been out on IVE home video since last fall.  </P> <P> . . . Shane ("Lethal Weapon") Black's latest script, "The Last Boy Scout," is  reportedly the subject of a studio bidding war. But will that title last? A  spokesman for the Boy Scouts of America says "there would be a problem" with  the commercial appropriation of the group's name, and that the organization  would be "looking into it."  </P> <P> . . . Premiere magazine reports that David Seltzer's script for this summer's  "Bird on a Wire" has 10 references to star Mel Gibson's now-legendary  posterior. At least one survived rewrites -- it's in the current trailer.  </P></p>

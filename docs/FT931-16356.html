			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Air raid Airtours has established a reputation as a highly efficient tour operator which has successfully developed its business by means of solid, organic growth. So it seems odd the company should depart so sharply from past practice by launching a large hostile bid. The argument is that acquisition of Owners Abroad would represent an unrepeatable leap in Airtours' development. It would double Airtours' market share, provide a geographical fit and yield substantial economies of scale. Coincidentally or not, it would also forestall the emergence of a formidable adversary by wrecking the proposed alliance between Owners and the German LTU Group. But despite the obvious attractions, it is easy to see why the market wobbled when considering the implications of the bid. Airtours is offering only 10 times Owners' earnings and will probably have to raise its offer to succeed, increasing the financial risks. If the bid succeeds, the aspiring upstart can also expect to fly into considerable turbulence created by Thomson. The industry leader's habit of launching aggressive price wars to defend its market share would hit the expanded Airtours at a particularly sensitive time. There is also the ticklish question of the competition authorities. They may conclude that two strong competitors would benefit consumers. Equally, they may balk at Thomson and Airtours controlling 60 per cent of the market. In short, the deal represents a big, if calculated, gamble in a sector notably harsh on losers. Airtours still has some convincing to do that it has correctly calculated the odds.</p>

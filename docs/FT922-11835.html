			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Ex-Soviet states must 'learn frombold E Europe' THE countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union could face a further economic downturn as they cope with the transition to a market economy and the disruption of their traditional trading relations with each other, the International Monetary Fund warns. Output in the two regions has dropped by an estimated 20 per cent in the last two years, the IMF says in its latest World Economic Outlook. In some countries this has fallen by as much as 35 per cent. While the Outlook says this contraction is not surprising, given the extent of the economic transformation undertaken in the regions, the extent of the drop has been greater than expected. The decline appears to have begun to bottom out in some countries but further output losses may yet be in store, especially in the republics of the former Soviet Union, where the process of economic reform has barely started. 'Compared with the eastern European countries, the starting point of the republics of the former USSR is much less favourable,' the IMF says. While Russia introduced an economic reform programme in February, most of the other republics have yet to elaborate a comprehensive strategy, it notes. The Fund argues that the republics should learn from the eastern European experience the need for 'bold and comprehensive reform so as to put in place all the main elements of a free-market system from the outset'. Output over the last two years appears to have varied widely between different republics, with Georgia and Armenia suffering the sharpest contractions as a result of the earthquake in 1990 and the blockade by Azerbaijan in 1991. In Russia, the largest republic, the IMF estimates that real gross domestic product fell 9 per cent last year after growing a scant 0.4 per cent in 1990. In Ukraine, net material product may have dropped by 9.6 per cent in 1991 after a decline of 3.4 per cent a year earlier. Based on official estimates, however, output may have fallen only slightly or not at all in 1991 in Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. All the republics share the problem of inflation. The IMF warns that credit control is effectively non-existent in many republics as real interest rates remain strongly negative and governments and state-controlled enterprises continue to enjoy virtually unlimited access to credit from central banks. The breakdown of monetary control has further eroded the role of the rouble as a medium of exchange in the former Soviet Union, leading to an increase in barter deals between republics. It is unclear whether other republics have established the conditions necessary for setting up separate currencies. 'At least in the short run, maintaining the rouble for some, if not all, of the republics could help safeguard a common economic space and avert a further decline in inter-republic trade.' Some republics, the report warns, are vulnerable to the trade shock that can be expected as energy prices are liberalised and rise to world market levels. Only Azerbaijan, Russia and Turkmenistan have positive balances in energy trade with the other republics. The damage caused to the economies of east Europe by the collapse in intra-regional trade underlines the importance of safeguarding trading links between republics of the former Soviet Union. The IMF has agreed membership terms with Azerbaijan, the last former Soviet republic to complete negotiations to join the organisation. THE republics of the former Soviet Union have been warned to take urgent action to stop the flight of capital, which is draining away foreign exchange badly needed to make debt repayments and finance investment, writes George Graham. The IMF warned yesterday that the role of the rouble within the former Soviet Union had been rapidly eroded, and that the currency system was distorted by multiple exchange rates, varying with differing transaction. Enterprises have been driven to keep their foreign exchange earnings outside the country, to avoid surrendering them at highly overvalued exchange rates, the Fund says. This aggravates the shortage. Mr Horst Schulman, managing director of the Institute of International Finance, yesterday estimated capital flight from the former Soviet Union at about Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.6bn) last year, and said foreign exchange was probably still leaving at a rate exceeding Dollars 1bn a month.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Summit seeks to speed Gatt trade accord A COMMONWEALTH ministerial mission will visit Paris, Washington, London and other capitals to stress the 'urgent need' for a successful end to the Uruguay round of trade talks by mid December this year, it was announced here last night. The mission will call on 'key participants' in the negotiations for a new General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade and 'urge them to negotiate positively and flexibly to reach final agreement', said a statement issued by heads of government at the end of day two of their five-day summit. The Uruguay round has emerged as the main issue, with Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister and Mr John Major, his British counterpart, playing leading roles. Both men have argued that the fact that the Commonwealth should have a special voice in trade negotiations since it includes members of the Cairns group and countries with francophone affiliations such as Mauritius and Canada, as well as straddling the developed and developing world. 'After seven years of effort, now is the time to secure the benefits of a successful Round package,' said the statement. December 15, 1993 must be seen as the final deadline. It went on to call on the US, Canada, the EC and Japan - the so-called Quad countries, which agreed on a tariff reduction package in Tokyo last July - to 'build urgently on the commitments they made, to secure a substantial market access package in which all can participate'. It continued: 'Given the importance of agriculture to both developing and developed countries, we emphasise the need for an outcome which liberalises market access and reduces domestic support and export subsidies in accordance with the Draft Final Act, as modified by the Blair House Accord.' Earlier in the day Mr Keating had resumed his campaign for action by the Commonwealth. With a disregard for convention, Mr Keating has made the running during the first 48 hours of the five-day conference of Commonwealth heads of government. In doing so he has taken up the role of champion of developing country interests, and upstaged the British prime minister, Mr John Major. Although Mr Major has himself made a strong plea for an early agreement, and spoken forcefully on the need for rapid implementation of Trinidad terms for debt relief, he has not had the same impact on the 50-member association, or enjoyed the same publicity. At a press conference last night, Mr Major said 'It is not just an economic and political question. I think there is a moral imperative to get an agreement.' Yesterday Mr Keating followed up his implicit attack on France, made in his speech at Thursday's public opening. Speaking during a closed door session yesterday, but taking care to ensure wide and early distribution of his address, Mr Keating told delegates: 'It is time for the Commonwealth to say clearly to the world that the Uruguay round must be concluded this year. We have an opportunity to put the Commonwealth's name to a separate statement calling on all the participants in the negotiations to show good faith and stop using their self-interested concerns as an excuse for a delay.' Earlier in the day Mr Keating had what his officials described as a friendly meeting with Queen Elizabeth. Mr Keating has been at pains to reassure fellow leaders that Australia's intended move to republican status would not weaken Commonwealth ties. Ms Benazir Bhutto, newly re-elected prime minister of Pakistan, arrived in Cyprus in time to take part in yesterday's dicussions.</p>

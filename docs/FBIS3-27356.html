			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guangdong has again squeaked through -- but at a  price. In spite of the cold wind from the north over the need to  march in step with Beijing -- and competition posed by Shanghai,  Pudong and myriad upstarts -- Hong Kong's favourite province  looks set to preserve what American economics guru Ezra Vogel  calls its No. 1 status. In return for a relatively free hand to  experiment with quasi-capitalistic market tools, however,  Guangzhou has to make concessions to the cadre mandarins in the  capital in economic, and particularly, political matters.    At the current Guangdong People's Congress, provincial  leaders have unveiled a growth target for this year of 15 per  cent, well above the national average of nine per cent. Local  economists say this is an underestimation aimed at allaying  Beijing's fears for hyperinflation and runaway capital  construction. Individual cities, however, have openly vowed to  maintain if not better their fantastic development clips of  1993. These range from 23 per cent for Guangzhou and an  incredible 96.9 per cent for Huadu, where the new Guangzhou  International Airport would be located.    Equally important, Guangdong leaders have obliged Beijing to  tone down tax policies -- mainly the "dual tax system" and the  Value-Added Tax (VAT) -- aimed at boosting contributions to  central coffers. When the fiscal reforms were promulgated late  last year, Beijing was unequivocal about the fact they would be  implemented on January 1, and that provincial authorities would  have no autonomy to make local variations. In a briefing to a  group of Hong Kong editors last weekend, however, Guangzhou  mayor Li Ziliu hinted that Beijing had vouchsafed the province a  "stable transition" of at least two years from the original  "financial contract responsibility system" (FCRS) to the dual  tax system. Under the old regime, Guangdong made a mutually  agreed-upon contribution to Beijing, which took into  consideration its need to retain more of its profits for  re-investment. The new system, which will carve out tax bases  for the centre and the localities, will give Guangdong no such  edge. Mr Li claimed that the synthesis between the FCRS and the  new tax regime will result in both central and local coffers  getting more.    Guangdong officials have also assured Hong Kong and other  overseas developers that, Beijing's strictures notwithstanding,  there will be subtle regional variations to the VAT to be  imposed on property deals. Mayor Li had this to say about the  much-feared VAT on real estate: "Guangzhou will take into  account practical realities and pay attention to dovetailing the  new taxes with the old ones with a view to safeguarding the  interests of investors." Translation: Guangdong officials will  ally themselves with foreign investors in lobbying Beijing to  acquiesce in modifications that will benefit all parties.    In spite of Beijing's recent emphasis on "boosting  macro-level adjustment and control," Guangdong has made new  strides in quasi-privatisation. Last year, exports from  enterprises with foreign participation overtook those from state  concerns. Mayor Li disclosed that all government-owned business  units in his city will be converted into "Western-style"  corporations within two years. Most of Guangzhou's money-losing  state enterprises, which have assets amounting to 8 billion  yuan, will be overhauled through means including their  conversion into shareholding companies where workers and  overseas investors can hold large stakes.    With its aggressive strategies of attracting foreign funds  to  hitherto taboo areas including airport construction, Guangdong's  lead over the rest of country in the creative utilisation of  non-Chinese capital is widening. Perhaps most important to the  long-term prosperity of the "before-the-times" province,  Guangdong has undertaken a number of relatively sensitive  political reforms. For example, the legislative session this  week is open to a record number of citizens, including the  bosses of private businesses. The congress is also set to pass  a landmark Law of Supervision that will vest powers in the  provincial and municipal legislatures to "oversee and supervise"  the work of the government, the courts and the procuratorates.  For the first time, the congresses can summon officials to  explain policies or account for dereliction of duty. Guangdong  is also a pace-setter in the fight against graft. A number of  cities have established anti-corruption or clean-government  organs that are partially modelled on Hong Kong's Independent  Commission Against Corruption.    Pronouncements by provincial leaders this past week have  also  made it clear, however, that Guangzhou has made major  accommodations with Beijing. In deference to Beijing's revival  of the old ideal of "taking grain as the key link", Guangdong  will follow the national trend by laying down specific targets  for the production of rice and wheat. To preserve arable land,  the area of new industrial development will be cut by at least  10 per cent this year. Investment in agriculture will also  increase substantially.    It is unlikely Guangzhou can succeed in persuading Beijing  to  let it assume overall responsibility for "national-level"  projects like the new airport. Beijing has foisted more serious  political baggage on Guangdong with the imperative of building  "spiritual civilisation," a tattered euphemism for strengthening  one-party dictatorship and weeding out "all-out Westernisation".  In his report to the congress, Governor Zhu Senlin toed the  harsh line by reiterating the "firm with both hands" policy  meaning that political control will be boosted in tandem with  economic liberalisation.    Largely following Beijing's initiative, ideological police  in  the province have since late last year launched a ruthless  crackdown on a dozen-odd publications for propagating "bourgeois  liberalisation". Reports in the Hong Kong and Taiwan press said  that punishments had been meted out to the media including the  Nanfang Weekend [NANFANG ZHOUMO SUPPLEMENT of NANFANG RIBAO],  Tourism Trend, Hope, Culture Square, the Dongfang Evening News  [DONGFANG WANBAO], the Star [English-language newspaper  published in Shanghai], the Guangdong-Hong Kong Information  Daily [YUEGANG XINXI BAO] and the Guangzhou Youth Paper. The  new war against "Western spiritual pollution" contradicts not  only the nascent spirit of political reform but also Guangzhou's  commitment to integrate its economy with the capitalistic world.</p>

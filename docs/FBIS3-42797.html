			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Bardin: "The Customs Procedures of </F> Disarmament: The Trilateral Uranium Deal May Yield the Expected  Profits"]    [Text] The Decree "On Exempting From Customs Duties  Goods Moved Across the Customs Border of the Russian Federation  in Keeping With International Agreements in the Disarmament  Area," signed by Viktor Chernomyrdin and reported by KOMMERSANT  yesterday, provides another example of Russia's international  obligations (including those related to disarmament) being able  to modify the domestic regimen of foreign trade regulation.    According to the official version of the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, this decree primarily accommodates a package of  Russian-American agreements related to reductions in strategic  offensive weapons, envisioning, in particular, the provision of  technical assistance to Russia in the area of disarmament.  Products and transportation vehicles classified as free  technical assistance or as those imported or exported  temporarily are exempt not only from customs duties and fees but  also from licensing.    However, this precedent may very well be built on in a quite  unexpected manner. In principle, nothing stands in the way of  extending the changes in the regimen of tariff and nontariff  regulation of foreign trade to the trilateral  Russian-Ukrainian-American agreement on Ukrainian missiles which  was signed in Moscow during Bill Clinton's recent visit.    The essence of the agreement of the three presidents is  as follows: Ukraine will ship to Russia the warheads of its  missiles; in turn, Russia will deliver to Ukraine nuclear fuel  for atomic power stations; the United States, which controls 50  percent of the world uranium market, will expand opportunities  for uranium exports from Russia; foreign exchange proceeds from  the latter will be split between Russia and Ukraine by way of  compensation for their disarmament outlays.    The trilateral agreement opens the American uranium market  to  Russian exports for 20 years. The United States will withdraw  its traditional charges of dumping. The liberalization of  foreign trade transactions related to disarmament could  contribute to the situation where counting on obtaining $12  billion from uranium exports is justified.    Ukraine has not been wronged, either. It counts on receiving  its share of foreign exchange proceeds, which is estimated to  come to $1 billion. Besides, Kiev hopes that pliancy on the  issue of START 1 may yield Ukraine another $1.5 billion in  credit from the IMF and $700 million from the World Bank. The  United States, having bolstered its shaken authority as  peacemaker, will also receive quite palpable economic results,  acting as an intermediary element in the subsequent resale of  the Russian-Ukrainian uranium.    At first sight, the cancellation of the licensing of trade  within the framework of disarmament, which is envisioned by the  government decree, does not in any way fit this broad version.  However, the issue is easy to resolve. Russia has already  assumed international obligations in the area of  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and has joined the  international regimen for controlling the exports of relevant  materials and technologies within the framework of the so-called  English Club, to which 26 country-suppliers of nuclear  technology belong. Since compliance with international  obligations enjoys priority, the cancellation of licensing does  not apply to uranium, whose exports from Russia are controlled  by the Ministry of Atomic Energy. The preservation of export  control is undoubtedly in the interests of all participants in  the trilateral agreement.    [begin box]  <H5>  Withdrawal of Nuclear Weapons From Ukraine to Russia </H5>   --Ukraine has agreed to transfer to Russia no fewer than 200  warheads from the SS-19 and SS-24 missiles within 10 months.  Ukraine has 130 and 46 of these missiles, respectively. During  the same period of time, all intercontinental missiles located  in Ukraine will be deactivated.    --Ukraine has undertaken to achieve complete nonnuclear  status within seven years (as provided by START 1).

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MONKEYS SHINE;  </P> <P> TRAINED SIMIANS EXCEL AT PERFORMING BASIC TASKS FOR HANDICAPPED  </P> <P> For the last 10 years, capuchin monkeys, chosen for their small size and  ability to perform simple tasks, have been working as helping hands for  disabled people. But a Boston-based organization that matches monkeys with  handicapped people is losing its government financing this year and now must  turn to corporations and individuals for donations to continue the work.  </P> <P> Robert Foster's life changed forever one rainy day 14 years ago while driving  to an auto parts store. He was traveling no more than 30 m.p.h. when he lost  control of his car and hit a tree.  </P> <P> His spinal cord was irreparably bruised and Foster woke up in his hospital bed  a quadriplegic.  </P> <P> After several years in rehabilitation, Foster moved into a one-bedroom  apartment. He was alone and nearly helpless all day, except for an hour or so  in the morning and evening when a personal attendant came to bathe and feed  him.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Phone Call Changed His Life  </P> <P> Shortly after watching a television show about the possible use of monkeys to  aid quadriplegics, Foster made a phone call that changed his life again.  </P> <P> He got in touch with Mary Jo Willard, a former research assistant to  behaviorist B.F. Skinner.  </P> <P> Willard, now the director of the Boston-based organization Helping Hands:  Simian Aides for the Disabled, first thought of matching monkeys with the  handicapped after visiting a quadriplegic in the hospital and discovering how  many small tasks he was unable to perform.  </P> <P> Within weeks, Foster, now 32, was made a guinea pig in Willard's fledgling  program. He was matched with a capuchin monkey named Hellion, who was trained  on the job and often lived up to her name. After several rocky years, Foster  and Hellion are now such a team that Foster's mother refers to the monkey as  her "granddaughter."  </P> <P> "She can work for me, she's a friend and she's good at breaking down the  barriers between people in wheelchairs and people walking around," Foster says.  </P> <P> Since 1979, capuchin monkeys, chosen for their small size and ability to  perform simple tasks, have been placed with 15 quadriplegics around the  country. The monkeys are bred at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla.  </P> <P> "She's instant help," says Mitch Kaufman, 34, of Portland, Ore., who has a  6-year-old monkey, Peepers.  </P> <P> Kaufman, who was injured in a car accident on his 30th birthday, says Peepers  does most of the tasks he once had to wait hours for attendants to perform.  </P> <P> "I can just let her loose," he says. "And she's sort of like a friend but  really funny. She's somebody there that wasn't there before. She kind of fills  up a space."  </P> <P> The program is designed to provide more than just technical help for the  handicapped. The monkeys placed with quadriplegics often become like family,  allowing quadriplegics to care for someone else instead of always being the  victims, Willard says.  </P> <P> "The quality of their lives is so enriched," says Willard, who financed the  program herself for the first two years while working a part-time job. "It's  wonderful to see such severely disabled people get so happy and excited about  something."  </P> <P> 'Helping Hands" also involves foster homes around the country where young  monkeys live for their first several years to grow accustomed to a home  environment. They are then returned to Boston for training and placement. More  than 80 young monkeys are currently with foster families, but the waiting list  for monkeys numbers in the hundreds, Willard says.  </P> <P> Mary Ann Feller of Silverton, Ore., has taken care of Kris, a nearly 4-year-old  monkey, for three years. She and her family are preparing to return Kris to  Boston within the next few months.  </P> <P> "I think it'll be real traumatic," Feller says. "They become such a part of  your life. But we knew it was short term. That's why you raise them, knowing  they will eventually leave to help quadriplegics. It's like raising guide dogs.  You have to think in that way or else you mourn and weep when they're gone."  </P> <P> Willard's idea, which later became a favorite topic for television talk shows  and news magazines and even the inspiration for the horror movie  "Monkeyshines," almost never came to fruition. She was turned down by 38  agencies over two years.  </P> <P> "It was enormously discouraging," Willard says. "People just thought it would  fail and they would be embarrassed by it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Press Stirred Interest  </P> <P> Willard was about to give up when a reporter for a medical journal spotted a  paper she had written about her program. The journal ran a story on the program  and other press coverage followed. Soon, Willard says, the agencies that had  rejected the idea saw it as more viable.  </P> <P> Since then, the difference the monkeys have made in the lives of the severely  handicapped has been enormous.  </P> <P> Foster remembers well what it was like before Hellion moved into his neat,  one-bedroom apartment in a complex for the elderly in Watertown, just outside  Boston. He has no mobility below his upper shoulders and uses a mouth stick to  operate his motorized wheelchair.  </P> <P> Hellion feeds Foster snacks left by an attendant and dials a speaker phone for  him. He also knows how to turn on the television, stereo and VCR.  </P> <P> "It used to be that if a door shut behind me, I couldn't open it up and I'd be  stuck there all day," Foster says. "If I dropped my mouth stick, I wouldn't be  able to move from that spot until my attendant came in at night."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Program to Lose Funding  </P> <P> The program, which has been financed by the Veterans Administration, loses its  funding this year. Recently, U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) introduced  legislation that would allow service-connected quadriplegic veterans to receive  a monkey, much the same way they are now entitled to devices like wheelchairs  and page-turners from the government.  </P> <P> Willard and program director Judy Zazula hope the program will receive enough  sponsorship from companies like animal food manufacturer Purina Mills and  individual donations to continue. At present, the program receives $300,000 in  funding.  </P> <P> Zazula, 33, has worked with Willard from the start of the program and directs  the training of the monkeys. She works 12-hour days at the Boston training  center where she spends long hours in a wheelchair simulating tasks for the  monkeys. Currently, there are 18 monkeys being trained at the center.  </P> <P> Zazula is so devoted to her charges that Hellion, Foster's monkey, was the  "flower primate" at her wedding last summer.  </P></p>

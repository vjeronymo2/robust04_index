			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by Si Liang (2448 5328): "The Results of </F> Implementing the Mainland Enterprise Bankruptcy Law Are Not  Satisfactory Enough"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 18 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Since the  "PRC Enterprise Bankruptcy Law" came into force in 1988, it has  created the conditions for setting up the legal framework of  enterprise management and the new enterprise system. However,  the results of implementing the bankruptcy law in the last five  to six years have not been satisfactory enough. Some contents  of the law are now unsuited to the situation whereby the  structure has been changing into the market economy in recent  years and different ownership forms are coexisting. It is said  that the authorities are now considering a substantial revision  of the bankruptcy law.    According to incomplete statistics, in the five to six years  of implementing the bankruptcy law, only some 1,000 enterprises  applied for bankruptcy. A large number of these enterprises  were under collective ownership, state-owned enterprises only  accounting for a small proportion. In addition to such  objective factors as changes in market conditions, the  enterprises went bankrupt mainly because of problems in their  internal management. For example, their self-control mechanisms  were not working; their accounts were not in order; they were  short of working funds; their products were of inferior quality;  they concealed business losses or incurred losses through lack  of experience or being taken in; and they had been running in  the red for a long time through poor management and had failed  to repay their debts.    What has perplexed people is the fact that many state-owned  enterprises which were running in the red for a long time, and  living solely on state financial subsidies, did not apply for  bankruptcy. Reportedly, this year, one-third of several hundred  million state-owned enterprises will incur overt business losses  [ming kui 2494 5719]; another one-third will incur covert  business losses [qian kui 3383 5719]; and only the remaining  one-third will show small profits. The mainland department  concerned recently investigated some state-owned enterprises  which were running in the red in six provinces and reached the  conclusion that at least 30 percent of state-owned enterprises  should go bankrupt. In fact, the number of enterprises having  applied for bankruptcy accounted for just 0.001 percent of the  total number of enterprises on the mainland. This shows that  the results of the bankruptcy law's enforcement were not  satisfactory enough. As a rule in market competition,  enterprises having lost their vitality and failing to survive  should be eliminated; however, a large number of enterprises  which have been running in the red for a long time are now  unwilling to apply for bankruptcy and still rely on government  subsidies for their continuing existence. This is indeed a big  problem. In fact, the implementation of the "PRC Enterprise  Bankruptcy Law" has encountered many difficulties. First, some  government departments were worried that, beacuse the social  insurance system was not perfect enough, if a large number of  enterprises were allowed to go bankrupt then a large number of  workers would become jobless and it would be hard to arrange new  jobs for them, adding an unstable factor to society. Second,  most of the loss-making enterprises were floated by bank loans,  so the banks did not want to see that their loans would never be  recovered if the enterprises went bankrupt, because, as the  banks said: "Bankruptcy will just shift the losses onto the  banks." As the money loaned by the banks came mainly from  ordinary people's deposits, if a bank also goes bankrupt,  society would experience major turmoil. Therefore, the banks  would rather see the enterprises indefinitely in arrears with  debt payments than having the debtors go bankrupt. Third, the  bankruptcy of a large number of enterprises will inevitably  bring about a chain reaction because debt chains exist among all  enterprises. If one enterprise goes bankrupt, other enterprises  with business relations will suffer serious losses. In  addition, as some enterprises play a major role in processing  local resources, if they go bankrupt the development of local  resources will be seriously affected.    All this shows that the implementation of the bankruptcy  law,  especially for state-owned enterprises, is facing mountains of  difficulties. However, if the bankruptcy law cannot be  implemented smoothly, the situation will be unfavorable to the  new round of enterprise property rights reform beginning this  year to establish the modern enterprise system and aslo to the  further development of the market economy.    In order to force more state-owned enterprises which have  been running in the red and failing to repay debts go bankrupt  as they should do, the authorities are adopting some measures to  deal with the difficult points. One of the measure was to set  up a system of keeping tens of billions of yuan in reserve funds  in the banks to cope with bad debts and make up for the losses  caused by enterprise bankruptcies. This year, 7 to 8 billion  yuan will be assigned to 15 cities, including Shanghai and  Shenyang, to offset bad debts appearing in pilot schemes of  enterprise bankruptcy. Another measure was to set up a  foundation for workers losing their jobs in enterprise  bankruptcies. Each worker will be given about 20,000 yuan as  redundancy compensation so that they can pay the living costs  while remaining jobless. It is expected that a new breakthrough  may be made this year in the number of bankruptcy application  cases among loss-making enterprises.</p>

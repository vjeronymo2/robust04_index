			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Newcrest to accept courts' rights finding Newcrest Mining, the Australian goldminer, has decided not to launch an appeal against a decision in the Western Australian courts, which declared that it did not have pre-emptive rights over shares in the Boddington gold mine. The question had arisen because Reynolds Metals wished to sell its 40 per cent interest in the mine to Poseidon Gold, part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group. Newcrest, which holds a 20 per cent interest in the mine, said that it believed 'there are reasonable prospects that the decision may have been overturned on appeal', but that 'such a result is not beyond doubt'. It said that the decision not to appeal was 'the reasonable and pragmatic decision to take in light of all the circumstances'. Newcrest's decision was welcomed by PosGold, which said that the Reynolds purchase would be completed soon.</p>

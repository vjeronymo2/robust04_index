			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from the Russian Federation Government Center for </F> Economic Conditions: "Month of May to Blame"]    [Text] Over the past week inflation was 1 percent.  Foodstuffs were up 1.9 percent, nonfood goods 1.2 percent and  paid services to the population were up 1.9 percent.    Prices for goods and services grew most noticeably in the  cities of Eastern Siberia, which recorded Russia's biggest rise  in the price of foodstuffs and paid services to the population.  The smallest change in consumer prices last week -- less than 1  percent -- was recorded in the Northern Region.    Prices in the unofficial trading system continued to rise  faster than in the official trading system. Price increases in  Moscow for the main foodstuffs, nonfood goods, and services  corresponded to the average Russian level; they were higher in  St. Petersburg -- at 2.9 percent.    Spring is to blame -- specifically, the month of May. The  seasonal increase in the cost of fruit and vegetables (by 11.9  and 5.2 percent respectively) affected prices as a whole.  Moreover, prices for meat products and salt were up more than 2  percent over the week, while the price of dairy products,  butter, vegetable oil, sugar, and flour increased by less than 1  percent. The only things unaffected by the spring are chickens  and alcohol producers -- egg and vodka prices were unchanged.    The average cost of the basket of a month's worth of the 19  most important foodstuffs on 10 May was 49,700 rubles [R] -- up  2.4 percent on the week and 4.4 percent since the start of the  month.    The variation between the maximum and minimum cost of the  basket in different Russian cities remained at last week's level  -- 270 percent.    The most "expensive" area is still the Far East Economic  Region -- the basket there cost R83,100 for the whole month.  After a week's break, the "cheapest" area is once again the  Central Chernozem Region -- R38,900.    Price growth for nonfood goods during this period has been  minimal this year -- 1.2 percent. Notable increases continued  to be recorded by matches (up 4 percent), wallpaper (up 3.8  percent), and medicine (up 3 percent, including a 10-percent  rise for nitroglycerin).    The cities of the Far East Region --  Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Nakhodka, Yakutsk, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk,  and Magadan -- are constantly on the list of the 10 cities with  the highest price levels for certain types of nonfood goods.  Thus, last week Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy was in the top 10  most "expensive" cities for half of the 40 industrial goods  surveyed, as was Nakhodka for 17, Yakutsk and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk  for 14, and Magadan for 7.  <H5>  Average Cost of Basket of the 19 Most Important </H5> Foodstuffs Forming the Basis of the Population's Weekly  Purchases (In Rubles, Per Person Per Month)    [In the following table the headings denote: A -- cost of  basket per month (in rubles); B -- U.S. dollar rate of exchange  set by the Central Bank of Russia; C -- Cost of the basket in  January 1991 prices in the United States ($88.29) expressed in  rubles at the Central Bank of Russia rate]    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1993                                                                       |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |A                 |B                 |C                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |January           |5,073             |568               |50,149            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |February          |6,449             |653               |57,654            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |March             |7,478             |684               |60,390            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |April             |8,527             |812               |71,691            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |May               |10,850            |1,050             |92,705            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |June              |13,103            |1,060             |93,587            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |July              |16,469            |994               |87,760            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |August            |18,318            |993               |87,628            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |September         |20,410            |1,201             |106,036           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |October           |23,347            |1,189             |104,977           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |November          |27,708            |1,231             |108,685           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |December          |30,724            |1,247             |110,098           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1994                                                                       |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |January           |37,547            |1,560             |137,732           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |February          |41,277            |1,668             |147,268           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |March             |44,278            |1,753             |154,772           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |April             |47,579            |1,820             |160,688           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |10 May            |49,663            |1,859             |164,131           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

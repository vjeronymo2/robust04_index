			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy session for WPP Activity in WPP, the advertising and marketing services group, dominated yesterday's business in the London stock market. Banks that bailed out the company two years ago through a convertible share issue sold much of their stake into the market, raising Pounds 138m. The heavily oversubscribed placing by SG Warburg on behalf of the syndicate of 28 banks led to total turnover of 246m shares in the stock yesterday and represented a third of the whole volume in London equities on a day dulled by closure of Wall Street for the Labor Day holiday. The shares converted for around 50p each and had been expected to realise about 100p. By Friday, marketmakers were talking about a price some 10 to 15 per cent higher. In the event, demand at the top level of the auction-style book building process was such that applications could only be 40 per cent satisfied, and 120m shares were sold at the top of the range price - 115p. Of the 70m shares remaining, half had been sold forward by the banks and the other half had been moved into the banks' own fund management arms for investment purposes. The underlying WPP share price ended 3 higher at 123p.</p>

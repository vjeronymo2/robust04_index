			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Labour seeks order in leadership race SENIOR LABOUR party figures will seek to impose some order on the elements of farce in the party's leadership contest by insisting at today's meeting of Labour MPs that there will be no immediate change to the rules. But the renewed claims about which of the candidates for leader and deputy leader were on course to secure the necessary 55 signatures from Labour MPs  -sparked by the weekend's confusion about the rules  - have fuelled the row over demands that all candidates should be able to address their colleagues before nominations close tomorrow. The issue will come to a head at the same meeting, where the demands are unlikely to be met. Continuing disarray in the election process is dismaying Labour MPs who believe it is damaging the party severely by highlighting ways in which Labour is not fully democratic. A letter, which was sent to candidates on Friday by Ms Joyce Gould, the party's organisation director, suggested that if a first-choice candidate did not secure enough nominations, the MP concerned could nominate a second-choice candidate. After consultations, which included Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, and Mr Larry Whitty, general secretary, senior party officials said yesterday that, in spite of what was in the letter, there had been no change to the rules. An MP could change his or her mind about who to nominate at the last minute, but could not send in two nominations. In a television interview yesterday with Mr Brian Walden, Mr Bryan Gould, a candidate for both the leadership and the deputy leadership, admitted that his request for the rules to be clarified had prompted the letter. He fiercely rejected the idea that this meant he had manipulated the rules and insisted that he was confident of being nominated for both posts. However, supporters of other contenders reacted angrily, saying the clarification seemed intended to benefit Mr Gould. Mr Ken Livingstone, the leadership candidate supported by the left-wing Campaign Group, said there was 'clear evidence' that party officials and perhaps some MPs had tried to influence which candidates would appear on the ballot paper. The general union TGWU is today expected to announce that it will conduct a workplace ballot of its members to decide how to cast its vote. However, the engineering union AEU reiterated its position yesterday that it had no money left for a postal ballot and refused to countenance a workplace ballot. The AEU's leadership strongly favours a looser link with the Labour party and an end to the block vote.</p>

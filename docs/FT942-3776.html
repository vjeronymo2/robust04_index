			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Lib Dem wins fail to live up to party's private hopes The Liberal Democrats showed delight last night at winning their first seats in the European parliament. But they failed to make as many gains in the south and south-west as they had privately hoped. The party had sought to play down media predictions, based on opinion polls, that they could win a swathe of Tory-held seats in the south-west and south. It did achieve victory in its two prime targets, Somerset and North Devon, where it had a majority of 22,000 over the Conservatives, and Cornwall and West Plymouth, with a majority of 29,000. 'It is the breakthrough we have been looking forward to for a very long time,' said Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, speaking in his constituency of Yeovil in Somerset. While it was a breakthrough for the party into the European parliament, it did not presage a break-out from south-west England, where his party has had sweeping gains in council elections. Although the party benefited from a sharp fall in the share of the Green vote, compared with 1989, Liberal Democrats spoke last night of votes for Labour having saved Mr John Major's bacon. An early disappointment for the Liberal Democrats came when they failed to win Wight and Hampshire South, where the Tories had a majority of 5,000. They also failed to capture Hampshire North and Oxford. Although these seats were not their best targets, their hopes had been boosted by their parliamentary by-election at Eastleigh in Hampshire on Thursday. A further disappointment for the Liberal Democrats came with the failure to win the North Wiltshire and Bath seat. Because boundary changes had brought into the constituency the city of Bath, where the party won the parliamentary seat in 1992 and controls the council, it believed it had a chance to win. Another outside chance was the Cotswolds seat, held by Lord Plumb for the Tories. There the party was pushed into third place by Labour, which in a strong performance slashed Lord Plumb's majority to 4,000. In Cornwall and West Plymouth, Mr Robin Teverson, the Liberal Democrat candidate, defeated Mr Christopher Beazley, who had held the seat for the Conservatives for 10 years and had a majority of nearly 20,000 in 1989. In Somerset and North Devon, the Liberal Democrats only managed fourth place behind the Greens and Labour in 1989. Since then, they have won control of the county council and, in this election, were helped by boundary changes. After an active campaign, the turnout was 47 per cent, 7 per cent up on the previous election. Labour, in third place, saw its share of the poll fall slightly and the Greens' vote, as expected, dropped sharply. Mr Graham Watson, the new MEP for Somerset and North Devon, said: 'There is a tide of liberalism sweeping the west country. It has not yet reached its peak, and I believe it will sweep this current government from office.' He added: 'I have found that on this constituency it has been fought largely on European issues. I've certainly been asked many times about my policies on the social chapter, and things like this, and I think the public have rejected what the Tories are doing in Europe.' The defeated Tory, Mrs Margaret Daly, had held the seat for 10 years with a majority of 40,000 in 1989. She said many people had told her they would vote Liberal Democrat as a protest. But she added: 'I hope the prime minister sticks to his guns. I think the thing the Conservative party wants like a hole in the head is a leadership challenge.' Sir Robert Wall, head of the Conservative group on Bristol city council, said: 'I can't see what advantage there would be in changing the leader.'</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Arts: Smiting the Philistines - Architecture Before the Great Fire of London in 1666 there were about 100 churches in the City of London. After the fire Christopher Wren built, or supervised the rebuilding of, some 53 City churches. A number were demolished before the First World War and their sites sold to provide funds for new churches in the expanding London suburbs. Curiously, it is the Bishops of London who have often been the enemies of the City churches. In 1919 Bishop Winnington-Ingram appointed a commission which recommended demolishing some 19 churches; and, despite public protest, the Church Assembly approved the measure in 1924. Mercifully, it was not approved by Parliament; the City of London Corporation presented a petition at the Bar of the House strongly objecting to the destruction of its churches. As recently as 1972 the then Bishop of London proposed that nine churches in the City should immediately be declared redundant. Once again, it was the City of London that rejected this episcopal advice. Last Friday another Bishop of London, the Right Reverend David Hope, introduced the report of a commission he set up in 1992 to settle the fate of the remaining City Churches. It is a frightening document, the more so because it is meant to be reassuring and practical. The bishop has what he calls a 'mission strategy' for London. He asked this particular commission to consider what current role there is for the City's churches within this strategy and to look at the 'practical and financial implications' for the church. The commission was very small. Its chairman was the judge and Lord of Appeal, Lord Templeman and the three members were Lady Wilcox, the Archdeacon of Oxford, and Viscount Churchill who has run the investment side of the Church of England Board of Finance for many years. The secretary to the board was a chartered accountant and it has reported to the bishop that, after receiving a fair amount of evidence it feels that only 12 churches in the City should remain 'the Active Churches' and the remaining 27 should become 'the Reserve Churches' - which really means hovering on the brink of redundancy. Much of the report is inevitably to do with money and administration. Its recommendations are all for rationalisation and the ending of the autonomy so many of the churches and their incumbents in the City now enjoy. The commission suggested that the City be divided into four parishes and that a City Dean be appointed to galvanise and organise them. But what underlies the whole report is a clear belief that the architectural and cultural fabric of these churches is a a positive nuisance to the Church of England and should be handed over to, and looked after by, someone else. If the listed building rules and the heritage lobby were not so strong, I am in no doubt that this commission would like to have recommended the demolition of the 27 'reserve churches.' The report says: 'All Reserve Churches possess religious architectural, historical and cultural values and associations which make demolition unthinkable. There is however no demand for the Reserve Churches as parish churches. It would be possible for a Reserve Church to be locked up and merely maintained wind and water tight . . .' The shadow of redundancy hangs over churches of the architectural quality of St. Mary Abchurch with its glorious shallow dome; St Stephen Walbrook - Wren's rehearsal in miniature for Saint Paul's; St. Peter Cornhill, with one of the most complete and wonderful church interiors in the City; and St. Mary at Hill with its late 17th-century high pews and central dome. Of course redundancy need not mean deconsecration and new uses can be found for historic churches, as has happened with varying degrees of success in cities like Norwich and York. What is saddening about this kind of bureaucrat's report is that it sees God's temples only as awkward elements in a management plan. The City's churches offer intangible benefits of sanctuary and peace as well as tangible benefits of scale and beauty in a square mile that is over-developed and often ugly. The working population of the City numbers about 300,000, about the same as the population of Venice, where there are around 170 churches. There is a natural realisation in Italy that churches are a part of life and that they have inspirational qualities, even if they are seldom formally used. There is money for the City churches and the City itself is rich enough to spend Pounds 11m last year on the restoration of its own Mansion House. Surely the churches can represent more than the current ineptitude of an established church to organise its affairs. They are a unique collection of buildings, undervalued both culturally and as working churches. For too long they have been seen as a burden and not an opportunity. All around us, especially among the young, there is a growing interest and concern for the spiritual and aesthetic values these churches represent. It would be sadly typical of the Anglican church to abandon many of its finest churches in the capital just as the signs of a spiritual revival are daily more visible. We need the churches, their beauty and their music and their ceremonial more than ever; what a moment to propose the virtual extinction of so many of the City of London's finest creations. We live in truly philistine times . . .</p>

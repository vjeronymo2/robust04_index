			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (2): To strange horizons - How exploration has changed THE world's biggest oil and gas companies are turning to ever more exotic parts of the globe to look for new supplies. This so-called frontier strategy is taking companies such as British Petroleum into the Colombian jungles and British Gas into the former republics of the Soviet Union. Frontier exploration is devoted to extending the limits of known energy reserves but carries a risk much higher than companies face in their more traditional areas of influence such as the North Sea and North America. Some of this exploration is conducted in extremely hostile environments where the oil majors face many environmental drawbacks as well as possible disruption to drilling programmes by guerrilla action. In addition host governments are often unstable and could turn hostile at very short notice. The fact that many companies are prepared to run these huge risks is evidence of their often desperate search for new oil reserves. Most big discoveries are thought to have been found in the North Sea and, while there still remains a lot of oil and gas to drill, production profiles are expected to tail off towards the end of the decade. At the same time, the environmental lobby has closed much of North America for oil exploration and raised the cost for companies still operating there. Mr Robin West who advises companies on their frontier strategy at Petroleum Finance Company, the Washington-based consulting group, points out that most traditional oil majors have done a poor job of replacing their reserves of energy. British Petroleum, for example, saw the level of its proven oil reserves drop by four per cent last year, since the company has much of its production concentrated in the mature oilfields of the North Sea and Alaska. 'Companies are now being forced to turn from quick pay-out, low-risk investment in the North Sea and North America to riskier prospects,' Mr West explains. The drive for oil companies to replace their reserves with new discoveries has occurred at a time of rapid political change across the globe which has seen the opening up of many countries where governments were previously hostile to western oil companies. These countries  - from Vietnam and Russia to Laos and Yemen  - are looking to exploit mineral resources to expand hard currency earnings. They look to the oil and gas majors for valuable investment in infrastructure and development in return for drilling rights on tracts of potential oil-bearing land. Nowhere is the rush to explore more evident than in the former Soviet Union. In spite of the difficulties of negotiating with changing political regimes and large scale bureaucracy, most western companies are hoping to secure at least some acreage or production-sharing deals. British Gas recently landed exclusive rights to negotiate for the development of a huge field in Kazakhstan which is the first stage before agreeing a contract. But negotiations can drag on for months or even years and many companies have become embroiled in discussing technicalities. Mr Kenneth Derr, chairman of Chevron, the US oil major, was negotiating with Kazakhstan for over four years, but he explained the company's persistence in terms of the significance of the field in which he was interested. 'It is unique in size and could have a meaningful impact on a company of our size for a very long time.' The republics of the former Soviet Union provide a safer bet for companies looking to frontier exploration since, in spite of production difficulties, they collectively remain the world's largest producer of oil with vast proven grossly under-exploited reserves. Companies searching for oil in Vietnam, Laos and Colombia are running a greater risk of ending up with dry holes. Clyde Petroleum, a small UK exploration company, was forced to write off its Dollars 8m investment in offshore Vietnam when it discovered a large reservoir of carbon dioxide last year instead of the natural gas reserves it was hoping for. Companies must collect extremely expensive high-tech data on the country's geology before deciding where to drill which is, in the end, a subjective decision. Oil exploration is a notoriously hit-and-miss affair even in the best researched locations. Much of the impetus for frontier exploration came after the Gulf war early last year when many oil producing nations began to talk of a dialogue, if not partnership, with consumers. Most nations in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) are in need of capital to complete capacity expansion plans, but many are short of hard currency. Dr Subroto, secretary general of the organisation, estimates that its 13 members need roughly Dollars 25bn in capital over the next decade to finish expansion programmes. These capital requirements have seen Opec nations actively courting western oil companies to form partnerships that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. Industry analysts call this a 'new bargain' between countries and companies. Mr Dan Yergin, who heads Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an oil consulting group and the author of The Prize, a best-selling history of the oil industry, said: 'It is the antithesis of what we saw in the 1970s when a wave of nationalism across the world led to many of these companies being thrown out of countries they were operating in.' Iran, which expelled western oil companies after the revolution in 1979, is now eager to entice them back. Tehran has even hosted conferences on producer-consumer dialogue in an effort to court wary western companies. Countries are competing for scarce cash amid global credit shortages which means they are often prepared to offer western companies extremely favourable deals in order to attract their investment and sophisticated technology. For the few companies that strike lucky in frontier exploration, the high stakes can offer rich rewards. Companies are hoping for an 'elephant'  - a discovery of 1bn barrels or more  - which will ensure earnings growth for at least a decade. British Petroleum's oil find in the foothills of the Colombian mountains is rumoured to contain more than 1bn barrels. Although the company has played down the significance of its discovery, it badly needs a boost to its reserves and, among the majors, has pioneered the risky frontier strategy. The company is painfully aware of the fact that the successful energy companies in the 1990s will be the ones that strike lucky in the jungles of Laos and Vietnam or strike favourable deals in the former Soviet Union. The stakes have been raised once more in the risky oil exploration business.</p>

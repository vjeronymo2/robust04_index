This accusation came from Gregorio Rosal, alias Comrade Roger,  spokesman for the Militor Glor Command.    [Begin correspondent Norie Temblor recording] In an  exclusive  interview with GMA-7 at Sierra Madre, Rosal said that the  breakaway factions lost the right to use the name Alex Boncayao  Brigade after they broke off ties with the Communist Party of  the Philippines. It will be recalled that many CPP units headed  by the NCR [National Capital Region] regional party committee  cut their ties with CPP Chairman Jose Maria Sison. In this  connection, Rosal said they will reactivate the real Alex  Boncayao Brigade to counter the impostor ABB.    Regarding the coming peace talks, Rosal revealed that the  CPP  remains open to the peace talks. In the meantime, Rosal called  on Ramos to give more attention to the important issues in the  peace talks rather than focusing on the issue of giving Sison a  passport.    On the ongoing cease-fire, Rosal disclosed that they have  not  committed any violations.    Meanwhile, government troops continue their intensive  surveillance of suspected New People's Army camps.

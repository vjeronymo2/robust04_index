Hector Luna Troccoli, secretary general of the presidency,  told the media that the request made by Attorney General  Telesforo Guerra was "on a personal basis, and as any other  citizen, he has the right to give his opinion."    Luna explained that this extreme measure -- which is part of  the Public Order Law -- can only be issued personally by the  president, Ramiro de Leon, or with the consensus of the cabinet  when the situation merits it.    According to the official, that is not the situation in  Guatemala at this time. Luna Troccoli admitted that these  "comments have been made in informal talks," but he reiterated  that De Leon "has not given any consideration to declaring a  state of emergency because the circumstances do not really call  for it."    The Attorney General's Office charged there is a plan to  destabilize the government of Ramiro de Leon in which  politicians, judges, and union leaders are reportedly involved,  but he abstained from giving their names. Nonetheless, the  political parties and the union leaders have demanded that  Guerra present evidence of the alleged plot, which the attorney  general linked to a strike movement of the public workers who  are demanding salary increases.</p>

Projects of this type should focus specifically on providing practical solutions to access problems faced by historic properties. Projects to develop and disseminate educational materials, to develop and conduct training using existing materials, or to develop materials and conduct training will be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Priority 3 is an ADA education project for historic preservation officials that shall include the following major components:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Develop educational materials that focus on solutions to access problems specific to properties such as historic museums, historic buildings housing public accommodations and those housing State and local government programs. The materials shall illustrate how people with disabilities use the built environment and how the provisions of the ADA Standards for Accessible Design can be effectively used to provide mainstream access without destroying the historic significance of the building or facility;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Establish size of target audience and state explicitly the number of people expected to be served in the course of the project's activities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Identify and coordinate with established professional organizations, such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the National Conference of State Historical Preservation Officers, and State Historical Commissions, etc., through which information and materials could be disseminated;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Specify how the project will reach all parts of the targeted audience, including racial and ethnic minority communities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Utilize existing federally approved materials to the maximum extent possible;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Develop and implement a strategy to disseminate the materials nationally, coordinating with other state and national historic preservation organizations as appropriate;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _If the project includes a training component, identify topics to be covered and the rationale for selecting those topics and develop and implement a plan to select trainers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _If the project includes training, a minimum of five regional sessions should be held. Criteria to be used to select the training locations should be carefully thought out and described in the applicant's proposal;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Develop and implement a strategy to publicize information about the ADA and the availability of materials and training sessions nationally through organizations, print and electronic media;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Create articles on the requirements of the ADA for publication in media appropriate to target audience;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Develop a plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the project and how the proposed evaluation criteria will indicate to what degree the project succeeded in meeting its stated objectives and reaching the targeted audience.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

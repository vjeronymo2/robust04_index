			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> e. A program for conducting education and training of occupational physicians, occupational health nurses, industrial hygienists, industrial hygiene engineers and occupational safety personnel. There shall be a minimum of five full-time students in each of the core programs, with a goal of a minimum of 30 full-time students (total in all of core programs together). It is most desirable for a Center to have the full range of core programs; however, a Center with three core programs is eligible for support providing it is demonstrated that students will be exposed to the principles and issues of all four core disciplines. Training may also be conducted in other allied occupational safety and health disciplines, e.g., industrial toxicology, biostatistics and epidemiology, and ergonomics. Each core program curriculum shall include courses from non-core categories as well as appropriate clinical rotations and field experiences with public health and safety agencies and with labor-management health and safety groups. Where possible, field experience shall involve students representing other disciplines in a manner similar to that used in team surveys and other team approaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. A specific plan describing how trainees will be exposed to the principles of all other occupational safety and health core and allied disciplines. Consortium Centers generally have geographic, policy and other barriers to achieving this Center characteristic and, therefore, must give special, if not innovative, attention to thoroughly describing the approach for fulfilling the multidisciplinary interaction between students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. Demonstrated impact of the ERC on the curriculum taught by relevant medical specialties, including family practice, internal medicine, dermatology, orthopaedics, pathology, radiology, neurology, perinatal medicine, psychiatry, etc., and on the curriculum of other schools such as engineering, business, law and the medical school.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h. An outreach program to interact with and help other institutions or agencies located within the region. Examples of outreach activities might include activities such as: Interaction with other colleges and schools within the ERC and with other universities or institutions in the region to integrate occupational safety and health principles and concepts within existing curricula (e.g., Colleges of Business Administration, Engineering, Architecture, Law, and Arts and Sciences); exchange of occupational safety and health faculty among regional educational institutions; providing curriculum materials and consultation for curriculum/course development in other institutions; use of a visiting faculty program to involve labor and management leaders; cooperative and collaborative arrangements with professional societies, scientific associations, and boards of accreditation, certification, or licensure; and presentation of awareness seminars to undergraduate and secondary educational institutions (e.g., high school science fairs and career days) as well as to labor, management and community associations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. A specific plan for preparing, distributing and conducting courses, seminars and workshops to provide short-term and continuing education training courses for physicians, nurses, industrial hygienists, safety engineers and other occupational safety and health professionals, paraprofessionals and technicians, including personnel from labor-management health and safety committees, in the geographical region in which the Center is located. The goal shall be that the training be made available to a minimum of 400 trainees/year representing all of the above categories of personnel, on an approximate proportional basis with emphasis given to providing occupational safety and health training to physicians in family practice, as well as industrial practice, industrial nurses, and safety engineers. Where appropriate, it shall be professionally acceptable in that Continuing Education Units (as approved by appropriate professional associations) may be awarded. These courses should be structured so that higher educational institutions, public health and safety agencies, professional societies or other appropriate agencies can utilize them to provide training at the local level to occupational health and safety personnel working in the workplace. Further, the Center shall conduct periodic training needs assessments, shall develop a specific plan to meet these needs, and shall have demonstrated capability for implementing such training directly and through other institutions or agencies in the region. The Center should establish and maintain cooperative efforts with labor unions, government agencies, and industry trade associations, where appropriate, thus serving as a regional resource for addressing the problems of occupational safety and health that are faced by State and local governments, labor and management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> j. A Board of Advisors or Consultants representing the user and affected population, including representatives of labor, industry, government agencies, academic institutions and professional associations, shall be established by the Center. The Board shall meet regularly to advise a Center Executive Committee and to provide periodic evaluation of Center activities. The Executive Committee shall be composed of the Center Director and Deputy Director, academic Program Directors, the Directors for Continuing Education and Outreach and others whom the Center Director may appoint to assist in governing the internal affairs of the Center.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> k. A defined research plan for the purposes of establishing a research base within the core occupational safety and health disciplines and within the ERC infrastructure as a whole, and for the training of researchers in occupational safety and health. The plan will include how the Center intends to strengthen existing research training efforts, and how it will expand these research activities to impact on other primarily clinically-oriented disciplines, such as nursing and medicine. (In nursing, for example, the development of the nursing research area should be consistent with national strategies outlined by professional nursing and occupational health nursing specialty groups to enhance nursing research productivity and to increase the number of nurse researchers for the future.) Each ERC is required to identify or develop a minimum of one, preferably more, areas of research focus related to work environment problems. Consideration shall be given to, but not limited to, the top ten work-related diseases and injuries targeted by CDC/NIOSH. In addition to the research and research training components, the plan will also include such items as specific strategies for obtaining student and faculty funding, plans for renovating or acquiring facilities and equipment, if appropriate, and a plan for developing research-oriented faculty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> l. Evidence in obtaining support from other funds, including other Federal grants, support from States and other public agencies, and support from the private sector including grants from foundations and corporate endowments, chairs, and gifts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Approximately $247,000 of the available funds as specified in A.1. will be awarded to ERCs to support the development of specialized educational programs in agricultural safety and health within the existing core disciplines of industrial hygiene, occupational medicine, occupational health nursing, and occupational safety. Program support is available for faculty and staff salaries, trainee costs, and other costs to educate professionals in agricultural safety and health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. To award approximately twenty-six non-competing continuation and thirteen competing continuation long-term training project grants (TPG) totaling $2,068,000 and ranging from approximately $10,000 to $500,000, with the average award being $53,000, to support academic programs in the fields of industrial hygiene, occupational health nursing, occupational/industrial medicine, and occupational safety. The following are the types of occupational safety and health training programs that are eligible for support. The awards are normally for training programs of 1 academic year. They are intended to augment the scope, enrollment, and quality of training programs rather than to replace funds already available for current operations. The types of training currently eligible for support are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Graduate training for practice, teaching, and research careers in occupational safety and health. Priority will be given to programs producing graduates in areas (i.e., disciplines such as occupational health nursing) of greatest occupational safety and health need.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by columnist Marcelo Pontes] </F>   [Text] These days, when candidates are deciding whether to  run for president and alliances are being readied, one concern  is foremost among the parties: they know that it is not enough  to have a good candidate; they must ensure that whoever is  elected will actually be able to govern.    This would be just a routine item on the political agenda if  today's Brazil did not have on one side an administration that  is disoriented within the Congress, with no dependable support  from the parties and vulnerable to surprises with every vote;  and, on the other, a candidate for president--Luis Inacio Lula  da Silva--who dominates the opinion polls but does not control  his own party. Furthermore, as backdrop we have the history of a  deposed president who restricted the concept of governability to  his ability to simply get elected.    The concern for governability is in proportion to the  difficulty the parties are having in laying the foundations for  election-year alliances. The PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement  Party] and PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], for example,  have made no progress in their talks because of internal  indecisiveness. Orestes Quercia announced his candidacy, as he  puts it, precisely to prevent such an alliance from prospering.  That antipathy is reciprocated within the PSDB--which,  incidentally, was born out of opposition to Quercia by PMDB  dissidents.    Quercia, in turn, is having trouble reaching an agreement  with Sao Paulo Governor Luis Antonio Fleury Filho, whose  favorite candidate is himself, and whose second choice would be  Deputy Antonio Britto.    Since Quercia announced, Fleury seems more inclined to  finish  out his term as governor. Whether he stays or goes, he is  unwilling to lift a finger to help Quercia. Even so, Fleury  finds it hard to take a more aggressive position toward Quercia.  With the governorship of Sao Paulo in hand, he still has been  unable to build his own following or exercise strong leadership  either within or outside the party.    No matter how much improved the conditions may be for  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso to remain as finance minister  until the Itamar administration leaves office, the PSDB still  considers him its favorite candidate. If Fernando Henrique is  not nominated, the party has three other names: Mario Covas,  Tasso Jereissati, and Ciro Gomes.    Covas does not want to run for president; he would rather be  governor of Sao Paulo. He is the strongest of all the candidates  who have showed up at the gate of Bandeirantes Palace so far.  Tasso is the only name in the group of Ceara tucanos  who could defeat Juraci Magalhaes, the PMDB's extremely popular  candidate for governor of that state. As for Ciro Gomes, he has  the reputation of being good with a megaphone, but not very  skilled in the whispering needed to forge alliances.    The PFL [Liberal Front Party] is taking the opposite  approach. Because it has no names, it is starting by developing  a platform, while leaving plenty of room for coalitions--Maluf  and Maluf, and Brizola and Brizola. Either of these men is  stronger individually than their parties or any alliances the  parties could put together.    From now on, we will see names emerge that although they may  not establish themselves as candidates for the presidency, could  at least be good campaign workers. One of these is banker and  former Minister of Industry and Commerce Senator Jose Eduardo  Andrade Vieira, who is working on becoming the candidate of the  PTB [Brazilian Labor Party] with the support of the PP  [Progressive Party].    After a lengthy and intense barrage of criticisms from  Governor Roberto Requiao, Andrade Vieira wondered how his image  was faring in his home state of Parana. He commissioned a poll  and found that of nine national political figures, he was the  one least rejected by respondents; he even did better than  Fernando Henrique Cardoso. He popped a few champagne corks and  started organizing his campaign.    Although a millionaire, Andrade Vieira would not need to  work  too hard to come off as a day laborer in terms of accent or the  way he cooks and debones a pacu (a fish from the  Pantanal), or in the bravado with which he opens a  beer bottle with a table knife. But he has to work harder when  it comes time to discuss Brazil's problems.    In his head is an empirical vision of Brazil's problems--"I  have had it up to here with the experts," he says, passing his  right hand across his neck like a razor blade--and with  simplistic models of government. He thinks he can solve  everything with partnerships or sectoral chambers. After all, he  was one of the masterminds of the sectoral chambers that, among  other things, were successful early in the Itamar administration  in getting the auto industry growing again.    His principal credential will become a slogan. It is  The man who gets things done, a reference to a TV  commercial his bank produced to honor small entrepreneurs. In  this field, he is very practical. He can tell us right away how  he would govern. He would reduce the government to 10 or 15  ministries, would fire through the press those ministers who  dissent with his administration, would close a whole bunch of  state enterprises (except for two private banks that he does not  identify), would not allow his few cabinet ministers to waste so  much time receiving visiting deputies who come "begging" as he  puts it, and would call on businessmen to get together and  figure out how Brazil should grow. But if he cannot get that  far, Andrade Vieira would accept an invitation to serve as  finance minister.</p>

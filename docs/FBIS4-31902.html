			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 15 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef  Moravcik hailed the results of Sunday's [12 June] referendum in  which Austria voted for European Union (EU) membership as "very  positive" today.    "What happened in Austria can help us succeed in our efforts  to join the EU," he told CTK.    The vote was also welcomed by the Slovak Foreign Ministry,  which issued a statement saying that Austria's path was "in many  ways a source of experience for Slovak foreign policy, whose  strategic aim is full EU membership." It also expressed interest  in intensifying Slovak-Austrian relations as a "prototype for  Slovakia's relations in an integrated Europe."    By voting to join, Austria had assumed not only the right to  take part in joint decision making in the EU but also the  responsibility of deepening European integration, the ministry  said.</p>

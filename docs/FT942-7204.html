			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Nokia to raise more than FM2bn in global issue Nokia, the Finnish telecommunications group, yesterday announced plans to raise more than FM2bn (Dollars 370m) of new equity in the biggest international share issue ever made by a Finnish company. Up to 6m new preferred shares will be offered, increasing total outstanding shares to 74.9m. At yesterday's closing price of FM410, the issue would raise more than FM2.4bn. The offer could take foreign ownership in the group above 50 per cent. An estimated 46 per cent of the company's capital is already held by foreigners, compared with 20 per cent a year ago. Around 90 per cent of the shares will be targeted at non-Finnish institutions, with the balance being offered on the domestic market. Most of the international offer will be directed at the US, where the company plans to seek a listing for its preferred stock, in the form of American depositary receipts, on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr Jorma Ollila, Nokia's president, said the funds would be used to finance the group's rapidly-growing telecommunications and mobile phone businesses and to strengthen its balance sheet. It will bring down gearing from 52 per cent at the end of last year. It is the group's second big share issue in a year, after it successfully raised FM918m last summer. The buying has been driven by a sharp improvement in Nokia's performance. Last year pre-tax profits were FM1.15bn after a FM158m loss in 1992. The company, the world's second biggest supplier of mobile phones after Motorola of the US, has seen huge growth in sales of mobile phone and fixed telephone equipment. Its share price has risen five-fold from FM82 at the beginning of 1993. Nokia intends to launch the issue during the summer, but is first seeking shareholder approval at an extraordinary general meeting on June 23. Its shares fell FM21, or nearly 5 per cent, on yesterday's announcement.</p>

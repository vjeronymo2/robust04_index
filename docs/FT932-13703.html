			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Arts: Anti-love story plays to the arthouse gallery - Cinema UN COEUR EN HIVER (12) Claude Sautet SOMMERSBY (12) Jon Amiel MR SATURDAY NIGHT (15) Billy Crystal Claude Sautet's Un Coeur En Hiver is a battle of faces. Violin-maker Stephane (Daniel Auteuil) has large, liquid, fastidious eyes and a moue of a mouth squeezed between babyish cheeks. Inside the overbred man, this face seems to say, a child is clamouring to stay hidden. Fellow violin-maker Maxim (Andre Dussollier) has playful eyes, wide lips and smile-lines as long and deep as the San Andreas Fault. He is clearly a playboy with a taste for debonair irony. Then there is Emmanuelle Beart, the woman who comes between them. She, a beautiful young violinist, is all taut complexion and perfect facial curvature. Is she the violin played by the two (seeming) rivals in love? Or is she the perfect melody who exploits and defeats them both? We are moved to this delirium of metaphor by a movie that slugs one with its own high-toned pretensions and line in lofty enigma. Nearly everyone but me at last year's Venice Film Festival, where it won the Silver Lion and International Critics Prize, rhapsodised about Sautet's film: a sort of anti-love story in which a shy, icicle-hearted instrument-maker (Auteuil) makes a play for his partner's girlfriend (Beart) and then backs off - in fear or mischief? - to watch the emotional fall-out. The girl despairingly returns his love, the rival rages at his partner's humiliation of her, the 'hero' retreats ever deeper into his igloo of expressionless expressiveness. Why does this film strikes some as a masterpiece? Two words: Daniel Auteuil. This actor - we saw him light up the role of the dim-brained nephew in Jean De Florette - has a face so alive that it sets the air shimmering around him. We imagine concealed passions even when there are none. In today's great French screen-acting sweepstake, Auteuil is immobility's answer to the hyperactive Depardieu. But what of the film around him? It is a woman's magazine story worked up for the arthouse crowd. Cast in basic language, it goes thus. Beautiful Violinist involved with Charming But Shallow Womaniser is knocked sideways by his Shy But Deep Friend. As in any six-mouchoir love story, passion must remain unrequited. And as in any standard-issue French art film, much symbolic play must be made with colour - note the gelid blue shirts worn by icy Auteuil, the brief eruptions of red in the frame when passion or anger threaten - and with well-chosen musical soundbites (tangled string-screechings from Ravel). This is the same Claude Sautet who made Les Choses De La Vie, a film whose readimix tragic romance involving Michel Piccoli and Romy Schneider was ridiculed by the same critics who now rave about Un Coeur En Hiver. But what is the difference in art and effect between the two films? None: save Auteuil's ability to hypnotise us while one cliche-worn scene or character slides by after another. There is the row in the restaurant, where our pure-bred heroine, having slapped on the scarlet-woman lipstick back home, tearfully turns all heads as she bawls out her man. There is the girl's jealous, quasi-Sapphic friend and manager (Brigitte Catillon), a Mrs Danvers for the Cinematheque set. And there is the scene that sums up this film's indomitable shallowness. One evening Auteuil goes to visit his friend and ex-music teacher (Maurice Garrel) in the country. Stepping from his car a few dozen feet from the house, he hears and sees the man bickering with his housekeeper-companion on the front terrace. Tactfully, silently, he steps back, re-starts the motor and retreats down the drive. Have you ever started a car 'silently' twenty-odd yards from the nearest witness? But this is a movie so in love with its po-faced contrivances that plausibility takes a back seat to romantic and symbolic pattern-making. For all its feints at psychological realism, the only things that distinguish Un Coeur En Hiver from Love Story or Terms Of Endearment are the French subtitles, the gnomic self-importance and Auteuil's acting, which hints at depths never plumbed by the script or direction. ****** In Sommersby Richard Gere returns from the American Civil War to a wife (Jodie Foster), a plantation (cotton) and a situation (is he the real Jack Sommersby?). In and around his peeling Tennessee mansion things are soon in lyrical turmoil, egged on - indeed over-egged - by Danny Elfman's music. Gere's foot size is too small; his memory for friends is faulty; and Foster notes a new, 'improved' marital personality. Instead of the old Jack, cruel and unloving, this one is an selfless gallant who brings waves of offscreen violin music whenever he embraces her. And instead of being a feudal bully to the cotton-pickin' villagers, he gives them shares in his new tobacco-plantin' venture which ends up earning Dollars 10,000. Inspired by the French film The Return Of Martin Guerre, Sommersby boasts some of the weirdest credits in recent history. Story by Anthony (Sleuth) Shaffer and Nicholas (Star Trek) Meyer; direction by Jon (The Singing Detective) Amiel; photography by Philippe (The Emerald Forest) Rousselot, in collaboration with an uncredited Rembrandt Van Rijn. (Lots of burnished browns and mysteriously-sourced glowing light). One cannot say the film fails, for one would have to ask the question 'Which film?' While Gere and Foster work their make-up off trying to bring life to Mr and Mrs Deep South - he all perplexed staccato boyishness, she lit from within by the candle-power she brought to The Accused and The Silence Of The Lambs - script, direction and camerawork seem more concerned with cranking out pretty pictures and social messages. The latter range from important bulletins about race relations in the New South - Good lord, the war's only just finished and here's Judge James Earl Jones on the bench - to lectures about married love and whether it is improved by not being married. Then there is another film still. The ghost of The Return Of Martin Guerre: in which director Daniel Vigne and star Gerard Depardieu really did knit together personal emotion and credible historical sweep and really did - unlike Sommersby - set our heads ringing to questions about identity, imposture and the subversive mysteries of love. ****** After so much romance, here is Billy Crystal setting the nightclub tables on a roar in Mr Saturday Night. He plays stand-up comic Buddy Young Jr, a sort of George Burns meets Mel Brooks and do you both know Jack Benny. As we scramble to unscramble Young's career the film darts about in time, zigzagging from childhood to second childhood via marriage (Julie Warner), sibling rivalry (agent-brother David Paymer) and multiplying layers of old-man latex (make-up artist, Peter Montagna). Crystal wrote and directed as well as starring, and the strain tells near the end. The film keeps trying to stop, only to be caught up by another wave of would-be plot resolution and emotional uplift. We are in Buddy's twilight years, when he must sob on all shoulders and bury all hatchets, including those still sticking out of his family and friends. Grin and bear it. Much of what goes before is joyous, including the hero's motormouthed gag routines on and off the stage. He varies his friendly venom from audience to audience: 'What's this, a Civil War Reunion?' for the zimmer-framed oldies of a Florida retirement home, 'I can show you something you've never seen before - your feet' to the fat heckler in the vaudeville theatre . . . While the jokes change, the Crystal charisma stays gloriously the same. We saw it in When Harry Met Sally and City Slickers: the baby-faced, twinkle-lipped bravado that takes the most innocent remark and writes gentle, witty malice all through it.</p>

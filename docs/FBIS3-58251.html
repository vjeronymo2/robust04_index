			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Francois Leotard, French minister of state </F> for defense by correspondent Franz-Olivier Giesbert; place and  date not given--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Giesbert] Good morning, Mr. Leotard. You are  the man of the day for several reasons. First, because you have  just come back from a lightning trip to Saudi Arabia with  Edouard Balladur -- without anything very specific, in fact, but  a lot of promises. Are you dIsappointed?    [Leotard] No, no. Not disappointed. With contracts that are  likely to end up being signed, and which are very large, but  that was not the only, or major, aim of our visit. We also held  very important political discussions in that country.    [Giesbert] Good. You are also the man of the day because of  the NATO summit opening in Brussels today. There is going to be  a lot of talk about Bosnia. By the way, did you see the article  by Bernard Koucher and Michel Rocard in yesterday's JOURNAL DU  DIMANCHE? For them, the alternative is simple: Get shooting or  get out. In other words, humanitarian action is over now; we  have to move on to military action.    [Leotard] Yes. A black and white solution in this sort of  tragedy -- it is not very responsible to say that.    [Giesbert] But before you were a minister, did you not use  to  say the same sort of thing?    [Leotard] Let me tell you that as far as shooting is  concerned, we do that when we have to respond. Getting out  means abandoning the women and children that we are currently  protecting, the civilian population in other words, giving up  the French role in that part of the world. It probably means  allowing the conflagration in the Balkans to spread. So, I do  not think that the alternative is as brutal, or as simple, if I  may say so, as that. We are retorting, and we will go on  retorting still more if we go on being attacked. That is quite  proper. But at the same time we are holding discussions with  our partners to see how we can continue to manage the situation  politically, and not just militarily.    [Giesbert] People do not always understand your position  very  clearly. One day you raise the question of a withdrawal from  Bosnia, another day you raise the need for reinforcements, and  in the end you [word indistinct] on Bosnia.    [Leotard] No, you journalists in general are strange. You  ask if we are going to stay indefinitely, and we say no, because  we do not stay indefinitely anywhere in the world. Then you  say: Ah, that means you are going to withdraw? It is obvious  that one day or other the United Nations forces -- the United  Nations forces, not just French ones -- will withdraw from  Bosnia. That is obvious. But we are not going to do it now.    [Giesbert] Before becoming a minister you adopted very  hard-line, very interventionist positions. [words indistinct]    [Leotard] Mr. Giesbert, when there were no troops on the  ground, not a single soldier, and not a single French soldier of  course, I supported air strikes -- and I remain convinced that I  was right. Once we have soldiers on the ground, who are  humanitarian forces, accompanying convoys, let us make sure that  air strikes -- which one day or other will of course have to be  made -- do not have even more serious consequences [words  indistinct]. [passage omitted]    [Giesbert] Mr. Leotard, the NATO summit will also deal with  the problem of the former people's democracies, like Poland, or  the Czech Republic, who want to join the club. Do you think  they should be made to wait, and then given a hard time, as is  happening?    [Leotard] I think their movement toward the West, toward us,  should be done in stages. We suggested to them that they should  be associated with the WEU, which is our European security  organization, and today and tomorrow in Brussels we will discuss  the American formula -- which is not contradictory, in fact --  of partnership for peace.    In other words, what we want is to bring them in  progressively, and not all at once, to the security process that  we Europeans are now constructing. I think this is the right  way.    [Giesbert] I imagine you have read the AFP interview with  the  president? [on France not rejoining NATO military command and  need for nuclear tests]    [Leotard] Of course.    [Giesbert] Had he shown it to you before?    [Leotard] No, and I can tell you that I see him every week  because that is my job, and we tell each other what each has to  say on the problems of defense, that is to say, according to our  responsibilities. There is nothing in the interview that I am  not aware of, that might worry me.    [Giesbert] He rejects a French return to the NATO command.  You agree with that?    [Leotard] Yes. We have always said that. The current  government shares this position completely.    [Giesbert] He also comes out against a resumption of nuclear  tests. You agree with that too?    [Leotard] That is the only point -- and even here he knows  quite well that we are not in agreement, except in the  short-term, because in the short-term there is of course no  threat to our deterrent force, which is perfectly credible. But  we think, I think, and will go on thinking, that over several  years, (?as soon as possible) we will have to resume testing  with a very specific aim, namely so that France can acquire  simulation techniques. We cannot get these techniques -- which  will make it possible for us to do without tests to a large  extent -- without holding some today, precisely in order to  acquire this technology -- as the Americans have done,  incidentally, in the past few years and months.    So that is the only point, but he is very well aware of the  government's position and his own. [passage omitted]</p>

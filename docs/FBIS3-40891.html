			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 16 January Manila BALITA in Tagalog  on page 2 reports that Interior Secretary Rafael Alunan has  proposed legalizing the clandestine gun-making industry to curb  the spread of unlicensed guns, and at the same time earn dollars  from weapons exports to Asian countries. Alunan said that as a  first step toward legalization, unlicensed gunsmiths in central  Danao city, the country's gun-manufacturing center, could form a  cooperative. BALITA reports that efforts to quash the industry  have failed, partly because the gunsmiths are protected by some  politicians.    The paper also reports that Danao gunsmiths, formerly  farmers, produce thousands of guns every year, and these guns  find their way into the hands of criminal gangs in Japan and  Taiwan. The guns include revolvers, shotguns, and pistols that  sell for $25 to $290.</p>

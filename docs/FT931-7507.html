			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Letter: Prompt release of information the best counter to leaks Sir, Surely the obvious way to combat leaks of official statistics ('CSO combats leaks of official statistics', February 20) is for the Central Statistical Office to release this information as soon as it is available. There really is very little point in companies and organisations endeavouring to make prompt statistical returns if ministers then sit upon the results. This type of statistical information is not just price sensitive, but is used in a whole variety of important applications within industry, and the sooner it is made available the more useful it is. The situation with regard to the retail price index is, of course, particularly scandalous. First, the latest information is withheld from the public for nearly two weeks after becoming available and, second, this is a statistic which, if derived from the electronic databases of a representative sample of leading retailers, could in fact become almost a real-time item of data similar to the FT index. Instead, I understand that much of the information used is still collected by investigators visiting stores and noting down prices.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 27 January, at the provincial conference on  discipline inspection and supervisory work, Jiang Chunyun,  secretary of the provincial party committee, stressed the need  to further strengthen leadership and do a solid job to firmly  grasp and achieve even greater results in anticorruption  campaign closely around the demand for the whole party's work  known as seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, promoting  development, and maintaining stability.    Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and governor of the province, presided over the  conference. Leading Comrades Li Zhen, Lu Maozeng, and Tan Fude  attended the conference. Jiang Chunyun made an important speech.    Jiang Chunyun said: Struggling against corruption is one of  the three major events emphatically grasped by the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council last year. Over the past five  months, party and government organizations at all levels in the  province have conscientiously implemented the important speeches  of Comrade Jiang    Zemin and the guidelines of the second plenary session of  the  Central Discipline Inspection Commission, have exerted great  efforts in doing a lot of work for struggling against  corruption. In general terms, the central authorities' target  of achieving marked results in anticorruption campaign at the  present stage has already been fulfilled basically.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: This year, the general demand on  the provincial discipline inspection and supervisory work is to  continuously carry out the CPC Central Committee's decision on  waging the struggle against corruption, closely around the  central task of economic construction, by implementing the  guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress and the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, under the guidance of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building the socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, in order to  carry on the anticorruption campaign in a penetrating manner  with even greater results on the basis of consolidating the  already achieved results.    Jiang Chunyun stressed that attention should be paid to the  issues in the following four aspects: First, we should pay  attention to the focus and continue to make leading cadres  clean, honest, and strict with themselves. This year, the focus  of the anticorruption campaign should be still placed on the  leading cadres at or above the county and city levels. Leading  party and government organizations at all levels in the province  should further maintain administrative honesty in combination  with their respective realities in line with the five  stipulations and new demands set by the central authorities.  Leading comrades of all localities must take a lead and set an  example for their subordinates. Lower levels should also  positively help leading organs in struggling against corruption  rather than interfering with it.    Second, we should grasp [words indistinct] to safeguard the  seriousness of party and administrative discipline. In  investigating and handling cases, we should place emphasis on  leading party and government organs, judicial departments, law  enforcing administrative departments, and economic management  departments. Party and government organizations at all levels  should further strengthen leadership and support discipline and  law enforcing departments to handle cases. Those who obstruct  and interfere with the handling of cases, who conceal and refuse  to report cases, who pigeonholed cases and refuse to investigate  them, and who investigate cases but refuse to pose punishment  should be [words indistinct] immediately. We should persist in  the system of making party and government leaders assume the  responsibility for handling cases, and the cases that are  difficult to be handled should be taken on by first and second  top leaders of party committees. Discipline and law enforcing  organizations should persist in principles and [words  indistinct] Once major clues for solving cases are discovered,  they should be seized firmly. No matter who is involved, all  cases should be investigated thoroughly and dealt with  resolutely without any tolerance. Severe punishment should be  given to those who indulge in the practice of higher authorities  having policies and the localities having their countermeasures  and to those who infringe upon the overall interests for the  sake of the immediate, partial, and small groups' interests.    Third, we should pay attention to checking the unhealthy  trends strongly commented by the masses. In correcting the  unhealthy trends of various trades, we should proceed from the  heads of trades and from the sources. By adopting the method of  clearing up higher levels first and lower levels then and  combining higher levels with lower ones, leading organs should  take the lead in clearing up unhealthy trends and solving  problems. Organizational departments, in particular, must set  an example for the whole province.    Fourth, we should grasp systems and gradually bring the work  of opposing corruption and advocating administrative honesty to  the orbit of institutionalization and standardization. The most  important thing to solve the corruption problem is to depend on  laws and systems. We should study the laws and characteristics  of market economy, unite them with reform and development, and  gradually set up a supervisory and restriction mechanism that is  suitable for the socialist market economic system.    Jiang Chunyun stressed: We should actually strengthen  leadership over the anticorruption campaign. The campaign has  now entered the stage of tackling the most difficult problems.  Success or failure in achieving substantive progress in this  campaign has a bearing on the prestige of the party among the  masses and on reform, development, and stability. Party and  government organizations at all levels must actually strengthen  leadership, be meticulous in organization, and firmly grasp the  anticorruption campaign. We should strictly grasp policies and  principles to promote the sound and effective progress of the  anticorruption campaign.</p>

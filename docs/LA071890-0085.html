			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REV. CLIFTON MOORE; RELIGIOUS RADIO-TV PIONEER  </P> <P> The Rev. Clifton E. Moore, who started a unique radio ministry in Los Angeles  in 1948, one since copied by hundreds of other clergymen across America, has  died in Irvine at 81.  </P> <P> Moore, a Presbyterian minister and former chairman of radio and TV for the  Southern California Council of Churches and for the Los Angeles Church  Federation, died Saturday at his home in the Orange County city.  </P> <P> He was a successful parish minister in Ohio before deciding to become a radio  specialist, and he came to Los Angeles with a family and no job -- just a  revolutionary idea.  </P> <P> He had tinkered with radio broadcasting before deciding on a full-time ministry  over the airwaves, a plan that was to eventually result in nominations for many  of of radio and television's top awards.  </P> <P> He attended the National Broadcasting Co.'s institute in Los Angeles and, after  graduating, approached Dr. Louis H. Evans Sr., pastor of Hollywood Presbyterian  Church, one of the nation's largest, about a Christmas broadcast. The resulting  program featured James Stewart, Dennis Morgan, Virginia Mayo and other  prominent Hollywood figures and so impressed Evans that he made Moore his first  minister of radio and television, a position he held for several years.  </P> <P> Moore eventually became director of radio and television for the Synod of  Southern California for the United Presbyterian Church and then executive  director of the Commission on Radio-Television-Films for the Council of  Churches of Southern California.  </P> <P> In 1972, he was named executive director for the Religious  Radio-Television-Film Assn. of Southern California.  </P> <P> His longest-running and most-celebrated TV programs included "Give Us This  Day," "Faith of Our Children" (which won six local Emmy awards) and "Great  Churches of the Golden West" (which featured 500 churches over 13 years and  received a special Governor's Award Emmy).  </P> <P> In 1973, the year before he retired, Moore produced 65 programs on Channel 2,  52 on Channel 4, 26 on Channel 7 and 52 each on Channels 11 and 13, along with  countless radio spots.  </P> <P> Moore mused about his career in an interview on the eve of retirement, saying  that "my greatest success was not so much what I did, but that a warm body got  into the ecumenical field in this way. . . . I was the bell cow that kind of  set a pattern for it."  </P> <P> A funeral service for Moore, who did his graduate work at Princeton Theological  Seminary, Western Reserve University in Cleveland and UCLA, will be held at 11  a.m. Thursday at Pacific View Chapel in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Survivors include his daughter, Gloria Rothschild, a sister, a brother and five  grandchildren.  </P></p>

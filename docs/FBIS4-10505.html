			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Manuel Lopez Calo] </F>   [Text] The financial crisis had a very high price for the  country, reaching 10 percent of GDP. Credit assistance reached  363.058 billion bolivares (6 percent of GDP) and there was  capital flight worth $2.65 billion during the first quarter of  the year. The collapse of important banks created such a climate  of distrust that those holding liquid assets were forced to  purchase foreign exchange in an amount eight times greater than  the decrease in international reserves for the entire year of  1993.    The reopening of Banco Latino, where the problems confronted  by the banking system were first detected, coincides with the  decline of the crisis in the financial system. The intervention  at Banco Latino was a bad business for the government in terms  of opportunity costs, but the lowest point of the curve seems to  have passed. The Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV), announcing the  reserve levels at the end of the first quarter, reported that  the foreign exchange movement had begun returning to normal.    With a balance of $12.656 billion in gross reserves at the  end of 1993 and a positive balance in the current account of the  balance of payments--$937 million at the close of the first  quarter--the gross amount of foreign currency to date is $10.943  billion, which means there had to be a $2.65 billion flight of  capital.  <H8>  Indebtedness To Bridge the Gap </H8>   The government made a cut in the 1994 Credit Law to reduce  net public indebtedness. Liabilities of 240 billion bolivares,  equivalent to $2.1 billion, are expected, but 100 billion  bolivares are expected to be amortized.    The government's objective is to reduce the number of  sources  of financing from multilateral organizations not considered  priority and which are tied to requirements that the government  cannot meet. But this shift in the government strategy harms the  position of the capital account of the balance of payments.    The multilateral organizations' loans committed to social  programs allowed the country to capitalize the loans because  they did not signify expenditures of the country's foreign  currency. This mechanism would mitigate the negative tendency of  the balance of payments.    The governmental goal of the 1995 Umbrella Law is to commit  resources to purchasing strategic military equipment, ruling out  the possibility of capitalizing the indebtedness.  <H8>  Necessary Aid </H8>   The monetization of financial aid could promote inflation if  the BCV does not use mechanisms to reduce liquidity. An increase  in the monetary base without an increase in goods and services  produced by society increases the price of products. This,  however, was a necessary evil to reestablish the system's  stability.    The failure of one bank could generate the failure of  others,  a risk the fiscal authorities did not want to take. One  peculiarity of the financial crisis is that there is a  systematic relationship: The collapse of bad banks could provoke  the failure of good banks.    Without a solid financial system, it is impossible to think  about the entry of new capital. The people's distrust increases  the demand for dollars, creating distortions in the economy, as  occurred in the country in the first quarter of the year.  <H8>  Cover Deficit in the Current Account </H8>   The basic objective of the government's stabilization  program  is to obtain a macroeconomic equilibrium to reestablish a  climate of confidence that will open new opportunities for  private investment and promote productive activity. The entry of  capital would improve the balance of capital, thus strengthening  the country's international reserves.    If we are unable to attract foreign exchange capital, our  international reserves will continue to decrease. The current  account will continue along the same trend of 1993 and might  reach a $3-billion deficit balance this year. The entry of  nonspeculative and short-term foreign exchange capital would  strengthen the Venezuelan position. A climate of political  stability and an economic proposal devoid of excessive  adventurism could be the key to recovering investor confidence.</p>

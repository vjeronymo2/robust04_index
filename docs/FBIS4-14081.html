			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has invited  the leader of the opposition, Mr. Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, to  accompany her as an honorable member of the delegation to  participate in the new government's inauguration ceremony in  Pretoria next month. In a letter to the leader of the  opposition, she said after nearly four decades of unremitting  struggle against the pernicious system of apartheid, South  Africa is on the threshold of a new era of freedom and equality.  Following the first-ever general election, the first  democratically elected President of South Africa will be sworn  in on the 10th of next month. She said: Your presence at this  historic event will be a befitting tribute to the struggle of  the black majority of South Africa in achieving their just  rights.</p>

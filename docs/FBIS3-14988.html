This first  session is planned for March 15th, stated to BASA Pavel Rotaru,  from the Parliamentary Press Service. Before February 27th,  former MP's should have abandoned their ID's and diplomatic  passports. Parliament commissions have formally finished their  existence on the eve of elections, but most deputies engaged in  commissions are still in offices in the parliament building,  said Rotaru. He noted that the future MP's will enjoy the  parliament's rooms and services only after the Central Electoral  Commission confirm their status and their mandates are validated  during first sessions of the new parliament.</p>

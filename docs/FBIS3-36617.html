In his interviews and statements he urged officers who  retired from the Russian armed forces and who, under the laws of  the Estonian Republic, are threatened with deportation, to form  self- defence units and to resist by force any attempts to evict  them.    Petr Rozhok told ITAR-TASS: "We live in the Russian land."    Mikhail Toporov, executive secretary of the Veterans Union  in  E stonia, said that this is a provocation aimed at creating  another hot spot in Europe. "We have decided to defend our  rights by political methods. We sent complaints against the  denial of residence and eviction of former officers to the  United Nations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe, the European Council and other organisations. We must  take realities into consideration which representative of  Zhirinovskiy's party refuses to do...", he said.    Estonian newspapers reported on Tuesday that the activity of  representative of the LDPR in Estonia, Petr Rozhok, will be  discussed by the next cabinet meeting.</p>

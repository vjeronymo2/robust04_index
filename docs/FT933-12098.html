			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / US Money and Credit: Rally threatens to run out of steam BOTH ends of the US yield curve were given a firm tug upwards last week, ending a period of equanimity in short-term interest rates and putting paid to the seemingly inexorable march of long-term rates to ever-lower levels. Just a temporary setback, or the beginning of the end for the bond market's prolonged rally? The answer could become clearer this week, as the latest batch of economic data - including provisional gross domestic product for the second quarter - reveals just how fast the recovery is proceeding. It was not difficult to see why short-term yields rose. Appearing before the House Banking Committee on Tuesday to deliver his biannual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, surprised the bond market with what was taken to be a warning that interest rates would have to go up in the near future. The bond market had allowed itself to be reassured by the inflation data for the last two months. But Mr Greenspan was having none of it: consumer price inflation had stabilised at around 3 per cent, he said. With Federal funds at the same level, real interest rates were effectively zero - a level that was not sustainable indefinitely. The level of real interest rates has been upgraded by the Fed as an economic indicator, he said, along with other indicators like the price of gold (which has bounced back from its seven-year low this spring). The significance of money supply data had been downgraded. Mr Greenspan's change in emphasis hurt short-dated paper: by the end of the week, the yield on two-year Treasury bills had risen by some 25 basis points, to 4.2 per cent. Mr Greenspan's inflation-bashing comments should have given heart to the long end of the bond market. Instead, they were taken as an excuse for a round of profit-taking: a 6.5 per cent yield had been seen by many as marking the floor for long-term bond yields, and this seemed as good an excuse as any to lock in some of the gains of recent weeks. From a yield a week before of 6.54 per cent, the long bond had widened out to 6.7 per cent at the end of last week. The progress of the Clinton administration's deficit-reduction package, and the prospect of a deluge of new bonds from companies, municipals and the federal government, were also hanging heavily over the long bond. Hopes that a compromise deficit-reduction bill between the Senate and Congress would be stitched together before the August recess were damaged by a gathering corruption scandal that threatens to engulf Mr Dan Rostenkowski, a key Democrat negotiator in the process. Meanwhile, companies lined up to lock in to low long-term rates while they were still around. Disney and Coca-Cola led the charge down the yield curve, producing the first 100-year bonds in the US for nearly four decades. Companies tapped the markets for nearly Dollars 10bn during the week, double the level of the week before. It all added up to a good reason for investors to sell bonds. But how far will the market retreat? Data this week is expected to maintain the positive tone that has supported bonds for so long. Provisional GDP figures for the second quarter on Thursday are expected to show the economy recovering steadily after its first-quarter slowdown, at around 2.5 per cent. In the midst of last week's slide, at least one thing remained constant: the yield curve flattened further, a sign that inflationary expectations are gradually being squeezed out of the market. The gap between two and 30-year bond yields narrowed by around 15 basis points, to 250 basis points. That at least is some comfort for holders of the long bond.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: New issues The paralysis which started to grip the new issues market in May is spreading. British Printing Company, the latest UK company to postpone its flotation, is neither an unfashionable property developer nor a cable television operator. Despite its colourful past within the Maxwell empire, BPC is the kind of solid industrial company institutions would normally be happy to own. Despite flotations totalling Pounds 7bn this year - more than in the whole of 1993 - there is no shortage of institutional funds even if patience is wearing thin. While equity and bond markets are choppy, though, many institutions would rather accumulate cash than commit fresh funds. Pension funds were certainly building cash balances during the first quarter. Long gilt yields of almost 9 per cent tempted some fund managers into bonds last week. Where money is flowing into equities, larger stocks are more likely to benefit. On a yield premium of 20 per cent to the Mid 250 index, the FT-SE 100 looks most attractive to investors in search of value. A medium-sized company like BPC was therefore swimming against the tide. The flotation might have still have succeeded, but only by pricing the shares more cheaply than the company and its existing shareholders could accept. Other hopefuls may be prepared to bend a little more. Greater realism in pricing new issues was anyway overdue. The sight of big industrial groups floating subsidiaries rather than making trade sales - ECC and Hanson are cases in point - was a hint that equity market valuations had become over-blown.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Letter: DTI changes that raise hopes of greater support for exporters (2) Sir, You report ('Treasury given regulatory role', April 16) that the DTI will retain overall responsibility for insurance companies in the new division of responsibilities between the DTI and Treasury. It is to be hoped that this division will include the Export Credits Guarantee Department (the UK government insurance agency), whose formal place is with the DTI but whose policies have been systematically dictated and eroded by the Treasury during the last parliament. We look forward to the new secretary of state for trade and industry having the vision and will to establish through ECGD the long-term political initiatives which will give our exporters the stability they need to thrive and prosper.

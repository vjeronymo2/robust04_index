			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOVEMBER SALES KEEP STEP WITH INVENTORIES, EASING FEARS OF BUILDUP  </P> <P> Business inventories rose 0.4% in November and sales increased at the same  pace, the government said Tuesday in a report that analysts said bodes well for  the nation's economy in the new year.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and back lots rose to  a seasonally adjusted $753.6 billion in November, while sales reached $503.8  billion.  </P> <P> The matching 0.4% gains kept the ratio of inventories to sales at 1.50, meaning  it would take 1.5 months to exhaust inventories at the November sales pace.  </P> <P> When not accompanied by increasing sales, rising inventories can signal  economic weakness because they may lead manufacturers to order production cuts  and layoffs while they sell off reserve goods.  </P> <P> But John Hagens of WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said the new report  indicates that "at least from the inventories point of view, we think the  economy is in pretty good shape for continued growth in 1989.  </P> <P> "Oftentimes, before a recession, inventories tend to build up. There's no  evidence of any kind of excesses in inventories in the economy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Positive Sign  </P> <P> The November increase in inventories followed a minuscule rise in October and a  0.9% jump in September. It was the 23rd straight month in which inventories had  risen, but sales generally have kept pace.  </P> <P> "It looks like inventories closed out the year on a very lean note, which  should be a positive sign in terms of growth in the first half of this year,"  said Michael Evans, a forecaster in Washington. "People remained somewhat  skeptical about the durability of the recovery. They kept their inventories  rather lean."  </P> <P> The monthly increase in sales was down from a 1.3% increase in October and  virtually unchanged sales activity in September.  </P> <P> The November sales gain was led by a 0.9% rise at the retail level, followed by  a 0.5% increase at the manufacturing level. These two gains offset a 0.4%  decline in sales at the wholesale level.  </P> <P> The government last week reported that retail sales in December rose a  lackluster 0.2%.  </P> <P> The increase in inventories was led by a 0.7% rise in retailers' inventories,  followed by a 0.4% increase for manufacturers and virtually no change in  wholesale stockpiles.  </P></p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Arts: Middle-class mockery They're back. After five years of sulking in their sequins Dillie Keane has reformed Fascinating Aida, and sophisticated cabaret returns to our lives. The gap has been filled, almost manfully, by Kit and the Widow, and, with the boys also currently in town, London is remarkably soignee at the moment. Sweet FA are reassuringly the same, with songs about the plight of the single girl constantly searching for the elusive network of single men, and on the waywardness of the modern world. And yet they are reassuringly different. The maverick Keane, with her face like a crumpled wedding cake, and long time partner Adele Anderson, with the voice that reaches down almost to the testosterone level, have been joined by Issy van Randwyck, the Dutch treat. It is a brave addition, for Issy is a skilled cabaret artist, with the voice of a brazen angel and an impish smile. There is an awful lot of temperament on stage now but on first sighting this is going to be the best sung, and probably the most adventurous, FA yet. Dillie Keane has written around a dozen new songs which stay safely within the FA tradition. When three such independent women tear to pieces vociferous minorities in 'Politically Correct' you know the movement is doomed; 'Kiss and Tell' is equally scathing about cheque book adultery. But more welcome in the first half was a trio of serious songs, notably a tingling 'Haunted' by Issy, which could become the popular hit that has always eluded Keane. After the interval Fascinating Aida attempt slapstick, with the Trio Berserka from the East European state of Legovia. It is broad, funny, and almost poignant as the women, with Dillie a drunken granny, sell their culture for the Yankee dollar. It takes some time to get back into the mainstream, but after Keane has got her personal life sorted out (sort of) with 'Back with You' and her political dreams dusted down with 'Socialist Britain', FA can perform their anthem for the forlorn female, 'Sew on a Sequin', with the necessary brio. Throw in the encores, the (dodgy) costume changes, a set that would have charmed Liberace, the backchat, and the essential shade of desperation behind the bold fronts, and you have Fascinating Aida vigorously back on top. This is middle-class mockery at its most arch but if you like this sort of thing you will love it.</p>

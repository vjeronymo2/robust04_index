			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GERMANY JAILS GYNECOLOGIST WHO PERFORMED 79 ILLEGAL ABORTIONS  </P> <P> A gynecologist in the predominantly Roman Catholic state of Bavaria was jailed  for 2 1/2 years Friday for performing illegal abortions.  </P> <P> In an eight-month trial dubbed a "witch hunt" by its critics, Horst Theissen,  50, was charged with carrying out at least 79 illegal abortions between 1981  and 1987.  </P> <P> He said he knew he was breaking the law but did so because of his clients'  distressing circumstances.  </P> <P> West German law allows for a pregnancy to be terminated only when a second  doctor agrees it is socially or medically necessary. In rural, strongly  Catholic areas of southern Germany, abortion is virtually unobtainable.  </P> <P> The prosecution questioned 79 witnesses on the circumstances of their  abortions, to establish whether they could have kept the baby or given it up  for adoption.  </P> <P> Critics of the trial said it was the women who appeared to be on trial, not  Theissen, and former Health Minister Rita Suessmuth said the court violated  their privacy.  </P> <P> The radical Greens party said the verdict was a major setback for women and  doctors.  </P></p>

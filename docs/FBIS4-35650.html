			<p>BFN     [Text] Minister of Tourism and Antiquities Dr. Muhammad  'Affash al-'Adwan and his Palestinian counterpart, Ilyas Frayj,  have expressed a desire to boost relations between the two  brotherly peoples in all fields, especially in tourism and  antiquities. At a meeting in Amman today, they reviewed the  state of the tourist industry in Jordan and future ties between  Jordan and the Palestinian National Authority [PNA].    [Begin recording] [Frayj] The tourist industries in Jordan  and Palestine complement each other. Both sides, therefore,  have a vested interest in promoting the industry here in Jordan  and in Palestine. In my opinion, the future promises to be  lucrative for both the Jordanian and Palestinian peoples. This  region is home to the most important sacred and archaeological  sites in the world. I anticipate a booming tourist industry.  In a year or two a million or so tourists will be visiting  Jordan and Palestine annually.    [Al-'Adwan] I have expressed our full readiness to support  our Palestinian brothers, especially at this stage when they are  planning to set up new institutions. We also told them we would  be ready to provide training for our brother Palestinians in the  tourism and archaeology industries. [end recording]    At the end of the meeting, the sides agreed to set up a  joint  committee to formulate an executive program for the full range  of cooperation in the tourist industry between Jordan and the  Palestinian National Authority.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Salah al-Mukhtar: "1 May: Moving Away From </F> Capitalism"]    [Text] Some may ask: Have the changes in the world over  the past five years negatively affected world Labor Day? This  question has been conspicuous in recent years. A ready-made  answer is often presented: "The collapse of communism in East  Europe has brought the era of the laborer to an end." This  sinister answer links laborers to communism, as if laborers and  their defense are confined to communism. One of the greatest  acts of political deception in this century has been America's  promotion of the lie that socialism has been defeated and that  the interests of laborers, as defined by socialism, are an  illusion that will never materialize. They argue that this is  because a market economy will give the laborers only what they  deserve. Apart from this, nothing else is "part of the  jurisdiction" of the economic system. This leads to the  assumption that the poor segments of society must endure poverty  because they must accept it as their fate in life. However, the  chance for the United States to continue this deception was  short-lived, even shorter than expected by its most sworn  enemies. This is because the "market economy," which replaced  communism in East Europe, actually created misery, crime, social  and moral decadence, and cultural and political degeneration.  Thus, those who were deceived by slogans of "democracy" and  "human rights" were soon disillusioned when the human being  there became the cheapest commodity under the market economy.  Thus, the overwhelming majority of people in East Europe and  the Third World discovered that capitalism is the AIDS of the  age because it spreads poverty, social degradation, and  injustice. As the true leader of all the social classes and  segments that have been economically destroyed by the U.S.  invasion, it was natural for the working class in those  countries to resume their struggle and to swiftly turn into a  revolutionary force working for the removal of misery and  degeneration. The year 1993 truly marked the beginning of world  struggle against U.S. capitalism's attempts to conquer the world  and turn the middle class into a poor working class. Such  attempts have polarized the world into a poor majority and very  tiny rich minority. Socialism has restored its vitality and  managed to isolate the capitalist and bourgeois forces. The  conviction that social justice cannot be achieved under  capitalism has won more supporters, because the working class in  eastern Europe and some parts of western and central Europe has  freed itself of the illusions of capitalism and the market  economy. Just as late 19th century witnessed the decadence of  capitalist thought, the late 20th century will witness the  defeat of capitalism as a way of life. This raises the need for  a socialism that respects the freedom of human beings,  recognizes the private sector within a socialist understanding,  coexists with religion, and entertains strong and clear  nationalistic traits reflecting the true interests of peoples  and nations. Such a formula will overcome the weaknesses of  communism and capitalism at the same time.</p>

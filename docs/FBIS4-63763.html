			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Maltsev report in the "Another Fire at Pacific </F> Fleet Depots" column: "This Time Cannon Grease Set Alight"]    [Text] On Monday at approximately midday Moscow time  another fire broke out at Pacific Fleet depots in Vladivostok.  This is the third serious fire at the Black Sea Fleet in the  past year and the second in the last 10 days. This time the  fire occurred at a fuel and lubricant depot located in the city  center near the city's oil tanks. It was only thanks to prompt  action by firemen that the fire did not spread to the oil tanks.  The scale of the damage and causes of the fire are being  established.    As firemen told KOMMERSANT-DAILY, a report about a fire at a  military depot located 150 meters from the city's oil tanks came  in at the central control point of the Vladivostok Fire Security  Department. According to the firemen, non-disposable fuel and  lubricants were stored at the depot: cannon grease, machine oil,  and other types. Ivan Kopot, deputy chief of the Fire Safety  Department, said that the Vladivostok oil tanks are a  transshipment point for fuel deliveries to the entire Maritime  Kray and are also used for filling vessels, including oil  tankers.    The fire was rated at three on the scale of difficulty (out  of five). Ten fire engines and a fire train were sent to the  area. The work was complicated by the fact that water in the  hydrants on the storage premises was so polluted that the fire  engine hoses were repeatedly blocked. However within an hour  the seat of the fire was localized and soon it was extinguished  completely.    It is noteworthy that the two previous large fires at the  Pacific Fleet depots cost fleet commanders Gennadiy Khvatov and  Georgiy Gurinov their posts.</p>

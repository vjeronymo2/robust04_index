			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Chirac's EU vote call countered France should hold a referendum on any treaty changes resulting from the European Union's planned 1996 constitutional conference, rather than on the final move to economic and monetary union already enshrined in the Maastricht pact, Mr Alain Lamassoure, EU affairs minister, said yesterday. He was reacting to the call with which Mr Jacques Chirac recently opened his presidential campaign for France to hold a second referendum on adopting a single currency, in addition to its 1992 plebiscite approving Maastricht. The issue of a single currency 'is already settled', Mr Lamassoure told French radio. But Mr Chirac's Emu referendum call, clearly designed to give fresh hope to the anti-Maastricht camp unreconciled to its narrow defeat two years ago, unsettled the financial markets and called down criticism from the Balladur government's more pro-European ministers on Mr Chirac's head. Mr Lamassoure's remarks were carefully co-ordinated with Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister who is also Mr Chirac's main backer within the government and who on Saturday succeeded him as interim president of the Gaullist RPR party. Their initiative is designed to get the French government off the hook on which Mr Chirac's Emu referendum idea threatened to impale it as well as himself. Domestic elections will make France's presidency of the EU in the first half of next year hard enough without France appearing to cast doubt on its existing Maastricht commitment through the mouth of Mr Chirac. But, said Mr Lamassoure, the challenge of enlarging the EU to the east, as well as improving its foreign and defence policy co-ordination, would almost certainly give rise to institutional changes in 1996 meriting a referendum. Mr Lamassoure fully acknowledged yesterday that the French presidential campaign 'unquestionably poses us a problem' in the smooth chairing of Union business. France will begin its EU presidency under one president and finish it under another. Another certainty is a new government after the May 7 election. This means that June 1995 - which would otherwise be the busiest month of the France's EU presidency as it scrambles to chalk up new directives to its credit - will see new French faces chairing most or all of the various Union councils. Meanwhile, Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing European Commission president, yesterday appeared to reduce by a month the suspense over whether he will run as Socialist candidate for the presidency. He said on radio that he would say 'before Christmas' if he decided not to run. It seems, therefore, that the nearer his silence is maintained to January 25 - the new likely date for installation of the new Commission - the likelier it is that he will run.</p>

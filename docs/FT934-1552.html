			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Islamic party sets terms for Algeria talks The banned Algerian Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) yesterday set out its conditions for opening talks with the government in an attempt to end the civil conflict which has cost more than 3,000 lives in two years. The offer, which could open the way to direct negotiations, came a week after General Mohamed Touati, one of the country's most respected military leaders, said on state television that the government would consider 'talking to leaders of the FIS who show respect for the law of the land'. The FIS was banned after appearing to be on the verge of winning parliamentary elections in January 1992. Mr Rabah Khebir, the FIS spokesman who took refuge in Germany last year, said at a press conference in Bonn that his party insisted on five conditions being met before it would agree to talk to the government. These were: the freeing of all political prisoners; the repeal of laws passed under emergency rule; the establishment of a 'free and independent' committee to include the main political, religious and judicial forces in Algeria; the bringing to trial of those 'responsible for recent bloody and murderous acts'; and any talks would have to take place in a neutral country to be chosen by both sides, he said. Mr Khebir condemned the murder of 12 Croats on Tuesday near Algiers and said that the FIS 'was not behind such calls for murder'. He added: 'The Algerian people and the FIS have nothing against foreigners, who are welcome in Algeria if they want to co-operate with the people.' He also warned that a lot of what was happening in Algeria was outside the control of FIS and could lead to revolution. Responsibility for the 23 murders of foreigners over the past three months has been claimed by two other radical Islamic factions, the Groupe Islamique Arme and the Takfir wal Hijra. General Touati, whose televised statement may have provoked the FIS offer, is a member of the eight-man National Committee for Dialogue, an organisation set up in the autumn with the aim of bringing all parties to the negotiating table. Secret contacts have recently taken place between members of the committee and FIS representatives. But General Touati's offer was the first acknowledgement by a senior military commander that the outlawed FIS represents a political constituency which cannot be ignored. Other parties, such as the moderate Islamic Hamas, the lay Front des Forces Socialistes and the former ruling Front de Liberation National party, have been urging the military to extend a hand to FIS. They argue that it is the only way for Algeria to avoid a slide into civil war. Armed police yesterday rounded up dozens of men after mass Moslem prayers at two Algiers mosques frequented by fundamentalists, witnesses said.</p>

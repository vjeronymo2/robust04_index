			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Tanks and luxury cars put Vickers in reverse - How a famous name has been left vulnerable to takeover SIR COLIN Chandler, the ebullient chief executive of Vickers, the engineering group, is caught between a rock and a hard place. Making tanks is not easy in a post-Cold War world, with government defence budgets under pressure. It is even harder to be manufacturing Rolls-Royce and Bentley limousines in the depths of an international recession that has seen fashion swing sharply against the conspicuous spending excesses of the previous decade. Unfortunately these businesses are the main pillars of Vickers, a famous name in British engineering. The downturn in both areas has reduced its market value from last year's peak of Pounds 637m to its current level of Pounds 216m, making it vulnerable to predators. Sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars have fallen by 65 per cent over the past 18 months. Last month Rolls-Royce Motor Cars said it would cut a further 950 jobs, or nearly a third of the workforce, from its plant at Crewe in Cheshire, leaving the UK workforce at 2,100. At the end of 1990 the figure stood at 4,850. Uncertain market conditions contributed to the failure of intensive efforts this year to find a strategic partner for Rolls-Royce, despite serious discussions with rivals such as BMW of Germany. Sir Colin intends to trade Rolls-Royce from a new breakeven position of 1,400 cars a year, down from 2,800 in 1990. He also believes that negotiations on some sort of partnership will resume when markets improve. Meanwhile, however, the restructuring at Rolls-Royce has savaged Vickers' results and share price. In the six months to June 30, the group made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.3m, having lost Pounds 12.4m in 1991 as a whole. The latest redundancies at Crewe will be taken as a Pounds 12m exceptional charge in the second half of the year. The tanks business is profitable, but the outlook is uncertain. Last year the group won a British government contract worth Pounds 500m to produce 140 of its new Challenger 2 battle tanks, work which should last until 1998. However, this week Vickers accused the Americans of using political leverage in Kuwait to clinch a tank deal for General Dynamics, involving the sale of 236 M1A2 Abrams tanks. Vickers still hopes to sell hundreds of tanks to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. However the current dominant role of the US in the area following the Gulf war makes that outcome extremely uncertain. Vickers' best chance of winning an order seems to be in Oman, which wants only about 60 tanks. The group had also been hoping to upgrade the turrets and guns of the British army's existing Challenger 1 tanks, but that contract seems vulnerable in the current search for public spending cuts. Winning a substantial tanks order would come as a welcome relief, since the normally substantial advanced payments would help offset the cash drain caused by Rolls-Royce Motors. Debt has been rising rapidly and is likely to reach Pounds 110m by the year-end, lifting gearing to nearly 50 per cent. The cash shortage and business climate has forced the group to postpone indefinitely the costly development of a generation of new luxury cars. Instead Sir Colin said that Rolls-Royce would be seeking to evolve its existing models. So what can Sir Colin do, apart from hang on and wait for recovery? That may be the best strategy, assuming that the latest job cuts at Crewe will staunch the luxury car losses. Sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley vehicles bounced back rapidly after the last recession, and the famous marques are arguably still under-exploited. But will Vickers be allowed to follow its own path. The group's combination of famous names and low share price appear to make it vulnerable to a predator, prepared to take a long-term view and use acquisition accounting to cover the costs of further rationalisation. Sceptics counter that the tank business is highly specialised, in an industry with chronic overcapacity. And any prospective buyer of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars would have to negotiate with Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine maker, an entirely separate company, which owns the Rolls-Royce brand name. Vickers does have clutch of quality niche businesses. It dominates the UK and the US markets for neo-natal equipment such as incubators, while Cosworth engines power many of the world's racing cars, as well as some high-performance Ford cars. Ross Catherall makes super alloys for the aerospace industry and KaMeWa is the world leader in water jet propulsion technology. Vickers could strengthen its balance sheet by selling some of these businesses, although it has given no indication of intending to do so. However, it would be unlikely to obtain top prices in present market conditions, and any such disposal would counter the group's stated policy of lessening its exposure to defence. That Vickers is aware of the dangers of a bid was apparent in the careful balance of its interim results statement last month. A cut in the dividend was justified thus: 'Prospects for the year are uncertain and it is therefore prudent to conserve cash and ensure our ability to support our defence, aerospace, marine engineering, medical businesses, and Cosworth, all of which are trading satisfactorily.' Last autumn Hawker Siddeley, the diversified engineering group, came out with a very gloomy results statement and BTR, the industrial conglomerate, pounced with a successful takeover offer worth Pounds 1.55bn. As a former rugby player, Sir Colin might be tempted to just keep his head down and battle on until recovery comes. However, there must also be strong chance that the chief executive will feel obliged to come up with something, such as a disposal, to make it less likely that other people's tanks appear on his lawn.</p>

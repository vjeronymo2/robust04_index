			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Councils refuse to back review The review of local govern-ment in rural England came under fresh attack yesterday as several district councils ignored national lobbying attempts by the Association of District Councils and called for the review to be abandoned. Opposition has so far come almost exclusively from county councils, but now Labour has demanded a Commons statement on the review. Mr Doug Henderson, Labour's local government spokesman, said: 'It seems that the procedure has fallen into complete chaos now and that the government have to make a complete statement in the house to clarify the position.' But Downing Street dismissed suggestions that ministers are considering ways of modifying or abandoning the reform process. A senior government official said Mr John Major, the prime minister, was aware of concern among Tory MPs and councillors. But he said rumours that Mr Major had met Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, and Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, to discuss a climbdown were incorrect. However, Ryedale District Council announced that it would mount a court challenge to the Local Government Commission's plans to abolish North Yorkshire County Council and replace it with unitary authorities. Ryedale, controlled by independents and Liberal Democrats, said it saw no need to change the two-tier system. Mr Ken Binks, chairman of Ryedale, said: 'Why abolish something that works, for a vast, costly and impossible exercise of political gerrymandering?' Association secretary, Mr Geoffrey Filkin, has urged all district councils to fax Mr Major, Mr Gummer, and Sir Norman Fowler, chairman of the Conservative party. He said they should tell the ministers that the revised review process was working and encourage the government to stand firm. But some refused. Mr Malcolm Fletcher, chief executive of Erewash District Council in Derbyshire, said: 'There's a growing feeling in Derbyshire that the review should be abandoned altogether.' Mr Geoffrey Woods, leader of North Hertfordshire District Council, also refused, saying that on preliminary indications his county would be best served by the status quo.</p>

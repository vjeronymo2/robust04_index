			<p>BFN     [Text] Osaka, April 13 KYODO -- The Asia-Pacific trade  center, the first comprehensive wholesale facility for imported  goods in Japan, will open in Osaka Thursday [14 April]. The  12-story center, with a total floor space of 335,000 square  meters, was completed by business groups and enterprises at a  cost of about 150 billion yen.    Center officials said they plan to develop the facility into  a major distribution center in Asia, which will contribute to  reducing Japan's huge trade surplus.    A total of 108 companies from Asian countries have rented  space for business outlets at the center, which can accommodate  as many as 400 stores, the officials said.    Foreign firms will be offered sales outlets at a discount  rate and have access to various services to facilitate their  entry into the Japanese market, they said.    The officials said only 58 Japanese companies will maintain  offices at the center because more than 200 firms have canceled  contracts to rent office space because of the protracted  recession.</p>

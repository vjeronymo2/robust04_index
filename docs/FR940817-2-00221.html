			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mercury compounds are potent neurotoxic substances and have caused a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human poisonings, with symptoms of vision, speech, and coordination impairments (Chang,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1980). Erethism, a syndrome with such neurologic features as tremor and behavioral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> symptoms as anxiety, irritability, and pathologic shyness, is seen in people exposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elemental mercury (Bidstrup, 1964). One major incidence of human exposure occurred in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the mid-1950's when a chemical plant near Minamata Bay, Japan, discharged mercury as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of waste sludge. An epidemic of mercury poisoning developed when the local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inhabitants consumed contaminated fish and shellfish. Congenitally affected children  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> displayed a progressive neurological disturbance resembling cerebral palsy and manifested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other neurological problems as well. In 1971, an epidemic occurred in Iraq from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methylmercury used as a fungicide to treat grain (OTA, 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manganese is used in metal alloys and has been proposed to replace lead in gasoline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is an essential dietary substance for normal body functioning yet parenteral exposure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manganese can be neurotoxic, producing a dyskinetic motor syndrome similar to Parkinson's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disease (Cook et al., 1974). Exposed miners in several countries have suffered from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``manganese madness'' characterized by hallucinations, emotional instability, and numerous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurological problems. Long-term manganese toxicity produces muscle rigidity and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> staggering gait similar to that seen in patients with Parkinson's disease (Politis et al., 1980).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Parkinsonian-like syndrome was also observed in people who accidentally ingested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (Langston et al., 1983). MPTP was a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> byproduct of a meperidine derivative sold illicitly as ``synthetic heroin.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organic solvents are encountered frequently in occupational settings. Most solvents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are volatile, i.e., they can be converted from a liquid to a gaseous state and readily inhaled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the worker. They are also lipid soluble and readily accumulate in the fat deposits of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposed organism. An example of a solvent exposure in humans is carbon disulfide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Workers exposed to high levels of this solvent were found to have an increased frequency of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depression and suicide (Seppalainen and Haltia, 1980). Furthermore, repeated exposure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic solvents is suspected of producing chronic encephalopathy. Workers exposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methyl-n-butyl ketone, a dye solvent and cleaning agent, displayed peripheral nervous system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neuropathy involving degeneration of nerve fibers (Spencer and Schaumburg, 1980).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Solvents including ether, ketones, alcohols, and various combinations are commonly used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> glues, cements, and paints and when inhaled can be neurotoxic. Repeated abuse of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvents can lead to permanent neurological effects due to severe and permanent loss of nerve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cells (OTA, 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pesticides are one of the most commonly encountered classes of neurotoxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances. These can include insecticides (used to control insects), fungicides (for blight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and mildew), rodenticides (for rodents such as rats, mice, and gophers), and herbicides (to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control weeds). Active ingredients are combined with so-called inert substances to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thousands of different pesticide formulations. Workers who are overexposed to pesticides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may display obvious signs of poisoning, including tremors, weakness, ataxia, visual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disturbances, and short-term memory loss (Ecobichon and Joy, 1982). Chlordecone exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in nervousness and tremors (Cannon et al., 1978). The organophosphorous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insecticides have neurotoxic properties and account for approximately 40 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registered pesticides. A delayed neurotoxicity can be seen as a result of exposure to certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organophosphate pesticides, producing irreversible loss of motor function and an associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neuropathology (Ecobichon and Joy, 1982). Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known to interfere with a specific enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (Davis and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Richardson, 1980). Paralysis has also been reported following consumption of nonpesticide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organophosphate products such as tri-o-cresylphosphate (TOCP).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neurotoxicities in humans, domestic livestock, and poultry associated with fungal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxins (mycotoxins) have been well documented (Kurata, 1990; Aibara, 1986; Wyllie and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Morehouse, 1978). Mycotoxins not only have a negative economic effect on animal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production, but they also represent a definite threat to human health. Mycotoxins occur in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forages, field crops, and grains used for livestock; they also are incorporated into cereals,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grains, and grain-based products used for human consumption. Therefore, human exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may occur either through direct consumption of these products or secondarily through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption of meat, milk, or eggs. An example of human exposure to fungal toxins is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Claviceps purpurea <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> - or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. paspali <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -infected wheat, barley, and oats used for bread and as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dietary supplement for livestock. These fungal toxins are notorious for producing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gangrenous and convulsive forms of the disease known as ``ergotism'' (Bove, 1970). These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fungi are in the family  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Clavicipitaceae <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and produce a group of compounds known as ergot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alkaloids, which have neurotropic, uterotonic, and vasoconstrictive activities. They may act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as dopamine agonists or serotonin antagonists, and also block alpha-adrenergic receptors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since there are numerous naturally occurring ergot alkaloids, this represents only part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their pharmacopoeia (Berde and Schield, 1978). These alkaloids are highly toxic and cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both acute and chronic poisonings. Although guidelines now limit the amount of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Claviceps <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -contaminated, or ``ergot''-contaminated, grains, these compounds may enter human food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources through secondary mechanisms. Other fungi associated with ergot-like syndromes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> livestock include  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Acremonium lolii  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Gallagher et al., 1984) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A. coenophialum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Thompson  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Porter, 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) is an indole tetramic acid produced by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aspergillus flavus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. oryzae, Penicillium cyclopium <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> P. camemberti.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This mycotoxin is suspected of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> causing ``kodua poisoning'' in humans who consumed kodo millet seed in India (Rao and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Husain, 1985).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fusarium moniliforme <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is a common fungal infection in corn (Bacon et al.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992) and directly related to neurotoxic syndrome in horses known as equine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leukoencephalomalaisia (ELEM).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Natural plant toxins also represent a health risk to both livestock and humans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Movement toward limited uses of herbicides, fungicides, and no-till agricultural practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases the possibility of noxious weeds and weed seeds being incorporated into food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. Ergot alkaloids also are produced by morning glories  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (Ipomea violacea) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be incorporated into soybeans, corn, peas, etc., during harvest. Export regulations limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> morning glory-contaminated soybeans because of the hallucinogenic and other effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced by ergot alkaloids. Jimson weed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (Datura stramonium) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , another weed incorporated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into agricultural commodities, produced scopolamine, hyocyamine, and stropine, all of which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have parasympatholytic (anticholinergic) activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recently, an outbreak of toxic encephalopathy caused by eating mussels contaminated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with domoic acid, an excitotoxin, was reported (Perl et al., 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

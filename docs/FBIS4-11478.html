			<p>CSO     [Text] The Socialist Party (PS) and the Independent  Democratic Union (UDI) yesterday announced their proposals on  the subject of corruption in public service and on the  maintenance of administrative probity.    The PS presented its criteria on the subject and described  the proposed Code of Conduct that the party intends to apply to  all of its members who are employed in public service during the  current administration.    The document states that the PS will apply maximum sanctions  to all public officials who are PS members and who become  involved in any kind of corruption.    The UDI, meanwhile, through Deputy Juan Antonio Coloma,  proposed several specific measures to deal with the problem,  among which he mentioned exhaustive background investigations of  persons who are appointed to public service, and a change in the  regulations on the creation of investigative commissions in the  Chamber.    The proposed Code of Conduct for Social officials was  described by the secretary general of the PS, Gonzalo Martner,  who said that the party would make its observance obligatory for  all public servants who are party members, after the document is  submitted for the approval of the next General Council on 16 and  17 April.    The document states that in the event of any evidence of  corruption on the part of any member of the PS in the  performance of his public duties, the PS Directorate will send  all the evidence to the Supreme Tribunal of the party, with the  express request to apply the maximum sanctions provided by the  statutes.    In addition, the proposal establishes the obligation on the  part of all PS members in public office to respect rigorously  the Basic Law of Administration of the State, which requires  them to execute their orders faithfully and to observe the  principle of administrative probity, with preeminence of the  public interest over private.    It also states that the Socialists must orient their  activities toward the satisfaction of civic demands and respect  for the user as the foundation of public service.    Gonzalo Martner said that it was the aim of the PS to  conclude a series of legislative debates in the ordinary session  of Congress next 18 September, that had already been presented  on that subject by ex-Senator Laura Soto (PPD [Party for  Democracy]) and Congresswoman Olga Feliu, in addition to the  initiative for a model law on official probity presented last  week by the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Jorge  Schaulsohn.    PS Vice President Ricardo Solari said that honesty and the  fight against corruption are indispensable components in  modernizing the state.    The PS leader said that his party will promote a series of  initiatives aimed at preventing corruption. He mentioned among  them legislation that would punish influence peddling, as this  is not considered punishable under current legislation.    He added that his party wants to begin a discussion on the  subject of granting the opposition the faculty to constitute  investigative commissions because, at present, the decision to  create a body of that type can only be taken by a majority of  deputies.    Nevertheless, the Socialist leader said that at the same  time  ways must be sought to prevent that function from being used for  calumny or for gratuitous attacks on individuals or officials.    Ricardo Solari also spoke of the need for legislation to  make  a clear distinction between the exercise of public functions and  the administration of private business.    The PS vice president said that, in his opinion, the  financing of political and electoral activities should have an  important public contribution component.    He said that donations to political campaigns should be  characterized by transparency, assigning them a spending ceiling  and providing equal access to political financing for all  participants.    He believed that a public component in financing political  activities would be a way of preventing corruption.    Solari said that the salaries of senior and middle grade  government officials should be compatible with current  conditions in a modern Chile.    He stressed the importance of improving salary levels,  because otherwise the state administration could be faced with a  flight of talent to the private sector.    UDI Deputy Juan Antonio Coloma called for a change in the  regulations that establish that a Special Investigative  Commission of the Chamber can be formed only by agreement of a  majority of deputies.    He called for the requirement to be lowered to a third of  the  votes, and that members of the commission be designated by  lottery and not by the political parties.    He said that it would be appropriate for the presidency of  each such commission to go to the congressman making the  accusation.    With regard to administrative probity and corruption, the  congressman advanced a series of proposals on behalf of his  party designed to deal with the problem.    Coloma appealed to the country's leaders to make government  appointments based on candidates' qualifications and abilities,  and not on their political affiliations.    In the opposition congressman's opinion, many recent  appointments have been made according to political quotas,  although the new government had said publicly that it would do  the opposite.    The congressman spoke of the importance of fighting against  the state bureaucracy, as he believes it represents a source of  corruption.    Coloma called for greater transparency on the part of  members  of Congress, so that all votes on legislation be public and by  roll call vote, thus preventing congressmen from promising one  thing and doing another when it comes to voting.    In addition to calling for specific solutions to the  problem,  Coloma said that a year ago the government was denying that  corruption existed and was accusing the opposition of using the  issue for electoral purposes. He said that President Frei  recognizes that there is a real danger of corruption.    Coloma also dismissed statements by DC [Christian Democratic  Party] Senator Jose Ruiz de Giorgio, who said on Friday that the  opposition had refused last year to create an ethics commission  in the Senate.    Coloma said that the senator's words were a serious blunder  that confused public opinion and were an attempt to hide serious  weaknesses inside Concertation.    The principal leaders of the Democratic Party of the Left  (PDI) emphasized the need yesterday, at the Ministry of  Interior, to coordinate initiatives to prevent and combat  corruption.    The President of the PDI, Deputy Fanny Pollarolo, together  with party leaders Antonio Leal and Pablo Mecklenburg, met at La  Moneda with Minister German Correa to offer their support for  the new responsibilities that he has just assumed.    The PDI representatives took advantage of the occasion to  exchange views with the secretary of state on corruption, a  subject of great concern to the political community.    "We reaffirm our decision to work very hard on this matter,  to put an end to a problem that exists in our country, and to  which we cannot close our eyes," declared Congresswoman  Pollarolo.    The political leaders discussed with the minister the  advisability of coordinating the various anticorruption measures  proposed by all sectors of the country.    Included among the proposals are the appointment of an  "ombudsman," who would gather accusations of corruption and the  strengthening of the investigative powers of the Comptroller's  Office.    Fanny Pollarolo called for the creation of a governmental  body that would collect and systematize all of the initiatives  in this area.    In any case, she announced, she has been considering this  matter and is preparing to form a ministerial coordination  working group on the problem of corruption.</p>

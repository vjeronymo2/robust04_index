			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE OF HUD AND ITS PROGRAMS  </P> <P> The mess at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development seems to be a  never-ending story. The public image of all HUD programs is one of a giant  fiasco. HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has even referred to some of the programs as a  "swamp." Organizations that have used HUD funds prudently and wisely are now  becoming suspect.  </P> <P> Neighborhood Housing Services of La Habra Inc. is a private, nonprofit  corporation that has been the recipient of HUD Funds through the Community  Development Block Grant program since 1977. This public/private partnership,  governed by a board of neighborhood residents, city officials and local  business leaders, has received some $920,000 in CDBG housing funds. The funds  have been used to assist hundreds of low-income families through loans to  repair and improve their homes.  </P> <P> These funds have been used prudently. They have been used wisely. They have  been loaned and repaid and loaned again. More than $3 million in home  improvement has been funded from the original $920,000 and assets in the fund  now totals $1.17 million.  </P> <P> Drain the swamp, but preserve and encourage those programs that are on high  ground. Much work remains to be done if we are to decently house American  families.  </P> <P> GLENN HAYES  </P> <P> Executive Director, Neighborhood Housing Services of La Habra  </P></p>

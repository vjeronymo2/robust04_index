			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Arts: Madama Butterfly - Opera The business of archiving opera has hardly begun in earnest. At a time when productions are expected to be up-to-the-minute in novelty and relevance, it is unfashionable to point out that there is also a case for preserving those thought to have historic value - the Royal Opera's Tosca and Don Carlos come to mind. Perhaps a start is being made. To open the new season, the Royal Opera is bringing back its old production of Madama Butterfly. No reason has been given. It may be that its intrinsic quality makes it a special case. More likely, its replacement was deemed unworthy of further revival. Either way Sophie Fedorovitch's sets from 1950 had fortunately been kept in a warehouse and now look fresh and nicely stylised. After a production which had Butterfly living in a squalid, modern tenement block, they make one realise how important the right time and place are in this opera. The social background of turn-of-the-century Japan is essential if Butterfly is to be an outcast, left to live and die alone. The very privacy of her feelings is what the character is about and it is an irony that Puccini's music should come from the most outgoing, emotive operatic style of all: therein lies the opera's great emotional tension. At least, in a good performance it should feel like that. This one, though better technically than the Royal Opera's previous revivals, was unmoving. After some of the Puccini conducting heard at Covent Garden of late, Carlo Rizzi's generally idiomatic feel for the score was a step in the right direction. He likes a firm and concentrated Puccini sound and the orchestra played well for him. Diana Soviero is an American soprano with an Italian-sounding name and voice, like Anna Moffo before her or Catherine Malfitano (also a Royal Opera Butterfly) today. The number of times she took breaths to prepare for a top note suggests some degree of strain in tackling the role; otherwise she has sufficient power for it, a cutting edge to the tone, the ability to make the words tell. But I was always aware of a singer and actress at work. Her predecessor here, Yoko Watanabe, was natural and infinitely more touching. Arthur Davies was again Pinkerton, singing a little more freely than before, though he continues to look uneasy in the role. Alan Opie joined him as a mellow, thoughtful Sharpless, both of them sounding overparted in the first act (their roles were taken by Zenatello and De Luca at the premiere, rather more forceful Italianate voices). Anne-Marie Owens's Suzuki alone is all heart, losing none of her warmth in the transfer from English National Opera. To come out of Madama Butterfly and not even to have thought of shedding a tear is a bad sign. The staging by Richard Gregson is said to be new, but it keeps to the obvious until the end, when Butterfly flings her screen aside and writhes around in agony on the floor for all to see, providing a final shock-horror tableau. If there was an archive film from 1950, it would surely have preserved something more affecting.</p>

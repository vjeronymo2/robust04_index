			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL AT AMBASSADOR  </P> <P> I am appalled at the inaccuracies of many of the statements Sam Hall Kaplan has  used to lambaste the Los Angeles School District for attempting to acquire the  Ambassador Hotel site for use as a high school ("Board Ignores Signals in  No-Trump Deal" May 20).  </P> <P> Our building staff has done its homework and knows its business. Many of  Kaplan's suggestions already have been implemented or studied. We'd be more  inclined to hear Kaplan's ideas if they were presented in a balanced and fair  way.  </P> <P> The school board was interested in the site for school use long before Trump  arrived on the scene. The district's building staff has spent more than two  years studying and evaluating 57 separate sites in the Mid-Wilshire area.  </P> <P> The sites were all either more costly than the Ambassador site, or, for those  that didn't cost more, would require significant destruction of affordable  housing and the relocation of many residents. In the past, Kaplan has taken us  to task for taking housing in other projects. No matter what we do, there seems  to be no way for us to satisfy him.  </P> <P> A lengthy environmental report for this project was completed in 1989. This  project has been fully approved by the state Department of Education, and has  met, and exceeded, all the rules and requirements of the State Allocation Board  that funds school construction.  </P> <P> The $73 million being requested is a reasonable amount of money based on the  amount of land needed for a high school and the typical cost of land in the  area.  </P> <P> Kaplan summarizes our joint use proposal accurately, but describing it as a  "scheme yet to be made public" is both untrue and absurd. Our joint-use plans  have been presented to the press and public on a number of occasions in the  past two months, one such instance being reported in The Times on April 22.  </P> <P> I can assure Kaplan that the school board is not interested in joint  development of the site because we want to be "a player" in local development.  We have proposed joint development because we agree with him that innovative  approaches to land use are needed in this crowded urban area.  </P> <P> Kaplan also suggests that the joint development proposal is "unmarketable" and  "unfeasible." We wonder if he has been talking mainly with the Trump  organization, which is uninterested in joint development. Other developers have  approached the district with an interest in this and other joint development  projects.  </P> <P> Kaplan is welcome to express his personal opinion over any of the board's past  or present school planning or design efforts, but I do take exception when he  sets himself up as an educational expert. Kaplan's comments about test scores,  dropout rates and school crime are irrelevant and far from the mark.  </P> <P> Kaplan concludes by calling on the board to come up with more imaginative ideas  to provide classroom seats. I believe the board's joint use proposal for the  site is just such an innovation.  </P> <P> Some might conclude from Kaplan's article that he favors developers over the  need of schoolchildren. But the issue here is not the board versus Donald Trump  or any other real estate developer. It is about building schools for children  now, not some time in the future. The board is convinced that the Ambassador is  the best site for a school in the area, and that is why we have been so firm in  seeking the site.  </P> <P> JACKIE GOLDBERG  </P> <P> Goldberg is president of theLos Angeles City Board of Education.  </P> <P> </P></p>

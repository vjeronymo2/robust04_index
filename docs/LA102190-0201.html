			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON / CATHERINE COLLINS;  </P> <P> FISHY DOINGS ON CAPITOL HILL MAY BE GOOD FOR CONSUMERS  </P> <P> Congress is up to its gills in fish bills. And the fishing industry will soon  get its first law requiring fish inspections.  </P> <P> To date, fish is the only flesh food not subject to a comprehensive, mandatory  federal inspection program. Yet the Food and Drug Administration estimates that  about 64,230 illnesses and 22 deaths result each year from contaminated  seafood.  </P> <P> Congress has considered several bills in the past five years in the hopes that  a better inspection process would provide better consumer protection and public  health. How to accomplish that in these times of budget shortages is central to  the debate.  </P> <P> There are three main issues. The first is a question of turf -- which agency  will run the program. The favored choices are the FDA, which operates the  current program of random inspections, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture,  which runs the meat and poultry inspection programs.  </P> <P> The second issue is a definition of "adulteration" or contamination and the  public health standard that should apply to fish that contains contaminants for  which there are no regulations.  </P> <P> The third issue is whistle-blower protection. The meat and poultry industries,  which have no whistle-blower protection, have lobbied hard against it for the  fish industry too.  </P> <P> "Because of its mandate to protect public health, it is more appropriate that  the FDA have the fish inspection program," said Nancy Watzman, policy analyst  at Public Citizen. "If the USDA, which has the mandate to promote agricultural  products, were to get the fish inspection program it is possible that these two  different mandates would conflict."  </P> <P> But Lee J. Weddig, executive vice president of the National Fisheries  Institute, likes the idea of the USDA controlling the program. "From an  organization standpoint, the USDA just makes more sense," he said. "And the  seafood industry is very international. The Department of Agriculture is  already in place with all our largest trading partners."  </P> <P> The Senate passed a bill (SB 2924), which was sponsored by the majority leader,  Sen. George Mitchell (D-Me.) and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the  Agriculture Committee. The Senate bill would make fish inspections part of the  USDA program.  </P> <P> The leading House bill, now a compromise effort between the Committee on  Merchant Marine and Fisheries and a bill sponsored by Rep. John D. Dingell  (D-Mich.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, would leave the  program with the FDA and has stronger language regarding contamination and  whistle-blower protection. A vote is expected at any time.  </P> <P> Although the fishing industry is split in its backing of the various  legislation, there is support for regulation because it would provide a  commercial advantage by bolstering public confidence in fish products -- the  fastest-growing sector of the food industry.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration and a dozen consumer groups, including the AFL-CIO,  Public Citizen and Consumers Union, oppose the Mitchell bill and support the  compromise bill in the House for both public health and budget reasons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Bill Aims to Improve Children's TV  </P> <P> "That's all folks." That's the message Congress is sending to the television  broadcasting industry with the passage of the Children's Television Act, which  became law last week without a signature from President Bush.  </P> <P> The bill (HR 1677), introduced by Rep. John Bryant (D-Tex.), limits advertising  during children's programming to no more than 10.5 minutes per hour on weekends  and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays. It also gives the Federal Communications  Commission, when reviewing applications for license renewal, the authority to  consider whether a station has served the educational needs of children.  </P> <P> Action for Children's Television, a public interest group, has reported that  some stations were airing as much as 12 minutes of ads an hour during weekends  and 14 minutes an hour during weekday programming.  </P> <P> "Programming for children should be designed to turn on their minds, not their  sweet tooth or susceptibility for subtle advertising," Bryant said. "Requiring  broadcasters to consider the educational needs of children serves the public  interest."  </P> <P> In exchange for a license, a television operator must agree to meet certain FCC  standards for programming. If he fails to meet the standards, he can lose the  license through a hearing process when it comes up for renewal.  </P> <P> A bill similar to Bryant's passed Congress in late 1988, but President Reagan  allowed it to die after Congress adjourned. President Bush did not sign the new  bill; his Administration did not support it either. However, the current bill  had overwhelming bipartisan support and ACT, the Parent-Teacher Assn. and many  education and religious organizations lobbied hard for it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Local Bar Sorts Out Pension Law Mess  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Bar Assn. appears to have succeeded where so many others  have failed.  </P> <P> The lawyers' group has sorted through the bewildering legalities governing the  distribution and taxation of pensions and issued a report proposing a  simplified version of the current rules.  </P> <P> The report describes the present law as "unduly complex, illogical as a matter  of policy." It suggests replacing the current labyrinth with two simple rules:  everything that comes out of a pension plan is taxable, and everything that  comes out can be rolled over into an IRA.  </P> <P> "If you have amended the law so that an individual can avoid paying tax by  rolling over his investment, there is no policy reason to have very complex tax  breaks that you now have," said David E. Gordon, co-author of the report and a  partner at the law firm O'Melveny &amp; Myers.  </P> <P> Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.) has used the report as the basis for some portions of  reform legislation (SB 2901) that has been co-sponsored by 10 of his colleagues  on the Senate Finance Committee. Pryor's bill, however, preserves some of the  old special rules, such as those regarding taxation of employee stock option  plans.  </P> <P> "We are very supportive, although the bill certainly includes some things we  don't like," said James A. Klein, deputy executive director of the Assn. of  Private Pension and Welfare Plans. "But the idea of reorienting Congress toward  simpler pension laws is very important."  </P> <P> While the bar association has not taken a stand on the other elements of  Pryor's bill, Gordon said that on the whole it is a step in the right  direction.  </P> <P> "The end result of complexity is only noncompliance," Gordon said. "This should  be an area in which an IRS pamphlet can say it all."  </P></p>

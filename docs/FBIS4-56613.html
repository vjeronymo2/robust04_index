			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The heavy water plant located in Arroyito,  Neuquen Province, the only one of its kind in the country, was  shut down two days ago due to a fire that was quickly brought  under control. There were no casualties. It is not yet known  when the plant will be reactivated.    The fire, which occurred in a pipeline sector of the plant,  has interrupted the long chemical process that will allow the  plant to produce heavy water as of the beginning of 1996. Heavy  water, which is used as a refrigerant for the turbines of  nuclear plants, is currently being imported.    According to Fernando Huici, an engineer for the National  Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA), the accident occurred due to  "the failure of a support holding up part of a pipeline carrying  a synthesis gas made up of hydrogen and nitrogen."    The official said "this gas, which has a temperature of 600  degrees centigrade, ignites when it comes into contact with the  atmosphere, and what we call the "blowtorch effect" occurred --  in other words, a small fire."    After stating that the plant's security has not been  affected, Huici indicated that the plant's management has called  in the Toese Company of Denmark, which installed the system, to  carry out an inspection.    Although the official believed that "the plant will be  running again" within the next few days, he lamented the  interruption of the operation. "We were at a very important  stage in the process," he said. [passage omitted]</p>

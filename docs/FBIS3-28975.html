Li's private plane is due to touch down in Phuket about 11  am  from Bali, in Indonesia, an informed source said. Thailand is  the third and last stop of Li's Southeast Asian tour--which has  drawn protests and veiled threats from Beijing. He also visited  the Philippines.    The Taiwanese president will stay at the Pacific Island Club  Hotel, where Amnuai will host a dinner reception for him  tonight, the source said. Deputy Labour and Social Welfare  Minister Phaithun Kaeothong is also to meet Lee for talks about  the Thai labour market in Taiwan. Amnuai and Phaithun are both  members of the New Aspiration Party (NAP).    There are about 30,000 Thais working legally in Taiwan, and  an estimated 40,000 working without permission. [passage omitted]    Li will spend tomorrow playing golf with senior Thai  businessmen--Chatri Sophonphanit, of the Bangkok Bank, Uthen  Techaphaibun, of the Bangkok Metropolitan Bank, Saman Ophatwong,  a major rice exporter to Taiwan, and Wisit Wirasithom, owner of  the Wall Street Tower--and go sightseeing at Pang-Nga Bay, the  source said. Tomorrow night he will host a return dinner party  for Amnuai and the businessmen at the Sheraton Hotel. [passage  omitted]    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and Foreign Minister Prasong  Sunsiri have stressed the govemment's adherence to a one-China  policy. However they also said senior people from Thailand's  economic partners, such as Taiwan have a right to make private  visits.    Chuan, unlike Ramos and Suharto, has refused to receive Li  during his three-day visit. [passage omitted]</p>

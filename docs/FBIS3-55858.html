			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] While the Armenian workers were  repairing the blown up sectors of the pipeline in Marneulskiy  Rayon, yet another explosion took place on Georgian territory.  It surpasses the others in its magnitude. A 300-meter sector  of the 1,000-mm gas pipeline was blown up and put out of order  at the place where it crosses the Kura River in  Azerbaijani-inhabited Gardabanskiy Rayon. Moreover, a  800-meter-long sector of the pipeline was displaced by some 5  meters.    Specialists from the Armenian State Gas Enterprise have left  for the site of the accident. In their opinion, the Kura River  should be diverted and large-scale earth moving should be  carried out at the location of the explosion in order to be able  to repair the pipeline.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mario Saucedo, secretary general of the Democratic  Revolution Party [PRD], yesterday denied that he was an adviser  of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) and of rebel  Subcommander Marcos. He also denied that his party is linked  with that organization.    Through a communique sent to this office, Saucedo maintained  that the reason for statements pointing to "my alleged  participation in the Drive for Peace and Reconciliation in  Chiapas established by the EZLN, Bishop Samuel Ruiz, and Manuel  Camacho" is to distort my work and the political positions of my  work.    He emphasized that to say that within the framework of the  two negotiations -- the EZLN-government talks and the  negotiation between various political parties with the  government to reach a consensus for electoral reforms as a  condition for social peace -- is grave because it would affect  the right environment for the dialogue.    I want to express, Saucedo said, my total rejection of such  statements because I have never, neither now nor in the past,  wanted to give advice to the EZLN or Subcommander Marcos. I  have only been an observer.    In conclusion, he explained that it must not be forgotten  that the PRD is a national force on the verge of attaining the  government and that is the reason for our interest in the peace  negotiations in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. "Nothing  will change our communication and commitment with the people of  Chiapas, the EZLN, and the country."    Meanwhile, the PRD Office of the Federal District, headed by  Rene Bejarano Martinez, presented charges to the Federal  District's Human Rights Commission that a couple of PRD members  were kidnapped by the National Defense Secretariat within the  framework of an event called "The 100 Marches for Democracy"  held on 24 February.</p>

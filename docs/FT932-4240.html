			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Inquiry calls for power-sharing system in Ulster AN INDEPENDENT com-mission of inquiry into Northern Ireland yesterday urged the government to replace direct rule by a system of power sharing and to open 'informal channels of communication' with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. The recommendations form part of a 400-page report prepared by the commission, which is chaired by Professor Torkel Opsahl, an international human rights lawyer and United Nations adviser. Other commissioners include Mr Eamonn Gallagher, the former EC director-general of fisheries, and Lady Faulkener of Downpatrick, a former BBC governor for Northern Ireland whose husband, Brian, was the last Stormont prime minister. The report recommends that a 'government of Northern Ireland should be put in place, based on the principle that each community has an equal voice in making and executing the laws or a veto on their execution, and equally shares administrative authority'. But the proposal received a cool response from both sides of Ulster's political divide. The Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist Party, which has boycotted the inquiry, described power sharing as a 'blueprint for the destruction of the union'. Sinn Fein said the report was 'ambiguous'. Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic Labour Party, said he wanted time to study the report in depth. The commission has avoided elaborating the precise form power sharing should take. The report says, however, that new legislation should be brought in to reinforce the rights of the minority Roman Catholic community. Prof Opsahl said the commission had wanted to avoid being seen to usurp the role of government or local politicians. Rather, it had set out to act as a channel for the views of ordinary citizens whose voices might not otherwise be heard. 'The publication of the report is perhaps the end of the beginning but we expect the discussion to go on.' he said. In its proposals on future government the commission rejects the conflicting positions taken by some local politicians - the unification in the short term of Ulster and the Irish Republic or the alternative of a full integration of the province into the United Kingdom. But the report is as critical of the government as of Ulster's political leadership in contributing to what it dubs a 'democratic deficit' in Northern Ireland. 'The British government's insistence that it is an honest broker, and that the ingredients of a settlement must be worked out between the two communities (Roman Catholic and Protestant) adds to the recipe for conflict.' The commission says that it found wide agreement among those giving oral evidence that a settlement excluding Sinn Fein would be 'neither lasting nor stable'. It insists that Sinn Fein should renounce violence before being allowed into full political talks, although it sees informal contacts with government as a useful way of exploring the prospects for an IRA ceasefire. The commissioners also want the government to lift its broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein. Among the other key recommendations in the report are the reform of the local police force and the strengthening of human rights with the enactment of a bill of rights.

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Industrial states urged to increase savings THE world's industrial countries will have to gear their fiscal policies to increasing national savings, if they are to achieve sustained growth and a lasting decline in real interest rates, the IMF warned yesterday. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the fund singled out the US, Germany and Italy as nations where additional measures to curb budget deficits could be required. Looking ahead to the mid-1990s, the IMF said that tougher fiscal policies in the three countries could help boost industrial country growth and investment, and world economic activity as a whole. Mr Jacob Frenkel, IMF research department director, said it was important government claims on savings be cut because of increased investment demand resulting from the Gulf war and economic restructuring in eastern Europe. In one scenario, the IMF calculated the possible impact of: the US eliminating its federal budget deficit by 1995; Italy cutting its state sector deficit of more than 10 per cent to about 6.5 per cent of gross domestic product by 1993; and Germany increasing government saving by about 1 per cent of gross national product between now and 1996. By 1996, the real capital stock in the industrial countries would be 1.25 per cent higher than it would have been in the absence of fiscal action, and the level of actual and potential output would be almost 0.5 percentage points higher. But the nations would not necessarily have to work in concert to help the world economy, it said. 'Actions in one country to reduce their use of world saving and strengthen their public finances would have important benefits for the world economy,' the IMF said. In the near term, the report said that prospects for global economic growth had clearly deteriorated since its last Economic Outlook in October last year. The economic position of the industrial world was characterised by sharply different cyclical positions among the major countries. At the same time, the prospects for inflation had worsened. It was acknowledged in the report that important questions are being asked about what economic policies should be pursued, in the light of economic weakness in some countries, the aftermath of the Gulf war, the fluctuations of the dollar and worries about financial fragility in several countries. But it stressed that these concerns 'should not overshadow the overriding importance of achieving sustained growth over the longer term.' This would require continued reliance on monetary policies to combat inflation, pushing ahead with structural policies including liberalisation of international trade, plus encouragement of savings. The report warned countries against using monetary policy to alter the present exchange rates relationships between the US, Germany and Japan. It also said they should not change macro-economic policies to deal with fragile financial systems. The IMF said the Gulf war and reconstruction in the Middle East would involve the world in a substantial net budgetary cost. It said last year's temporary rise in oil prices and developments in the Middle East raised industrial country consumer prices by about 0.5 per cent last year and cut real gross national product by about 0.25 per cent or Dollars 25bn. Stephen Fidler adds: Measures to improve savings in developing countries are necessary to promote growth but are not sufficient by themselves, the report said. Converting higher savings into effective domestic investment also requires stable policies at a macroeconomic level. The experience of east Europe - where high investment rates were not converted into strong economic performance - shows conditions must also be in place to make sure investment is well utilised. 'If the environment for investment in domestic assets is not favourable, action to raise domestic saving could turn out to be deflationary or simply promote capital flight,' the Outlook said. 'Conversely, measures to boost investment will not succeed if the required financing is not available.'</p>

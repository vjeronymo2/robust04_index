			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article By Elvira Lobato] </F>   [Excerpt] The Brazilian Telecommunications Code, which was  created 31 years ago to grant concessions on radio and  television stations in the country, has become a work of fiction.    The code forbids the concentration of the market and  establishes that no entity or person can own more than 10  television stations nationwide. Five of those, at most, may be  VHF (Channels 1 through 13).    The family of entrepreneur Roberto Marinho (Globo Network)  has shares in 17 television stations, 15 of which are VHF.    The official registers of the Communications Ministry show  the Marinho family has 10 television concessions (eight VHF and  two UHF, that is, Channels 14 and above). They also have shares  in four other VHF stations in Parana State, two in Sao Paulo  State, and one in Minas Gerais State.    The Sirotsky family (RBS Network) has concessions for 13 VHF  television stations and shares in another station in Espirito  Santo State.    The Saad family (Bandeirantes), the Abravanel family (SBT,  Silvio Santos groups), and the Camara family (of the Anhanguera  family in the Center-West Region) all surpass the limit of five  VHF television stations in the entire country.    The Bandeirantes group has concessions for nine VHF  television stations, SBT has eight (plus one UHF station), and  the Camara family has seven.    These oligopolies are the result of a loophole in the law:  It  established limits for entities and people, but it does not  consider one simple trick -- registering the concessions in the  name of several companies or several members of the same family.

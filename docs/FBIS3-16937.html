			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Secretary of the Northern Fleet's Military  Council Yuriy Polozkov confirmed that the Pomor-94 naval  exercises did in fact aim primarily to insure the coordination  of moves in the preparation of a multinational naval task force  for the imposition of a naval blockade at "hot spots" around the  world.    Polozkov was interviewed by Interfax following a REUTERS  report on the exercises. REUTERS quoted the Chief of the  Russian Navy's Press Center, Aleksandr Veledeyev, as doubting  whether the exercises aimed to insure coordinated performance by  the Russian and Western navies.    Norwegian, U.S., British, German, and Russian warships are  to  take part in the Pomor-94 exercises in the Sea of Norway on  March 21.    The First Deputy Commander of the Russian Navy, Admiral Igor  Kasatonov, has told Interfax the Pomor-94 exercises are part of  a series of moves to enhance coordination between the Russian  and NATO fleets. Admiral Kasatonov will be monitoring the  exercises on behalf of Russia.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 21 (YONHAP) -- North Korea will not  accept full-scale international inspection of its nuclear  facilities while talks with the United States are underway, a  senior North Korean diplomat said Monday.    North Korean Ambassador to Russia Son Song-pil, while  explaining his country's position on the continuing nuclear row  to members of the Russian State Duma (House of Representatives)  Foreign Affairs Committee, said that international nuclear  inspections would never be allowed until an across-the-board  agreement on the issue was reached with the United States.    Pyongyang would not return to the Nuclear Non-proliferation  Treaty (NPT) should international organizations fail to withdraw  their move toward sanctions against it, Son added.    Son said, "economic sanctions, if taken against North Korea,  will be regarded as a declaration of war...we will counter war  with war."</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / World News in Brief: Lord Devlin dies at the age of 86 Lord Devlin, the former law lord, died at his home at Pewsey, Wilts, aged 86. He was the youngest High Court judge this century when appointed to the Queen's Bench Division at the age of 42 in 1948. He retired in 1964 after only three years in the House of Lords and it was said the law had lost one of the finest legal minds of his generation. In recent years he campaigned on behalf of the Guildford Four and Maguire Seven. Obituary, Page 6</p>

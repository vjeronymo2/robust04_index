			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: When only direct challenge is valid - European Court Individuals who do not take up their rights to challenge European Commission decisions by bringing direct actions in the European Court of Justice cannot later challenge them by way of a reference from a national court to the ECJ for a ruling on a preliminary point of law, the Court ruled last week. The case concerned the payment of state aid to a German textile company about which the Commission had not been notified and which was therefore declared unlawful. The German government was ordered to seek restitution of the money. A copy of the Commission decision was sent to the company by the Federal economics minister who advised the company it could challenge the decision by a direct action in the ECJ. No such proceedings were brought either by the company or the German authorities. More than six months later, the Federal economics minister withdrew the decisions to grant the aid, in compliance with the Commission decision. The company brought proceedings for judicial review in the national courts against the minister's decision. The proceedings were dismissed at first instance. The company appealed, claiming that the aid in question had been partially compatible with the Rome treaty rules and that this vitiated, at least in part, the Commission decision declaring the whole package unlawful. The company claimed that it was entitled to invoke this claim despite the fact that the limitation period for bringing a direct action before the European Court of Justice had expired. The appeal court referred the issue to the European Court for a preliminary ruling. The Court set out its own jurisprudence on the issue. First, it said a decision which had not been challenged in a direct action by its addressee within the limitation period set down in the Rome treaty became definitive. Second, a company benefiting from an individual state aid which was the subject of a Commission decision was entitled to bring a direct action before the ECJ challenging it, even if the decision was addressed to a member state. The Court said time limits set out in the Rome treaty for direct actions applied equally to member states and individuals. Thus, a member state which failed to bring a direct action within the limitation period could not challenge the validity of a decision thereafter. The reason for this was that the imposition of limitation periods safeguarded legal certainty by avoiding the situation whereby Union acts could be challenged indefinitely. The Court then ruled that the same reasons led it to exclude the possibility of an individual beneficiary of state aid challenging a Commission decision by attacking the national measures taken to ensure compliance with it, where that individual had had the opportunity to challenge the Commission decision directly before the ECJ but had failed to do so. If it were otherwise, the Court continued, the individual would be changing the definitive nature of the Commission decision. The Court distinguished the present case from previous ones in which it had ruled that the mere fact that a direct action had been brought before it did not stop the same party from bringing an action before the national courts in order to challenge national acts executing the decision which formed the basis of the direct challenge. The Court pointed out that in these previous cases, direct action had been brought by the individuals concerned. The Court also distinguished another case, in which it had ruled that an individual was entitled to challenge the legality of a Commission decision by challenging a national act taken pursuant to that Commission decision. The Court stated that the only act capable of being challenged by the individual in that case was the national act and that the individual had the right to challenge such decisions indirectly before the national courts when direct action was not available. In the present case, the individual was made fully aware of the Commission decision and the possibility of challenging it directly.

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Plans for road through Oxleas Wood Plans for a six-lane road through Oxleas Wood in south-east London, one of the capital's last pieces of ancient woodland, were called 'unlawful and irrational' in the High Court yesterday. Nine residents hope to get compulsory purchase orders declared unlawful. They say the road would destroy rare habitats and bring pollution. The European Commission said last week that Britain was to be pursued under EC law for failure to publish an environmental assessment of the scheme. The High Court case continues today</p>

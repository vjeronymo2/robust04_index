			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, 11 May (ITAR-TASS) -- A direct, scrambled  telephone line will be set up in the nearest future between the  Kremlin and the federal chancellor's department. An agreement  on this was signed in Bonn today during the official visit of  Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin to the FRG. The  document was signed by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev for  Russia and by FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel for Germany.    "Taking account of the mutual interest in creating the  technical wherewithal to hold confidential telephone  conversations at the highest level," the agreement provides for,  "as soon as technically feasible," setting up a direct scrambled  telephone link between the Kremlin and the federal chancellor's  department, using two channels laid along geographically  separate routes.    The agreement comes into force on the day on which it is  signed.</p>

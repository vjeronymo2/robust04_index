			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / German postal sell-off due to start in 1998 Germany's federal postal service aims to offer a first tranche of around 25 per cent of its shares on the stock market in 1998, Mr Klaus Zumwinkel, chairman, said yesterday. In the meantime, it plans to develop new customer services, which could generate some DM5bn (Pounds 2.06bn) in annual sales and create up to 30,000 jobs. These include in-house postal deliveries for corporate customers and electronics-based services. Mr Zumwinkel said the service was negotiating with several large companies, offering to deliver mail not only to central post-rooms, but also to individual offices. Electronic post offices, which receive transmitted messages and print them out before delivery, also looked promising, he said. This service has been available in Berlin, Frankfurt, Leipzig and Berlin since last year. In the mainstream parcel delivery business, officials said the state-owned service had a 26 per cent share last year of the national parcels market, when it increased volume 3.6 per cent to 667m deliveries.</p>

At a meeting of European business managers here, the foreign  minister said "for the past twelve months I have been asking for  consultants to be named to get the privatisations of STET [Turin  Telephone Finance Company], ENEL [National Electric Power Board]  and the petrol sector off the ground."    "Well," said Andreatta, who served as budget minister in the  government of Giuliano Amato which gave a push to the  privatisation process, "these nominations have been frozen for  twelve months, in a subtle game in which the great potentates of  high finance have played their part."    "I am not claiming," he went on, "that there is some kind of  feud between some politicians and high finance. Personally I am  convinced that we need to keep checks on the influence of high  finance.... In the past few months I have seen thousands of  objections raised by high finance to a process that must be done  well, following the example set in Britain and France."    The foreign minister voiced worries that some areas of large  industry are suggesting that partnerships should be limited to  those with industry in France. "But I do not think that deals  between two countries with rather interventionist tendencies  would be the best thing for our privatisation process."    The possibility of the privatisation process being wound  down  by the winners of the March 27-28 general elections was played  down by Andreatta who forecast a governing alliance which  differed considerably from the coalitions as they head into the  vote.    "And in this reorganisation, I think that intermediate force  will prevail in the left-wing, right-wing and centrist line-ups,  allowing a continuation with the action set in motion by the  Amato government and (the current) government of (Carlo Azeglio)  Ciampi, privatisations included," he said.</p>

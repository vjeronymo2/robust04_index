			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: United Newspapers rises 25% - All-round growth and Pounds 19.6m exceptional gains behind advance United Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Express, yesterday reported a 25.3 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 109.9m to Pounds 137.7m, with all divisions contributing despite difficult trading conditions. The outcome was flattered by exceptional gains of Pounds 19.6m mostly the sale of Extel Financial to Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, against gains of Pounds 10.4m a year earlier. Before exceptionals, pre-tax profits rose by 18.7 per cent to Pounds 118m in the year to December 31. Lord Stevens, the chairman of the group, whose interests range from regional newspapers and business magazines to exhibitions, warned that the pace of economic recovery in the UK and the US 'is not consistent.' United expected, however, its 'recent major investments to perform well.' Turnover for the year rose 9.3 per cent to Pounds 908.4m and earnings per share rose 15 per cent to 44.9p a share, or before exceptionals by 8 per cent to 35.6p. A final dividend of 14.5p is proposed for a total of 22p (21.5p). Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson said yesterday: ' This is quite a good set of results and for all the right reasons.' There had been improvements across the group and the second half recovery was being sustained in the first half of the current year. United said that particularly strong results had been achieved in the US by its advertising periodicals and the PR newswire. The US contributed operating profits of Pounds 44.9m on turnover of Pounds 243.6m. The group's UK national newspapers increased operating profits by 2 per cent to Pounds 33.7m on turnover of Pounds 300.4m although 'turbulent market conditions', price reductions by competing titles and extra spending on new supplements held back profits. The UK and Europe contributed operating profits of Pounds 85.5m on Pounds 664.9m. The sale of Extel Financial for Pounds 73.5m and the Pounds 190m rights issue left the group with net cash of Pounds 4.5m at year end compared with net debt Pounds 308.6m at the start of last year. This year, however, net debt has risen to Pounds 100m because of the acquisition of Harmon Homes and the Hong Kong International Trade Fair. COMMENT United makes little fuss and avoids headline catching stories such as the battle for the future of The Independent or big takeovers. It has, however, got on with quietly managing its businesses with solid results across a wide front. With so many of its businesses sensitive to advertising, it should be poised to take advantage of cyclical recovery. In meetings with City analysts yesterday the atmosphere was a little less cautious than in the formal statements. Pre-tax profits should rise to about Pounds 140m this year for a prospective p/e ratio of 16, a moderate rating for such a broadly based publisher.</p>

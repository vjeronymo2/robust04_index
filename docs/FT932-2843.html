			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Reprieved pit may still be closed BRITISH COAL has started procedures which could lead to the closure this year of one of 12 mines reprieved by the government just three months ago. It has told miners at Rufford in Nottinghamshire that the pit's future is limited and has offered them the option of voting for its closure. The move will be seen as the beginning of the end for at least some of the 12 as it becomes clear that the market is not big enough to support them. The Coalfield Communities Campaign pressure group said yesterday it showed that the white paper accompanying the reprieve in March was 'nothing but a sham'. British Coal has told the 500 miners at Rufford that deteriorating conditions at the mine mean that one option is to close it before the end of this year. It has also suggested developing another face which could provide work for some of next year and a third face with an uncertain potential life. The attraction of accepting the first option is that British Coal could offer enhanced redundancy terms - available only until the end of the year - and the option of work elsewhere. Most of the miners are members of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers. In a ballot tomorrow they will be asked to vote on the options proposed by British Coal and also on whether to oppose closure. Regional executives of British Coal believe that even if the vote goes against closure it is likely that many men will take voluntary severance by the end of the year. They have told the workforce that Rufford's uncertain future would in any case make it a likely candidate for closure later this year if British Coal is unable to find markets for all 12 reprieved pits. Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour energy spokesman, said British Coal was guilty of 'financial blackmail of the most vicious kind'. He added that the workforce was effectively 'being offered only one choice - leave the pit before December 31 and receive up to Pounds 37,500 or stay on with only the prospect of a maximum of Pounds 6,150'.</p>

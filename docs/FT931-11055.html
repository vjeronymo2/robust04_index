			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Second shake-up at Wheway WHEWAY, the struggling environmental engineering group, yesterday announced its second boardroom shake-up in a year with the departure of Mr John McGowan, the chief executive Mr Hugh Ashton, who took over Mr McGowan's post of chairman in November, said yesterday the group was 'a long way down the line' on appointing a replacement. An announcement was expected soon, he said. Mr McGowan's departure comes after two years of increasing difficulties for the loss-making company. The accounts, published yesterday, were qualified by Price Waterhouse, which stated that 'subject to the group having sufficient banking facilities to be able to continue trading', the company was a going concern. Mr Ashton criticised the decision to qualify the accounts in light of the recent agreement with banks to secure Pounds 21m in facilities until the financial year-end in September. Last year the banks agreed to extend the facilities in return for security on Wheway's Pounds 21m in net assets. The group paid some Pounds 1m in debt restructuring fees. Wheway said that it intended to strengthen the board with new non-executive and executive appointments.</p>

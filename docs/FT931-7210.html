			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Akzo up 3% but warns of decline AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, posted a 3 per cent rise in net profit before extraordinary items in 1992, but warned that the result for the current half-year may decline. The downturn in Europe, where Akzo generates 70 per cent of its sales, is expected to outweigh the emerging recovery in the US, which accounts for 22 per cent of turnover. However, Mr Aarnout Loudon, chairman, did not make a forecast for the second-half result. In 1992, net profit before extraordinaries increased to Fl 712m (Dollars 392m) from Fl 691m in 1991, in the face of stagnant economies in Europe and turmoil on the currency markets. Sales were steady at Fl 16.85bn, with the effects of adverse currency translations and divestments balanced by rises in prices and sales volumes and by acquisitions. Operating profit rose by 6 per cent to Fl 1.23bn. Net profit including extraordinaries rose by 11 per cent to Fl 646m. Akzo had after-tax charges of Fl 66m in 1992, due in part to a pre-tax restructuring provision of nearly Fl 175m, but this was still lower than the 1991 net charge of Fl 111m. Akzo said it would hold its dividend at Fl 6.50.</p>

			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / The European Market: Bulldozers try to clear a path through mountains of rules - A look at the uphill struggle to shift the obstacles to cross-border sales of construction equipment ASK a construction equipment man to pick out a German wheeled loader from a yard full of similar equipment and he will find one in less time than it takes to say 'homologation'. The German wheeled loader will be the one with the wheel chocks screwed on, or close to, the steps up to the cab. Germany is the only country which requires chocks on its loaders for use in case of brake failure. 'They're waiting for something that never happens,' says one senior UK executive. Little more than four months before the introduction of the European Single Market, progress towards a true single market in construction equipment matches that of an overloaded dumptruck struggling up a muddy hill. The engine is running, but the final destination is a long way off. It is not just details such as wheel chocks and lighting specification differences which irritate the big construction equipment producers, and add to production costs. 'We've got machines lying around in the UK which could easily be sold in Germany if they were adapted to German standards,' says Dr Frithjof Timm, president of Komatsu Europe. Producers, in fact, do regularly bring unsold equipment back to their factories to refit them for a different European market, but this is both inefficient and demoralising, says Mr Tuve Johannesson, president and chief executive of Brussels-based VME Group. Unfortunately, though, some national regulations defy minor re-engineering. On Italian roads, for example, there is a 2.5m width restriction for construction equipment: consequently, it can be a lot easier for an Italian producer to sell its equipment in the UK than vice versa, says Mr David Barrell, director-general of the UK's Federation of Manufacturers of Construction Equipment &amp; Cranes. Behind the complexity lies the thorny issue of homologation - modifying a piece of construction equipment to conform to national legal and market requirements without changing the overall design. These requirements are often more exacting than the two main recognised sets of standards - the SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) and ISO (International Organisation of Standardisation) standards. Multinational producers claim, with some justification, that the hidden purpose of homologation has been to protect national industries and markets from foreign encroachment. It has thus contributed to the chronic overcapacity, fragmentation and duplication of effort among European suppliers. Cutting through the morass of conflicting national regul-ations and specifications is, of course, a key aim of the the Single Market programme, and a start has been made. The EC's basic Machinery Directive was adopted in 1989, and subsequently amended to include mobile machinery. Even at this late stage, discussions are still continuing on a second amendment related to lifting equipment. Agreement could be reached by the end of the year for adoption in May or June next year, completing the 'Machines Package'. For the main equipment suppliers, the directives are fine - as far as they go. Caterpillar, the world's largest producer, is pleased by the progress made, and notes particularly that the standards backing up the directives are clearly based on the ISO norms. But there are problems. Apart from some unease in the industry over the pace at which national governments will introduce the necessary enabling legislation, there is concern that a mandatory directive, which is deliberately framed in general terms, is backed up only by voluntary standards. These are being drawn up under the aegis of CEN, the European standardisation organisation. This raises a serious question about the enforcement of the directive. The precedents are not promising: one supplier says an EC directive on noise omission from certain types of construction equipment, introduced in January 1989, virtually outlawed a particularly irritating French homologation requirement, but there is no evidence of the directive being policed. The biggest problem with the Machinery Directive, however, is its scope. It was designed to concentrate on safety at work, with the result that what the industry calls 'job-side' specifications are covered, while 'road-side' rules are not. Although there is some frustration, especially in the UK, that the two elements were not considered simultaneously, the inclusion of road regulations would undoubtedly have caused further delays, because of the need to consult many different levels of highway authorities. The result, therefore, is that - despite pushing by the UK - only preliminary work has been carried out at EC level on harmonising road regulations on widths, weights and specification details. 'The rest of the loaf has yet to be worked on,' says Caterpillar. With most observers predicting slow progress towards harmonisation of road standards, the implications for the industry are significant. Germany is generally regarded as the toughest market for homologation, with every detail of a machine tested by the TUV road safety body for compliance, from the reflector plates to engine output. But reunification has transformed Germany into a market for an expected 46 per cent of European construction equipment sales this year, up from a stagnant 18 per cent in 1989, according to a Corporate Intelligence Group forecast last week. Importers to Germany have always suspected their machines are scrutinised for road regulation compliance rather more closely than those of home-produced rivals. Having a manufacturing presence in Germany has never been more important.</p>

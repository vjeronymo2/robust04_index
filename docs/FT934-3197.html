			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Unilever to sell stake in Dutch textile company Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, said it plans to sell its minority stake in Gamma, the Netherlands' largest textile company, in a transaction which would raise around Fl 200m (Dollars 105m) at current share prices. The shares, representing nearly 30 per cent of Gamma's share capital, will be placed mainly with institutional investors. A company spokesman could not say when the placement would take place but he confirmed that it will yield a book profit. Goldman Sachs has been appointed to help in the disposal. Unilever said the divestment was part of its strategy of concentrating its financial resources on core activities. The announcement came after the close of bourse trading in Amsterdam, where Gamma's shares closed unchanged at Fl 98.50. The shares hit a 12-month high of Fl 100.50 in late November, up from a low of Fl 71.70 set in March. Gamma, which has annual sales of Fl 1.55bn, recorded its first profit fall for 14 years in 1992, when net profit fell to Fl 64.8m from Fl 71.3m in 1991. Besides making curtains, carpets and towels for the European market, Gamma also produces exotic printed fabrics sold mainly in western and central Africa.</p>

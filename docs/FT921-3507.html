			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / The devil you know . . .: Philip Stephens on the parties' main campaign themes If the prime minister loses the general election it will be because the electorate blames his government for the recession. If he wins it will be because the voters trust his management of the economy, rather than Mr Neil Kinnock's. The contradiction between those two statements is more apparent than real. As the campaign for April 9 unfolds, both the Conservative and Labour parties recognise that the economy will be the pivot on which the outcome will hinge. Of course it will be more complicated than that. The Conservatives will make much during the campaign of Mr John Major's personal popularity and his achievements in 16 months in Downing Street. Labour will draw support for its reputation as the more trusted guardian of the welfare state. But campaign strategists of all persuasions believe that the issue which will loom largest for the uncommitted voters upon whom the result depends will be the economy. This is first postwar election being fought in the middle of recession. Unemployment was still high and rising in 1983 and 1987 but consumer spending and output were moving in the opposite direction. More important, voters who were ready to accept that the recession in 1980-81 was a price the country had to pay for the profligacy of the 1970s, may be far less willing to excuse the government a decade on. If any single factor has sustained Labour support in the opinion polls over the past year it has been the length and depth of the downturn. The latest Gallup poll for the Daily Telegraph, for example, indicates that less than 30 per cent of the electorate is satisfied with the government's record. Mr Kinnock will take maximum advantage of the discontent. Each and every step of his party's campaign will include a reminder of the business failures, the increase in unemployment and the jump in housing repossessions since Mr Major replaced Mrs Margaret Thatcher in November 1990. Mr Major has had some success in deflecting the blame. Gallup shows that more than two-thirds of voters are ready to place much responsibility for the recession on Mrs Thatcher. A similar number have also been swayed by the emphasis on the impact of worldwide recession. The Conservative campaign does not rest there. One strand will be the constant reminder that Labour would put up taxes; another will be the, albeit unstated, message that whatever mistakes the government has made, a Labour administration would compound them. They will be drawn together to make the central claim that Labour's conversion to market economics is unconvincing: that its high tax, high spending, pro-trade union policies would stifle enterprise and push up inflation. Mr Major has the opinion polls on his side: Mori's latest survey for The Sunday Times shows, for example, that 39 per cent of the voters prefer Conservative management of the economy to the 28 per cent convinced by Labour's alternative. If he is to win the election, Mr Kinnock must narrow that gap or ensure that on April 9 the voters' disenchantment with the Conservative record outweighs their mistrust of his prospectus.</p>

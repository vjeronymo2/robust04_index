"The settlers must leave the settlements quickly, otherwise  our fighters will strike them," the fundamentalist group said in  a statement.    The statement did not set a specific deadline.    On March 7 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the armed wing of Hamas,  gave settlers until March 15 to leave four settlements in the  occupied West Bank -- Tekoa, Kyriat Arba', Ar'iel and Keddumim  -- and Gush Katif in the Gaza Strip.    Hamas also declared the 25th of each month to be a day of  strikes and protests to remember the 30 Palestinian worshippers  shot dead by an Israeli settler in Hebron's Tomb of the  Patriarchs on February 25.    The fundamentalist group also called on all Palestinians to  pray at the al-Aqsa mosque in the Old City of Jerusalem on March  18 in an act of defiance against the Israeli authorities.    Since the massacre the army has banned Palestinians from the  occupied territories from visiting Israel proper.</p>

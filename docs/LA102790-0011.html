			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOVAK ON AMERICANS MOVING UP  </P> <P> Your headline said that the "rich" were to be taxed by the proposed House  budget. After reading the article, I found that the "rich" were those people  making more than $50,000. Just whose definition of rich is this? The idea that  anyone making above $50,000 a year is rich is a lie.  </P> <P> TYE RUBINS  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

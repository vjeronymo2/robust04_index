I. Ortenburger in 1926 in the Cimarron River northwest of Kenton, Cimarron County, Oklahoma (Hubbs and Ortenburger 1929). The Arkansas River shiner is a small, robust shiner with a small, dorsally flattened head, rounded snout, and small subterminal mouth (Miller and Robison 1973, Robison and Buchanan 1985). Adults attain a maximum length of 51 millimeters (mm) (2 inches (in)). Dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins all have eight rays and there is usually a small, black chevron present at the base of the caudal fin. Dorsal coloration tends to be light tan, with silvery sides gradually grading to white on the belly. The Arkansas River shiner historically inhabited the main channels of wide, shallow, sandy-bottomed rivers and streams of the Arkansas River Basin. Adults are uncommon in quiet pools or backwaters, and almost never occur in tributaries having deep water and bottoms of mud or stone (Cross 1967).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adults prefer to orient into the current on the ``lee'' sides of transverse sand ridges and feed upon organisms washed downstream (Cross 1967). Their food habits have not been recorded but their principal food items are presumed to be small aquatic invertebrates (Gilbert 1978) or plankton (Sublette  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1990). The Arkansas River shiner spawns in July, usually coinciding with flood flows following heavy rains (Moore 1944). The pelagic eggs drift with the swift current and hatching occurs within 24&hyph;48 hours. The larvae are capable of swimming within 3&hyph;4 days; they then seek out backwater pools and quiet water at the mouths of tributaries where food is more abundant (Moore 1944). Both Moore (1944) and Cross (1967) inferred that this species will not spawn unless conditions are favorable to the survival of the larvae. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maximum longevity is unknown, but Moore (1944) speculated that the species' life span is likely less than 3 years (age class II) in the wild. The age structure of Arkansas River shiners collected from the Pecos River in New Mexico included three, and possibly four, age classes (Bestgen  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1989). The majority of the fish captured were juveniles (age class 0) and first-time spawners (age class I). Most of the fish in spawning condition were age class I. Bestgen  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1989) thought mortality of post-spawning fish was extremely high based on the absence of age class I and older fish from collections made after the spawning period (late July and August).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

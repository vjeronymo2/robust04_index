			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Hunt launches drive for more skilled workers Fourteen industrial and commercial sectors were selected yesterday by Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, as prototypes for the government's 'modern apprenticeship scheme'. The scheme aims to create a new generation of skilled workers. Industry trainers in sectors including information technology, chemicals and agriculture will work with employers and Training and Enterprise Councils - which deliver government training - to recruit 2,000 young people in England and Wales to be trained to technician and supervisory levels. When fully operational next year the Pounds 1.25bn scheme will offer up to 50 per cent more public money than is now available to training organisations. This has been made possible by a combination of declining numbers of young people on Youth Training and a small amount of new money. Mr Hunt said the response to the scheme from employers had been 'overwhelming'. But employers said yesterday many of them were waiting for funding details before making formal commitments. The Engineering Training Authority said: 'The government will have to make a big marketing effort to get both employers and young people on board.' It is intended that when the modern apprenticeship is fully operational up to half of 16- to 19-year-olds on government training schemes will achieve Level Three national vocational qualifications, the vocational equivalent of two A levels. At present most participants on YT attain Level Two NVQs, the vocational equivalent of four GCSEs. The scheme forms part of the government's drive to meet national targets for the attainment of vocational qualifications. One of these is that by 2000, half of young people should reach NVQ Level Three or its academic equivalent. At present 37 per cent of young people have achieved this skill level. Recently the employer-led National Advisory Council for Education and Training Targets said the UK should be aiming higher. It added: 'International comparisons point to the need to do so. In Japan 80 per cent of young people reached a comparable level in 1986.'</p>

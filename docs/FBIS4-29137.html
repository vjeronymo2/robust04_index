			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand will allow foreigners to hold more shares  in the local insurance business as part of a liberalization  policy, which in compliance with the GATT agreement. Speaking  after opening the first ASEAN Insurance Congress at the  Shangri-la Hotel in Bangkok yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister  Suphachai Phanitchaphak stressed the need to draw up a plan  aimed at expanding the insurance business in the future. Mr.  Suphachai says the plan will call for the issuance of more  licenses for operating the business here and for the expansion  of equities held by foreigners.    At present foreigners are allowed to hold an equity of 25  percent in a local insurance firm. The new plan is likely to  allow foreigners to hold 49 percent of the total shares. Mr.  Suphachai said ASEAN countries should formulate a joint plan to  open their insurance markets. This is to provide a maximum  benefit for those who use the service and to minimize effects on  the business following the liberalization. He said ASEAN should  also open a joint market in some areas to help strengthen the  insurance business.</p>

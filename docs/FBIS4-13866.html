			<p>BFN     [Text] Sallum, Egypt, April 22 (AFP) -- Security forces  have taken measures to block Algerian Moslem militants from  trying to slip into Egypt in the guise of pilgrims on their way  to Mecca, officials said Friday.    Security forces will escort pilgrims and hold their  passports  when they enter Egypt from Libya at Sallum until they leave the  country at al-Nuwaybi' in the Sinai, officials said. "These  measures are aimed at preventing Algerian militants infiltrating  into Egypt," a security official at the Libyan-Egyptian border  said. The security services had obtained information about  attempts at cooperation between Egyptian and Algerian  extremists. "The Algerian militants could take advantage of the  pilgrimage season to infiltrate into Egypt and renew contacts  with Egyptian activists," he said.    Some 30,000 pilgrims from Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco  and Mauritania are to start travelling to Saudi Arabia via the  Egyptian border post at Sallum. The pilgrimage, or hajj, is  planned for the end of May. Only Libyan pilgrims will be exempt  from the measures. The governments of Egypt and Algeria are  both locked in a bloody confrontation with Islamic militants  bent on their overthrow.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Motoring: Urbane additions to the market The competition is going to be red-hot in Britain's luxury car market this autumn. Four new models from Audi, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover will slug it out with the well established Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Lexus LS400. I have driven all the newcomers but cannot yet write about the Jaguar and Land Rover - even though security surrounding the latest Jaguar XJ Series and the first completely new Range Rover for 24 years has been less than cast iron. Sneak pictures and descriptions of their features have been appearing in enthusiast magazines for a year or more. But accepting invitations to official launches, which may run for several weeks, means one is honour bound to observe an embargo against publishing before the last of the international motoring writers has flown home. So, although my lips may be sealed until the end of this month so far as Jaguar and Range Rover are concerned, I will say this. Jaguar already sells twice as many luxury cars in Britain as its nearest rival, BMW. The new XJ models can only put it still further ahead. I do not go along with Land Rover's claim that the Range Rover is a direct competitor with the likes of the BMW 7-Series, Audi A8, Mercedes-Benz S-Class, Jaguar and Lexus. But if you insist that your luxury car must be able to ford rivers, cross deserts or climb mountains, even if you have no plans to take it off the tarmac, then the latest Range Rover reigns supreme. Which leaves us with the new Audi A8 and BMW 7-Series, because both the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Lexus LS400 have been around in their present form for some time. Although the A8 4.2 quattro looks a fairly conventional large saloon car, it is anything but. This is because it is made largely from aluminium and weighs around 140kg less than its sheet steel rivals. This, Audi says, makes it more crash-resistant and friendlier to the environment. Fuel consumption is reduced and, at the end of its life, the vehicle will be easier to recycle. Whether this will cut much ice with the customers remains to be seen. The A8 quattro, priced at Pounds 46,699, puts its V8's 300 horsepower on the road through all four wheels via a Tiptronic gearbox which lets a driver choose fully automatic transmission or manual gear selection according to mood. On the German autobahn, the quattro reached its governed 155mph (250kph) maximum in eerie silence and treated curving mountain roads with nimble indifference. It is a brilliant performer - but, like Lexus, the Audi marque lacks the charisma of BMW, Mercedes-Benz or Jaguar in Britain. Audi hopes to sell up to 500 A8s in 1995 and expects 80 per cent of them will be the cheaper version - Pounds 34,499 with front-wheel drive, and 174hp, 2.8-litre, V6-engine. But BMW GB aims to get at least four times that number of customers into its new V8-engined 730 and 740 saloons. They replace an eight-year-old 7-Series which was second best-seller in the luxury market after Jaguar. Standards in this class are so high that it is difficult to find any fault with cars such as the BMW 730 and 740 (or, for that matter, the Audi A8). It came almost as a relief to note that the 7-Series' screen-wipers were a bit noisy. In any case, most users choose them not for sheer performance (legally unusable, anyway) or refinement (all are utterly urbane) but for less easily defined qualities such as status and image. The new BMWs look little different from the old ones and retain the classic rear-wheel drive layout. At Pounds 39,800 (the 730) and Pounds 46,700 (740), they cost no more if specifications are taken into account. They cruised in silence equal to the Audi A8 when I tried them some time ago on the autobahn. More recently, they were no less impressive at far lower cruising speeds on UK motorways. How do the BMWs and Audi A8 rate against the new Jaguar XJ models and the latest luxury Range Rover? All will be revealed at the end of this month.</p>

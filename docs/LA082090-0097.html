			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> PACKARD TO MEET WITH CITY COUNCIL  </P> <P> To keep abreast of developments in Washington, the City Council will hold a  breakfast meeting with Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) on Tuesday.  </P> <P> On the agenda are several issues being discussed in Congress that will directly  affect San Clemente, including the Border Patrol checkpoint, offshore oil  drilling and a proposed regional airport in South County, said City Manager  Michael T. Parness.  </P> <P> "We try to get together with him a couple times each year to touch bases on  current issues," Parness said, "and get some input from Congressman Packard on  what's happening in Washington that's important to us."  </P> <P> The meeting, which is open to the public, will be at 8 a.m. in the Ole Hanson  Room of the city's Community Center, 100 N. Calle Seville.  </P> <P> Among the topics to be discussed will be the proposed airport, which has been  proposed for Cristianitos Canyon, just east of the city.  </P> <P> City officials and Packard strongly oppose the site, which has also been turned  down by the County Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> "The airport is a major issue to the city," Parness said. "Yet I don't think  we'll talk much about it because (Packard) is so solidly behind us on this."  </P> <P> Although Parness is in regular contact with Packard or his aides, the city  manager said direct conversations between the legislator and the council are  important.  </P> <P> "This is a good opportunity for him to sit and talk face to face with the City  Council and simply make contact with them," Parness said. "He gets a better  feel for the issues and our range of concerns." FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

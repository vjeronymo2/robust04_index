			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Observer: Surprise move Once upon a time the NatWest itself was a great British institution like Unilever, with its management succession seemingly cast in stone. However, yesterday's boardroom upheavals there are the surest sign yet that chairman Lord Alexander plans a radical overhaul of the troubled bank's top team. By promoting NatWest golden boy Derek Wanless to be one of two new deputy group chief executives, he has leapfrogged a generation of NatWest bankers who might have felt they should have been given a chance of succeeding Tom Frost, the present NatWest chief executive, who has been doing the job since 1987. Frost is 58 and due to retire in August 1993, but his period at the NatWest helm has not been a happy one and it would not be a surprise if he took early retirement. Like NatWest finance director John Burns, who is going to the TSB, Frost could be forgiven for opting for a quieter life. Wanless, a Geordie who took a first in mathematics at Cambridge, may be just the new breed of banker NatWest needs to set it back on course. But he has not spent all of his time just piloting NatWest through the retail banking revolution. Besides being an enthusiastic supporter of Aldershot football club, he is an Eric Clapton fan, regularly attending rock concerts. Perhaps of greater note to NatWest's rivals in the banking world is that he is also an outstanding chess player. Yesterday he modestly tried to play down a widespread legend among his company colleagues that, at the peak of his powers, he could beat 20 simultaneous challengers blindfolded. 'If it ever was true, it is not true these days,' he said.</p>

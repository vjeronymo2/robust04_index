			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Newsletter" by reporters Zou Aiguo (6760 1947 0948) and Hu </F> Xiaomeng (5170 0879 1125): "Zhongnanhai and the Hope Project"]    [Text] Beijing, 7 Jun (XINHUA) -- The "Hope Project" is a  great enterprise. The older generation of the proletariat  revolutionaries and party and state leaders have shown  enthusiasm, concern, and support for it ever since the first day  of its birth. In September 1990, Deng Xiaoping, chief architect  of China's reform and opening up, obliged a request to inscribe  the title "The Hope Project" with great pleasure.    In October 1989, the China Youth Development Foundation made  the following announcement to the world: Let's implement the  "Hope Project," set up China's first foundation to help children  in impoverished areas, and enable hundreds and thousands of poor  children who dropped out of school to return to school.    Zhongnanhai [official residence of top leadership] shows  concern about the enterprise which will not only benefit the  present, but also future generations.... [ellipsis as published]  <H8>  (1) </H8>   On the eve of the Spring Festival in 1994, General Secretary  Jiang Zemin braved a severe cold, crossed over mountain after  mountain, and trekked across the great expanse of Shanxi.  Arriving in a village or township, he would inquire about  conditions at the kindergarten, primary, and secondary schools  there. He praised Shanxi, saying Shanxi's building schools to  solve children's schooling in impoverished areas was the right  direction in implementing the "Hope Project." He pointed out:  "Economic development and social progress, in the final  analysis, are decided by the quality of the people and by the  raising of the scientific and cultural level of the entire  society. It takes more than 100 years to educate the people.  Education is the foundation of everything. Any neglect in  education constitutes a shortsighted and dangerous act. When  embarking on rural education, it is necessary to proceed from  local reality, readjust school setups, and train more primary  and secondary-level talented people who are greatly needed for  local development."    In his Government Work Rreport to the Second Session of the  Eighth National People's Congress on 10 March 1994, Premier Li  Peng said: "All levels of government must foster a long-term  view; have a sense of urgency; stress enrollment work for  school-age children in rural areas; strive to lower the dropout  rate; and implement the `Hope Project' by mobilizing all social  forces."    In March 1994, the China Youth Development Foundation  promoted the Hope Project's "One Family Helps One Child"  program. In their capacity as ordinary party members and  citiznes, many party and government leaders, both in Zhongnanhai  and in various localities, showed their support of the  implementation of the Hope Project with practical deeds.  Comrades including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan,  Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, Chen Yun, Wan Li, and Bo  Yibo donated funds.    We saw a donor list at the China Youth Development  Foundation:    On 31 March 1994, Comrade Jiang Zemin asked a comrade of the  CPC Central Committee General Office to send a donation to the  foundation to help children who dropped out of schools in  impoverished areas.    On 30 March 1994, Comrade Song Ping and his wife entrusted a  staff member to carry a 1,000-yuan donation along with a  personal letter bearing the message: "For Hope Project in Yanan."    On 26 March 1994, Wen Jiabao, member of the CPC Central  Committee Secretariat, entrusted his party branch to donate 800  yuan to the foundation for the Hope Project.    On 8 April 1994, Comrade Chen Yun entrusted a staff member  to  carry a 5,000-yuan donation to the foundation, saying this  foundation was for children who dropped out of school in old  revolutionary areas and in impoverished areas.    On 2 June 1994, Comrade Wang Zhen and his wife visited and  donated 2,000 yuan to the foundation, saying the donation is to  be used in the Bijie area. He made a stopover there during the  Long March many years ago.    ...... [ellipsis as published]    Zhongnanhai is bound closely to Hope Project.    (2)    On 10 June 1992, an ordinary sedan entered Beijing's  Houyuanen Temple and stopped not far from the China Youth  Development Foundation. Two middle-aged people alighted from  the car and went into the foundation's office. They presented  3,000 Renminbi [RMB] to the Hope Project.    According to regulations, foundation staff members should  write down all donator's names and give them receipts; this is a  strict system. Therefore, a staff member asked the two  middle-aged people: "Would you please let us know the donator's  name?"    The two declined to tell him the name of the donator, nor  did  they give a positive reply on the address, postal code, or work  unit of the donator. One of the two just said: "Please accept  the money. We were asked by a veteran member of the CPC to  bring the money here. If you insist on writing something down,  you can write that it was donated by a veteran CPC member!"    After more than 100 days, on 6 October the two people  returned to the foundation's office in the same car. Once  again, they presented 2,000 RMB in the name of "a veteran CPC  member."    Who was the "veteran CPC member"? Comrades of the foundation  learned the name after trying various channels. The "veteran  CPC member" who refused to reveal his name was Deng Xiaoping.    As early as 1990, with a proletarian revolutionary's  boldness  of vision, Deng Xiaoping repeatedly gave advice on the issue of  education: "If we want to realize modernization, the key lies  in promoting science and technology. To develop science and  technology, we must attach importance to education. Empty talk  cannot realize modernization. We must have knowledge and  capable people." "From a long-term point of view, we must  attach importance to education, science, and technology. We  have already wasted 20 years; the consequences would be  unbearable if we still do not attach importance to them." "We  must find ways and means to properly solve the problem of  education even if we have to be restrained in some other fields  and slow down a little on other projects."    The China Youth Development Foundation used all 5,000 RMB  donated by Deng Xiaoping to subsidize education for children in  the old revolutionary base area in Guangxi's Bose prefecture  where Deng Xiaoping lived and fought.    The children in Bose prefecture wrote a letter to Deng  Xiaoping after receiving his donation. The letter says: "When  we learned that you donated 5,000 yuan to the Hope Project in  the name of a `veteran CPC member' and the foundation sent the  money to aid children in the old revolutionary base area in Bose  prefecture who cannot afford to go to school, we all cried in  excitement...we feel that although you are far away in Beijing  your heart is close to us."    Deng Xiaoping, the general designer of China's reform and  opening up, thinks about children who cannot afford to go to  school and holds them in his heart; and he thinks about the  future and hope of the motherland.  <H8>  (3) </H8>   In April 1992, the Chinese Communist Youth League [CYL]  committee of organs directly under the jurisdiction of the party  Central Committee and Work Committee for Organs under the  Central Committee jointly launched activities of "donating money  to show some love" for the construction of the "Hope Primary  School in Yanan." Leading comrades of the central authorities  enthusiastically responded to the activities.    From June to July in 1992, during activities to solicit  donations for the building of the "Hope Primary School in  Yanan," leading comrades of the party Central Committee and  State Council took the lead in donating money for the project.  From the valuable recording book for donations, we can see some  familiar names, they include:    Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Ding Guangen,  Yang Shangkun, Deng Yingchao, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Bo Yibo, and  Song Renqiong.    From party and state leaders to common staff members and  from  veteran comrades to young people who have just started their  work after graduating from college, each donation involves a  deep feeling and a touching story.    Li Peng, premier of the State Council, who repeatedly  donated money for the project, said: "We were nurtured by the  mountains, water, and people in Yanan. Today, when the people's  living standard has generally been raised, the conditions there  are still very poor. We cannot set our minds at ease. Helping  children there solve their difficulties in attending school is  our unshirkable responsibility."    Comrade Wan Li said: "Education is the fundamental thing in  making a vital and lasting plan. Even if we have to tighten our  belts, we must make some contributions to helping people in the  old revolutionary base areas."    Another leading comrade said: "The amount of money I have  donated is not very much, but it represents my goodwill. It is  hoped that people of the whole country will show concern for and  support the Hope Project, and give our children more hope."    Deng Yingchao was ill when she learned of the project, and  she asked her secretary to send 1,000 RMB to the fund. This  revolutionary of the older generation who repeatedly donated  money to the society passed away three months later; the 1,000  RMB was her last donation.    As of October 1992, organs and units as well as individuals  directly under the central authorities had donated more than  880,000 yuan to the fund. On 1 July 1993, the "Yanan Hope  Primary School," which was filled with the good feelings of  Zhongnanhai, was completed. It can accommodate 600 students in  12 classes.    The leading action of people in Zhongnanhai has prompted  millions of Chinese people to take similar action to show their  love.  <H8>  (4) </H8>   Since October 1989, the Hope Project has developed for over  four years. In this short period, it has achieved remarkable  results.    According to the latest data, since initiation of the Hope  Project more than four years ago, total donations have exceeded  200 million yuan. The project has assisted 549,000 children who  could not afford to attend schools in 27 provinces and  autonomous regions to return to school. The fund has set up 204  hope primary schools.    On 1 May 1993, Wan Li, honorary president of the China Youth  Development Foundation, received some staff members of the  foundation at his residence in Zhongnanhai. The retired veteran  comrade who was chairman of the Standing Committee of the  National People's Congress has profound feelings toward  education. He said: Education is the fundamental and vital plan  of our country. To develop education, the key lies in the work  of leading cadres at various levels. Those leading cadres who  do not attach importance to education are disqualified. Comrade  Xiaoping always attaches great importance to education and is an  outstanding leader with a far-sighted view. Leading cadres at  various levels, regardless of their position, should all  consider education as a major task in national construction,  attach great importance to the task, and support education.    "The meaning of the Hope Project is not merely to aid  tens of thousands of children who cannot afford to attend  school. The more important thing is that it can arouse the whole  society to shown concern for, and care about the growth of the  next generation. The future of the country depends on the next  generation, as does the prosperity or decline of the nation."  Wan Li said passionately: "The Hope Project is not just a  project of the CYL or the foundation. It is a great project and  a cause related to the future of our country and people. The  whole society must show concern for and support this project.  The Hope Project has great hope. I hope the spirit of the  project will be carried forward continuously!"    On 7 February this year, Wan Li made another speech on the  Hope Project. He emphatically pointed out: "If everyone makes  an effort, we can certainly develop education." He said: In  cultivating cross-century talent, the key lies in education.  Wealth is created by the people. If we have people with a good  knowledge of science and technology, we will be able to make  rural areas prosper and make the country rich and powerful. The  Hope Project is a good thing. If we make concerted efforts, we  can certainly achieve success in promoting education.    On 17 July 1993, Vice Premier of the State Council Li  Lanqing  who is in charge of education, spoke at a forum on "implementing  the `Program for Reform and Development of China's Education'  and the `Hope Project.'" He pointed out: The Hope Project is  "very meaningful" because it can not only aid children who  cannot afford to attend school but can also arouse the whole  society to attach importance to, shown concern for, and support  education. He pledged to urge governments at various levels to  give greater support to the Hope Project. He said: Meanwhile,  the Hope Project should also be publicized to enable people to  understand how to take part in the work of aiding children who  cannot afford to attend school.    Two months later, in meeting with representatives of winners  of the first "awards for outstanding workers of the Hope  Project," the vice premier again said: I fully support the Hope  Project because it can arouse the whole society to support and  help the development of education in the rural areas when the  state is still short of money, supplies, and manpower.  Meanwhile, I am convinced the Hope Project is not merely to  gather money. It is significant because it can arouse the whole  society to pay attention to education.    On the eve of "1 June" 1992, the State Council promulgated  the "program for the development of our country's children in  1990's" which considers "further promoting the Hope Project and  helping children of poor families attend school" as important  measures for protecting and ensuring the survival and  development of children.    On 31 May this year, General Secretary Jiang Zemin and  Premier Li Peng held a get-together with more than 200 children  who took part in the "hand in hand" mutual assistance activities  at Yingtai in Beijing. Among those children, many were able to  return to school with the aid of the Hope Project. In their  speeches, Jiang Zemin and Li Peng hoped China's children would  grow in a healthy and robust manner under the sunshine of  socialism and become a fresh force on various fronts of the  motherland. The children used their young voices to express  their determination: We will never let the party and people  down!    The revitalization of the Chinese nation needs education!    For the future, for the children!</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Management: Whistleblower's cautionary tale - Jim Smith's allegation of contracting irregularities was vindicated, yet he lost everything The parliamentary report paper is yellowing with age, but Jim Smith treasures its contents as if they referred to events which happened yesterday. The text outlines his efforts to expose defence contracting irregularities that helped the UK government recover more than Pounds 1m in over-paid profits and led to changes in contracting procedures that saved millions more. Smith has little else to treasure. Identified as a whistleblower, he is now a corporate outcast because he used insider knowledge, gained as a director, to alert authorities to questionable practices at his company. When his allegations of excess profiteering from defence contracts were highlighted by the Public Accounts Committee in the mid-1980s he was hopeful of receiving some compensation and picking up the pieces of a shattered career. Today he is penniless, evicted from his home of 20 years, ostracised by companies that once courted his talents, ignored by a government that valued his help and all but forgotten by the professional bodies to which he belonged. 'I did what I knew to be professionally and ethically right. I cannot halt the suffering. Losing the house was terrible,' he says. Smith's story is particularly relevant at a time when there is growing anxiety in the UK about unethical corporate behaviour. Public Concern at Work, the recently established charity which advises whistleblowers, said in a report this week that a third of the calls to its office during its first month of operation concerned corruption and potential fraud. Smith's case demonstrates that even when an individual's claim is vindicated and he is supported by apparently powerful organisations, he can still be abandoned and forgotten. At one stage in his campaign for government compensation, for instance, he had the support of more than 300 MPs who signed an early day motion calling for government compensation. That all-party support and the recommendation for compensation from the PAC, however, failed to move the Ministry of Defence, which had benefited most from his actions. The Institute of Directors (IoD) - of which he is a member - and his professional body, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (Cima), also backed him but the campaigning subsequently ran out of steam. Smith's fate seemed unimaginable 42 years ago when, as a young school-leaver, he joined the family company that became Ferranti International as a trainee accountant. Within four years he was working with senior directors planning the company's financial future. He became expert at methods of defence contracting and helped the company over one of its most difficult times in the 1960s when it was forced to pay back excess profits on a contract for Bloodhound missiles. In that case, Smith believes the profits had been fairly earned but the company was anxious to keep on friendly terms with the MoD. 'I learned then what damage could be done to a company by an inquiry into its costing methods,' he says. After joining the board of a US-owned, UK-based defence company he first encountered what he considered unethical behaviour. He had raised about Pounds 1m through the MoD's progress payments system to help company cashflow on specific contracts, but the US parent wanted to use the cash elsewhere. Smith alerted the MoD and the payments were postponed. By this time he had left to set up a company doctoring service which advised companies on cash flow. In 1974 he was approached by John Heywood, an ex-management colleague at Ferranti who had become the chief executive of the Horstmann Gear Group. Smith helped the group purchase a UK defence company, Aish, based in Poole, Dorset, and became a director in the same year. Shortly afterwards, he found evidence of over-pricing in a contract won by Aish. He insisted that it was rectified and the figures adjusted in the accounts. He estimated the company would have to pay back Pounds 1m to the MoD. Smith says his approach had the support of Heywood, Aish's chairman, who he says also wanted him to make the position clear to the MoD. The chairman was absent on sick leave, however, in June 1981, when Smith was called to a group board meeting to ratify a set of accounts which did not allow for the overpayment. 'When I refused they frog-marched me out of the building, held in an arm lock. I was instantly dismissed,' he said. Aish told the PAC that Smith was made redundant because his specialist expertise was no longer needed and that Smith had lost an unfair dismissal claim - and subsequent appeal - at an industrial tribunal. The company also said it had approached the MoD about the excess profits before the ministry was passed evidence by Smith. Heywood, the one man in the company powerful enough to persuade the board to reverse its decision, died three weeks after the meeting. By this time Smith had met with MoD officials and outlined the problem contracts. He says the company only admitted the overpricing two years later when the tribunal was about to hear his unfair dismissal claim. This last point was accepted when Smith took his case to the PAC in parliament. His stance was vindicated when it published a report supporting his action and calling for a 'hot line' to encourage whistleblowers to report malpractice in defence contracts. Aish repaid Pounds 421,000 to the MoD and a further Pounds 600,000 was deducted during price renegotiations. An MoD investigation in 1983 decided there was insufficient evidence of criminal activity and that it was a matter for contractual redress. The MoD may have tightened its procedures but it did nothing to help Smith. He says his former customers no longer used him as a consultant for fear that it could upset their relationship with the MoD. 'As soon as you are branded a whistleblower you have an uphill battle to be compensated because people think you are a sneak but that wasn't the case at all for me. It was the people who did the dirty on me that forced the issue. I had been tasked to ensure they did not do anything amiss. I did the right thing.' Losing the industrial tribunal, unusually heard in camera, was perhaps the most severe of Smith's setbacks. Another blow was evidence from MoD officials refuting his contention that he had raised the matter a year before any approach by the company. The discrepancy in the evidence was never reconciled. Nevertheless, Sir Gordon Downey, then comptroller and auditor general in 1985, concluded: 'Mr Smith's allegations clearly had a significant impact on the volume and effectiveness of MoD's post costing activity with this firm.' There remains a feeling among some who helped Smith at the time that he was badly treated but that avenues which might have put right the wrongs have been exhausted. Andrew Hutchinson, principal research officer at the IoD, said his organisation tried to help Smith. He says: 'We did our best to encourage his creditors to be reasonably lenient with him on the grounds that he had been put into this position through acting on principle.' He adds: 'I could see no particular reason to suppose that the situation was anything other than what he had alleged. It had all the appearance to me of a fairly good civil service snow job.' Cima admits it might have done more to help. A note left by an official in the case file says: 'The institute was simply not in a position to champion Smith's cause.' Bunny Warren, assistant secretary, who was not an official at the time, says the institute was not wealthy enough. 'He was up against a big company which would have been prepared to take senior legal advice and be represented to make sure they didn't lose the case.' He says the institute provided loans and grants to Smith and was unlikely to pursue them for repayment. It is also paying a weekly sum that is kept low so that it does not affect payment of his state benefit. 'If you look at it in the hard light of day I suppose we should have done more,' says Warren. The only new interest now comes from Public Concern, which wants to revive government interest in Smith's case. Guy Dehn, director of Public Concern, says: 'If anyone in the US had done what he did they would have been paid a very large sum of money. They certainly wouldn't have been dismissed and ruined.' Smith's experience, though, is not untypical of whistleblowers. In perhaps the most famous example, Stanley Adams was awarded Pounds 200,000 compensation from the European Commission after he exposed illegal price-fixing by Hoffman La Roche. His whistleblowing led to a suspended one-year jail sentence under Swiss industrial espionage laws in 1976 after the suicide of his wife who had feared a much more severe sentence. According to a survey of 87 whistleblowers in the US six years ago some 17 per cent of them lost their homes, 8 per cent filed for bankruptcy, 15 per cent filed for divorce and 10 per cent attempted suicide. Aish itself was sold by Horstmann and became Widney-Aish. Michael Windsor, current executive chairman of Horstmann, says he knows little about the case, but comments that no good had come of it for the company.</p>

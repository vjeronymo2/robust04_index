			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Bosnian Serbs given heavy-weapons deadline INTERNATIONAL mediators have given Bosnian Serbs until next weekend to place their heavy weapons around four key Bosnian cities under UN control, they said yesterday. The mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, who are chairing a new international peace conference on the former Yugoslavia, issued their statement in Geneva. They called on Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic to 'honour the seven-day deadline by concentrating the weapons concerned at notified locations around the four cities' - Sarajevo, Gorazde, Bihac and Jajce. In Sarajevo yesterday, the 380,000 inhabitants were trapped without water supplies while the humanitarian airlift to the Bosnian capital stays suspended. Mortar shells destroyed a truck at a UN supply warehouse and UN officials said it seemed the relief effort was being deliberately targeted. Doctors in Sarajevo said cholera and hepatitis had broken out. People collected rainwater after water supplies were cut off on Saturday. Snow fell in the city, warning of an early winter. The last lifeline to the Bosnian capital was severed on Thursday when an Italian aid flight crashed west of the city. UN teams are trying to determine if the aircraft was shot down. UN officials said food supplies were extremely low in the city, where six people were killed on Saturday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 28 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin praised the results of Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev's first official visit to Russia as "very successful."    Meeting journalists after the ceremony of signing  Russian-Kazakh bilateral agreements in the Kremlin on Monday,  Yeltsin described the visit as "the first and very important  official visit by the head of the Republic of Kazakhstan to  Russia."    Yeltsin said Russia and Kazakhstan signed a record number of  bilateral agreements. The prime ministers of the two countries  and Russian and Kazakh governmental delegations signed a total  of 23 bilateral agreements, including on political, economic and  military cooperation.    "Russia and Kazakhstan already have the basis of bilateral  relations, namely the bilateral treaty of friendship and  cooperation," he continued. "But this document needs to be  developed and expanded." The Russian leader said that all the  documents had been prepared thoroughly and long. The agreement  on the Baykonur cosmodrome had been ironed out for nearly a year.    Nazarbayev stressed that his visit "sweeps away all talks  and  rumours about Russia's imperial activity." Both sides had  "overcome all difficulties," he added.    Commenting on the agreement on Baykonur, Nazarbayev replied  that the Kazakh side "understands how important Baykonur is for  Russia now," added that "Kazakhstan did not want to keep it in  its pocket."    Yeltsin noted that the "difficulties which emerged in this  issue were connected not with the political aspect, but mostly  with the technical and economic one."    The president explained that the latter concerned primarily  technical and economic support for the people living in the city  of Leninsk and servicing the cosmodrome.    Under the agreement, Kazakhstan will lease the cosmodrome to  Russia for 20 years with further prolongation of the term for  another ten years. Russia will pay 115 million U.S. dollars to  Kazakhstan annually in lease payments. The agreement also  considers Baykonur Russian territory for the duration of the  lease period where all Russian laws will have equal force as in  the rest of Russia.    The two presidents also signed an agreement on the  development of economic cooperation and integration, a  memorandum of the basic principles of resolving issues  concerning the civil and legal status of citizens of Kazakhstan  living in Russia and Russian citizens residing in Kazakhstan, an  agreement on military cooperation and an agreement on strategic  nuclear forces temporarily stationed in Kazakhstan.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Arts: The Rape of Lucretia - fortissimo / Opera The music is the main reason for celebrating the return of English National Opera's 10-year-old Rape of Lucretia. This first of the Britten chamber operas is nowadays one of the less often performed of his stage works, yet it boasts one of the most ravishing and finely fashioned of all his scores. In the Coliseum - London's largest theatre and therefore, one would once have thought, miles too large for it - the instrumental filigree fills out the spaces with unforced, unexaggerated radiance. A single phrase for the harp conjures up images of Lucretia's serene domesticity (did any theatre-composer ever re-imagine the instrument more inventively than Britten?); the stuttering cor anglais lament after her rape achingly uncovers thoughts and feelings temporarily too painful for verbalisation. If, indeed, one wanted to demonstrate the mysterious power of music to make fully-fledged drama out of inadequate verbal material, it is The Rape of Lucretia that one might well scan for particularly pointful examples. The artiness of Ronald Duncan's verse-libretto becomes no easier to bear with the passing of the years. Yet, since the dramatic scheme beneath the poetastery suggested possibilities to which Britten was responsive, the opera becomes through its music an intensely affecting drama of adult people and adult emotional conflict. The music is well treated - and very well played - in this ENO revival. It is not yet unfolded with ideal containment and reticence: on Wednesday the conductor, David Parry, seemed too intent on urging drama, force of statement, maximum volume from all his performers, and insufficiently trustful of the score's innate carrying power. The performance was certainly kept moving; there was no slacking of the reins. But there is a kind of expressive delicacy that one recalls from Lucretia performances long past, and which - to its slight detriment - this one lacked. Vocally likewise: while the current ENO cast contains voices of genuine 'operatic' amplitude and authority, much more so than the English Opera Group used to have at its disposal, the use of those voices was not always disciplined to tapping the sense of the musical lines. Kim Begley, now a splendid dramatic tenor in full sail, apt for Lohengrin or Siegmund in any theatre, rang out from on high as the Male Chorus; mutatis mutandis, the same qualities could be admired in Rita Cullis's Female Chorus. Understatement was not an option chosen by either singer; nuance was missing. The other male members of the strong cast - Peter Coleman-Wright (Tarquinius), Paul Napier-Burrows (Junius), even Richard van Allan's well-remembered Collatinus - also needed to draw in their vocal horns. The other females commanded much more of the refinements on which the vocal writing is predicated: Jean Rigby once again a direct, deeply moving Lucretia (apparently not in best voice), Yvonne Barclay a light, pretty Lucia, and - best of all - Catherine Wyn-Rogers a Bianca of grave, calm steadiness of utterance. In 1983 Graham Vick's spare production, with its wooden platform, screens, balconied walkway and absolute frankness of statement, carried a fierce dramatic charge; rehearsed now by Sally Day, it seemed plain but not always dramatically potent. But the wonderful beauty of the music is never scathed or slighted: which is grounds enough for warmly welcoming the revival.

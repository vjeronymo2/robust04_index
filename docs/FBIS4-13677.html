			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by the House of Representatives </F> in Amman on 21 April--read by announcer]    [Text] In its session yesterday, the House of  Representatives discussed the latest political developments,  represented by the Israeli threats to Jordan and the continuing  U.S. siege of the Port of al-'Aqabah. The House is of the view  that the historic speech by His Majesty King Husayn on  completing the first phase of the third Hashemite restoration of  the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of Rock has again emphasized  Jordan's firm pan-Arab policy on the Palestinian cause, the  peace plan, and Arab and humanitarian issues. The House  expresses its full support for the Jordanian position on the  concept of a just peace in the region, based on the rights of  the Palestinians in their Palestinian homeland and the return of  Arab sovereignty over Jerusalem, in harmony with international  legitimacy and human rights.    The House of Representatives reiterates its rejection and  utter denunciation of any Israeli or Western accusations or  threats under the pretext of supporting what Israel calls  terrorism, and holds the Israeli Government responsible for the  results of hindering the peace and stalling the implementation  of the UN resolutions known the world over, and and  circumventing these resolutions by exploiting U.S. support for  it and the weakness of the Arab position and Arab coordination.    The House expresses its strong support for the struggle and  steadfastness of the Palestinian Arab people in their legitimate  defense of their land and rights and stresses its stand by our  Palestinian people in their just struggle and jihad, which is  guaranteed by all international norms and agreements, the Geneva  Conventions, and human rights charter.    The House highly appreciates His Majesty King Husayn's  personal backing for the restoration of the al-Aqsa Mosque and  the Dome of the Rock and values his majesty's efforts to  preserve the Arab city of Jerusalem, the symbol of peace, and  the Muslim and Christian holy places in it, from any tampering  whatsoever. The House also expresses its denunciation and  condemnation of the continuous U.S. aggression against the Arab  nation, represented by the continuing unjust U.S. blockade on  the Gulf of Aqaba with the aim of putting all kinds of pressure  on steadfast Jordan, to deny it the freedom of national choice,  to compel it to abandon its firm pan-Arab policies, and force it  to sign a separate peace with Israel in order to serve the  Israeli and U.S. objectives of controlling the region and its  wealth. The House voices its denunciation of the U.S. blockade  against the fraternal people of Iraq and the continuing denial  of food and medicine to Iraq.</p>

As a result of generally analyzing the remarks of evangelist  Billy Graham, who visited Pyongyang on 31 January; UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali; and Gary Ackerman, chairman of the  Asia-Pacific Affairs Subcommittee of the House Foreign Relations  Committee, who personally met with President Kim Il-song  recently; the ROK and the United States can see that such an  analysis is very likely to be true.    According to authorities concerned on 6 February, President  Kim Il-song has an optimistic view that the nuclear issue will  be properly resolved through dialogue with the United States but  he is not aware that North Korea should accept full-scope  inspections by the IAEA in a bid to hold dialogue with the  United States.    On the same day, a government official said that "It was  highly likely that North Korean officials in charge of nuclear  issues reported to President Kim that accepting only limited  inspections [chehan sachal] by the IAEA is necessary to resolve  the nuclear issue." He added that "They, however, have not  reported again to President Kim Il-song that North Korea should  accept full-scope inspections to meet the IAEA's demand."    Considering the closed North Korean system, the ROK and the  United States are concerned about the fact that because North  Korean officials in charge of nuclear negotiations worry about  their reshuffle, they will adhere to the limited inspections  without using a "negotiation card" in negotiations on  inspections and, thus, they may lead the situation to an  unexpected catastrophe, including the nuclear issue which may be  referred to the UN Security Council.</p>

Despite this holiday, the head of state and the leadership  of  the city and the region, at a meeting behind closed doors,  managed to discuss a wide range of actual problems for the  region which demanded the settlement at the presidential level.    According to Anatoliy Sobchak, the president promised to  support the St. Petersburg authorities in financing, from the  federal budget, the construction of new metro lines which are  extremely necessary to the city. The mayor of St. Petersburg  obtained Boris Yeltsin's consent to promote the St. Petersburg  project of accomplishing the construction of the dam [as  received]. This issue will be submitted for the Russian  Government's consideration.    Participants in the meeting discussed the possibilities of  crediting of house building which is very actual for St.  Petersburg where considerable part of the population are still  living in shared flats. The spectrum of issues discussed today  was extremely wide, also including subsidizing products of stock  breeding which are delivered to St. Petersburg from the  Leningrad region, timely receipt of funds for the preparation  for the Good Will Games due to be held in summer, and quoting  some kinds of goods.    Special attention was paid to the settlement of problems  with  petrol taking into account that the Surgut Company is the  monopolist in petrol deliveries to St. Petersburg and therefore  maintains prices for this fuel at the highest level in the  country. According to Anatoliy Sobchak, the city authorities  proposed to the president the mechanism for overcoming the  monopolism in this field, and the president intends to sign an  appropriate decree.    The sensation of the day was the St. Petersburg mayor's  report that Boris Yeltsin agreed in principle to turn the city  of Kronshtadt into a free economic zone. This city will be  stage-by- stage opened up for tourists and citizens of St.  Petersburg. The navy base located on the territory of  Kronshtadt will have to be moved to some other place. According  to Anatoliy Sobchak, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev who  was present at the meeting said "yes" on this issue.    In addition, many problems concerning the Leningrad region  were solved at the Russian president's meeting with the  leadership of this region.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Cardoso's presidential hopes boosted by Real Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's presidential candidate and former finance minister, appears to have significantly closed the gap on his main rival since the introduction of the country's new currency, the Real, this month. Mr Cardoso negotiated the Real and other economic measures through Congress before resigning to run for president. He needs the new currency to be seen as effective in reducing inflation if he is to catch the front runner, left-winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Before the currency was launched, Mr da Silva led Mr Cardoso by 41 per cent to 19 per cent in opinion polls. But a poll released yesterday, and conducted after the new currency's introduction, showed Mr da Silva's support for the October election falling to 34 per cent and Mr Cardoso's rising to 25 per cent. More important, the Datafolha poll showed the two level on 43 per cent for the second round run-off. The findings backed up polls conducted before the new currency had time to take effect, which suggested a swing to Mr Cardoso. The stock market, which fears Mr da Silva would prevent liberalisation of Brazil's economy, gained more than 2 per cent in early trading yesterday. This followed a near 5 per cent increase on Thursday after another poll suggested Mr Cardoso had gained ground in the populous state of Minas Gerais. Mr da Silva and his Workers' party (PT) played down the poll's significance and pointed out that Mr Cardoso was still behind in every state. Mr da Silva has had a difficult week, fighting off corruption allegations against his running mate Jose Paulo Bisol. The press claims may not matter in terms of votes, but denial of them has taken up valuable campaigning time. The latest poll also showed a sharp fall in opposition to the new currency. The proportion of people believing themselves worse off because of its introduction has more than halved to 20 per cent, while 67 per cent of people said the currency was good for Brazil. Inflation is expected to fall to a single figure this month. This compares with an inflation rate of 50 per cent in June under the old currency, the cruzeiro real.</p>

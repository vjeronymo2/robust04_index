			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Banks warned on lending policies HIGH STREET banks should be more open about their methods of deciding whether to lend to small businesses, Mr Pen Kent, an associate director of the Bank of England, said yesterday. Mr Kent, the Bank director in charge of guiding relations between banks and industry, also said banks could be moving lending managers too frequently for them to build relationships with small companies. Mr Kent said banks should question a number of their practices as part of an effort to improve communication. He said small companies should also make more effort to provide potential backers with financial information. He described short-term bank loans and overdraft finance on which many small companies have relied as often 'entirely inappropriate' and said this encouraged the wrong sort of relationship between banks and companies. Mr Kent said banks should question 'whether they could be more open in what they are looking for when assessing proposals', and whether they could help companies avoid refusal or withdrawal of credit facilities. He said that financing options, rather than overdrafts, needed 'to be explored more systematically'. Banks were becoming more aware that they should offer finance 'packages' with different sorts of facilities. Mr Kent's remarks follow criticism by some small business organisations that banks' methods of deciding whether or not to offer loans and their terms are not understood by many borrowers. However, Mr Kent said he believed many banks were correctly starting to place more emphasis on cashflow and the state of the on-going business in lending decisions rather than relying on the value of the underlying asset. He said that the difficulties between banks and small businesses were part of a wider problem of 'a lack of information and inadequate communication' between British companies and financial institutions. It was particularly important that the recovery of small business activity was not hindered by lack of funds.</p>

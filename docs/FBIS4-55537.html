			<p>BFN     [Text] Over the past four years, there has been a drastic  drop in trade union membership in the Czech Republic. Of the  initial 92 percent, membership has dropped to the present 36  percent. Only 22 percent of the work force employed in private  companies are trade union members, said Jaroslav Strait,  chairman of the Trade Unions Association of Bohemia, Moravia,  and Silesia. He said that the current trend in the development  of the trade union movement is worrying. What is disappearing  is not only trade unions but also ordinary human solidarity,  Strait said, adding that the pressure the state exerts on the  social and economic rights of the people has strongly  intensified and that ever tougher standards are asked for.    Strait said that all of this is happening with the help of  the Czech-Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions. He branded this  organization as a government-run trade union.</p>

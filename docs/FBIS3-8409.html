Members of the SZDSZ delegation, headed by the party's  parliamentary faction head and prime minister candidate Gabor  Kuncze, told MTI they had raised to Hrebenciuc the problem of  releasing Transylvanian Hungarian convicts imprisoned in  connection with the 1989 December revolution in Romania.  Hrebenciuc said a positive decision is expected in the matter  soon.    SZDSZ delegates stressed that the affair of Romania's ethnic  Hungarian community and the Hungarian-Romanian basic treaty were  inseparable from each other.    As for the delay in opening new border posts, Hrebenciuc  said  construction will begin between Battonya and Turnu, and between  Mehkerek and Salonta, with further crossings in the offing.    Coposu said his party sticks to the principles laid down in  the 1918 Alba Iulia declaration stating that Romanian Hungarians  are entitled to the same rights as the Romanians, with special  regard to education, including the opportunity of pursuing  higher studies in the native language.</p>

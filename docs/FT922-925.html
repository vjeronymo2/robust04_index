			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: Daimler confident of rise in year's sales and profits TURNOVER at Daimler-Benz, the German engineering, aerospace and electronics group, is likely to be around the 'magic DM100bn mark' this year, up from DM95bn (Dollars 60.1bn) last year, the company's chief executive reiterated yesterday. At the company's annual meeting in Berlin, Mr Edzard Reuter said that profits were also likely to be ahead of last year's result, but gave no other details. This confirms Mr Reuter's optimism as signalled last month when Daimler reported a 14 per cent increase in first-quarter net profits (to DM480m) and turnover up 16 per cent to DM22bn. He stressed that the group's aim was to continue increasing the dividend in line with growth in profits. It lifted the dividend last year, from DM12 to DM13 a share, for the first time in six years, following an 8 per cent rise in net profits to DM1.9bn for the year. He outlined a number of general risks facing the company in the remaining months of the year, but he said Daimler faced the future with 'quiet and confident optimism'. At Mercedes-Benz, Daimler's vehicle subsidiary, turnover is expected to rise 4.5 per cent to DM70bn this year. On the passenger vehicle side, he said the new S-Class luxury car model was proving extraordinarily successful. However, general weakness in world markets meant that in total unit sales of cars were not as good as had been hoped at the beginning of the year.</p>

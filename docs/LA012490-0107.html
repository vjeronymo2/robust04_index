			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> In the middle of his second season as coach, you begin to get the impression  that Jim Harrick is the best thing to happen to UCLA basketball since John  Wooden. . . .  </P> <P> Gene Bartow had rabbit ears. Gary Cunningham didn't really want to coach. Larry  Brown had wanderlust. Neither Larry Farmer nor Walt Hazzard won enough to  satisfy high expectations. . . .  </P> <P> Solid. That's Jim Harrick. Twelve wins, three defeats. A conference  championship contender. An exciting, fast-breaking style. Renewed fan interest.  . . .  </P> <P> Among other things, Harrick has brought Tracy Murray along perfectly. He didn't  rush the hotshot freshman from Glendora High, who is now contributing heavily  as a starter. . . .  </P> <P> Sellouts for Oregon State Saturday and DePaul on Feb. 3 at Pauley Pavilion  already have been announced, and the March issue of Sport magazine is about to  hit the newsstands with a story proclaiming the "Bruins Are Back." . . .  </P> <P> There never will be another Wooden, but here is a guy who could very well stay  on the job longer than the first five coaches combined who followed the Wizard  of Westwood. . . .  </P> <P> The knockdown Mike Tyson suffered in a sparring session with Greg Page in Tokyo  probably is meaningless. Most gym workouts are. . . .  </P> <P> However, I remember watching a ferocious George Foreman knock a sparring  partner out of the ring a few days before he did virtually the same thing to  Joe Frazier in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1973. . . .  </P> <P> Veteran promoter Don Chargin says Sugar Ray Robinson was the best gym fighter  he has ever seen and former featherweight champion Raul Rojas the worst. . . .  </P> <P> If you were making an instructional film on the art of self-defense, WBC  bantamweight champ Raul Perez would be your man. . . .  </P> <P> Ram owner Georgia Frontiere was in a generous mood this week, signing Jim  Everett for six years the same day she took out a full-page advertisement in  The Times to thank the team's fans. . . .  </P> <P> Saddest sight in the NBA is Ralph Sampson limping up and down the court. . . .  </P> <P> One good thing about playing for an organization with the history of the Los  Angeles Clippers is that club records always are within easy reach. For  instance, the Clippers' best won-loss record since moving to Los Angeles for  the 1984-85 season was a sparkling 32-50 in 1985-86. . . .  </P> <P> Now that Ron Harper can't make the All-Star Game, how about a spot on the  Western Conference roster for teammate Charles Smith? . . .  </P> <P> A two-point victory at home over an expansion team (Minnesota) and a 32-point  loss to a cellar-dweller (Sacramento) tells me the Clippers have to make a deal  for a guard. . . .  </P> <P> The Clippers could have had Charlotte guard Dell Curry, who was signed to a  multiyear contract Tuesday, for Greg Kite last year. . . .  </P> <P> Four NBA teams with losing records -- Charlotte, Sacramento, Golden State and  Miami -- have sold out every home game this season. . . .  </P> <P> The Cal State Long Beach uniforms that supposedly are gold look more like  fluorescent pistachio. . . .  </P> <P> We got everything -- including dissertations on Michael Jordan -- except the  score from ESPN announcers Barry Tompkins and Quinn Buckner on the Long  Beach-Nevada Las Vegas telecast Monday. . . .  </P> <P> Joe Harrington is doing an outstanding job coaching Long Beach, but must he  also referee every game? . . .  </P> <P> One of the most remarkable streaks in sports is Jerry Tarkanian's 73  consecutive victories in Long Beach -- 63-0 as coach of the 49ers, 10-0 as  coach of the Runnin' Rebels. . . .  </P> <P> Members of the last college basketball team to have a perfect record --  Indiana's 1975-76 national champions -- congratulate Bobby Knight each season  after the final previously unbeaten team has lost. The calls began coming in  Saturday after Kansas was beaten by Missouri. . . .  </P> <P> That NCAA proposal to move conversions back to the 25-yard line would have made  two-point attempts somewhat risky. . . .  </P> <P> I break into a sweat watching five-set Australian Open matches on TV. . . .  </P> <P> One of the keys to the rise of the Toronto Maple Leafs is the absence of ailing  owner Harold Ballard from the front office. . . .  </P> <P> Those who don't believe alcohol ranks right up there with drugs as a problem in  sports should check the police blotter of the Minnesota Vikings. . . .  </P> <P> Vince Lombardi once called the Playoff Bowl, which used to match the losers of  the NFL Western and Eastern Conference championship games, "a hinky-dink game  for hinky-dink teams." . . .  </P> <P> Try telling members of the U.S. World Cup soccer team, who are being paid  anywhere from $26,000 to $40,000, how much their sport is gaining in  popularity.  </P></p>

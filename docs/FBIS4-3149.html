			<p>BFN     [Text] After a three-day session, the conference sponsored  by the provincial radio and television broadcasting department  with the participation of directors of the radio and television  broadcasting bureaus and stations of various prefectures and  cities concluded in Harbin on the afternoon of 14 April. During  the conference, the spirit of the national work conference on  propaganda and ideology was relayed; the experiences gained in  implementing the tasks adopted at the provincial work conference  on radio and television broadcasting were summarized and  exchanged; and the issues of how to have the radio and  television departments reinforce their vitality in the course of  establishing the systems of socialist market economy as well as  successfully conduct propaganda activities and develop radio and  television broadcasting undertakings were emphatically discussed.    During the conference, the participating comrades contended  that the provincial work conference sponsored in November 1993  on radio and television broadcasting was a grand gathering of  unprecedented size in the province's history of radio and  television broadcasting development. The spirit of the  provincial work conference in this regard has begun to promote  or is promoting the development of radio and television  broadcasting undertakings in the province. Although only six  months have been over after the provincial work conference in  this regard, the work to implement the spirit of the work  conference has won initial success and a favorable and  encouraging trend in the work has taken shape. The leading  bodies of party committees and governments at the  prefecture-city level have generally listened to the report  given by the radio and television broadcasting department and  formulated actually feasible measures for stabilizing the  broadcasting organs at the county level, consolidating the rural  broadcasting network, and carrying out propaganda management.  Some units have also made great and important moves. For  example, the Suifenhe city party committee and people's  government summarized in a timely manner their experience and  lessons gained in this regard; restored the operation of some  city radio and television broadcasting organs that had been once  revoked according to their local reality; and enhanced the  systematic management over the radio and television broadcasting  front. Such acts conducted by them have evoked strong  repercussion among the radio and television broadcasting  departments throughout the province.    It was emphatically pointed out at the conference that radio  and television broadcasting departments at all levels are facing  a severe test. They should not only do a good job in being the  mouthpiece of the party, government, and the people, but also  steadily deepen their self improvement. This requires them to  always regard as a guiding principle the socialist theory of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and to do a good job in guiding public  opinions and setting people's minds at rest. In conducting the  propaganda work, they should consciously uphold the principle of  applying the scientific theories to arming the people; applying  correct public opinions to guiding the people; adopting lofty  spirit to educate the people; and using the outstanding works to  encourage the people. They should truly achieve in being really  helpful and refraining from adding turmoil to society, playing  the main melody and refraining from creating noise, paying  attention to social benefits and refraining from forgetting the  righteousness while seeing the interest, observing the  propaganda discipline and refraining from going their own way,  presenting concrete facts and refraining from being pretended,  and vigorously grasping implementation and refraining from  indulging in formalism. They should also make contributions to  realizing political stability, social peace, and economic  development in the province.    It was pointed out at the conference that radio and  television broadcasting departments are facing so many  difficulties of which, the prominent one is the strained  situation in funds. They should continuously seek more support  and investments from the state on one hand and concentrate their  efforts on tapping internal potential on the other hand by  deepening their self improvement and upgrading the quality of  personnel's contingent and propaganda work so as to truly  provide for the people rich, colorful, and healthy nourishments  for the mind, which can encourage the people to make progress.    At the conference responsible comrades from the provincial  radio and television broadcasting department and the radio and  television broadcasting bureaus of various prefectures, cities,  and fronts voiced their opinions on their future work of  carrying out propaganda management, developing broadcasting  undertakings, conducting technical management, and of building  spiritual civilization.</p>

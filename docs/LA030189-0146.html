			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> EC QUESTIONS U.S. TRADE SINCERITY  </P> <P> The European Community said today the United States' latest move to boost  subsidies for farm exports suggests Washington is not committed to serious  reforms.  </P> <P> The EC-U.S. deadlock over agriculture is the biggest obstacle to success in the  Uruguay Round of talks to liberalize world trade, which resume at ministerial  level next month after a stalemate in Montreal in December.  </P> <P> U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter Tuesday asked Congress to remove  the ceiling on how much the United States can spend on subsidies under its  Export Enhancement Program to strengthen Washington's hand in the talks, held  under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  </P> <P> "(Yeutter's remarks) are not helpful to the development of a cordial and  friendly atmosphere in these negotiations, so essential to the interests of  U.S. and European Community agriculture," EC Agriculture Commissioner Ray  MacSharry said today.  </P></p>

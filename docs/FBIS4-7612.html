			<p>BFN     [Text] Kragujevac, 3 Apr (TANJUG) -- The Muslim offensive  code-named "The Final Liberation of the Unitary  Bosnia-Herzegovina" [Konacno oslobodjenje cjelovite Bosne I  Hercegovine], launched in the middle of the last week against  all Serb positions, has failed to yield any results, being a  totally disorganized action, according to General Manojlo  Milovanovic.    In the "Hallmark of Time" program on Radio Kragujevac,  General Milovanovic referred to the setting up of a federation  between the Muslims and Croats and went on to explain the  reasons why it was created and the role of military circles in  this move. "First, the Muslims rid themselves of the Croats as  the enemy, while on the other hand the Croats were facing total  military defeat and had to agree on the federation."    Asked if the Croats had joined in Muslim armed attacks  against Serbs, General Milovanovic said: "No. They have been  completely passive in relation to us and the Muslims and, like  cunning Latins, are waiting to see who is going to win and then  take the side of the stronger."    Explaining the main objectives of the Muslim offensive,  General Milovanovic singled out Posavina and Podrinje as its  main targets. "In Posavina the Muslims want to cut through the  Serb corridor. They need to capture Brcko, and the Croats want  to keep the areas where the Croat population was in the majority  before the war. The Muslims have two options in the Drina river  basin -- one of them is a lateral operation [esast to west] to  reach the left bank of the Drina river from Tuzla and Kalesija  to Zvornik, then to link up with Srebrenica from Kladanj via  Vlasenica, to link up with Zepa from Olovo via Sokolac and Han  Pijesak and also to link Sarajevo with Gorazde. The other  option is a vertical operation [south to north] to connect the  Muslim enclaves from Gorazde toward Zepa, from Zepa to  Srebrenica and from there to Zvornik, or the other way round."    Milovanovic said that there is a rift between the Muslim  military and state leadership and that the offensive was  originally scheduled for the autumn. This is clearly a result  of the military leadership's wish to prove themselves.    Commenting on the arrival of Turkish units, Milovanovic said  that this is a clear provocation or a sign of the UN Security  Council's weakness. "This is a religious and not a civil war,  and the world should be aware of it. This is a war between  Christianity and Islam."</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CZECHS EVICT CUBANS FROM EMBASSY IN U.S.;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: IT'S GETTING HARDER FOR A COMMUNIST COUNTRY TO FIND A SPONSOR IN  WASHINGTON.  </P> <P> Cuba's low-level diplomatic mission to Washington, technically a tenant of the  Czechoslovak Embassy since 1977, received an eviction notice Wednesday. The  move could force Cuba to find another sponsor or lose its only official contact  with the United States.  </P> <P> But, in yet another sign of how much the world has changed in the last year,  the hard-line Communist nation may find that it has few allies willing to  sponsor its interests section. Such sections are established by governments  that do not have full diplomatic relations with a given country and operate  under the sponsorship of nations that do.  </P> <P> Few old-style Communist governments are still represented in Washington for  Cuba to approach. There has been speculation that Iraq might extend a welcome  because the Cuban delegate to the Security Council defended Iraq in the United  Nations.  </P> <P> Another potential sponsor would be Yemen, whose U.N. envoy joined Cuba to cast  the only votes against a dozen U.N. resolutions involving Iraq.  </P> <P> Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel came under pressure from U.S. congressional  and human rights groups to drop the Cubans last December after he took office  as leader of his country's first non-Communist government in more than 40  years.  </P> <P> During a visit here earlier this year, Havel was asked about the Cuban  sponsorship by Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and other legislators. Havel responded  that his new government had higher priority problems.  </P> <P> But, as Daniel Vesely of the Czech Embassy confirmed Wednesday, "The Foreign  Ministry today delivered notes to the U.S. and Cuban embassies in Prague,  saying that the government of the Czech and Slovak Republic will no longer be  responsible for the Cuban interests section in Washington."  </P> <P> A State Department source said the United States finds the section "useful" in  facilitating communications in the absence of normal diplomatic relations. He  added, "It will be up to the government of Cuba to find an alternative host  embassy."  </P> <P> In Havana, a Foreign Ministry statement announced the change and said that  another country will be sought to represent Cuba's interests in the United  States.  </P> <P> Freedom House, a human rights advocacy group headquartered in New York, led the  drive to persuade the new Czech government to stop sponsoring the Cubans here.  R. Bruce Malcolm, executive director of Freedom House, wrote to Havel last  January protesting that Czechoslovakia continued to "represent in the United  States a government which denies its citizens even the most fundamental human  rights."  </P> <P> Malcolm reminded Havel that Fidel Castro endorsed the Soviet invasion of  Czechoslovakia in 1968 and "even today condemns the movement toward democracy  throughout the world."  </P> <P> Of Human Rights, a Washington-based group dedicated to attaining freedom for  Cuban political prisoners, also asked Czechoslovakia to end its relationship  with Castro.  </P> <P> The Cuban interests section -- two dozen diplomats and their families -- is  housed in the old, pre-Castro embassy in a diplomatic enclave in Washington. A  brass plaque on the iron fence surrounding the building still reads "Embassy of  the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic," although the nation dropped the Socialist  appellation after electing a non-Communist government.  </P> <P> Cuba broke relations with the United States in 1961 and had no links until it  established its interests section under Czechoslovak sponsorship in 1977.  </P> <P> Like their American counterparts in Havana, the Cuban diplomats perform many of  the functions of an embassy. The U.S. interests section in Cuba operates under  the protection of the embassy of neutral Switzerland. No change is expected in  its status.  </P> <P> The only other interests section now in Washington is Iran's, which operates  under the aegis of the Algerian Embassy.  </P></p>

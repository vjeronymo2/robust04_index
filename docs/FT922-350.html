			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Economists call for devaluation BRITAIN should consider devaluing sterling within the European exchange rate mechanism among other measures to stimulate the economy and cut government borrowing, according to economists at London Business School. In the school's latest Economic Viewpoint, Professor David Currie and Mr Geoffrey Dicks say the Bank of England rather than the Treasury should be given responsibility for setting interest rates and reducing inflation. They say the combination of those moves would keep confidence in sterling on financial markets relatively high, while the effects of devaluing sterling would help Britain's international competitiveness. According to the economists, Britain 'remains in severe recession' with economic growth of just 0.1 per cent likely this year. Unemployment is likely to rise to 3m by mid 1993, with the public-sector borrowing requirement increasing from Pounds 30bn in the present financial year to Pounds 34bn in 1993-94. In such gloomy circumstances, a devaluation might help Britain to bring borrowing under control. It could be a prelude to tough measures by the Treasury to constrain increases in public spending for the coming financial year. Unless action is taken, the increases in prospect for the PSBR might undermine confidence in sterling. The LBS says that reducing the pound's central DM2.95 rate in the ERM should be considered only in the context of the other measures proposed. To reduce the value of the pound in the ERM by itself 'would be a very serious mistake', the report says, as it might lead to investors' selling sterling and to an upsurge in inflation. Letting the Bank set UK interest rates would assure markets that decisions over monetary policy were free from political influences. It would thus aid confidence in sterling. Economic Outlook.

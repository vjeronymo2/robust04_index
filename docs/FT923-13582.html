			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Concorde reaches supersonic milestone CONCORDE reached a signif-icant milestone yesterday by completing 250,000 supersonic flying hours in commercial service with British Airways but the aircraft is showing signs of its age. The UK carrier said the supersonic hours flown by Concorde now totalled more than all the supersonic flying hours completed by the combined air forces of the west since the introduction of supersonic combat aircraft. This achievement comes as the Anglo-French airliner, which began commercial service with BA and Air France in 1976, has suffered a series of technical problems. These include the loss of parts of its rudder during supersonic flight on three occasions since 1989. BA is now subjecting Concorde rudders to scrupulous checks after every five flights compared with normal inspections after each 50 to 100 flights. It has also commissioned new rudders from British Aerospace at a cost of about Pounds 5m to be fitted on all BA's seven Concordes. The company said yesterday the first new rudder would be fitted in November. Both BA and Air France want to stretch the working life of the aircraft into the next century in an effort to continue supersonic services until a second generation supersonic airliner is developed to replace Concorde. Without modifications, Concorde is expected to reach its operational limit by 1998-99. British Aerospace and Aerospatiale, the two Concorde airframe manufacturers, as well as Rolls-Royce and Snecma of France, the engine suppliers, are working with the two airlines to make design adjustments and improvements to extend Concorde's operational life to 2005 or possibly 2010. Both UK and French airworthiness authorities are satisfied Concorde remains safe and the rudder incidents did not represent a serious risk to the air-craft. Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said Concorde had to have its certificate of airworthiness renewed each year. The aircraft were 'monitored on a continuous basis and have to be maintained in accordance to a very strict maintenance schedule to anticipate any eventual problems'.

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Pensions blow to government contracting-out plans THE PROGRAMME of market-testing public services faces another serious setback after a ruling from the attorney-general that contractors will have to provide 'broadly comparable' pension rights in many cases where staff are transferred from the public sector. Under Transfer of Undertakings (Tupe) regulations, which apply to many contracts, companies are obliged to retain the existing workforce on the same terms and conditions. But most companies had assumed, encouraged by the government, that big savings could be made in pension payments. Many contractors have only been able to take over profitably services in the National Health Service, local government and the Civil Service by offering less generous pension arrangements than the typically index-linked public sector pension. But Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney-general, has upheld his department's advice on Tupe, ignored when granting most previous contracts, that contractors should give comparable pension rights when taking over staff from government departments. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, had suggested that departments should avoid giving such guidance on Tupe. Sir Nicholas has told her that advice previously given by law officers, that pensions were covered by the regulations, was correct. His insistence on the law officers' view follows guidance from Mr William Waldegrave, civil service minister, that occupational pensions were not affected by the regulations, a view echoed by the Department of Health. Some contractors, when told of Sir Nicholas's ruling, reacted with dismay, though others said the definition of 'comparable' might provide some room for less generous benefits. Mr Simon Cox, managing director of ISS Mediclean, which has 80 cleaning contracts with the NHS, said: 'This is the crunch. It is just about possible to cope with the other aspects of Tupe and run a profitable business. But if we have to provide fully-funded, index-linked, pensions, it becomes impossible.' Typically, in the funding of a public service pension the employer and employee between them pay in up to 13 per cent of salary each year compared with less than 10 per cent in a small private sector service company. Some of the contractors pay no pensions at all. A trade union official said the government could face a 'deluge' of retrospective claims from people who had had to accept reduc-tions in pension provision. Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social affairs commissioner, has confirmed that Sir Nicholas's ruling is correct by stating in a letter to Mr Lyndon Harris, the Labour MEP, that the Acquired Rights Directive, on which Tupe is based, does extend protection to occupational pension schemes. Mr Tino Hernandez, head of research at the CPSA public service union said: 'The last avenue through which private contractors might have been able to make savings to enable them to beat in-house bids has effectively been cut off.'</p>

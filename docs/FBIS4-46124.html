			<p>BFN     [Text] In a statement to REUTER today, Husayn al-Musawi, a  Hizballah leader, confirmed the report on the abduction of  al-Haj Mustafa al-Dirani. He said that this Israeli operation  is part of the ongoing fighting between Hizballah and Israel.  Al-Musawi added that Israel wants to use al-Dirani as a  bargaining chip to insure the release of navigator Ron Arad.  But this Israeli attempt will not succeed, he added.</p>

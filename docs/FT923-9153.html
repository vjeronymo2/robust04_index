			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Firmer at long end LONGER-DATED rates in the sterling cash market firmed yesterday as the pound continued to weaken on the foreign exchanges and the market remained jittery about the prospects for European economic union. Although trade in cash was thin, the pound's slide to a low of DM2.8247 in Europe underlined expectations that a cut in UK base rates is a distant prospect. The Bundesbank compounded the gloom by draining more funds from the German money market than had been anticipated. In its weekly intervention, it drained more than DM8bn after only DM1bn to DM3bn had been expected, and German call money rose to a level just below the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. Both six-month and one-year sterling cash firmed  1/16 on the offered side, to 10 7/16 and 10 1/2 per cent respectively. Trade in sterling futures matched the trend in cash as the 1993 'back month' contracts fell heavily. The June 1993 short sterling contract closed 12 basis points down at 90.27 from its opening level. Shorter-dated cash and futures prices were steadier. The Bundesbank calmed the atmosphere by announcing that there would be no press conference after its council meeting today, virtually eliminating the prospect of a Lombard rate rise. The Paris Match opinion poll on the French referendum, which showed a small majority in favour of ratifying the Maastricht treaty, also raised hopes that the much-feared crisis of European Monetary Union will not be taking place for another six weeks at least. Three-month money closed unchanged on the offered side at 10 3/8 per cent, and one-month money was softer at 10 1/8 per cent from a previous close of 10 3/16 . The September short sterling contract was down two basis points from its opening level at 89.59, although this is still a bearish price by recent standards. The Bank of England helped to ease the short dates by forecasting a small shortage of Pounds 400m. It dealt, as usual, at 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and 2. It purchased Pounds 50m of Band 1 treasury bills in the morning before revising the forecast to Pounds 500m. In the afternoon it bought Pounds 86m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 13m of Band 2 bank bills and provided late assistance of Pounds 100m.</p>

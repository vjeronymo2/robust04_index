			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Victoria L. Catlett, Office of Airport Planning and Programming, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW, Washington DC 20591; telephone (202) 267&hyph;3263. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (ANCA) requires an airport proprietor, as a condition of receiving grant funds under the Airport Improvement Program and of collecting and imposing passenger facility charges: (1) To conduct a public review process and cost-benefit analysis of any noise or access restriction affecting Stage 2 aircraft if the restriction was not proposed before October 1, 1990; and (2) to obtain agreement from each affected operator or approval of the Secretary of Transportation for any restriction affecting Stage 3 aircraft not in effect before October 1, 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASE is a commercial service airport which serves Aspen, Colorado. Pitkin County is the proprietor of ASE and operates ASE through the Board of County Commissioners (Board). ASE is now open each day from 7 a.m. to one-half hour after sunset. An exception until 11 p.m. exists for two air carriers (United Express and Continental Express) that maintain private navigation aids at the airport. In its current form, the exception to ASE's nighttime curfew is only available to scheduled carriers operating Stage 3 or exempt aircraft, which arrive or depart before 11 p.m. and who have access to an on-site instrument landing system which is privately owned. The current operating hours of ASE are set out in County Ordinance 90&hyph;12. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the past, Ordinance 89&hyph;3 (October 24, 1989) regulated hours of operation at ASE. It prohibited general aviation aircraft from taking off or landing during the period one-half hour after sunset to 7 a.m. Scheduled air carriers operating Stage 3 or exempt aircraft under Parts 135 or 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and who had access to privately-owned, on-site instrument landing systems were permitted to operate until 11 p.m. Ordinance 89&hyph;3 established a yearly, limited exception to the prohibition on nighttime operations for general aviation aircraft operators. General aviation aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR) were permitted to depart on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays until two and one-half hours past sunset local time during ski season each year. The airport manager was also authorized to grant similar departure exceptions during high-traffic holiday periods such as Christmas Eve, New Year's Day and President's Day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 12, 1990 the Board introduced, first read, and set for public hearing a draft ordinance ``(e) establishing the hours of airside operations at the Aspen-Pitkin County Airport (Sardy Field).'' The draft ordinance would have expanded nighttime access at ASE to all aircraft until 10 p.m. and necessarily provided more liberal access than the ski season exception. The Board proposed this change, in part, in response to concerns voiced by the FAA and general aviation user groups about the potentially discriminatory nature of ASE's hours of operation. The Board did not adopt the June 12, 1990 draft ordinance. At an August 7, 1990 special session and hearing the Board tabled the June 12, 1990 draft ordinance indefinitely. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board introduced, first read, and set for public hearing Ordinance 90&hyph;12 on November 13, 1990. The Board adopted Ordinance 90&hyph;12 on November 27, 1990 which established the current operating hours. It also repealed the ski season exception under Ordinance 89&hyph;3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over approximately a two year period, the FAA attempted to informally resolve the ANCA issues with the County. The FAA repeatedly raised concerns that Ordinance 90&hyph;12 did not appear to be grandfathered either as to operations by Stage 2 or Stage 3 aircraft, nor exempt from requirements under ANCA Sections 9304 (b) and (c). After extensive correspondence and discussion, the FAA determined that the County had not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that repeal of the ski season exception through passage of Ordinance 90&hyph;12 was grandfathered. The FAA determined that informal resolution had not been successful and issued a Notice of Apparent Violation (NOAV) on September 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NOAV advised the County of the FAA's position that the existence, and continued enforcement, of Ordinance 90&hyph;12 was an apparent ANCA violation and that the County's eligibility for airport grant funds and authority to impose and collect passenger facility charges was at issue, absent the County's agreement to rescind or permanently not enforce Ordinance 90&hyph;12. The NOAV indicated that contrary to the County's contentions, the June 12, 1990 draft ordinance did not reference an intent to repeal ASE's ski season exception as an alternative to liberalizing the curfew. The FAA interprets ``proposed'' in the context of ANCA and 14 CFR Part 161 to mean issuance of an official proposal by the government body with authority to adopt the proposal or ordinance. It does not appear that either the language of the June 12, 1990 draft ordinance or the published notice in the Aspen Times indicated that the Board was proposing to repeal the ski season exception as an alternative to liberalizing access to ASE. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The County provided a Response to the FAA's NOAV and made the following key arguments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> (1) When the Board tabled the draft ordinance by Resolution on August 7, 1990, the Board repealed the ski season exception, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

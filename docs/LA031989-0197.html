			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARTS &amp; CULTURE ON THE PACIFIC RIM;  </P> <P> A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> EMERGING ARTISTS;  </P> <P> FOLLOWING ARE PROFILES OF THREE ARTISTS WHO BRING A PACIFIC RIM PERSPECTIVE TO  THEIR ART, PLUS A REPORT ON THE HONG KONG ACADEMY OF PERFORMING ART, WHICH IS  EXPECTED TO TRAIN A NUMBER OF DANCE, DRAMA, MUSIC AND TECHNICAL ARTS STUDENTS.  EMERGING ARTISTS ON THE PACIFIC RIM WILL BE A REGULAR FEATURE OF DAILY AND  SUNDAY CALENDAR.;  </P> <P> A TWO-MAN 'TRIO' FROM DOWN UNDER  </P> <P> Los Trios Ringbarkus, as an escalating number of people who like to explore the  theater netherworld are finding out, is neither a three-ring circus nor a  mariachi band on a budget. They are two Australian comics of the "New  Vaudeville" variety named Neill Gladwin and Stephen Kearney, who love nothing  better than considering the possibilities of what a box of crackers or bread  rolls can bring out in them and in a room of captive patrons.  </P> <P> In another era, they would have been locked up for (at least) disturbing the  peace, or, as goes the title of their show at Theatre/Theater, "Rampant  Stupidity."  </P> <P> But unlike their homeland's ecological heritage, an ark of the world's  strangest animals unable to breed with their Asian neighbors, Gladwin and  Kearney have picked up on a host of international influences: Punk's  audience-assault style. Samuel Beckett's perpetual see-saw between the will to  speak and death. Buster Keaton's physical daring.  </P> <P> "We're the product of the disgusting practices of our progenitors, stuck in  British-run penal colonies," deadpanned Kearney about the first white Aussies.  </P> <P> So it wasn't surprising when Los Trios, who seem capable of anything, picked up  a reporter and photographer at the Hollywood Pep Boys and sped away in an  ancient but spirited white Cadillac to the Shangri-La of Griffith Observatory.  "We want to eat lunch where Arnold ripped out that guy's heart in 'The  Terminator,' " explained the tall, blond Gladwin, smiling to his back-seat  guests.  </P> <P> As Kearney -- shorter with spikey, cropped hair -- lost rubber through the  switchbacks, they explained that Griffith Park is where they like to "deposit"  their mates from Down Under without a map, "so they get a real taste for L.A."  </P> <P> These two have their L.A. tastebuds well conditioned. Although "Rampant  Stupidity" only opened in early January (after a three-performance preview in  December to an utterly unsuspecting public, plus a few critics), Kearney and  Gladwin have actually been peddling their wares in The Industry for nearly two  years.  </P> <P> They didn't quite want to admit that Hollywood had little notion of how to  employ their talents for comic mayhem, but they were bemused at studio  legalisms.  </P> <P> "As we developed material for them," Gladwin recalled, "they started claiming  ownership over our characters. It got to the point that if Stephen had his  sleeve up, then it was ours, not theirs. If my collar was crumpled, it was  theirs, not ours. Scary."  </P> <P> Yes, even these radically inclined, black comedians of the night do auditions  for TV pilots during the day ("Remember your lines, Steve?" "Got your American  accent, Neill?"), though they've been turned down by the Carson show. It all  helps their act, they insist. Gladwin: "Everything in life, everything, is a  performance art piece." Then Kearney adds: "And not a very good one, at that."  </P> <P> Besides, for Gladwin at least, Los Angeles strongly recalls their native  Melbourne: "Nice climate, large suburban houses with big lawns, fantastic Greek  food."  </P> <P> Pals at Rusden State College, they found themselves one day turning a promotion  for a colleague's upcoming performance into a performance itself, "something  like 'Mona Lisa' with accordion and drums," said Kearney.  </P> <P> The act built from routine to routine. In the atmosphere of rowdy, post-modern  Melbourne vaudeville in the late '70s, their performance was much ruder and  more tasteless, they insisted, than what they do now. That's when they were a  trio, with dwarf performer Gareth Walpole. (The name comes from ringbarking a  tree -- stripping the bark at the base -- making it die. "That's essentially  what happens with our act," Gladwin once told an interviewer.) Club dates led  to opening acts for groups such as INXS and Men at Work.  </P> <P> "Gareth would be in a gorilla suit," said Gladwin, "Stephen would play wild  drums. People would laugh just staring at us.  </P> <P> "But now, can you believe that people are coming expecting A Serious Night in  the Theater, and in five minutes, they know they're in trouble?"  </P> <P> "What they often don't get," explained Kearney, "is our deep sense of outrage  at just about everything, and the ways we twist that into something that works  on stage. They want to be entertained in the old ways. It makes it doubly hard  because when you turn pro, you sometimes forget what made something funny  funny. Sometimes, this town only adds to making you forget it."  </P> <P> But then, the strangest things will happen at Theatre/Theater, and Los Trios  will once again be reminded why they are Los Trios. Such as the audience  members who get so immersed in the spirit of "Rampant Stupidity" they're drawn  into the act (take the bit where they untie and toss around an innocent man's  shoe), become part of the show and even hold it hostage (by taking one of  Kearney's shoes).  </P> <P> "Wonderful," Kearney smirks, "they're as outraged as we are."  </P> <P> This special report was edited by David Kishiyama, an assistant Calendar editor  </P></p>

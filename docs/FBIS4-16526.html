			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow 15 April -- While Russian and Ukrainian  leaders discuss the future of the Black Sea Fleet in Moscow, the  Ukrainian Defence Ministry is on the offensive and is not  daunted even by the use of force in its efforts to take over  parts of the Black Sea Fleet. In doing so, Kiev is violating  all the existing Russian-Ukrainian agreements on the fleet, the  fleet's press centre told ITAR-TASS on Friday.    Today, a group of eight military personnel from the  Ukrainian  Navy, having gained the support of the Ukrainian presidential  representative in Izmail, arrived at a brigade of river cutters.  The Ukrainians were led by head of the western maritime defence  region of the Ukrainian naval forces, Captain Dmitriy Ukrainets,  according to the press centre.    The Ukrainians met with the command of the river unit and  handed them the directive issued by the Ukrainian Defence  Ministry on 10 April, which says the Black Sea Fleet unit is  being disbanded, and the third naval defence brigade of the  Ukrainian Navy is to be created on its base. The unit was given  a new commander, Captain Yaroslav Fyodorshin.    The Ukrainian personnel appealed to the brigade's command to  avoid the use of armed force. They promised to increase the pay  of seamen who swear allegiance to Ukraine. The Ukrainians  announced that those who wanted to serve in the Russian Navy  would be allowed to go to Russia.    The personnel of the river cutter unit were especially  warned  to preserve the brigade's military equipment and property, which  the Ukrainian Navy representatives claim belongs to Ukraine.    Meanwhile, in Moscow, Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev  told journalists on Friday that Russia has been providing all  the money for the Black Sea Fleet since September 1993, which  means that "the fleet is Russian even as concerns financing".  There can be no talk about leasing parts of the fleet to  Ukraine, the minister declared. Especially since, under current  conditions, Ukraine's security in the Black Sea is being  maintained at Russian expense. The Russian and Ukrainian  delegations to the CIS summit meeting in Moscow are currently  working on specific solutions to that problem.</p>

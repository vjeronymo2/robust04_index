			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / MPs question PIA's standing MPs on the cross-party Treasury committee yesterday expressed doubts that the new investor protection watchdog would inspire public confidence. Taking evidence from Lautro, the existing regulator for the life insurance industry, MPs highlighted the role of Mr Joe Palmer, chairman of the new personal investment authority. Mr Brian Sedgemore, a Labour committee member, asked whether Mr Palmer should be seen in the category of people of the highest quality on whom the regulatory system depended. Legal &amp; General, the life insurance company where Mr Palmer was formerly chief executive, recently attracted a record fine from Lautro for a widespread and systemic failure to meet regulators' requirements. Mr Barry Sherlock, Lautro chairman, said that the important issue was the way in which a company dealt with weaknesses that had been identified. He said: 'As a result of the work we have done over the last five years, no single company has a totally clear record.' He admitted but sought to minimise the risk that the PIA might find it difficult to establish public confidence, emphasising instead the progress made in setting up the PIA since Mr Palmer had been appointed. Mr Giles Radice, another Labour committee member, suggested that the PIA might find taking on staff from existing regulators a barrier to creating confidence. Mr Sherlock said existing staff were skilled and experienced. Without them the PIA would be 'a disaster'. Asked why it took so long to agree on disclosure of the commission on life insurance products, Mr Sherlock cited the need to work with the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog.</p>

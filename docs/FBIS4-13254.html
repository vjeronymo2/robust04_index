			<p>BFN     [Text] Army has foiled yet another bid by Pakistani  infiltrators to smuggle in a large quantity of arms and  ammunition through the northern sector into the Kashmir state.  A Defense Ministry spokesman told newsmen in Srinagar that this  is the biggest cache of arms recovered so far this year. It  includes 32,000 rounds of ammunition, 92 hand grenades, 203  antipersonnel mines and a large quantity of incriminating  documents. A massive hunt has been launched to trace the arms  couriers.

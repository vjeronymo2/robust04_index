			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Lloyd's agrees on computer PARTICIPANTS ON the London insurance market yesterday announced agreement on a new system based on electronic communication and designed to harmonise the way brokers place risks with syndicates at Lloyd's and insurance companies. Live use of the system is expected to begin in April 1992. It should help to improve the efficiency of the market and to reduce costs at a time when profitability is under pressure as a result of intense rate competition. The London Insurance Market Network (Limnet) already provides a common framework for communication between brokers and underwriters on the London market. The new system was agreed by the London network management committee. It brings together insurers from the Lloyd's market, the Institute of London Underwriters, the London Insurance and Reinsurance Market Association and the London Insurance Brokers' Committee. The objective is to allow brokers to place electronically policies currently written on a subscription basis with underwriters. Such risks are offered to a number of Lloyd's syndicates and companies outside the Lloyd's market, each of whom subscribe to part of it an agreed premium rate. Face-to-face negotiation of terms, conditions and price will remain a feature of dealing in bigger and more complex risks.</p>

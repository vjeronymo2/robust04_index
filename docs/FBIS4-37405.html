			<p>BFN     [Text] Rescheduling Algeria's foreign debts will relieve  the burden on the oil and gas sectors, particularly as Algeria  has a plan under implementation. This is what Amar Mekhloufi,  minister of industry and energy said in an interview with the  London-based AL-HAYAT newspaper.    The minister announced that this plan would be carried out  in  the next five years and was estimated to cost about $17 billion,  50 percent of which would be in foreign currency.    The minister added that the plan would have good production  and export results and would enable Algeria to repay its debts  in the future.</p>

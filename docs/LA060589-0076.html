			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Sears Boycott Threatened: The American Postal Workers Union has demanded that  Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. remove mini-post offices set up in 11 of its stores  and threatened to boycott the retailer if it ignored the request. "We view this  as a menace to postal jobs, postal workers and the general public," union  President Moe Biller said. A Sears spokeswoman said the Chicago-based retailer  planned to continue the one-year pilot program at least through October. She  said she was unaware of plans to expand the program. Biller said he was told by  Postal Service officials that as many as 100 Sears stores may soon have the  counters.  </P></p>

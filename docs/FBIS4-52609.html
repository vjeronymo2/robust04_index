			<p>BFN     [Text] Three thousand winning candidates in the recently  concluded village elections have already been proclaimed by the  Comelec [Commission on Elections]. These were registered by the  Comelec as part of the first batch of winning candidates. They  represent more than 300 of the 41,000 villages in the whole  archipelago where elections were held. The proclaimed  candidates include those from the southern Philippines, the  Visayan islands, and the National Capital Region [Metro Manila].  On the other hand, the Comelec is suspending the proclamation  of 66 candidates due to election code violations.</p>

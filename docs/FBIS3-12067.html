Zedillo Ponce de Leon was born in  Mexico City on 27 December 1951. He is the son of Rodolfo  Zedillo Castillo and Martha Alicia Ponce de Leon. He is the  second of six brothers, after Luis. Following him came  Guadalupe, Lorena, Veronica, and Rodolfo. He is married to  Nilda Patricia Velasco Nunez and is the father of five children:  Ernesto, Emiliano, Carlos, Nilda Patricia, and Rodrigo.    Zedillo holds a B.S. degree from the National Politechnical  Institute's Higher School of Economy, where he studied from  1969-72. He also studied economics at the University of  Colorado in 1974. He received a master's degree and a doctoral  degree in economics from Yale University, which he attended from  1974-78. His doctoral thesis was entitled: "External Public  Indebtedness in Mexico: Recent History and Future Oil Bounded  Optical Growth." [thesis title as received in English]    He worked as an economic researcher in the Secretariat of  the  Presidency's National Directorate for Economic and Social  Programming from 1971-74, as an economist with the Bank of  Mexico from 1978-82, and as deputy manager for economic and  financial research in the same bank in 1982. He was secretary  for programming and budget from 1988-92. In 1992, he was named  secretary for public education, a post from which he resigned on  29 November 1993 in order to join the campaign of the now  deceased PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio.    He was a professor at the Colegio de Mexico from 1981-83. He  distinguished himself with his economic studies, which in turn  led to his appointment as secretary for programming and budget.  He outlined the National Development Plan, which has led to  important political, economic, and social changes during the  government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. With the  motto "Planning Is Prevention," Zedillo outlined the government  strategies established since 1988 to date and within whose  framework the government drafted programs to lower inflation by  reducing spending, resuming growth, and attaining steady  progress in the economic recovery.    As the person responsible for the proposals dealing with  1989, 1990, and 1991 disbursements, he appeared before the  Chamber of Deputies and corresponding commissions on several  occasions, where he mounted an imprtant defense of the budgets  and the National Solidarity Program. Zedillo also participated  in laying the groundwork for the national agreements on the  country's modernization, which led to an increase in several  special allocations for agriculture and education.    While he was secretary for programming and budget, Zedillo  pursued dialogue, negotiation, and harmony with all governors,  including those in opposition. Later, when he was secretary for  public education, he subscribed to the thesis that "the higher  the education, the greater the wealth," which held that the  country's modernization was not just "fashionable" but an  essential requirement in raising the country to the level of  advanced countries with an eye on the 21st Century. In this  context, he negotiated and secured approval for changes to  Article 3 of the Constitution. He had the Congress approve a  new General Education Law as an essential measure in meeting the  challenge of the country's education with the new millenium in  mind. Progress made in education during Zedillo's tenure  crystallized in a national plan for the modernization of basic  education, reform providing for free textbooks, and the reform  of teachers' career tracks.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Body to probe Bar complaints urged A complaints bureau to investigate allegations of un-satisfactory work by barristers which could order compensation payments to clients of up to Pounds 2,000 should be established, the Bar Standards Review Body recommended yesterday. The recommendation was one of a number made by the review body, set up by the Bar Council after last year's royal commission on criminal justice drew attention to the poor performance of some barristers. The complaints bureau, the review body suggests, should be run by a non-barrister. It should have the power to demand apologies, order compensation and refer cases to the Bar disciplinary tribunal. If the Bar agrees to the establishment of such a bureau it could be in operation by the start of 1996. It would cost about Pounds 167,000 a year to run, said Lord Alexander of Weedon QC, chairman of the review body. Other recommendations of the review body include pre-trial conferences to improve early preparation of cases and publication by barristers' chambers of their working procedures and fees.</p>

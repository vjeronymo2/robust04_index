			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Peres says Palestinians must limit demands MR Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, yesterday criticised the Palestinian approach to Middle East peace talks, saying there would be no progress unless they accepted limits to the scope of self-government in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Speaking shortly before the two sides opened their second week of negotiations in Washington, Mr Peres said the Palestinians were seeking sovereign powers while the agreed structure of the talks envisaged only limited Palestinian self-rule during an interim stage. 'They have to come to terms with reality,' Mr Peres said. 'We are not talking about independence. We are talking about self-government in the territories for five years. This should be a sort of trial period which will enable all of us. . .time to reach a permanent solution. The attempt to make out of an interim self-government proposal a permanent solution is in vain,' he told the Financial Times. He added that the self-government proposals tabled by Israel last week - and immediately attacked as inadequate by the Palestine Liberation Organisation  -represented 'more of a risk' for Israel than for the Palestinians. After yesterday's round of negotiations in Washington, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, said that there were two sets of incompatible proposals on the table. 'In a sense there is a deadlock and we are trying to find a way out of it,' she said. She added that the Israeli negotiating team had been told that its proposals for self-government were not acceptable. However Mr Yossi Gal, the Israeli spokesman, would only admit to 'a certain frustration' and said that he did not want to characterise the situation as 'deadlocked'. The foreign minister, one of the most 'dovish' members of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's government, was echoing frustration among ministers that their peace overtures since taking office in July, such as curbing Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, have elicited little response from the Arab side. Yesterday, Israeli authorities began releasing 600 of the thousands of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel as part of a number of goodwill gestures announced to coincide with the Washington talks. The army also opened up some of the thousands of streets in West Bank and Gazan towns previously sealed in retaliation against the Palestinian intifada, or uprising. Palestinians complained that the Israeli proposals contained nothing about a withdrawal of Israeli troops and offered no real control over their own land during the interim stage. They want to elect a governing authority with full legislative powers. Israel has conceded elections for a council covering the West Bank and Gaza, but wants to limit its size and restrict its powers to that of a local authority.</p>

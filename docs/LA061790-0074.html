			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNWELCOME WAGON;  </P> <P> TRAVELERS UNEASY WITH UNOFFICIAL GREETERS AT L.A. BUS DEPOT  </P> <P> That wasn't exactly a red carpet that was rolled out for visitor Opal Cronk  when she set foot in Los Angeles the other day.  </P> <P> It was a human tide of street people that surged toward the frightened Morro  Bay grandmother after she stepped from the bus and claimed her luggage at the  downtown Greyhound station.  </P> <P> Sidewalks outside the bus terminal were crowded with a ragtag collection of men  hustling drugs, begging for spare change and soliciting "jobs," like carrying  new arrivals' bags.  </P> <P> Cronk took one look and retreated into the station to wait for a ride.  </P> <P> "If I hadn't come for my grandson's high school graduation in Fountain Valley,  I'd turn around and go back home," she shuddered. "This is real scary. We don't  have all of this around where I live."  </P> <P> Welcome to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Most cities do not greet visitors by giving them the bum's rush. But that's  what the 350,000 travelers who will pass through Los Angeles' main bus station  this summer can anticipate.  </P> <P> The 23-year-old terminal is located near the center of the city's Skid Row,  where growing numbers of homeless and derelicts congregate around soup  kitchens, flophouses and voucher hotels.  </P> <P> Although bus stations throughout urban America generally are located in less  than upscale neighborhoods, officials say conditions around the Los Angeles  terminal are more intense than elsewhere. Most tourists coming to Los Angeles  avoid the experience by arriving in their cars or at airports.  </P> <P> The deteriorating neighborhood around the bus station is sending Greyhound  executives scrambling to find a safer place in the metropolitan area to  relocate their bus depot.  </P> <P> "It's darn scary here, no question about it," said Robert Bonds, Greyhound's  Los Angeles terminal manager.  </P> <P> "I walked outside once at 7 o'clock at night. I won't do it again. My advice to  passengers is, if you go outside those front doors, be real careful. My concern  is passengers' safety."  </P> <P> The situation prompted a handful of street people two months ago to launch a  self-styled cleanup campaign outside the terminal.  </P> <P> The transients' do-it-yourself crackdown on loitering and panhandling at the  terminal is being led by Jerry Lafayette, who describes himself as a homeless  ex-drug addict. He says his concern is financial.  </P> <P> There is money to be made by helping bus passengers carry their bags and hail  taxis, Lafayette said. As much as $150 a day can be earned in tips from  travelers and taxi and shuttle operators.  </P> <P> But those who pounce on travelers spoil it for everybody, he said.  </P> <P> "If 10 guys run to a cab when it pulls up out here to wash windows and grab  bags, you scare everybody, even the driver," said Lafayette, a 37-year-old  former courier service employee.  </P> <P> He said he is trying to chase away drug addicts who hang around the depot and  pester travelers for cash to spend on rock cocaine from Skid Row dealers. He is  urging those who want to work outside the bus station to wear clean clothes and  to take turns approaching travelers.  </P> <P> Results have been mixed. Lafayette said he has recruited six former addicts to  work in such a semi-organized manner. But dozens of other homeless men ignore  the blunt-spoken Lafayette's harangues and continue to loiter at the depot  entrance.  </P> <P> Two visitors from Sonora, Mexico, Elizabeth Siller and Maria Gonzales, seemed  dazed by the scene as strangers moved in on them from all sides near the bus  station doorway last week.  </P> <P> Several offered to help the women with their luggage. One persistently tried to  persuade them to take an unlicensed "bandit van" to their destination. Another  peddled phony gold jewelry, waving a necklace in their faces.  </P> <P> "Your first impression of L.A. when you get off the bus here is, 'Oh my God --  what have I come to?' " said Harold Patton, 39, who said he is a recovering  cocaine addict who has joined in the self-policing effort.  </P> <P> The bus terminal's rough neighborhood works to the hustlers' advantage,  Lafayette admitted. But sometimes it is hard to distinguish the self-appointed  crew trying to police the depot from the street hustlers who are frightening  visitors.  </P> <P> Turning toward travelers leaving the station, Lafayette shouted: "Welcome to  L.A! You are in the heart of Skid Row! You go one block this way or one block  that way, anything can happen! I will be your personal security! I will escort  you safely to your car!"  </P> <P> Such an exhortation "borders on extortion" in the view of Los Angeles Police  Capt. Jerry W. Conner, commander of the city's Central Area police division.  Conner's office is in a bunker-like, brick police station located a few hundred  yards from the entrance to the bus terminal.  </P> <P> Conner acknowledged that visitors "are totally vulnerable" when they step from  the Greyhound depot. Although specific figures are unavailable, incidents of  theft, assault and robbery in the area are common, he said.  </P> <P> "The bus station is the port of entry for a lot of people, and for them to be  confronted by what you see out there just drives me up the wall," Conner said.  </P> <P> "It embarrasses me because you're right across the street from the Police  Department."  </P> <P> Police are prevented from clearing the bus station sidewalk because Greyhound  does not own the walkway area next to the terminal, Conner said. Greyhound  built the two-story depot in 1967, but sold the building four years ago to an  investment firm.  </P> <P> The bus company leases the second floor as a passenger lounge and ticketing and  boarding area. The first floor is rented as a mini-mall to shopkeepers who sell  souvenirs and other tourist items.  </P> <P> Off-duty policemen hired as security guards by Greyhound are posted at two  places on the second floor to keep street people out of passenger areas. But  access to the first-floor mall -- used by all passengers -- is not restricted.  </P> <P> When police patrol the public sidewalk outside the terminal, transients and  beggars simply step back a few feet onto private property, Conner said.  </P> <P> Greyhound officials say they are ready to pack up their buses and move.  </P> <P> "I spent today looking around for any place that has the space we need," Enzo  Orlando, the company's area general manager, said last week.  </P> <P> Orlando said Greyhound needs at least an acre for a new terminal. He said he  would prefer to stay close to the downtown area because of its central  location.  </P> <P> "My druthers would be to cozy up to the Amtrak facilities over by Union  Station," he said. "With Metro Rail coming in, that will be a transportation  center. We're talking with them about it."  </P> <P> The strike by union bus drivers, which began March 2, has had little effect on  the street scene outside the terminal. But bus riders all over the country are  talking with Greyhound about the problems at the Los Angeles depot.  </P> <P> Terminal manager Bonds said he often heard from worried passengers in Eugene,  Ore., where he was assigned until March 6.  </P> <P> "They'd say, 'If you have to route me through L.A., I won't go.' "  </P></p>

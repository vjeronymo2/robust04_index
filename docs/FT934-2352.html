			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts lifted by producer prices and rate cut hopes UK government bonds continued their inexorable rise yesterday, helped by the release of favourable economic data and the expectation that inflation will stay low, possibly paving the way for a further cut in the base rate. The biggest gains were seen in the index-linked sector, where long-dated issues rose over a point. Dealers said the sharp rise reflected the fact that the index-linked sector had underperformed the rest of the market recently and was simply 'catching up', encouraged by the release of some strong buy recommendations from a couple of gilt-edged specialists. Among conventional stocks, the longer-dated issues performed well, with gains of over half a point on the day, spurred on by the producer price data. Producer output prices were unchanged in November compared with October, while the annual rate fell to 3.6 per cent from 4 per cent. Input prices showed a monthly increase of 1.2 per cent, but the yearly rate declined by 1.8 per cent. While the figures provided cheer for the gilts market by suggesting that inflationary pressures remain subdued, dealers said the key focus of the market is the release tomorrow of the Retail Price Index. Market participants expect underlying inflation to be unchanged or slightly lower for November. Gatt and the Bundesbank provided the two main talking points in the European government bond markets. Most market participants are optimistic about the prospects of an agreement on Gatt by the December 15 deadline. In addition, there is plenty of speculation that the Bundesbank may cut its official interest rates at Thursday's council meeting. German government bond futures reached a new high on reasonably good volume, with dealers saying the market was buoyed by hopes of a cut in the discount and Lombard interest rates this Thursday. Even though the repo rate was fixed at 6.00 per cent until January 5, some dealers said there was a chance of a 25 - 50 basis point cut in headline rates at this week's council meeting. In addition, the market will be closely watching the Bundesbank's M3 target announcement. The bund futures contract, which opened at 100.76, hit a new all-time high of 100.95 before slipping back to 100.86 by late afternoon. Among the high-yielding European markets, Italy ended nearly half a point higher, helped by a more settled political background, expectations that the 1994 budget will be approved, and hopes of a possible cut in official interest rates before Christmas. However, some dealers said that the thin, pre-holiday volume meant that the market's move was somewhat exaggerated. Spanish government bonds closed lower, mainly on domestic selling. Japanese government bonds ended firmer in the cash market as market participants shrugged off last Friday's news of 0.5 per cent growth in third-quarter GDP and chose instead to focus on the gloomy quarterly Tankan survey from the Bank of Japan. The yield on the benchmark No 157 JGB opened at 3.125 per cent and ended at 3.12 per cent, having traded at 3.1 per cent (corresponding to the lowest benchmark yield in over six years). The market had expected the third-quarter GDP figures to show a decline rather than a rise. However, dealers said that the market paid more attention to the Tankan report, which helped support speculation that the Bank of Japan may lower interest rates in order to stimulate the economy. Longer-dated US Treasury bonds posted moderate losses amid a mixed reading on commodity prices, but notes with shorter maturities were unchanged in light activity. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 lower at 100 5/16 with the yield climbing by about 3 basis points to 6.233 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/32 , yielding 4.216 per cent. After falling late on Friday despite a tame report on November consumer prices, the inflation-sensitive long bond showed further weakness in the face of a sharp rise in Comex gold prices and an early increase in the closely watched Commodity Research Bureau index. The 30-year issue remained anchored in negative territory throughout the session, even though Nymex January crude oil futures - down 46 cents a barrel - offered a more positive picture. The 21-commodity CRB index later reversed direction to show a 0.76 decline to 224.43 late in the day, but the long bond failed to bounce back. Most traders were keeping to the sidelines, as the market looked ahead to November retail sales data, which are due out today. Forecasts centre on a 0.4 per cent increase, after a 1.5 per cent jump the previous month.</p>

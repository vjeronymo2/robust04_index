			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin said here today that China is very much concerned about  the latest development of the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    He made these remarks in an interview here this morning with  Hatsuhisa Takashima, chief commentator of the Japan Broadcasting  Corporation [NHK].    Jiang said: "It is China's consistent stand that it needs  enough patience to find a solution to such a complicated issue  on the Korean peninsula.    "We should keep calm at a time when it is more difficult and  urge all parties concerned to exercise restraint and act with  caution," he said.    Jiang said the goal for the settlement of the issue is  finally to safeguard peace and stability on the Korean peninsula  and realize denuclearization.    No matter what temporary difficulties may appear, he said,  it  is possible to find a proper solution to this problem as long as  these two major objectives are not departed from.    Jiang said it is imperative to see that the door for  negotiation is not completely closed, adding that there still  exist possibilities of holding dialogue.    He urged all parties concerned to take positive measures so  as to avoid acceleration of the crisis and not to make all  parties' efforts wasted.    Jiang said China is not in favor of imposing sanctions  because that is useless for the settlement of the problem. On  the contrary, he added, it would aggravate the escalation of the  situation and lead to a serious consequence that all parties  concerned do not want to see.    He said: "It is my view that persevering in dialogue and  consultations is an effective and fundamental way to solve the  problem."    During the more than one-hour interview, Jiang also answered  questions on a series of other major international issues raised  by Takashima.    On Sino-U.S. relations, Jiang said that U.S. President Bill  Clinton's recent delink of China's most favoured nation status  with the human rights issue was beneficial to strengthening and  expanding bilateral economic cooperation and trade.    It conforms to the fundamental interests of the two  countries  and the two peoples, he said.    Jiang said as long as the two sides look towards the future  and the whole world, proceed from their fundamental interests,  abide by the principles defined by the three Sino-U.S. joint  communiques to increase mutual trust, reduce troubles, develop  cooperation and not to practise confrontation, the Sino-U.S.  relationship will grow smoothly and healthily.</p>

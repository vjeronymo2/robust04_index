			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Turkish government to rescue Denizcilik Bank DENIZCILIK Bank, Turkey's maritime bank, has become the second bank this year to be rescued by the government. Denizcilik's operations are being taken over by the state-owned Emlak Bank. Emlak will take over Denizcilik's balance sheet, its 41 branches as well as more than 1,000 bank personnel. The bank had assets of TL2,314bn (Dollars 279m) at the end of 1991. It suffered a loss on operations of TL88bn, compared to a loss of TL483bn in 1991. Denizcilik was earmarked for privatisation. However, like Tobank, taken over by state-owned HalkBank, the government did not find a buyer.</p>

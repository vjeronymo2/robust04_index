			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REHNQUIST COURT RESTRICTING CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS  </P> <P> With Wednesday's ruling that government has no constitutional obligation to  shield citizens from danger, the Supreme Court under Chief Justice William H.  Rehnquist added yet another flourish to its strict view of the protections  afforded by the Constitution.  </P> <P> In matters ranging from education in rural areas to utility rate regulation and  collecting evidence at crime scenes, the Rehnquist court has taken the same  view -- that the Constitution imposes no "affirmative obligation" on government  to provide services to citizens or to protect them from harm.  </P> <P> Rehnquist maintains that the Constitution was intended to prohibit government  agents from interfering with citizens' rights by such actions as banning books  or breaking down doors without search warrants. Its intent, he said, is to  "protect the people from the state, not to ensure that the state protected them  from each other."  </P> <P> Since the departure of moderate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. last year,  Rehnquist has been in firm control of the high court.  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan, when he elevated Rehnquist to chief justice in  1986, cited his "judicial restraint." And, since his appointment to the high  court in 1971, he has lived up to President Richard M. Nixon's description of  him as a "strict constructionist."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Controls Key Cases  </P> <P> But, until Powell was replaced last February by Reagan-appointee Anthony M.  Kennedy, Rehnquist could not count on obtaining a five-vote majority. Since  then, Rehnquist's control in key cases has been unchallenged.  </P> <P> The high court has not moved quickly to overturn liberal rulings by past courts  -- although it may overturn several in pending cases -- but Rehnquist has used  his position to send a message to lower courts on how the Constitution should  be read.  </P> <P> Take, for example, the ambiguous phrase in both the 5th and 14th Amendments  saying that the government may not "deprive any person of life, liberty or  property, without due process of law." Much of 20th-Century constitutional law  has turned on those words.  </P> <P> In the 1930s, a conservative Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional many  of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs, such as the  establishment of a minimum wage, on the grounds that "due process" gave a  person the right to make contracts without government interference.  </P> <P> In the 1960s, the court under liberal Chief Justice Earl Warren relied on the  "due process" clause in ruling that police officers may not use evidence of  criminality at trial if they have violated a suspect's rights in obtaining that  evidence.  </P> <P> In 1973, the Supreme Court relied on the same clause to give women the right to  abortions, on the grounds that "liberty" encompasses an implied right to  privacy. That ruling, still under attack by anti-abortionists and the Bush  Administration, will be reconsidered by the high court in April.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clause Seen as Limited  </P> <P> But Rehnquist has made his position clear. He believes that the due process  clause is quite limited in its meaning. The question before the court in  Wednesday's ruling was whether a Wisconsin social worker had violated the  "liberty" of a child when she failed to intervene to protect him from an  abusive father.  </P> <P> Many state judges, and a few federal judges, have concluded that, when public  employees -- whether policemen, school officials or ambulance drivers -- are  grossly negligent, they may be sued for violating the rights of a citizen.  </P> <P> Rehnquist disagrees. "Nothing in the language of the due process clause itself  requires the state to protect the life, liberty and property of its citizens  against invasion," he wrote. "The clause is phrased as a limitation on the  state's power to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety  and security. Its language cannot fairly be extended to impose an affirmative  obligation on the state.  </P> <P> "The 14th Amendment was intended to prevent government from abusing its power  or employing it as an instrument of oppression," Rehnquist continued. "Its  purpose was to protect the people from the state, not to ensure that the state  protected them from each other. The framers were content to leave the extent of  government obligation in the latter area to the democratic political  processes."  </P> <P> The rule set down by Rehnquist was sweeping, as illustrated by an exchange  during the court's argument in the Wisconsin child abuse case. If a policeman  saw a person being assaulted on the street and walked on by, could he be sued  for violating the victim's rights under the Constitution? No, replied an  attorney representing the state, a view that the high court opinion  subsequently endorsed.  </P> <P> If states want to permit damage suits against their employees or agencies, they  may do so, Rehnquist said. If local agencies want to employ more child care  workers or set more demanding standards on them, they may do so. "But they  should not have (these obligations) thrust upon them by this court's expansion  of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment," he concluded.  </P> <P> His opinion, supported by five other justices, will force lower court judges to  throw out dozens of suits in which citizens are seeking damages from government  agencies.  </P> <P> In November, Rehnquist wrote a blunt opinion rejecting the view of an Arizona  court that a rape suspect was denied due process of law when police lost  evidence from the crime scene that might have exonerated him.  </P> <P> "The police do not have a constitutional duty to perform any particular tests"  at a crime scene, the chief justice wrote for the five-member majority. "We  therefore hold that . . . failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does  not constitute a denial of due process of law."  </P> <P> Last month, a Pennsylvania utility company contended that its constitutional  rights had been violated because it did not receive a large enough rate  increase to pay for an abandoned nuclear plant. Again, taking a hands-off  approach, Rehnquist disagreed. "The Constitution is not designed to arbitrate  these economic niceties," he said, sending the case back to the state  regulatory body.  </P> <P> In June, the court, with Rehnquist in the majority, turned down a plea from a  low-income mother in rural North Dakota who argued that a required fee to bus  her children to school was unconstitutional. The state law setting the fees  "interferes with no fundamental right," wrote Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,  because education is a matter for the states and is not guaranteed by the  Constitution.  </P> <P> By contrast, justices who often subscribe to liberal views -- William J.  Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and, sometimes, John Paul  Stevens -- have a profoundly different view of the Constitution.  </P> <P> They say that free public education is a fundamental right in today's society,  that the due process clause requires "fundamental fairness" in criminal trials  and that citizens have a right to sue government officials who are charged with  protecting them and do not.  </P> <P> But, in the last year, their views have been expressed only in impassioned  dissenting opinions.  </P></p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / W Midland engineers see orders decline The flow of orders to the west Midlands engineering industry from both home and overseas has slowed down in the past three months and a declining proportion of companies expect order books to grow in the next three months. The latest survey of business trends, conducted by the Engineering Employers Federation West Midlands just before the Budget and covering 494 companies, demonstrates the shallowness of economic recovery and offers an antidote to optimism. Recent regional surveys had suggested that the west Midlands, with its dependence on manufacturing, would be one of the regions to emerge from recession most quickly. Engineering employers reported yesterday that the proportion of companies experiencing an increase in domestic orders fell to 37 per cent in November from 46 per cent in May. Those experiencing a rise in export orders fell to 22 per cent from 27 per cent. Twenty one per cent of companies expect a fall in capacity utilisation over the next three months.</p>

The Bosnian Serb  leadership must honor the commitments that it made to Russia,  end the attacks and withdraw from the city of Gorazde, which has  been declared a "safe area" by the United Nations, ensure the  conditions for the entry of UN forces there, and end the  blockade of UN personnel in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "The world community is called upon to adopt resolute  measures to achieve a political solution to the Bosnian crisis.    "In this connection I confirm the proposal to hold a summit  meeting between Russia, the United States, and the European  Union with the participation of the United Nations.    "Of course, such a meeting must be thoroughly prepared. The  corresponding instructions have been given to the Russian  Federation Foreign Ministry."    [Dated] The Kremlin, Moscow, 19 April 1994.</p>

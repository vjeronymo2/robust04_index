			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Climbdown on trust tax THE MAIN changes to the tax treatment of UK resident trusts suggested by Mr Norman Lamont in his first Budget two years ago have been abandoned, Mr Stephen Dorrell, the Treasury financial secretary, said yesterday. The proposals, published in a consultation paper in March 1991, were intended to bring the taxation of trusts more into line with the tax treatment of individuals, reflecting the cut in the top rate of income tax to 40 per cent and the changes to capital gains tax made in the 1988 Budget. The central element of the plans envisaged that the income tax and capital gains tax treatment of trusts would be integrated, so that trustees' income and chargeable gains were added together and taxed at the basic rate up to a threshold, and then at the higher rate. Announcing the climbdown, Mr Dorrell said that many of those who had responded had been concerned that treating capital gains as the top slice of income would adversely affect beneficiaries entitled to trust capital, because gains, more than income, would tend to be charged at the higher rate. He added that ministers were still considering some of the more detailed proposals in the document, intended to streamline and simplify the tax treatment of trusts. The announcement sought to play down the decision not to implement the main plans, by emphasising it had been a matter for consultation. But the paper only resulted after careful consideration within the Treasury, in a review by Mr Lamont when he was financial secretary.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: 'We're after the bits that make a profit' / A look at a coal company seeking high returns from rock-bottom costs THE weed-covered railway line which winds its way up the Neath Valley in South Wales will shortly be clanking with wagons again. Ryan Group, the privately-owned coal company, is restoring the track with a Pounds 4m grant from the Welsh Office so it can haul coal from its Lyn and Pentreclwydau mines. Ryan expects that when fully developed the two sites will be the largest private underground mines in the UK, producing 600,000 tonnes to 700,000 tonnes of anthracite a year between them. As the UK coal industry shakes itself out with the imminent privatisation of British Coal, Mr Crispian Hotson, Ryan's South African-born chief executive, says: 'We're not after the massive tonnages. We're after the bits that make a profit.' Ryan was originally a publicly quoted company which grew by recovering coal dumped by collieries in the River Usk. But by the mid 1980s it was loss-making and deeply in debt. Mr Hotson and his business partners injected capital and took over management control, eventually buying the company in 1988. Last year Ryan refinanced itself with Pounds 50m of equity from Electra, the venture capital group, Bankers Trust and Creditanstalt Bankverein of Austria, enabling it to reduce its large bank debts and get its balance sheet in order. Mr Hotson expects to see annual losses of more than Pounds 4m transformed into a profit of Pounds 7m this year. Following a radical restructuring which involved sales and closures, Ryan now has three divisions. The largest is opencast mining, where its subsidiary, Crouch Mining, produces 4m tonnes a year under contract for British Coal. It also has a subsidiary in Pennsylvania which mines coal for local utilities. The underground mining division is responsible for the Neath Valley operations, and the third division is engaged in coal recovery in Belgium and Poland. Mr Hotson's vision of the future is based on a competitive coal industry operating at a fraction of the costs of British Coal. With present trends, Mr Hotson sees the UK coal industry shrinking to about 40m tonnes a year (from 76m last year) by the year 2000. About half of that would come from opencast operations, 16m from British Coal pits, and 4m from privately-owned underground mines. Mr Hotson thinks output from the underground mines could be raised to 30m to 40m tonnes if the private sector were given free rein to drive down costs and introduce efficient working practices. In that case the UK could not only wipe out imports, but might even export coal again. Ryan expects to be among the bidders for licences from British Coal to operate mines which the state-owned company cannot afford to keep open. None of those currently on offer is of interest, but Mr Hotson says Ryan might bid for Betws, the small south Wales anthracite mine, and 'one or two pits in Nottinghamshire'. He is looking for mines with 20 to 30 years of reserves, where Ryan can use new techniques to get production costs below Pounds 1 a gigajoule, compared with the Pounds 1.53 at which British Coal is supplying the generators. Ryan is producing coal from open-cast mines for 60p a gigajoule. At these lower prices, Mr Hotson says, domestically produced coal will not only drive out imports but also compete strongly with alternative fuels, particularly natural gas which poses the greatest threat to coal. He believes that cheap coal could trigger the construction of a new generation of coal-fired power stations using efficient clean coal technology. Instead of the familiar giants, these would be small stations with a capacity of as little at 200MW each. Ryan might get into the electricity generation business itself if it can find suitable partners. The recent flotation of another privately-owned coal mining group, RJB Mining, has raised speculation that Ryan might try the same. But Ryan has yet to build up its profit record. Also, Mr Hotson would rather bide his time. The muted welcome given to RJB by the stock market suggested that the outlook for private mining is still too clouded to fire investors' enthusiasm.</p>

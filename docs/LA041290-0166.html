			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> GIANT-KILLER MONTCLAIR PREP SLAYS AGOURA FOR TITLE, 6-1  </P> <P> Walt Steele's fears that his top-ranked Montclair Prep team would be short on  pitching and emotion were erased Wednesday by one swing from Keyaan Cook and a  strong pitching performance from Scott Saklad.  </P> <P> Cook hit a grand slam and Saklad allowed only four hits as the Mounties  defeated Agoura, 6-1, in the championship game of the Thousand Oaks tournament.  Montclair Prep (15-2), the No. 1-ranked team in the Southern Section 1-A  Division but the smallest school in the tournament, was coming off a 7-6 upset  of previously unbeaten El Camino Real on Tuesday.  </P> <P> "We talked about an emotional letdown," said Steele, Montclair Prep's coach.  "It was a big win, but we wanted to keep a consistent tempo."  </P> <P> That was cured when Cook, a 5-foot-10, 215-pound senior shortstop, gave the  Mounties a 4-0 lead when he sent a fastball from Bob Kazmirski (2-4) over the  left-field fence with two out in the third inning. Cook hit a three-run home  run against El Camino Real and was five for 12 with eight runs batted in during  the four-game tournament.  </P> <P> "Keyaan has been struggling lately, but really started to get his rhythm  going," Steele said.  </P> <P> Saklad, making only his second appearance in three weeks, also was in tune. A  short reliever who had thrown only 6 1/3 innings all season, Saklad (1-0)  retired 10 batters in a row at one point.  </P> <P> "We were just hoping for four innings from him, but after five innings he had  only thrown 62 pitches so we stuck with him," Steele said. "He really picked us  up."  </P> <P> Saklad lost the shutout in the sixth when Josh Smaler, an all-tournament  selection, hit a two-out solo home run. Saklad walked two in the seventh and  was relieved by freshman Chris Ferebee, who struck out the two batters he  faced.  </P> <P> "I wasn't nervous because I hadn't thrown in a while and not much was expected  from me," Saklad said. "I just wanted to keep the ball down and throw  groundballs."  </P> <P> Montclair Prep, which failed to advance past the first day of the tournament  the previous two years, extended its lead to 5-0 in the fourth. Russell Ortiz  -- an all-tournament selection -- reached on an error, went to second on a  fielder's choice, and scored on Shad Knighton's two-out single.  </P> <P> The Mounties added a run in the fifth when Cook singled, moved to second on a  ground out, and scored on a hit-and-run single from Brent Polacheck.  </P> <P> Agoura (7-8), winner of five consecutive games, had runners in scoring position  three times but failed to score.  </P> <P> "We just weren't aggressive at the plate and it hurt us," Agoura Coach Gary  Gray said. "(Saklad) wasn't overpowering, but he was around the plate and kept  us off balance."  </P></p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Working Life: After The Gold Rush - Reading matter Stewart Lansley and the Henley Centre. Random House, Pounds 20, pp269 It is an old cliche that money does not make you happy. It is also a pressing political reality that economic growth has made much of the developed world not just unhappy, but bitterly divided and socially unstable. This is commonly blamed on a decline in spiritual values, which may be true but is of limited use in policy terms. What is needed is a more objective look at the phenomenon, which may give clues on whether it is reversible. Stewart Lansley's After The Gold Rush is a fair shot at a daunting topic. The author starts with a grim picture of a developed world in crisis: mounting unemployment, a widening gulf between the rich and poor, a declining belief in government and the onset of what he terms 'the politics of exclusion'. The root cause, Lansley argues, is that rising affluence has brought with it a change in the nature of consumption. People can afford the essentials, and concentrate instead on 'symbolic goods', such as a flash car or a second home: goods whose essential point is what they say, not just about those who own them but those who do not. Together with this has come the rise of what Lansley terms 'competitive individualism', whereby most people seek to shake off collective responsibilities. This, he suggests, explains such developments as the fall in top tax rates across the developed world in the past 20 years, and the drop in trade union membership. So is there a way out? Ultimately, says Lansley, that depends on one crucial question: whether people will reach saturation point in their demand for symbolic goods. If so, they can opt for more leisure, altruistic concern for others and rational use of scarce resources. Will that happen? Only perhaps, says Lansley. 'There is reason to believe such a limit exists, but that we are not yet close to it.'</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Two KIO Swiss bank accounts frozen TWO SWISS BANK accounts belonging to the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), the overseas investment arm of the Kuwaiti finance ministry, have been frozen by a Geneva judge following a petition by the Italian cardboard producer, Sarrio. The attachment of the accounts is a significant victory for Sarrio, which is suing the KIO in Spain for non-payment of part of the price of assets sold to the KIO's Spanish subsidiary, Grupo Torras (GT), in 1991. The Italians accepted shares in Torras Papel, a GT subsidiary, as partial payment for their Spanish paper interests, with the agreement that these shares could be 'put' back to GT in three instalments. The Kuwaitis paid the first instalment but new managers, who took over the KIO last May, have not, says Sarrio, made the second and third payments. The value of the shares held by Sarrio has since collapsed. GT is in receivership. Sarrio applied for, and won, an attachment order in Switzerland on May 11. The accounts affected are at Lombard Odier, the private bank, and the Swiss Kuwaiti Bank. It is not known how much money is now in the accounts. Sarrio is trying to retrieve SFr112m (Dollars 76.7m) and the KIO is likely to ask that at least one of the accounts be unfrozen in the meantime. The move by Sarrio could pose a serious threat to the Kuwaitis, however. If Sarrio is allowed to retrieve the money it wants from one or other of the accounts it might create a judicial precedent and allow other GT creditors to make claims directly from the KIO. The KIO's lawyers are understood to feel the retrieval attempt will fail, however. The KIO claims it is merely a shareholder, and not the owner, of GT.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Stock Exchange launches probe into Owners Abroad share deals THE STOCK Exchange have launched an inquiry into share dealings of Owners Abroad, the UK's second biggest tour operator. The probe is believed to centre on two issues: the dramatic fall in the Owners share price in the past month - it has collapsed 37 per cent in that period; and the sale of 690,000 shares by Mr Howard Klein, chairman, to the company's employee share option plan. While there is no suggestion that the latter transaction was in any way illegal, the sale on March 31 was followed by a further slump in the share price. Mr Klein yesterday denied there was anything improper in the share sale. 'I had made it known to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the company's broker, many months ago that I needed to dispose of the shares for personal reasons. Phillips &amp; Drew were consulted on the basis of the sale of my shares to the Esop and they advised that it was perfectly in order.' On the day that Mr Klein sold the shares to the Esop at 108p, the price closed at 105p, to be followed over the next week by a rapid decline. Owners lent the Esop the money to complete the transaction. Yesterday, the shares finished  1/2 p down at 89p in busy trading. It is the second inquiry in as many weeks into the holiday group. The first, which is still believed to be under way, is investigating anonymous notes sent to national newspapers and company employees that Owners was about to be taken over by Airtours, its rival tour group. Both companies have denied the story. Yesterday's move by the authorities came only a day after Owners published its reports and accounts for 1991, which caused concern in the market. Analysts drew attention to the company's depreciation policy, particularly on the treatment of one of its leased aircraft.</p>

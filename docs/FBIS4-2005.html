			<p>BFN     [Text] In 1994, Qinghai's judicial administrative work is  to focus primarily on maintaining political and social stability  and boosting economic growth.    This is the exact message from a recently concluded  provincial judicial administrative work conference. The  conference, which concluded on 3 March, conscientiously summed  up the province's judicial administrative work in 1993,  deliberated a five-year provincial judicial administrative work  program, and called for further strengthening the province's  reform-through-labor and reeducation-through-labor work,  improving the quality of prisoner transformation work, and  enabling more prisoners to turn over a new leaf.    The conference also stressed successfully running special  schools and called for building one or two model  provincial-level special schools, strengthening production  management and deepening the internal reform of the  reform-through-labor and reeducation-through-labor enterprises,  and increasing economic efficiency in this connection.    The conference stated: The province's judicial service  should enhance the understanding of reform, intensify work with  available resources, expand the social influence of lawyers,  notaries, and the judicial service at the grassroots level, step  up legal system propaganda and education, publicize market  economic laws and commercial laws, and strengthen fruitful legal  system education among primary and secondary school students and  juveniles.    Provincial Vice Governor La Bingli attended the conference  and delivered a speech in which he called on the people's  governments at all levels in Qinghai to attach great importance  to and strengthen leadership over judicial administrative work  apart from successfully carrying out economic construction and  to strive to create favorable conditions under which the  province's judicial administrative work can develop. On the  other hand, La Bingli noted, judicial administrative organs at  all levels throughout the province should energetically build a  strong police force to meet the province's reform and economic  construction needs.</p>

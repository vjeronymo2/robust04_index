			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Boris Yeltsin: Toward Concluding Agreement on Achieving </F> Civic Accord in Russia" -- ITAR-TASS headline]    [Text] [No dateline as received] -- The first stage of work  on the text of an agreement on achieving civic accord in Russia  has been concluded. While preparing it, the possibility of  joint constructive (?work between) various branches of power,  parties and trade unions has become apparent. The text prepared  by the working group is being distributed for publication and  general discussion. But no less complex and important stages lie  ahead. In this connection I want to share my thoughts about the  idea of civic peace and accord and further possible measures.  <H5>  Need for Agreement </H5>   The Agreement on achieving civic accord in Russia arises  from  what has happened in the political life of the country -- no  matter how contradictory it may seem -- and from the need to  ensure political stability in society and to encourage the  shoots of civic peace. Not a single serious problem of economic  and social change can be solved without this.    The agreement would help to protect the emerging Russian  democracy against political extremism. So far we, in fact, have  only one democratic instrument to protect society and the state  -- the new Constitution. This is not enough. Besides the Main  Law, democratic traditions and a culture of dialogue, compromise  and partnership are needed.    The recent elections in March showed how justified is the  concern expressed in the address of the Russian president  regarding the alienation of society from power and the  population from politics. Only by proving to people that  politicians, parties and state institutes can come to an  agreement, find common positions and effectively solve important  public tasks can one hope to overcome this alienation.  <H5>  The Possibility of an Agreement </H5>   Skeptical voices are heard saying that in the present  condition of society an agreement is impossible. This point of  view leads down a blind alley. I consider that the adoption and  implementation of an agreement are realistic. Society is tired  of confrontation, it is demanding civic peace, consensus,  stability (not, however, the stability of immobility, but the  stability of movement, economic and political reformation).    The people's need is sensed by the politicians, and this is  clearly heard in the individual statements and declarations of  the most varied political forces.    An agreement is furthermore possible because it reflects and  consolidates mechanisms of consensus that have already started  to operate, which is attested by the examples of joint work by  the representatives of different branches of power on specific  problems.    The whole population, the majority of political parties and  a  considerable proportion of the corps of deputies have an  interest in consensus and political stability. With what  political explosions are fraught is clear to all. At the same  time -- and this is fully justified -- many are counting on  legal mechanisms of obtaining power, which work only amid  political stability.  <H5>  Main Tasks of Agreement </H5>   The tasks of the agreement on achieving civic accord in  Russia arise from the interests of the overwhelming proportion  of the population. I would formulate them briefly as follows:    1. To ensure political stability by bringing into play the  mechanisms of accord to be used permanently, in order to help  resolve contradictions at early stages without them resulting in  a confrontation, and in order to create in society and among the  political elite an atmosphere of rejecting and denouncing  extremism;    2. to form new political traditions and a new political  culture;    3. to overcome the alienation of society from power by  demonstrating real accord and the effectiveness and openness of  politics;    4. to make the structures of civic society more active by  involving them in discussing and tackling important problems;    5. to stimulate and speed up the adoption of laws  necessary for extricating Russia from the economic crisis;    6. to create a favorable social atmosphere: A feeling of  stability, confidence in power and an understanding of it.  <H5>  What is Most Important in the Agreement </H5>   The most important thing is that the agreement on achieving  civic accord in Russia should set in motion a permanent  mechanism of accord and maintain it.    For this it is proposed (in accordance with the existing  text) to set up a conciliation commission from representatives  of the parties. Its main function is to create and maintain the  work of permanent round tables for the main directions: Social  and economic policy, security, culture, national problems and so  forth.    These round tables will analyze the situation, single out  important specific problems and set up temporary working groups  from representatives of the interested parties to discuss them  and to elaborate recommendations.    The strength of such groups lies in the fact that the  recommendations drawn up by them will emphasize key  contradictions at an early stage and will find agreed ways of  solving them precisely because it is easier to come to an  agreement on specific issues.    I am sure that this agreement will be achieved if we can  maintain such conciliatory procedures for specific problems and  make use of their results.  <H5>  Completing Work on the Text of the Agreement </H5>   To complete work on the text of the agreement it is proposed  to set up a working group, which would include two  representatives from the following parties: - the Russian  president, the Federation Council, the State Duma, the Russian  Government, the Public Chamber, religious organizations, trade  unions, associations of entrepreneurs and industrialists,  creative associations.    I should regard it as useful to adopt a procedure whereby  each of the parties could veto the inclusion of any of the  proposed candidates in the group. This would enable a  composition to be achieved that could work smoothly and make  decisions by consensus. In that case, the text of an agreement  that had had the finishing touches applied to it by the group  could be signed without any further discussion.    The text of the current draft agreement as published in the  press should be discussed, and recommendations, proposals and  amendments should be drawn up and then sent to the president's  administration for forwarding to the working group that is now  operating.    Then, one day in the second half of April, a further working  conference can be convened, attended by representatives of the  above-mentioned parties to the agreement and leaders of  parliamentary groups in the State Duma. The purpose of such a  conference is to endorse the composition of the group working on  the text and (to endorse) the signing procedure.    After this meeting, the newly formed group will be given no  more than seven days to complete its work on the text, so that  the signing may take place on 28 April.  <H5>  Signing of the Agreement </H5>   I imagine that the parties from the above-mentioned list  must  decide for themselves which of them will be delegated for the  ceremonial signing of the text of the agreement. I daresay  there may be proposals to broaden the group of signatories by  means of regional or wider political representation (this may be  a topic for discussion at the next conference).    The delegations of the parties sign the text of the  agreement. It is then published with an appeal by the parties to  accede to the agreement. Following publication of the text, the  body set up in accordance with the adopted agreement (in the  current text, that is the Conciliation Commission) is given the  powers to organize an open signing of the agreement. This may,  for example, take the form of decisions to accede to the  agreement adopted and sent in by various organizations. A list  of such organizations may be published regularly in the  newspapers by the Conciliation Commission.    I am sincerely confident that the agreement on achieving  civic accord in Russia is both possible and necessary today for  all of us -- the politicians and citizens of Russia. The  agreement will demonstrate that our new political system is  strengthening and maturing, that we are becoming stronger and  more responsible and that political ambitions and speculative  interests are taking hold of us less frequently.    But the process of completing, adopting and implementing the  agreement can easily be wrecked; mutual mistrust and the  tendency to achieve victories at the expense of one's opponent  and not together with him is still great. We must never forget  this if we sincerely believe in our desire for accord and civic  peace in Russia.</p>

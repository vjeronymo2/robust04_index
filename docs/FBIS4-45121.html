			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Filonov, Atominform Central Scientific </F> Research Institute laboratory chief, under "Polemics" heading,  entitled "What Kind of Chemical Weapons Elimination Concept Does  Russia Need?" Article is a response to the 30 April  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA interview with A. Kuntsevich which appeared  in the 11 May FBIS Arms Control Report, p. 6.]    [Text] In January 1993 Russia signed a convention banning  the development, production, stockpiling or use of chemical  weapons and requiring their destruction. The convention was  drawn up with participation by 70 states, with negotiations  extending over a period of 10 years. In October 1993 all the  U.N. member states approved it, the kind of full consensus that  one rarely finds in international affairs. Now the world  community is closely following the process by which the  Convention is considered and ratified by the principal  countries, i.e those that produce chemical weapons. These  includes the states of the European Economic Community, Japan,  China, the United States and Russia. The statutes of the  Convention will take effect 180 days after the 65th ratification  resolution is handed over for safekeeping, but not earlier than  two years after its completion and signing, i.e. not before  January 1995.    Now it is already May 1994, and the day is not far off when  the Russian State Duma will have to make a decision regarding  ratification of the Convention.    Parliamentary hearings on this issue were held on 24 March.  All those attending were of one opinion: the Convention must be  ratified, because that is in Russia's national interest and will  help establish a more lasting peace on our planet. However,  those attending also expressed concern that as we take this  responsibility upon ourselves we must also measure our  capabilities, and in that context it is above all essential to  have a tool for implementing the Convention requirements: a  "Concept for the Elimination of Chemical Weapons (CW) in  Russia." A draft concept was in fact presented at the  parliamentary hearings on behalf of the Russian Federation  Presidential Committee on Conventional Chemical and Biological  Weapons Issues. The draft in a way builds on the "Comprehensive  Program for Gradual Elimination of Chemical Weapons in the  Russian Federation," which was drawn up by the same committee in  1992.    Were answers to all the questions of interest to those  attending the hearings found in the proposed draft?  Unfortunately not. Firstly, the draft concept to a certain  extent only reflects the issue of destroying toxic agents and  leaves completely open the problem of how to destroy CW. Yet it  is a well-known fact that the toxic agent "filling" comprises  only 10 percent of the total mass of materials slated for  destruction. Finding ways to utilize the shell casings, bombs,  filling equipment and special missile components is an equally  complicated and expensive undertaking. Secondly, the draft makes  no provision for options with regard to destruction technology.  In fact, both the Comprehensive Program and the draft Concept  give exclusive preference to the chemical method. Yet at the  same time all references to chemical-based technologies are in  the future tense, indicating that they are still being  developed. Thirdly, the proposed national Convention is clearly  biased in favor of foreign technology.    That bias is so strong that Point 6, Section 13 of the draft  flatly states that one precondition for Russia's fulfillment of  its international commitments with regard to CW destruction is  "the attraction of financial and technological aid from foreign  countries in connection with destruction of the Russian  Federation's chemical weapons, including the construction of  'turnkey' CW destruction facilities in Russia." It can clearly  be predicted that implementation of that passage will result in  Russia's technical and hence political dependency on its Western  partners. And the insignificant $50 million in U.S. aid intended  to supply an experimental installation will wind up causing  billions more to flow out of our country and into foreign banks.    Realizing the importance and timeliness of resolving the  issue of large-scale CW destruction, in addition to Khimprom  (which manufactures toxic agents) several organizations under  other ministries have also begun developing various  technological alternatives, often doing so at their own  initiative.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has already reported on one possible  alternative technology for complete and comprehensive CW  destruction -- use of nuclear explosions (see: NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA, 29 March 1994). There exist other proposals as well. For  example, the Central Scientific Research Institute for Machine  Building under the Russian Space Agency has under the direction  of A. I. Papush, a corresponding member of the Russian Academy  of Natural Sciences, developed a high-temperature technology and  created a working model of a unit designed to neutralize highly  toxic substances. On 29 December 1993 destruction of the  principal CW components was demonstrated using that experimental  unit, along with the scientific and technical principles of this  method. In essence the proposed technological process is based  on a thermochemical method of transforming a neutralized  substance. The experimental unit measures 8.0x1.5x1.5 meters and  has a capacity of 1 metric ton per hour. The unit's mobility  makes it possible to destroy CW (or toxic agents) at their  storage sites. Unfortunately, neither the Russian Federation  Ministry of Defense, represented by its Radiation, Chemical and  Biological Defense Troops, nor the Russian Federation  Presidential Committee on Conventional Chemical and Biological  Weapons Issues, which was headed until recently by A.  Kuntsevich, has paid proper attention to this  domestically-designed innovation. Its inventors were even  refused access to a certain number of appropriate formulas in  connection with their demonstration. Yet the "chemical" generals  have shown some interest in and consented to the conducting of  tests in Russia using experimental units made in the United  States and Germany.    I have no reason to doubt the sincerity of the best  intentions with which this draft Concept was developed. But the  national Concept should be understandable to every citizen of  our country, just as in the end it will not be with "aid" from  overseas that the problem of CW elimination will be solved, but  with the money of Russia's taxpayers.    What would I like to see in the Concept? Firstly, it should  reflect the principal ways and means of destroying chemical  weapons specifically, not just toxic agents, as envisioned by  the international Convention. Secondly, it should make provision  for the use of various technologies for CW destruction,  depending on the state and conditions of CW and toxic agent  storage. For example, munitions in a hazardous state of decay  would be destroyed at the site where they are presently located  using the aforementioned thermochemical method; toxic agents  stored in large containers would be destroyed at refitted  Khimprom enterprises; cannister, artillery and airborne chemical  weapons would be destroyed with the help of nuclear detonation  technology; and so on. The Concept should confirm the most  efficient use for each of the proposed technologies, not pit one  against the other.    What must be done in order to accomplish that? It is clear  that there is no point in assigning the aforementioned Committee  on Conventional Chemical and Biological Weapons Issues to edit  the draft Concept a third time. That should be done by a  different team, which should include representatives of all the  organizations that are offering various technologies for the  destruction of CW (or toxic agents), as well as representatives  of CW customers and manufacturers, environmentalists, doctors  and economists. Their efforts should be covered by the media in  a generally intelligible form at both the Federation-wide level  and at the local and regional levels. This team's primary task  should be to organize and conduct comprehensive assessments  (technical, environmental and economic) of all proposed  technologies, including mandatory demonstrations. After this  collective assessment has been made, the most environmentally  safe and economically appropriate CW destruction technologies  should be determined, and this should not be done independently  by the customer (the Ministry of Defense), as stipulated in  Point 5.6 of the draft.    I am convinced that if the issue is formulated in this way  Russia is capable not only of destroying its own CW within the  established time limits at a minimal cost, but also of providing  assistance to other countries around the world.</p>

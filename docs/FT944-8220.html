			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Looking for a year-end finale - The Emerging Investor The world's emerging markets largely discounted last week's action by the US Federal Reserve as thoughts remained focused on whether there will be a final rally to end the year. The markets have managed to recoup almost all of the losses triggered by the Fed's first rate rise of 1994 back in February, with the IFC's composite index having virtually returned to its January starting point. However, the performance has not been even: Latin America has far outstripped Asia, while Europe's emerging markets - which include Turkey and Poland, two of the disappointments of 1994 - remain caught in a downward trend. While the prospect of a further tightening by the US Fed remains, and forecasts vary between the end of the year or early in 1995, fund managers and strategists take a more measured long-term view. Indeed, with so much capital now tied up in emerging markets, especially from US pension funds, a sudden change of strategy is highly improbable. According to Mr Michael Howell of Baring Securities, in a speech delivered in Tokyo during the summer, international money managers allocated more new money throughout 1993 to the emerging stock markets than they did to North America and Japan combined. While the flow of funds has slowed somewhat during 1994, the annual inflow of new money is forecast to be between Dollars 40bn and Dollars 50bn, against some Dollars 63bn the year before. US monetary policy has been the main factor determining investment attitudes towards emerging markets throughout this year. Consequently Mr John Legat, senior emerging markets portfolio manager of GT Unit Managers in London, has been pursuing a policy of diversifying away from the dollar bloc markets, which includes most of south east Asia, and concentrating on markets in India, Africa, eastern Europe, Turkey and Brazil. However, each time the US Fed had lifted rates he has been buying back the dollar bloc markets on expectations that long bond yields would start to fall - good news for financial markets in general. Mr Jean de Bolle, of Foreign and Colonial Emerging Markets, comments that he does not believe the US long bond has yet peaked, something that is unlikely to occur before the second quarter 1995, he thinks. For this reason he is looking to invest in smaller emerging markets during 1995: countries such as Peru for instance. He is also keen on Turkey, in spite of its lacklustre showing this year, and Brazil, which, he believes, has great potential over the next 12 months. Turkey has aptly demonstrated the volatility that can so often characterise the short-term performance of emerging markets. Following a gain of some 200 per cent in dollar terms in 1993, the financial markets came under a wave of selling as its foreign debt rating was downgraded in mid-January and the Turkish lira collapsed against the dollar. Inflation then rose into triple digit figures for the first time in 14 years, hitting an annual rate of 117 per cent in May. The market made a partial recovery during the summer, as the government introduced an austerity package, but by the end of last week it was still down nearly 40 per cent in dollar terms on the year to date. Looking ahead Mr Sushil Wadhwani, a Goldman Sachs strategist based in London, believes Asian markets in general offer good potential over the long term, and appear an even more attractive proposition than Latin America, even if the US Fed acts more decisively next time round. Mr Mark Mobius of Templeton Worldwide, which has some Dollars 7.2bn invested in emerging markets funds, believes that prospects for the next six months remain generally good. 'However, while a number of markets have moved up substantially and have recovered from the decline in the early part of the year, many are overpriced,' he says.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                       TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Friday    Week on week change Stock                          Country  18/11/94     Dollars       %  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Eczacibasi Ilac                 Turkey   0.1300       0.0287   28.27 Goodyear Tyres                  Turkey   0.5063       0.0681   15.53 CSN                             Brazil   0.0484       0.0046   10.55 Peru-Pacifico                     Peru   1.0172       0.0823    8.80 Pacifico Peruano Suiza            Peru  32.9897       2.5131    8.25 Leader Universal Holdings     Malaysia   5.5729       0.4106    7.95 Investimentos Itau (Pfd)        Brazil   0.7177       0.0490    7.33 Cukurova Elektrik               Turkey   0.2381       0.0162    7.32 Cukurova Elektrik               Turkey   0.2025       0.0135    7.16 Telsep (Pfd)                    Brazil   0.5203       0.0308    6.29  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

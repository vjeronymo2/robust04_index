			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLIPPED OUT;  </P> <P> COMPTON YOUTHS FLY THROUGH THEIR ROUTINES AND WALK AWAY WITH PRIZES  </P> <P> The Ebony Flyers know how to please a crowd. They crank up the rap music, march  out on stage in their maroon leotards and sequined silver belts and leap into  action.  </P> <P> At times moving with the lyric grace of a school of dolphins rising from the  sea, the 15 Compton youngsters jump, spin and somersault their way across a row  of tumbling mats to the driving beats of soul, pop and rap songs.  </P> <P> "When they go places and nobody has ever seen them before, the reaction is  something to watch," Roosevelt Porter, the group's founder and coach, said with  a touch of pride.  </P> <P> In its 12 years of existence, the acrobatic gymnastics troupe has competed in  20 amateur performing arts contests, never taking less than first place.  "They're very skillful and extremely entertaining," observed Victor Dru, a  Hollywood dance teacher who has organized several regional contests in which  the Flyers have appeared.  </P> <P> An athletic trainer and gymnastics coach at Compton Community College, Porter  is a calm, self-assured, 44-year-old who started the troupe under the umbrella  of the college's community outreach program for children, College for Kids.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Keeps Them Off Streets'  </P> <P> In a city of gang shootings and entrenched poverty, Porter gives his charges  patience, discipline and attention. "It helps the kids," said Deborah Ford,  whose 8-year-old daughter Shavonda Maxwell has trained with Porter since she  was 4. "It keeps them off the streets."  </P> <P> Competing against -- and beating -- groups from much more affluent backgrounds  allows the Flyers to "see the other side of what life is all about," said  Porter, who graduated from the college in 1976 with an associate of arts  degree, intending to become an art teacher.  </P> <P> "People say, 'Oh, your kids are from Compton,' and then they roll their eyes,"  he added, smiling because his Compton youths walk away with the prizes. "I have  something to offer them that they like to do."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plans on Olympics  </P> <P> Shavonda, who recently won a first place in Las Vegas for a solo routine,  started with Porter after watching a film about a gymnastics star. "She started  flipping all over my house. I decided to put her in class before she broke  something," Ford said. "She loves it, says she's going to the Olympics."  </P> <P> Altogether, Porter works with about 30 youngsters in the program. He runs a  baby tumbling group of 4- to 6-year-olds and a beginning group of slightly  older children preparing for the Flyers, boys and girls ranging in age from 7  to 26.  </P> <P> Twice a week the Flyers gather in the college gymnasium for two hours of  practice. They don't use parallel bars or beams in their act, concentrating  instead on mat routines involving tumbling feats.  </P> <P> They execute their moves serially or in unison, often creating a dance-like  effect. "Everybody who works with this group has to understand they're part of  a machine," said Porter, who competed in gymnastics as a Los Angeles high  school student and who choreographs the troupe's routines.  </P> <P> Although an arts major, Porter worked in the college training room to earn  money while attending Compton, "and it just sort of took hold." He became  certified as an athletic trainer and has held that position at the college  since 1978.  </P> <P> He also worked with the College for Kids program while a student. When the  directors wanted a new course one summer, Porter fell back on his gymnast  training to start a tumbling class. He used music to help the beginners master  their timing, incorporating it into the end-of-course performance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Parents Went Wild'  </P> <P> "The parents went wild, so I just kept it up, year after year."  </P> <P> Originally all girls, the group was first called the Ebony Jewels.  </P> <P> Several alumnae of the Flyers have gone on to study dance in college, while  four former members of the troupe who organized their own singing group -- The  Boys -- recently climbed to the top of the soul charts with their song, "Dial  My Heart." The four boys sang at the same performing arts competitions in which  they appeared with the Flyers.  </P> <P> Ultimately Porter says he would like to help Compton youngsters compete at the  national or even international level. To that end, he is hoping to persuade the  college and the city to find the facilities to house a full-fledged, community  gymnastics program.  </P> <P> In the meantime, he dreams up new routines. "I don't want the kids to ever  think we're doing the same thing. That's boredom."  </P></p>

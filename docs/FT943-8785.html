			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Berliners demand their homes back: Those who lost land when the Berlin Wall went up think it is time to reclaim it They had gathered on Saturday at the site of the former Berlin Wall in Bernauer street, 33 years to the day after east German troops moved in with bulldozers to divide the city. About 100 people, many frail and elderly, stood on this long, narrow strip of wasteland in east Berlin. It had been turned into mud by the torrential rain but they had come determined not to celebrate the collapse of the wall nearly five years ago, but to demand from the German government the right to regain property which they had been forced to leave when east German troops ordered them out of their homes to make way for the wall on the night of August 13 1961. 'All we want is justice,' says Mr Wolf-Dietrich Golz, who two years ago helped establish an association for those seeking compensation or restitution. 'The German government refuses to return our property to us,' says Mr Golz. 'Their excuse is that since all property along the Berlin Wall belonged to the former east German defence ministry, it should automatically be passed under the control of the German state. But why? Why is it that those whose property was confiscated by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945, or by the communists between 1949 and 1990, can seek compensation or restitution, but not us?' The Berlin Wall ran like a snake along 165km of the city, cutting through 3,000 homes. 'I remember August 13 1961 very well,' says Mr Golz, 54. 'It was a warm, quiet summer's night. We were living on Finkenkruger Street in Spandau, not in the British zone, but in the eastern/Soviet zone. I had been writing a love letter. Then I heard the dogs, the bulldozers, the soldiers. The next morning, I looked out the window. Finkenkruger Street had been divided. We were locked in.' 'Even before the wall had been built, it was sheer hell to live there. In the late 1940s, when the Russians carved out their zone in east Berlin, life became very difficult. We were surrounded by guards.' Mr Golz's mother eventually moved to Bavaria, leaving the family house to her son in her will. 'I was studying at the time in Dresden. I went back from time to time to my home. Then in 1967, the home was flattened. I received no notification. No compensation. Nothing.' The wall along Finkenkruger Street has since been removed. All that remains is a long avenue of overgrown grass and shrubs. East and West Berliners can now see each other again. 'I want to return there and rebuild my house,' says Mr Golz. Over 1,400 Berliners who once lived on the site of the Berlin Wall want to do the same, or else seek compensation. But Mr Gerhard Schiele, a Free Democrat and member of Berlin's chamber of deputies, says the chances are slim. 'Mr Theo Waigel (the finance minister) does not want to give the claimants any compensation because it would cost too much money. And the justice ministry, which used to be under Mr Klaus Kinkel (now the foreign minister), and who helped draw up the unification treaty, is afraid that if the law is amended it will create a precedent for other property claims. These are the real reasons for the government holding onto their property, which by the way, is very valuable.' The dispute has not only pitted east Berliners against the German government. It has caused a rift between the Berlin Senate and Bonn. 'The Senate has repeatedly demanded a change in the law,' says Mr Klaus Kilian, an official from the Senate's justice department. 'The Bundesrat (Upper House) last June suggested some degree of restitution or compensation, but the Bundestag (Lower House) will never agree. If it were allowed, it could set a precedent for other claimants. These could include those whose land was expropriated by the Soviet administration in eastern Germany between 1945 and 1949.' Mr Kilian says the dispute is also delaying investment and planning in Berlin. 'We cannot develop large sections of the former wall until this matter is settled,' he says. 'Investors are very wary.' In the meantime, former property owners along the Berlin Wall are determined to continue their struggle. 'This is about justice,' says Ms Inge Bergk, a veteran campaigner whose parents had lived on Bernauer Street. 'If East Germany no longer exists, then the old law which placed all Berlin Wall property under the communist defence ministry no longer exists as well. This is our property and we want it back.'</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA QUAKE;  </P> <P> INSURERS FACE MASSIVE QUAKE LIABILITY  </P> <P> Insurance companies could be held liable for as much as $3 billion to $4  billion in losses from Tuesday's earthquake that rocked the San Francisco Bay  Area, Richard J. Roth Jr., assistant state insurance commissioner, said  Wednesday. The total does not include the cost of repairing roads, bridges and  other uninsured structures.  </P> <P> While it will take insurance companies 10 days to two weeks to complete a  comprehensive assessment, some experts estimated that insured losses could  approach Hurricane Hugo's record $4 billion. "It's the Western version of  Hugo," Roth said.  </P> <P> Even before Tuesday's quake, 1989 had become by far the worst year ever for  catastrophes. With 2 1/2 months remaining, the year's insured losses total  $5.64 billion, double the previous record of $2.82 billion in 1985.  </P> <P> In contrast, insurers paid about $350 million in claims as a result of the  Whittier quake two years ago.  </P> <P> Ironically, insurance stocks were among gainers in Wednesday's trading on Wall  Street. Investors, according to some market observers, evidently bet that the  year's heavy insured losses will provide insurance companies with a golden  opportunity to raise premiums and fatten profits, a theory the industry  disputes.  </P> <P> Roth said he figures that insured losses to buildings and other structures from  actual shaking by the Bay Area quake will total about $1 billion. Additional  losses will be covered by insurance against fire, wrecked vehicles, medical  costs and death -- not to mention public liability lawsuits.  </P> <P> Roth's estimate did not include such major public works as the damaged San  Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, the collapsed portion of the Nimitz Freeway in  Oakland or repairs to the Oakland and San Francisco airports. Taxpayers will  pick up those bills. Indeed, a Caltrans spokesman said the department is  seeking an emergency appropriation to begin immediate public rebuilding.  </P> <P> As for residential damages, only about 20% of homeowners pay the extra premium  required for earthquake coverage, the industry estimates. Although California  law requires all insurers doing business in the state to offer earthquake  insurance, customers are not obliged to buy it.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, insurers rushed "catastrophe teams" of claims adjusters to the  stricken area. Los Angeles-based Farmers Group Insurance Cos. flew a team of 50  adjusters to Pleasanton in Alameda County to set up an emergency processing  center to handle its customers' earthquake damage claims.  </P> <P> Farmers spokesman Jeffrey C. Beyer said the company insures about 250,000  homeowners and 450,0000 motorists in the Bay Area. About two-thirds of its  automobile policyholders buy "comprehensive" coverage, which covers personal  injury and damage to the vehicle, he said.  </P> <P> Fireman's Fund, based in the Marin County town of Novato, was among major  insurers putting out a call for independent claims adjusters to help reach all  customers within 24 hours.  </P> <P> Homeowners and businesses without earthquake insurance but covered for other  property damages would probably not be covered for collapse from shaking but  might collect for damage by water and fire, said Ed O'Hare, spokesman for the  industry-supported Insurance Information Institute.  </P> <P> The coincidence of multibillion-dollar national disasters happening in  consecutive months generated shock waves among state insurance regulators, some  of whom were meeting in Washington to discuss, among other topics, the adequacy  of insurers' reserves for catastrophe.  </P> <P> "What troubles us is the combination of Hugo and the earthquake coming back to  back," said Robin Campaniano, Hawaii's insurance commissioner and head of the  earthquake panel of the National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners. "It may have  a significant impact on insurers."  </P> <P> But in California, Roth said insurance companies should be able to handle the  expected Bay Area losses easily -- "even if it runs as high as Hurricane Hugo."  </P> <P> Related Story: D2  </P></p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Coleridge pressed over postal ballot: Anger over voting MR David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, was criticised yesterday for suggesting that Names unable to attend the extraordinary general meeting on July 27 were unlikely to get a postal ballot. Lloyd's governing council faces votes of no confidence at the meeting, following the disclosure of Pounds 2bn losses in 1989. Several Names attending the annual conference of the Association of Lloyd's Members demanded that arrangements for a postal ballot were implemented for the many people who would be unable to attend the meeting. One overseas-based Name said the council would be making a 'grievous mistake' if it disenfranchised a large number of members from taking part in a crucial vote. Mr Coleridge said he could not give an immediate answer. He was taking legal advice and consulting the Electoral Reform Society, although the position would not be resolved for another week. He suggested that there was insufficient time to organise a postal ballot, which would be costly, lengthy and potentially damaging to the standing of Lloyd's.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong's weakness remains in focus TOKYO closed marginally higher after fluctuating in a tight range and activity was limited to small-lot trading by public funds and investment trusts, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed 80.64 higher at 17,393.68 after a low of 17,254.76 in the morning and a high of 17,408.83 in the afternoon. After firming at the start, following Tuesday's approval of the government's fiscal supplementary budget by the House of Representatives, early gains were erased by investment trusts' selling. However, bargain-hunting by public funds supported prices in the afternoon. Volume fell to 200m shares from 266m as advances led declines by 479 to 468 with 176 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 4.23 to 1,308.31 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.26 to 1,056.50. Investors said that aside from public funds and dealers' trading, genuine buying was scarce. Some investors supported small-capital shares, and the second section rose for the 10th consecutive day. Toy makers and video game makers were strong ahead of the Christmas season. Konami rose Y230 to Y2,950 and Sega Enterprises rose Y300 to Y10,000. Bandai, the largest toy maker, gained Y170 to Y3,750, while Takara rose Y130 to Y1,330. Semiconductor equipment makers rose on prospects of a recovery in the US chip industry. Kyocera, the semiconductor ceramic package maker, rose Y70 to Y4,240. Toshiba, which has strong business ties with US companies, rose Y2 to Y622. Other high-technology issues fell on profit-taking, with NEC down Y7 to Y668 on earnings worries, and Matsushita Electric Industrial retreating Y10 to Y1,140. Speculative favourites rose on short-term buying by dealers, with Nippon Carbon up Y33 to Y513 and Clarion rising Y30 to Y472. On the over-the-counter market, TSD, the computer software maker, lost Y47 to Y573 after announcing that it expected to see losses on the pre-tax and after-tax level for the September year-end. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 0.21 to 18,773.28 in volume of 30.2m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, gained Y500 to Y11,000 on reports of an upward earnings revision by a leading Japanese broker. Roundup A further fall in Hong Kong depressed many of the region's markets yesterday. HONG KONG fell nearly 2 per cent at the opening following Governor Chris Patten's statement that he intended to press ahead with democratic reforms. But bargain-hunting helped to lift the Hang Seng index off the day's low of 5,391.71 to close 91.23 down at 5,410.48 in turnover of HKDollars 2.4bn. Some analysts fear that the uncertainty could last until next February when the draft reform proposals are presented to the legislative council. Mr Michael Franklin at Kim Eng Securities said it was likely that international fund managers were seeking to lock in their profits before the year-end and would attempt to buy back in early 1993. AUSTRALIA drifted lower on worries about the domestic economy and the weak local currency. The All-Ordinaries index finished 5.8 lower at 1,438.5 in turnover of ADollars 161m. On Tuesday the Australian dollar fell to a new five-year low against the US currency. National Australia shed 10 cents to ADollars 7.16 following an analysts' presentation. Commonwealth Bank rose 2 cents to ADollars 6.00. SINGAPORE eased with profit-taking in some blue chips. The Straits Times industrial index fell 4.18 to 1,459.89 with 111.8m shares traded. Among active issues, DBS foreign shares fell 30 cents to SDollars 13.30, SIA foreign 20 cents to SDollars 16.30 and Sembawang Shipyard 20 cents to SDollars 8.10. KUALA LUMPUR rebounded on bargain-hunting and speculative buying and the composite index gained 4.28 to 641.51 with 168.5m shares traded. SEOUL weakened after the government decided not to cut the rediscount rate. The composite index shed 9.73 to 650.20 in turnover of Won522.9bn. TAIWAN fell in spite of a rise in the financial and paper sectors. The weighted index lost 11.06 to 3,635.70 in turnover of TDollars 4.3bn after TDollars 6.34bn. MANILA rose on news that drilling for oil off the island of Palawan would go ahead. The composite index advanced 6.92 to 1,273.40 in turnover of 244.4m pesos. NEW ZEALAND saw thin trading as the NZSE-40 index eased 13.78 to 1,525.56 in turnover of NZDollars 22m. Telecom and Fletcher Challenge led the market down with falls of 4 cents each to NZDollars 2.53 and NZDollars 2.25 respectively. BANGKOK extended its gains with a good performance in the banking sector. The SET index rose 13.42 or 1.5 per cent to 874.75 in turnover of some Bt4.74bn. Thai Farmers Bank, the most active stock, jumped Bt40 to Bt720.</p>

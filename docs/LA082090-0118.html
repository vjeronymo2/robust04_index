			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EARNINGS;  </P> <P> K MART CORP. PROFITS RISE 2%  </P> <P> K mart Corp., one of the nation's largest retailing companies, said today that  its profits edged up 2% in the second fiscal quarter ended Aug. 1 as a result  of stronger apparel sales and cost controls.  </P> <P> Second-quarter earnings of $148 million, or 74 cents a share, were up from $145  million, 72 cents a share, last year.  </P> <P> Revenues climbed 11%, to $7.88 billion from $7.09 billion.  </P> <P> Expense controls and higher sales offset negative factors such as a relatively  weak retail environment, higher interest expenses and a reduction in gross  profit margins, K mart Chairman Joseph Antonini said.  </P> <P> To boost sales, K mart launched a strategy to lower everyday shelf prices,  leading to lower profit margins.  </P></p>

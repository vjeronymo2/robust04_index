Is Lukin  Wearing His Deputy's or His Ambassador's Hat Today?"]    [Text] The State Duma International Affairs Committee  intends to send President Boris Yeltsin an interesting document.  This is its approximate content: Having considered your  inquiry about the recall of Vladimir Lukin from the post of  Russian Federation Ambassador to Washington, we express our  agreement with his recall. At the same time we must inform you  that probably for technical reasons your inquiry failed to reach  our committee.    Through this message the committee is reminding the  president  of his constitutional obligations or, to be more accurate, of  his obligation to appoint and recall ambassadors only after  consultations with the International Affairs Committees of both  Federal Assembly chambers. But a strange situation has come  about: Vladimir Lukin, elected a State Duma deputy and soon  after chairman of a State Duma committee, has not yet been  officially recalled from his previous position as ambassador and  is consequently technically speaking serving in two roles.  Whichever way you look at it, the Constitution is being  contravened. Not at all because Lukin wants this but owing to  the forgetfulness of the people in the presidential apparatus  who should be making sure that the Constitution is being  implemented -- especially in such minor and simple matters as an  ambassador's recall.    This situation is, however, certainly not absolutely  unimportant. There has not until now been a sufficiently clear  idea in the committee of how to interpret the reference in the  Constitution to "consultations." The enquiry sent to the  Russian Foreign Ministry seeking clarification by 1 February  remained unanswered several days after the deadline.    People within the committee think that there is no point in  insisting on the American procedure for appointing ambassadors  whereby the final say rests with the Senate.    In Lukin's view, notification should be given in writing,  after which hearings should take place in which experts and, of  course, the nominees themselves participate, then the committee  should make a decision which is brought to the president's  attention and automatically made public. If the committee  supports a candidacy proposed by the president, there is no  problem. If, on the other hand, there are objections and the  president nevertheless insists on his choice, then, Lukin says,  the ambassador will have to live with the knowledge that people  throughout the world, as well as in the country where he is  posted, will know that parliament rejected his candidacy.  Incidentally, the "unwanted" ambassador is not to be envied in  these circumstances.    The committee will have to try out this mechanism in  practice  in the very near future. Several key ambassadorial appointments  are expected: Yuliy Vorontsov will replace Lukin in Washington,  and current Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will replace  Vorontsov at the United Nations. Lukin will finally have to be  recalled....</p>

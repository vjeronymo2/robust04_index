			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Bulgaria rules out debt forgiveness BULGARIA yesterday ruled out any western forgiveness of its debt, saying this could slow down its economic reforms. Mr Ivan Kostov, its finance minister, said Bulgarian officials were meeting the Paris Club this week to discuss arrangements to postpone or reschedule the country's debt. 'We have never discussed the elimination of the debt . . . not even among ourselves.' The Bulgarian authorities fear that any debt forgiveness would remove the incentive needed to push through radical economic reforms. Mr Kostov's comments, in the wings of the inaugural meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, followed a call for debt forgiveness by Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC's representative at the bank. from Mr Christophersen said Bulgaria should be the second east European country after Poland to benefit from debt forgiveness. Poland last month had at least half its debts to foreign governments written off. 'There must be a debt relief agreement for Bulgaria. Without this, it will be impossible for that country to get out of its difficulties,' he said. While Poland owes about Dollars 30bn to Paris Club governments, Bulgaria's total foreign debt is Dollars 11bn, about Dollars 2bn of which is owed to governments. The issue is controversial. Japanese finance ministry officials have said that the Dollars 500m loan promised to Poland by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has been blocked following Poland's deal with the Paris Club. A senior US Treasury official said yesterday that such a halt would be 'unacceptable', although the chief loser would be Japan, which would have 'demonstrated its inability to respond to questions of world leadership on financial issues.' He added, however, that the US government had no direct knowledge that the loan had been blocked. It had not been discussed at a meeting between Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, and Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's finance minister, last weekend. Mr Victor Geraschenko, head of the Soviet Union's central bank, called yesterday for an early lifting of restrictions imposed on EBRD lending to his country. Greater assistance from the bank and other western financial institutions would stem the disintegration of the Soviet Union. In particular, he hoped that a clause that the total volume of all credits and other services received from the EBRD during the first three years should not exceed (the Soviet Union's) paid in capital 'would be eliminated in the near future.'</p>

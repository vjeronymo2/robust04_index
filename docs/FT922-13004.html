			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Dinkie Heel strides out in second half Trading at Dinkie Heel - which makes shoe heels, toe-caps and Stick-a-Soles  -improved in the second half to leave an 11 per cent overall drop in pre-tax profit to Pounds 259,000 for 1991. The figure was struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 51,000 relating to the sale of theloss-making Enterprise Group wholesale business, and interest paid of Pounds 107,000 (Pounds 128,000). Profit was almost halved in the opening period but Mr David Parkes, chairman, said the improvement in orders and profits noted in his interim statement was sustained, and margins increased. Turnover fell to Pounds 7.29m (Pounds 7.93m) mainly because of the Enterprise disposal. Earnings per share in 1991 came to 1.82p (1.6p) after substantially reduced tax provision. The final dividend is maintained at 0.6p for a same-again total of 0.95p.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: House of Fraser The Fayed brothers will not be the only ones to be slightly disappointed by the 180p price tag which was eventually hung on the House of Fraser group. Earlier soundings suggested that the group might go for more than Pounds 2.00 a share, and the lead manager, SG Warburg, limited the public offer to 25 per cent of the shares. If the bank believed that pre-marketing to institutions would control the float better and encourage a higher price, it has been proved wrong. Institutions could see House of Fraser coming. The Fayeds were known to have explored other options and the market thus seemed disinclined to pay up for a property which had not been placed elsewhere. Even the 25 per cent publicly offered could have been clawed back by institutions, so there was little incentive to chase the shares. Arguably a better tactic would have been to market the issue more heavily at private investors, who are keen on businesses they know and can understand. More limited allocations to institutions might have caused a little hunger and, potentially, a higher price. It may be argued that in volatile conditions the issue had to be priced cautiously, but the 26.2 point rise in the FT-SE 100 this week hardly constitutes a bear market. Still, the silver lining is that at 180p House of Fraser should be a lot more attractive to individuals. Both Warburg and the Stock Exchange may be embarrassed if the issue is now heavily oversubscribed.</p>

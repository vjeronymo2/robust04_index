			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Science research unit for RHS The Royal Horticultural Society, best known for its flower shows and gardens, is to form a substantial scientific research department. The RHS has appointed its first chief scientist, Sarah Ball, and plans to build a new Centre of Horticultural Science at its main garden, Wisley, in Surrey. Ball, a plant pathologist, wants to re-establish the worldwide scientific reputation that the RHS enjoyed in the 1920s and 30s. By the early 1990s it was devoting only 3 per cent of its income to science. The long-term plan is to increase that to about 10 per cent - giving Ball a budget of more than Pounds 1m a year. RHS scientists will focus on issues of particular interest to non-commercial gardeners. RHS Wisley: UK, 0483 224234.</p>

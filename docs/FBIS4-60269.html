			<p>BFN     [Text] Here are some Palestinian reactions to Rabin's  demand that Yasir 'Arafat reaffirm in writing his commitment to  the peace process.    Palestinian Council Member Furayh Abu-Middayn says that  crises were expected to crop up in the course of the  negotiations, but if Israel seeks to limit the autonomy to the  Gaza boundaries, it should say so candidly, rather than continue  to come up with new pretexts.    Sa'ib 'Urayqat said the real danger to the peace process  does  not lie in Yasir 'Arafat's remarks, but rather in Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin's actions.    Jamil al-Tarifi, head of the Supreme Civilian Coordination  Committee, told Qol Yisra'el correspondent Mark Weiss that  Israel has posed preconditions for the resumption of  negotiations that the PLO repudiates.</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Columbia Pictures and Warner Bros. announced Wednesday that they will build and  jointly operate a 14,000-square-foot child care center on their shared studio  lot. Construction is scheduled to begin in early summer, with opening  tentatively set for next spring. The center will accommodate up to 90 children  (45 from each company) in three age groups: infants, toddlers and preschool.  Executives for the two companies said the center represents "an ideal situation  for working parents who will have an opportunity to make quality daytime  visits, and who can work productively with the confidence that their children  are being well cared for nearby. This program is essential in today's working  world, with an increasing number of women balancing career and family. We  believe it will also benefit our companies in attracting and retaining the best  employees in all areas of our operations." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

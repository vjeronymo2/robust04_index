			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: News in Brief Two new offshore funds have been added to the range offered without initial charges through US broker Schwab's International FundSource Service, which was launched two months ago. The two latest additions are the Guinness Flight Global Strategy Fund, a managed currency distribution fund, and Guinness Flight International Accumulation, a managed currency accumulation fund. Investors can now buy into more than 50 offshore funds without the usual initial charge of about 5 per cent. Annual management charges are still payable. The minimum investment is Dollars 2,000 per fund and Dollars 1,000 for subsequent investments. For details call 0800-526027                     *         *        * Artscope, the specialist fine art insurance broker, has launched a high-tech system to store images of art works and help track them down if they are stolen. The system, known as Artist (Artscope Imaging and Storage Technology), captures images of paintings and antiques on site and stores them digitally on a secure computer, from where they can be transferred instantly to police, antique dealers and auction houses if a theft occurs. The service is available free to qualifying Artscope clients. More details from 0252-544000.                     *         *        * Foster &amp; Braithwaite is offering a 1 percentage point off the initial charge on its two unit trusts which invest in investment trusts. According to Micropal, the F&amp;B High Income Investment Trust fund is ranked second (out of 12 funds) in its sector over the year to November 1 and the F&amp;B Investment Trust fund is third over the same period. The normal initial charge on the F&amp;B funds is 5.5 per cent and the annual charge 1.25 per cent.                     *         *        * Capital Ventures, the Cheltenham-based financial services company, has launched an enterprise zone trust to buy a retail unit in phase 2 of the Parkgate, Rotherham development which is let to Focus DIY on a 25-year lease. The initial yield after expenses on the scheme, which is called Cert XVII, will be about 6.7 per cent on the gross investment, according to Capital Ventures, which estimates that this equates to a return of 10.5 per cent to a top rate taxpayer. The deadline for subscription both to this EZT and Cert XVI, which will build retail units at Flint in North Wales, is December 24. Capital Ventures is hoping that investors in its Cert I EZT launched in 1987 will use their capital distribution from the investment to reinvest in Cert XVII and is offering them priority rights until November 30.                     *         *        * Alliance &amp; Leicester building society has reduced the rate on its two-year fixed rate mortgage from 6.25 per cent to 5.95 per cent because of increasing competition in the market. There is an arrangement fee of 0.5 per cent of the loan, up to a maximum of Pounds 300. This is one of a number of fixed rates available from one to five years from the society. All are portable and available on repayment, endowment and pension-linked mortgages.</p>

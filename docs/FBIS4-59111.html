			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Talhah Jibril: "Libyan-Tunisian Relations </F> Experiencing Silent Crisis"]    [Excerpts] Rabat -- AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that  Tunisian-Libyan relations are currently experiencing a silent  crisis following the Tunisian authorities' arrest of two Libyans  belonging to the Islamic Call Organization [munazzamat al-da'wah  al-islamiyah] [ICO], a Libyan government organization headed by  Dr. Muhammad al-Sharif. Sources say that the two Libyans  intended to offer financial assistance to some members of the  outlawed Ennahda movement in Tunisia.    Libyans arriving from Tunisia say that the Tunisian  authorities have begun to subject Libyans traveling across  Tunisian territory to thorough search measures, and that some  Libyan travelers are forced to stand for many hours at  checkpoints on the border between the two countries. [passage  omitted]    Well-informed sources say that the ICO, whose headquarters  is  in Tripoli, is linked to a Libyan organ. The organization,  which publishes THE JIHAD magazine, performed several activities  in Africa, especially in west African states, under the cover of  Islamic preaching. The organization owns several facilities and  buildings in Libya.    This is not the first time Tunisian-Libyan relations have  experienced coolness as a result of the links between the ICO  and the outlawed Ennahda movement. Dr. al-Sharif, who is in  charge of the organization, intervened with Tunisia as Colonel  Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's envoy to secure the release of some  Ennahda and ICO prisoners.    After the embargo was imposed on Libya, the organization's  name was changed to the Call College [kulliyat al-da'wah], but  its activities have continued in the same manner. [passage  omitted]</p>

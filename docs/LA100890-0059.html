			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GALLEGLY'S FLYERS TAKE SOME FLAK;  </P> <P> FRANKING: THE DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER SAYS MAILERS ARE A WASTE OF MONEY. A  SPOKESMAN REPLIES THAT THE INCUMBENT HAS SUPPORTED REFORMS.  </P> <P> The Democrat challenging Rep. Elton Gallegly accused the incumbent of using  taxpayer-supported mailers to strengthen his 1990 reelection campaign and of  being among the biggest spenders in the House of Representatives on newsletters  to constituents.  </P> <P> Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) spent $185,179 on mass mailings in 1989, which ranked  him fifth among California's 44 House members in 1989, a new study by a  national taxpayers group says.  </P> <P> Richard D. Freiman, an Agoura attorney and TV writer opposing Gallegly in the  November election, said the incumbent's reported spending on five mass mailings  in 1989 was a waste of money.  </P> <P> "These are puff pieces for Gallegly," he said. "Most people throw them out  because they don't have any information that is important or necessary in  them."  </P> <P> Controversy surrounding the franking privilege, under which Congress spent more  than $100 million last year on mailings, led to extensive reform in the U.S.  Senate in 1989 and to less extensive restrictions in the House of  Representatives.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the congressman said Gallegly supported those reforms, voting  to reduce the number of mass mailings by House members from six to three a year  beginning in 1990.  </P> <P> Gallegly also voted to limit the mail privilege -- a popular congressional  benefit since 1793 -- even though he remains convinced that the newsletters are  useful tools in communicating with constituents, his spokesman said.  </P> <P> "The congressman believes it's an important way of keeping in touch with the  district," said John Frith, Gallegly's press secretary.  </P> <P> Frith said surveys have shown repeatedly that district residents like the  newsletters and want them to continue. He said, however, that only about 10% to  15% of households in the district respond to such surveys.  </P> <P> Gallegly's 21st Congressional District includes parts of western and northern  Los Angeles County and southern and central Ventura County. The cost of his  mass mailings was reported late last month by the National Taxpayers Union, a  200,000-member nonprofit group that lobbies for reduced government spending.  </P> <P> Bill Pierce, spokesman for the group, said the study shows that the average  expense by a congressman on newsletters in 1989 was 31 cents per household. By  comparison, Gallegly spent 71 cents for each household in his district, Pierce  said.  </P> <P> Pierce said the figures in his group's study are not precise because the exact  spending of House members on mass mailings are confidential. But most,  including Gallegly, confirmed the number of mailings from their offices. A  minimum figure was derived from that.  </P></p>

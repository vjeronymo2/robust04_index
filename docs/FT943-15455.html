			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Plans to liberalise farm trade face obstacles Last year's agreement in the Uruguay Round world trade deal to liberalise farm trade by phasing out all non-tariff measures (NTMs) may prove impossible to implement fully, according to a study. The study, by two University of Minnesota economists, says that, if anything, pressures to impose further NTMs are likely to grow in the next few years because of faster innovation in food products and national environmental regulations. 'One cannot escape the conclusion that all that can be achieved is a reduction in some of the existing measures and a framework for future negotiations of the others. The implication. . . is that non-tariff measures are here to stay,' it says. The study also says the complex way in which NTMs are applied in farm trade poses serious practical difficulties for the Uruguay Round plan to convert them into tariffs, which would be eliminated over several years. The biggest problem is that several commodity groups, such as fruit and vegetables, carry a large number of NTMs, for each of which equivalent tariffs are not easy to calculate. The study finds that Norway, the US, Austria and Canada impose a wider range of NTMs on trade in agricultural products than any other western industrialised countries. It adds that although this does not mean these countries necessarily have the most protected markets, the greater the diversity of NTMs the more likely they are to restrict trade. Canada topped the list of countries with the most agricultural NTMs, totalling 1,464. That was more than twice the number in Sweden, the second-ranking country, and compared with only three in Ireland, with the least NTMs of those countries surveyed. The study, based on an analysis of an Unctad database, finds that almost half the farm trade measures imposed by western countries are quantity restrictions, a third are technical regulations and stand-ards, and a fifth are tariffs and other financial measures.

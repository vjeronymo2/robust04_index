			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Arts: Tosca - Covent Garden The years pass but the voice does not change. It is difficult to believe that it will soon be 30 years since Luciano Pavarotti made his Covent Garden debut: the beauty and clarity of this tenor voice remain undimmed, as does the musicianship of its owner, however dazzling the spotlight of media attention that is shone on his every appearance these days. This revival of Tosca opened the Royal Opera's 1992/93 season. From time to time the company's still handsome production is asked to recapture the dramatic integrity it had in 1964, when it was new. More often it is merely a showcase for a star, as here. Pavarotti sang in Tosca back in 1977, when memory recalls the opera caught fire as drama. This time it did not, although that should not necessarily be taken as the tenor's fault. In the music of Cavaradossi, Pavarotti sings to the manner born. There is no way that a ringing Italianate tenor sound can be taught. Either it is there by nature or it is not, though Pavarotti has told of the exercises he practised as a student to make his vowel sounds so astonishingly clear. There was perhaps more steel to the tone than usual on Saturday. The phrases in the Act 3 aria where a singer can caress the music remained loud and tightly-controlled. Otherwise the role was most eloquently sung. The vocal personality gives his Cavaradossi a touch of class, even if the rest of the character is only sketched in. During the lovers' playful banter in the opening scenes, Pavarotti sat at his easel, continuing to dab at his painting with a cheeky grin, while his Tosca, with no more concern for dramatic credibility, addressed the audience and hardly gave him a cursory nod. As far as she went, Elizabeth Holleque made a workable Tosca. In this company, however, the voice lacked glamour and power. Playing a prima donna, not least in the production created for Callas, demands a singer ready to stamp her personality on the role to a degree this young American artist, for all her virtues, was not. She entered the lion's den in the Farnese Palace looking as though she would be swallowed pretty quickly. An understandable reaction, perhaps, as Silvano Carroli was playing a voracious Scarpia, his eyes rolling, the power clearly gone to his head. There was coarseness in plenty here, as the voice sounded rough and he shouts too often. But Carroli can utter Italian words in a way that sends shivers of menace down the spine. The small roles were mostly taken by well-known faces, including Eric Garrett's Sacristan, the original from 1964. In the pit Zubin Mehta obtained the gorgeously lush sounds from the orchestra that he has always found for Puccini in this theatre, although the price was some self-indulgent wallowing at times. On balance a lesser conductor with a good grasp of the Italian style would probably be preferable. Despite signs that the Royal Opera had other ambitions, this was a star's evening. What Pavarotti was achieving in vocal terms was well ahead of anything else that was going on.</p>

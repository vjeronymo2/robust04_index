			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: THE BIG THAW: WILL WE MISS COLD WAR?;  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: CONTINUED NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION IS THE MOST PROBABLE SCENARIO FOR  LASTING GEOPOLITICAL PEACE, SAYS ATLANTIC MONTHLY'S PESSIMISTIC COVER STORY.  </P> <P> John Mearsheimer did not predict the invasion of Kuwait. But his cover story in  the August Atlantic Monthly -- "Why We Will Soon Miss the Cold War" -- does  resonate with the rumbling of tanks.  </P> <P> And although his fairly intricate thesis focuses exclusively on Europe, readers  who were already beginning to luxuriate in the soothing calm of a relatively  stress-free Western world will probably give his ideas a more sober reading  after being so rudely awakened by the Iraqis.  </P> <P> The years between 1648 and 1945, Mearsheimer points out, were racked by one war  after another. The Cold War caused the bellicose Europeans to chill out. Now  it's only a matter of time before tempers once again flare and bullets -- if  not larger and more dangerous projectiles -- fly, Mearsheimer predicts.  </P> <P> The "bipolar" standoff between the equally matched Soviets and Yanks, along  with worldwide horror at the thought of using nuclear weapons, is what kept the  nations of Europe from engaging in the sort of behavior that resulted in the  killing of about 50 million Europeans between 1900 and 1945, he writes. Now  those deterrents are evaporating, and "Europe is reverting to a state system  that created powerful incentives for aggression in the past."  </P> <P> Mearsheimer, chairman of the political science department at the University of  Chicago, sees three possible scenarios for post-Cold War Europe.  </P> <P> First is the "Europe without nuclear weapons" scenario. But because of the  potential for nations like Germany to return to "hypernationalism," Mearsheimer  is relieved that this "most dangerous among the envisionable post-Cold War  orders . . . does not appear to be in the cards."  </P> <P> Second is "The Current Ownership" scenario, in which the nuclear powers in  Europe maintain their weaponry but no new nuclear powers emerge. But this isn't  going to happen either, he believes.  </P> <P> Third, and most probable, is the "Nuclear Proliferation" scenario. This is the  one in which he sees the most hope for stability, arguing, "Mismanaged  proliferation could produce disaster (but) well-managed proliferation could  produce an order nearly as stable as that of the Long Peace" (John Lewis  Gaddis' term for the Cold War).  </P> <P> Even here, though, he doesn't see much hope that proliferation will be anything  less than pell-mell.  </P> <P> So, without a trace of irony, he contends that the West has "an interest in  continuing the Cold War confrontation."  </P> <P> Alas, not even that seems likely to Mearsheimer. So, according to his gloomy  world view, there's little to do but watch the bodies begin piling up in some  corner of illusorily peaceful Europe.  </P> <P> With luck, a chorus of informed political soothsayers will soon begin to shout  out logical and well-supported analyses explaining that Mearsheimer's  pessimistic world view is cockeyed. Meanwhile, it seems likely that Francis  Fukuyama, author of last year's much-discussed "End of History" (Remember? The  one that predicts a quick end to international squabbling) is probably reading  the August Atlantic -- and the headlines -- and scratching his head.  </P> <P> </P> <P> REQUIRED READING  </P> <P> What does the issue of gun control have to do with the black community? Plenty,  according to a powerful article in the September issue of the African-American  publication Emerge -- "Our Voice in the World." "Every year more than 85,000  African-Americans know the terrifying sensation of a bullet entering their  bodies," write authors Roberto Santiago and Walter Lowe Jr. Nearly 10,000 of  those victims die. "Yet, in the African-American community, there has never  been the degree of support for stricter gun control laws that might be  expected." This passionate but balanced essay argues that it's time for black  America to confront the gun issue.  </P> <P> * Assemblyman Richard Katz's plan to turn the Los Angeles River into a freeway  receives yet another setback in the August Los Angeles Magazine. In a piece  titled "Mark Twain!," author Neil Cohen takes a long look at the river and  finds that the infamous concrete ditch is -- at least in places -- beautiful.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Magazine accents its appreciation of the river with color  photography, and hard though it may be to believe, some of the pictures portray  scenes so bucolic and tranquil they would fit in on a Sierra Club nature  calendar.  </P> <P> * ". . . Above all, our society needs to stop thinking of drug abuse as a moral  and legal question and begin to treat it instead as a public health problem,"  Abdelmonem A. Afifi, dean of UCLA's School of Public Health, writes in the  summer issue of UCLA Magazine, the school's alumni publication. What follows  his introduction is a rounded and well-written, if too basic, primer by  students and faculty members on "Drugs in America."  </P> <P> * The 1939 New York World's Fair was a $155-million fanfare to the future, a  celebration to announce the coming "Age of Consumerism." General Motor's  Futurama showed 28,000 people a day what the '60s would hold, including $200  cars that would move by radio control on seven-lane highways. "In the future,"  the narrator promised, "cars will be air conditioned." Featured in the  September issue of Joe Franklin's Nostalgia, the World's Fair story offers an  enlightening look back at the future, complete with dozens of great photos,  including a heroic sculpture dedicated to "Asbestos -- the magic mineral."  </P></p>

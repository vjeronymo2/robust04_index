			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Govett Oriental assets rise Surging Pacific stock markets during 1993 led to a 52 per cent rise in net asset value per share at Govett Oriental Investment Trust over the year to March 31, writes Bethan Hutton. The figure grew from 262.07p to 397.63p, but more than half of that rise was achieved by the interim stage. Falls in most Asian markets since the start of 1994 have limited second half growth. Available revenue was Pounds 2.34m (Pounds 2.54m), for consolidated earnings of 1.3p (1.41p) per share. A proposed final dividend of 0.75p makes a 1.15p (0.95p) total. As at end-March, 31.8 per cent of the trust's assets were in Japan, compared to 25 per cent six months earlier.</p>

This is indicated both by the negative  radiation balance (the difference between sun's radiation and  the earth's surface and the atmosphere's own radiation) and the  negative values of the average air temperature measured over  many years on the greater part of the European territory of  Russia and West and East Siberia.    However, as compared to February, in March the temperature  begins to rise quickly. Therefore, on the entire territory of  Russia (with the exception of the shores of Arctic seas) March  is four to 12 degrees warmer than February.    March's weather characteristics on the territory of the  former USSR vary. While in Central Asia and the Transcaucasus  orchards are already in bloom in March and seedlings appear in  the fields, in the middle belt of European Russia the first  thawed patches appear in the fields. At the same time, in the  northern part of the territory, Siberia, and the northern part  of Kazakhstan winter still reigns supreme, with bitter cold and  blizzards.

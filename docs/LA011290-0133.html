			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESSLAND INC. TO CUT 200 JOBS IN RESTRUCTURING  </P> <P> Businessland Inc., a personal computer retailer, announced plans Thursday to  cut about 200 jobs in a restructuring.  </P> <P> Businessland said it would make a one-time staff reduction of 5% to 7% of its  3,900 worldwide work force, meaning a loss of from 195 to 273 jobs.  </P> <P> The company said the cuts were due to recent acquisitions and streamlining  through a multimillion-dollar investment in automating information systems and  field distribution.  </P> <P> Businessland, which resells personal computers and workstations to a mostly  corporate market, did not indicate where the jobs would be eliminated.  </P> <P> The San Jose-based company, which reported soft sales in its first quarter  ended last Sept. 30, said the restructuring is targeted to take advantage of  cost savings from new management information systems and ongoing consolidation  of distribution operations.  </P> <P> Businessland, founded in 1982, reported sales last year of $1.2 billion. The  company said sales growth remains strong, with revenue estimated at more than  $370 million for the second quarter ended Dec. 31.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> FORGET NASHVILLE; DESERT ROSE MAY BE COUNTRY BAND OF '90S  </P> <P> As much as Nashville is the home of country music, it may be just as remarkable  for the prodigal sons it has cast out. From the Bakersfield crowd through the  outlaw and new traditionalist movements, the city's music establishment has  been slow to welcome any new vitality in the music, and there may be no one  more familiar with that slowness than Desert Rose Band singer Chris Hillman.  </P> <P> After an incandescent new song, "Another Lifetime," during the band's late show  Monday at Santa Ana's Crazy Horse Steak House, did Hillman sound just a bit  bitter as he shouted: "That's not country music! You can't play that music in  Nashville!"?  </P> <P> Sure, Music City's Country Music Assn. finally got around to nominating the  Desert Rose Band in three categories this year, but it has only been about 21  years since Hillman and his fellow Byrds first kicked on Nashville's door with  the seminal country-rock album "Sweetheart of the Rodeo."  </P> <P> Perhaps to drive a point home, the band followed Hillman's outburst Monday with  three Bluegrass-tinged numbers -- including its own "Time Between" and the  Osborne Bros.' "Once More" -- that were about as country as you can get without  worrying about deer-tick Lyme disease.  </P> <P> With Hillman and guitarists Herb Pedersen and John Jorgenson erecting flawless  three-part harmonies, and Jorgenson and steel guitarist Jay Dee Maness trading  devilishly fast, song-hugging breaks, the group clearly didn't need any outside  ratification to know it is onto a good thing.  </P> <P> Indeed, the Crazy Horse show, particularly the several new songs from an  upcoming album, suggested the 4-year-old group (rounded out by bassist Bill  Bryson and drummer Steve Duncan) is shifting into a higher gear. Although  always possessed of remarkable vocal and musical prowess, the band's live shows  haven't always connected on an emotional level. Monday, though, they  practically burned the floorboards out from under them with a 22-song set that  drew two deafening encore calls.  </P> <P> Even Hillman, whose clear tenor vocals previously seemed to want for the  consuming passion or charismatic flaws that so marked the singing of his Byrds  and Burrito Brothers partner Gram Parsons, loosened up and howled a bit on the  encores of the Burritos' "Christine's Tune" and "Sin City."  </P> <P> The band ranged through a variety of styles, from the Bluegrass tunes to  Pedersen's version of Buck Owens' "Hello Trouble" to a Louvin Bros. country  shuffle to Dylan's "You Ain't Going Nowhere."  </P> <P> If there is a signature sound to the Desert Rose Band, it is in the tasteful  inclusion of '60s British Invasion touches into their arrangements. Although he  can twang with the best of them (using an ultra-twangy six-string bass on some  songs), Orange County-bred guitarist Jorgenson also added chiming 12-string  guitar parts to "One Step Forward" and "Summer Wind" and the unique British Vox  vibrato sound to "I Still Believe in You," which also featured a moving ballad  vocal from Hillman.  </P> <P> Songs from the new LP (due in January) included the driving, anti-drug  "Darkness on the Playground," the country-pop "The Story of Love" and a  banjo-powered Pedersen tune, "Fooled Again." Combined with the group's  considerable legacy -- stretching back through Hillman's pioneering '60s work,  Maness' stint with Buck Owens, and vocal arranger Pedersen's work with Emmylou  Harris and others -- the Desert Rose Band may just become the country group of  the '90s.  </P></p>

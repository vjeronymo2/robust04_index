			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Letter: Federation not a front-runner Sir, Reading your article 'Germans urge rethink of European Union' (June 25), I was struck by the statement that Germany's industrial federation (BDI) has traditionally been one of the most enthusiastic supporters of EMU among Europe's employers' organisations. In my view, BDI never was a front-runner in EC matters, nor were German trade unions. It took several years before they mentally endorsed the success of the EMS. When BDI quotes that 'the speed of integration has been too fast', I wonder what kind of integration they are after. Is dismantling 280 trade fences installed on nationalistic subsidiarity level, for instance, already a bridge too far? How many bureaucrats were maintaining these obstacles?

Democratic Alliance chiefs were amongst those of eight  parties which recently announced the formation of the  Progressive cartel, but the loose grouping of left-wing  intellectuals withdrew its support shortly after, in protest  over positions struck by the Progressives.    Today's decision to return to the fold came after assurances  from the other parties in the cartel, which is dominated by the  Left Democrat Party, that the Progressives would continue with  the economic recovery programme set in motion by current Premier  Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.    Also important were guarantees from the Left Democrats on  elements in the cartel's programme, and on candidate selection.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Corresponding </F> Member Anatoliy Shpak, academy chief scientific secretary, by  Dmitriy Kiyanskiy; place and date of interview not given: ``What  is Happening With the Academy? For the Government's Information:  If the Most Urgent Steps Aren't Taken, Serious Science May Soon  be Nonexistent in Ukraine'']    [Text] Two doctors of sciences complaining of general  weakness, fast tiring and noise in their ears visited the Kiev  hospital servicing scientists almost simultaneously. An  examination revealed that both of the elderly gentlemen were  suffering from anemia with, of all things, chronic  undernourishment as the cause.    Recently I needed an old friend in an urgent matter--a  division director in a certain academy institute. I phoned him  at work, but there was no answer. An hour later, the same  result. When I dialed his home, I heard the voice of my friend.    ``What's the matter,'' I asked, ``you sick?''    ``No,'' he said. ``Luckily I'm healthy, but like with all of  my colleagues I'm now working as a scientist at home. The  institute building isn't heated, and we were let out until  spring.''    Here's another fact. It was reported in the Presidium of the  Ukrainian Academy of Sciences that the issue of reorganizing a  number of scientific research institutes in connection with  their inability to work under the new conditions is now on the  agenda.    Yes, something isn't right in the kingdom of science. And  judging from everything, the disease won't be cured with mustard  plasters, berry tea, and lime blossoms. Medicines of higher  efficacy are needed.    What is happening with the Academy of Sciences, which just  recently stood on one of the top rungs of the social  hierarchical ladder? Can something really be jeopardizing the  existence of such a mighty and reliable structure? A PRAVDA  UKRAINY correspondent discusses these questions with ANU  [Ukrainian Academy of Sciences] Corresponding Member Anatoliy  Shpak, the academy's chief scientific secretary.    Kiyanskiy: What adjustments has the current energy  crisis made in the activity of ANU institutions? After all,  while historians, economists, philologists or theoretical  physicists could work a few months at home when their institutes  run out of money for heating, such a routine is not suited to  experimental physicists, chemists, materials scientists, and  representatives of many other scientific disciplines.    Shpak: To our great regret scientists in the  humanities aren't the only ones who have to work at home. Our  institutions are hundreds of millions of rubles in debt for heat  and electric power, and a large number of scientific research  institutes in the technical and natural sciences must switch to  such a strange work routine, encountered nowhere else in the  world. Thus, the temperature in the laboratories and offices of  the institutes of colloidal chemistry and water chemistry,  microbiology and virology, and molecular biology and genetics  has been reduced to plus five degrees Celsius, and the  scientists are forced to work at home. I'm afraid that such a  ``routine'' will last until May-June.    One extremely typical example could be cited here. The  allotment of electricity to the Institute imeni Paton was  reduced by a fourth. Strange, isn't it? Electric welding without  electric power! Even our children are affected by the economic  woes. Academy day care centers have closed down for a month (and  perhaps more!): There's no money to keep them going.    Kiyanskiy: So what happened? Why has science  transformed so quickly into a Cinderella? For what reason has it  been put on starvation rations? Have the government bigwigs  really decided to rectify the country's catastrophic financial  situation at the expense of scientists, as if it's impossible to  find any other means of avoiding economic ruin?    Shpak: That seems to be the case. Judge for  yourself: Current financing, and all the more so the prospects  for this entire year, are totally inadequate to even our most  minimal needs. This pertains chiefly to fundamental research,  without which the existence of civilized society is altogether  impossible. And all the more so in a country that only recently  embarked upon the path of independence.    As of today the state owes the academy 40 billion  karbovantsy, and this is with regard for the sharply higher  prices of fuel. The institutes are presently spending a third of  their allocated funds on wages, while practically all the rest  goes to energy resources. Our institutions spend hardly any  money to obtain modern scientific equipment. And without it,  it's altogether impossible to obtain results of any value. What  are we here for, if not for that?    Recently Ukrainian scientists have been unable to maintain  contacts with their own colleagues in the far and near frontier.  There's no money for business trips. But why even talk about  foreign countries!? It's a problem today just to travel to  another city in Ukraine for a conference. The institutes have  stopped subscribing to foreign scientific periodicals. And  everyone knows, after all, that an information vacuum is  contraindicated to science.    I know that the fuel situation in Ukraine is totally  stressed, but economization and the economy are two different  things. To deprive the academy of the needed minimum of energy  resources actually means sapping the life blood of entire  directions. The research equipment of the leading scientific  centers consumes a rather large amount of energy--you can't do  anything about that. Consider just the Institute of Nuclear  Research. This is a huge complex of unique devices for  experimentation in physics, including a nuclear reactor and  accelerators. Two-thirds of the academy's associates work in  such energy-intensive scientific institutions. It is precisely  in such institutes that the country's intellectual potential is  created.    Kiyanskiy: Just 5 years ago the wages of  scientists evoked the unconcealed envy of all other Soviet  workers. A doctor of science in charge of a division or a  laboratory received 500 rubles, and felt himself to be extremely  well-off. How much are scientific workers paid today?    Shpak: Before 1 December of last year a doctor of  sciences received from 220,000 to 290,000 karbovantsy, a  candidate of sciences received an average of not more than  200,000, and a scientific research institute director (as a rule  a prominent scientist and a member of the academy) received  370,000 karbovantsy--almost as much as a taxi driver earned. An  academician was paid a little more for his high scientific  title--10,000 coupons, while a corresponding member was paid  5,000. This amount was enough for one and a half chicken eggs.    The pay of scientists was tripled in December, but this is  on  the average. In general, to be honest, pay is different in  different scientific institutions: No special subsidies were  allocated to the academy. The institutes are facing a dilemma:  pay for building space, or increase wages. Many are trying to  find the golden mean. As a result it comes both hot and cold for  them, as they say. Such that now even a yardman doesn't envy a  doctor of sciences.    Some of my acquaintances--people with academic degrees and  the highest qualifications--are forced to become taxi drivers  for several hours in the morning before work and in the  evenings, using their own cars. What choice do they have? Life  is making them do it! You can't feed a large family today on  scientific activity alone.    I can't help worrying when I look at some of our old  academicians--prominent scientists who devoted the best years of  their lives to science, and who now have to keep a mental tally  of how much they spent today on a carton of milk and a can of  sour cream, and of how many coupons are left over for tomorrow.  The old academician goes to the store, and all he gets is grief:  His paltry pension and academy benefits aren't enough for the  most necessary things.    Need we be amazed that some scientists have decided to leave  the country? Unfortunately the most energetic, promising and  talented are the ones who are leaving: Young people have no  faith in advancement, and in making a career of it in their  homeland, they have no certainty in tomorrow. Even venerable  scientists are now emigrating. Many of our former compatriots  can be found in the West's leading scientific centers, though  unfortunately, not only as professors.    Kiyanskiy: How many scientists has the country  already lost?    Shpak: In the last two and a half years over 300  persons left institutes of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences for  business trips abroad for a period of over 6 months.  Unfortunately one out of every three has not returned. We don't  know what many of the scientists who left will do. The terms of  their business trips aren't up yet. However, more than likely  our institutes will not be seeing some of them anymore.    By the way, ``internal emigration'' is no less dangerous.  Both young academy scientists and middle-aged people are leaving  more frequently for commercial organizations. Science is losing  prestige literally before our eyes.    The Ukrainian Academy of Sciences is certainly experiencing  one of the most difficult periods of its life. The situation in  the institutes is now extremely complex, and to be honest, the  spirits of their colleagues are rather low. It is already clear  today, after all, that a large number of our scientific  institutions will encounter very serious difficulties this year,  and even the question of their very existence will possibly be  raised.    In all probability, representatives of government structures  arguing for ultraeconomical and clearly insufficient financial  support to Ukrainian science believe that in the extreme case it  could be mothballed until better times. But can it? Of course it  wouldn't be difficult to literally freeze places like the  institutes of cybernetics or molecular biology and genetics:  Their colleagues work in cold offices anyway. But can you really  freeze cybernetics, molecular biology, and other disciplines  until better times? In 5-8 years they will fall hopelessly  behind, and this will retard the entire state's intellectual  development.</p>

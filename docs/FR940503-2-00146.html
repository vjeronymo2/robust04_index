USIA will consider providing funding up to approximately $200,000, of which $10,000 must be devoted to developing or purchasing specialized support materials for participating African institutions. For technical information, interested organizations may contact E/P Program Specialist Charlotte Peterson at (202) 619&hyph;5319. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Project Objectives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Introduce African participants to the U.S. legal system and the principles on which it is founded, particularly the rule of law and the power of courts to overrule actions of the Executive and Legislative branches, and compare the U.S. legal system with those of the target countries; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Examine the organizational structure and administrative operation of public defender and legal aid organizations in the U.S., and explore how U.S. models might be adapted for use in the target countries; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Explore techniques of alternative dispute resolution and sentencing alternatives such as probation and community service; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Provide a formal training component for the dual purpose of benefiting the individual visiting public defenders and legal aid attorneys, and of enabling them to develop or enhance training programs for colleagues in their home countries; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Discuss the primary constitutional issues affecting criminal cases, including due process, equal protection, rules of evidence, and criminal procedure; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Explore strategies and modalities for challenging governmental actions, including test cases and class action lawsuits; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Promote long-term linkages between African public defenders and legal aid organizations and their counterparts in the U.S. in order to foster dialogue on issues of common concern and to enhance the institutional capabilities of the African organizations; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Develop and/or purchase specialized support materials for participating institutions in each of the target countries. Such materials might include but are not limited to legal reference and research books, training videos, textbooks or other instructional materials. Grant monies of $10,000 must be used for this purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Participants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The African participants will be attorneys active in public defense work and/or legal aid in their countries, or seeking to establish such services. Participants will be nominated through coordination among U.S. Information Service personnel in the target countries, USIA, and the African partner institutions. All participants must have strong English-language skills. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. consultants who will travel to Africa will be selected by the grantee institution in consultation with USIA. The grantee should provide the names of American participants and brief, relevant biographical data. American participants should be selected on the basis of their experience and expertise in the thematic field. Experience in communicating to foreign audiences and general knowledge of Africa and of the countries involved in the project are highly desirable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Program Structure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following suggestions should not serve as a blueprint, but as a stimulus for the development of an original program design. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Phase One:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The program could begin with a 3&hyph;4 week U.S. study tour for approximately 12 attorneys representing public defense and legal aid services in the target countries. The study tour should allow the African lawyers to visit several regions of the U.S. and should include cultural activities as well as the following professional components: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _An initial orientation to the U.S. legal system and the constitution on which it is founded; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _A series of field visits to familiarize the visiting lawyers with the operations of courts and other legal institutions such as bar associations, law schools, and legal training facilities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Field visits and consultations with NGOs wholly or partly dedicated to legal aid, including organizations focused on civil rights, consumer protection and public interest issues such as the environment; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

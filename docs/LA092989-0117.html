			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HAWTHORNE POSTPONES VOTE ON HANGAR FEES TO REVIEW ISSUE  </P> <P> The Hawthorne City Council has delayed a vote to repeal increases in hangar  fees at its municipal airport while it studies what improvements are needed  there.  </P> <P> Airport officials want a number of improvements made. But Monday, council  members heard from local pilots, some of whom said the improvements were not  necessary. Pilot Bruce Traub, for example, said the extensive improvements  sought by airport officials constitute a way for the city to justify its  increase in monthly hangar rent.  </P> <P> Hangar fees at the airport, which had been raised in July to $210 a month, last  month were raised again, to $280.  </P> <P> The council asked city officials to provide exact comparisons in hangar rents  at surrounding airports. Council members complained that they have received  different figures from the city and from the pilots and that some of the  figures were estimates and not exact fee schedules.  </P> <P> The council voted for the increases in August, and in September airport  officials sent a letter to City Manager Kenneth Jue listing needed hangar  improvements, including roof repairs, upgrading of drainage, and additional  electrical wiring and restrooms.  </P> <P> The 160-member Hawthorne Aircraft and Pilots Assn. has criticized the increase,  maintaining that it violates an agreement the city made with the pilots in 1985  to raise fees gradually from $125 a month to $200 over a four-year period and  then tie future increases to the consumer price index. The four-year period  ended in July, and the index increased the fee to $210.  </P> <P> The increase in hangar rent was included in a package of other increases in  municipal fees designed to reduce the city's $2.5-million budget deficit.  </P> <P> The new municipal fees would raise $800,000 annually, with $50,000 coming from  the new hangar rental fees, according to city officials.  </P></p>

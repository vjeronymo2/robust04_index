			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: COLTS SIGN GEORGE FOR $15 MILLION  </P> <P> The Indianapolis Colts signed Jeff George to a six-year, $15-million contract  that will make the Illinois quarterback the highest-paid rookie in NFL history  and put him among the four highest-paid players in the NFL.  </P> <P> Among current players, George's package would rank below only those of  Buffalo's Jim Kelly and Philadelphia's Randall Cunningham.  </P> <P> It is equal to the contract of Cleveland's Bernie Kosar.  </P> <P> George's contract surpasses the six-year, $11-million deal that quarterback  Troy Aikman signed with the Dallas Cowboys last year.  </P> <P> "It's what I've always dreamed of doing, and here I am," George said when he  arrived at Colt headquarters Friday. "I am very excited about it."  </P> <P> George, an Indianapolis native, played one year at Purdue but transferred to  Miami after Coach Leon Burtnett was fired. He never played for the Hurricanes  and left for Illinois the next year. George, who passed up his senior year of  eligibility to enter the draft, completed 262 of 423 passes for 2,932 yards and  22 touchdowns at Illinois last season.  </P> <P> Agent Leigh Steinberg, who also negotiated Aikman's contract, and Colt General  Manager Jim Irsay bargained until 5:30 a.m. Friday at an all-night restaurant,  Steinberg said.  </P> <P> The agreement was the only obstacle to a trade by which the Colts sent Pro Bowl  tackle Chris Hinton, wide receiver Andre Rison and two draft choices to Atlanta  for the first pick in Sunday's draft. The Colts, who also received the Falcons'  fourth-round pick this year, had imposed a Friday deadline on signing George,  or the deal would have been off.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: VIDEO NEWS  </P> <P> New Releases  </P> <P> Movies  </P> <P> Play ball! No, it's not the beginning of the baseball season yet, but it is the  start of the big-release video season, and leading off this week's lineup is  one of the best baseball movies ever made, "Bull Durham" (Orion, $89.98, R).  </P> <P> Starring Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, "Bull Durham" isn't  just a baseball movie; it's sort of a romantic-metaphysical-sports comedy. And  it's great fun. Sarandon is passionate both about the sport and its players --  notably the two minor-league players played by Costner and Robbins.  </P> <P> Otherwise, it's mainly tough-guy week at the video store: "Die Hard" (CBS/Fox,  $89.98, R) even outscored "Bull Durham" at the box office last year ($78  million to $50 million) with its tense story of a cop (Bruce Willis) vs.  terrorists in a Los Angeles skyscraper. In "The Dead Pool" (Warner, $89.95, R),  it's Dirty Harry (Clint Eastwood) vs. a serial killer. And "The Presidio"  (Paramount, $89.95, R) stars Sean Connery and Mark Harmon in a suspense  thriller (with relationship subplots) about a murder investigation on a  military base.  </P> <P> Anything for more sensitive viewers? Sure. With its exotic setting (India),  quirky characters and lush color, "The River" (Connoisseur, $79.95, 1951) looks  like one of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's films. However, this  curious, English-language, slightly flawed, often moving picture about a girl's  crush on a crippled American soldier was the work of the great French director  Jean Renoir. Connoisseur is also re-releasing three foreign-language films  previously on other video labels -- Renoir's 1937 anti-war classic "The Grand  Illusion" ($59.95), Michelangelo Antonioni's ground-breaking, austere 1960  drama "L'Avventura" ($79.95), and the very slow but haunting 1956 story of a  Japanese soldier's spiritual conversion, "The Burmese Harp" ($79.95), directed  by Kon Ichikawa.  </P> <P> Other Videos  </P> <P> It's a bird, it's a plane, it's . . . no, it's a basketball player in "Michael  Jordan: Come Fly With Me" (CBS/Fox, $19.98). Arguably the sport's best current  pro (and Magic Johnson fans will argue), the slam-jammin' Jordan's career is  documented in this 45-minute tribute. TERRY ATKINSON  </P></p>

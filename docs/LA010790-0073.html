			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI BIRTHING CENTER PLAN WORTHY OF STUDY  </P> <P> A proposal by UCI Medical Center to open an off-site birthing center to relieve  overcrowding in the hospital's maternity unit deserves careful consideration  when state Medi-Cal officials meet with hospital administrators this week to  discuss the issue. Properly planned, such centers have proven successful in  other areas of the nation as an alternative to hospital births. And well-run  birthing centers have one important side benefit: only women who are  pre-screened and found to be low risk are allowed to deliver babies there. It  thus could ensure something sorely needed by many in Orange County: proper  prenatal care. As of now, many indigent women see a doctor for the first time  when they arrive at an emergency room in labor.  </P> <P> But the plan should be carefully scrutinized by medical specialists and  advocates for the poor to make sure it never becomes a dumping ground for  indigent women or further drives the medical system into a two-tier system for  the poor and the wealthy.  </P> <P> Currently, Medi-Cal reimbursement rates for privately run birthing centers fall  short of what is needed. But there is great interest in Sacramento in UC  Irvine's proposal, which would establish the first such publicly funded center  in California. Estimates are that births at such centers may cost half as much  as those in hospitals because of shorter stays by patients and because the  centers are usually staffed by midwives instead of doctors. UCIMC is also  asking Orange County to earmark up to $2 million in new tobacco-tax monies for  the center.  </P> <P> There is no reason why a well-run birthing center should not be an alternative  for women of all economic classes. A study recently published in the New  England Journal of Medicine stated that "few innovations in health service  promise lower cost, greater availability and a higher degree of satisfaction  with a comparable degree of safety" than birthing centers. The study followed  more than 11,000 women at 84 birthing centers. Death rates were similar to  those of low-risk hospital births; to ensure safety, birthing centers provide  for transfers to hospitals in case of emergencies.  </P> <P> Only about a quarter of the women who used the centers were poor; the rest  chose them because they were more convenient or they otherwise preferred them  to hospitals. This is as it should be.  </P></p>

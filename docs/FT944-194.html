			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Political worries push peseta to record low Concern that political troubles could prompt the fall of the government yesterday drove the Spanish peseta to a record low, writes Philip Gawith. Spanish markets have been rocked recently by allegations of government involvement in undercover operations against Eta, the Basque separatist group. After touching a low of Pta 85.28 against the D-Mark, the peseta closed in London at Pta 85.15 , from Pta 84.62. The Italian lira was also a victim of political worries, and general D-Mark strength. It breached the crucial level of L1,050 against the D-Mark, to touch L1.050.10, from L1,045. In Mexico, by contrast, markets rallied, with interest rates falling and the peso recovering sharply. In New York the new peso rose 10 centavos to close at 4.875 compared with 4.975 on Wednesday. The Canadian dollar continued to weaken, despite reported central bank intervention, finishing at CDollars 1.407 from CDollars 1.403. The US dollar recovered from its sharp fall on Wednesday afternoon in New York, where it touched lows around DM1.54 and Y98.6, to close at DM1.5507 and Y99.68. Traders stressed again that liquidity was very poor, and this was accentuating price movements. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime minister, sought to calm markets by saying he would not call an early general election. Arguably, this achieved the reverse effect. Mr Malcolm Barr, international economist at Chemical Bank in London, commented: 'This only added to the markets' nervousness because it was seen as a sign of the depths of the crisis. There is a feeling this could be a bit like the Berlusconi investigations which don't end until the roots are traced right to the top.' 'The suspicion has been created that Mr Gonzalez and members of his government knew what was going on, and that Gonzalez could be forced to resign if any evidence came to light,' said Mr Barr. He said Spanish economic fundamentals were also not that good, 'and this sort of development forces the market to reappraise what is going on.' Mr David Williams, European economist at Merrill Lynch, commented: 'The basic problem for the peseta moving forward is that Spain's extremely high propensity to import, coupled with a gradual loss of cost competitiveness, points to a trend deterioration in the current account.' The Bank of Spain has said it will defend the value of the peseta, and economists believe that if it weakens to around Pta 86/86.5, the bank will be forced to raise interest rates. The catalyst for the peso's appreciation was news that that the US is working with Mexico on a credit facility to stop the currency's recent fall. A US Treasury official said also that Mexico had not drawn on the Dollars 7bn currency support line provided to it by the US and Canada to support the peso. The official comment followed market rumours which saw the dollar plummet by around three pfennigs and two yen during afternoon New York trade on Wednesday. In France leading commercial banks raised their base rate to 8.25 per cent from 7.95 per cent, but the Bank of France held its intervention rate at 5 per cent. The intervention rate has been at 5 per cent since May 24. Analysts said the central bank had sought to keep its intervention rate above the German repo rate, which has been at 4.85 per cent since July. French inflation is only 1.6 per cent, but the central bank wishes to keep the franc stable against the D-Mark. The franc closed unchanged at FFr3.455 against the D-Mark. In the UK short sterling contracts fell by 10-15 basis points. They took their lead from the collapse in gilt prices. Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers, GNI said the tone had been set by heavy selling from two US hedge funds. 'It has been a combination of extremely thin markets and some quite lumpy orders.' The March contract finished at 92.52, from 92.66. Sterling had an erratic day, finishing more than a pfennig lower against the D-Mark, at DM2.4183, from DM2.4309. Against the dollar it was up by 1 1/2 cents, at Dollars 1.5595, from Dollars 1.5447. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 706m assistance, after declaring a Pounds 800m daily shortage.</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHEPISI'S 'HOUSE' SHELTERS A KINDER, GENTLER RUSSIA;  </P> <P> MOVIES: THE DIRECTOR SAYS 'RUSSIA HOUSE,' WHICH RECENTLY WRAPPED IN MOSCOW,  WILL FORCE PEOPLE TO 'RETHINK THEIR ATTITUDES ABOUT THIS PLACE.'  </P> <P> Western cinematic images of the Soviet Union, mostly the product of decades of  spy movies and other films about the Cold War, are about to be challenged by a  new film that its director says will show "a different Russia," one that is  gentler and more human, a country that today is deeply troubled but undergoing  profound changes.  </P> <P> "People are going to see a different Russia, a Russia that has never been shown  before in the West, and they are going to have to rethink their attitudes about  this place," Australian director Fred Schepisi said recently here as he  finished filming segments of "The Russia House," which is based on John le  Carre's latest spy novel.  </P> <P> "How willing they will be to discard the old images and stereotypes is hard to  say, but they will definitely be challenged."  </P> <P> Schepisi's film, a $21-million Pathe International production with Sean Connery  and Michelle Pfeiffer in the principal roles, seems likely to amplify the  "soft-on-communism" controversy around Le Carre's novel.  </P> <P> The novel has been castigated by many conservative critics in the United States  who have accused Le Carre, whom they took to be one of them, of forgetting who  the bad guys are in East-West relations and for portraying Western intelligence  agencies as clinging to the Cold War at a time when the Soviet Union appears to  be abandoning the very policies that seemed to make it such a threat.  </P> <P> "The people who should know what is going on here, the import of these changes  for the Soviet Union and the impact they will have on the world, seem to be the  very ones who falling behind in their understanding, who can't keep up with  events here," Schepisi said.  </P> <P> "They, to my mind, are more concerned about 'staying in business,' as it were,  instead of promoting peace. That's what the book is about, and why it has been  unexpectedly controversial, and that's what this film will be about. . . . In  showing people a different Russia, this film will give them new insights into a  lot of things."  </P> <P> Schepisi's "different Russia," on one level, is intensely physical -- Moscow,  Leningrad and their environs, which serve as the backdrop for "The Russia  House." The film, scheduled for release next fall, is one of the first major  Western productions to be shot here under the liberalized conditions that are  part of glasnost.  </P> <P> "This is Russia, the real Russia, and not Finland masquerading as Russia that  people will see," he said. "We have tried to film as many actual locations as  possible with the normal traffic, the normal crowds, life the way it is lived  here.  </P> <P> "People will be surprised, I think, at the vast scale, the breadth of the  streets, the huge apartment blocks, the incredible beauty of so much of Russia  -- none of which they have seen before. We get beyond Red Square, beyond St.  Basil's and its onion domes."  </P> <P> But Schepisi, who spent 10 weeks here planning and then filming, also hopes to  portray the sweeping changes under way here, to set the film against the  present political and social background.  </P> <P> "The Moscow that people will see is a city of lost churches, of lost time, of  lost grace," he said, "but it is also a city that is struggling to come back,  that is under reconstruction, that is going through a spiritual rebirth. . . .  </P> <P> "To portray perestroika, though, we also have to capture the run-down apartment  buildings, the stores without food, the deep alienation people here feel and  the changes that they want. But the trick is not to get too involved, to  approach and pull back and then approach again.  </P> <P> "The humanity of Russians will come through -- how touchingly generous they are  when they get to know you -- and many people will have to rethink their ideas  about this place. In the film, Barley Blair (Connery, the hero, a London book  publisher recruited by British intelligence) learns he really likes Russia  because of that humanity. And for us that, too, will be a new image of Russia."  </P> <P> And, although the film, like the book, falls in the espionage genre, Schepisi  said he prefers to think of it as an "anti-spy" movie.  </P> <P> As in Le Carre's novel, the Soviets are not the bad guys, the hero could be  accused of treason for abandoning his mission and American and British  intelligence officials emerge as heartless manipulators of people's lives in  the name of national security.  </P> <P> "What people think and do often, quite fortunately, has little to do with what  government bodies think and do," Schepisi said. "And that is an insight, which  seems especially true here, that we want in the film."  </P> <P> While this "different Russia" is in Le Carre's novel, the result of the British  author's two trips to the Soviet Union, Schepisi's ability to portray it stems  from the cooperation he has received from Moscow Film Studio and a Soviet-West  German joint venture, Corona, in his five weeks of filming here.  </P> <P> "A lot of people advised against filming here and told us to stick to Finland,"  Schepisi said. "It would never work, they told us, and we would be weeks behind  schedule and millions over budget. But we finished shooting only half a day  behind schedule despite a lot of bad weather, probably a little bit under  budget and very appreciative of the cooperation we got.  </P> <P> "True, something that is so different from what we know -- and their system is  very different -- does make for difficulties. But once we got to know the  system, surmounted the language barriers, got the crew settled down and began  to work, things went very well. Our Soviet partners and crew showed great  flexibility, and we had extraordinary cooperation on things that we would never  be able to do in the United States. Again, that's contrary to all the images we  have of this place."  </P> <P> The film has a powerful patron, however, in Elem Klimov, first secretary of the  Soviet Union of Cinematographers and an influential member of the political  avant-garde here.  </P> <P> "Elem Klimov sold this to the Soviet leadership as a real experiment in  glasnost," Schepisi said. "Remember this, on the surface, is an espionage film,  based on a Le Carre novel, starring Sean Connery once again as a British  intelligence agent. But they read the script here and were willing to put aside  their stereotypes of us and help."  </P> <P> In return for Klimov's cooperation, Schepisi will help the Soviet director film  Mikhail Bulgakov's novel "The Master and Margarita" in the United States next  year. "It's not only the right thing to do after the help we have had here, but  it will be a privilege to work with Klimov," Schepisi said.  </P> <P> Schepisi's time here and his contacts with Soviets made him, like Le Carre, a  full supporter of perestroika.  </P> <P> "We in the West ought to think about what perestroika means not just for the  Soviet Union but for us," Schepisi said. "We ought to think what Gorbachev's  changes will mean for this country and what his success will mean for the  world. . . .  </P> <P> "They are encountering difficulties right now. Perestroika is bringing harder  times, less food, uncertainty about the future. They need our support at this  moment, our encouragement so that an opportunity, a historic opportunity, does  not slip away."  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DAVIS' CRITICISM 'RUINED' THE JOY FOR REDS' SCHOTT  </P> <P> Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott is upset with outfielder Eric Davis.  </P> <P> Schott said Davis' criticism that the Reds should have paid for his transfer  between hospitals in Oakland and Cincinnati has taken her joy out of the team's  World Series victory.  </P> <P> "It has ruined it all for me," she said. "I just don't believe we have this  after winning a World Series. I can't believe we'd ruin something as great as a  World Series win with a silly . . . plane flight."  </P> <P> Davis told reporters he is upset that the Reds did not pay the $15,000 bill to  bring him back to Cincinnati from Oakland on Friday. He suffered a kidney  injury in Oakland while diving for a ball in Game 4 of the World Series.  </P> <P> Davis, saying he will be stuck with the bill, complained that Schott showed "no  concern . . . or any consideration" for his welfare.  </P> <P> Schott said she is irked and disappointed by Davis' reaction.  </P> <P> "I have stuck by this guy for five years," she said. "You would think this guy  would have been rejoicing, but instead it's ruined everything."  </P> <P> Davis took out a newspaper advertisement, published Sunday, to thank fans for  the cards, letters and other signs of support he received while hospitalized.  But he is still angry with the Reds.  </P> <P> Davis said Schott declined to return his telephone calls about his  transportation back to Cincinnati. He had hoped Schott would help set up a  private jet to bring him back. Doctors said he had to fly on his back with  medical personnel nearby to monitor his condition.  </P> <P> Reds General Manager Bob Quinn visited Davis on Saturday and said their  differences had been ironed out. But Davis said Quinn never brought up the  matter of the bill to charter the jet.  </P></p>

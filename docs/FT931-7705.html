			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Branson gives BA 24 hours to settle over 'dirty tricks' MR RICHARD Branson, the head of Virgin Atlantic, yesterday gave British Airways 24 hours to settle their 'dirty tricks' battle. Mr Branson wants BA to agree compensation for the damage inflicted on his airline by BA's campaign or face the threat of renewed legal action. Meanwhile, BA said last night that it would look into allegations made on ITN that airline employees in Los Angeles had continued to try to poach Virgin passengers after the airline had pledged not to do so again. Virgin has previously set deadlines as part of its tactics to reach an early settlement with BA, following last month's Pounds 610,000 libel victory against its competitor. But on each occasion it has been prepared to let talks continue after the expiry of the deadline in the hope of a breakthrough. The smaller airline, however, last night appeared poised to break off talks and carry out its threat to pursue its claims of anti-competitive activities against BA through the courts. Speaking at Heathrow airport at the opening of a new departure lounge for Virgin passengers, Mr Branson said that, without progress towards an agreement over the next 24 hours, 'there is no point in carrying on'. He added: 'We lost a great deal of money because of their tactics and need compensation. We don't want to see things dragged on indefinitely but they are repeatedly delaying a solution to the problem.' Last night, BA said it had agreed to make no comment on the talks and that it did not intend to respond to Mr Branson's remarks. Talks began three weeks ago in an atmosphere of optimism, involving Mr Sid Pennington, managing director of Virgin Atlantic, Mr Trevor Abbott, financial adviser to Mr Branson and Mr Robert Ayling, BA's newly-appointed group managing director. But relations between the two sides deteriorated a week ago, following the disclosure of a letter from BA to Virgin setting out proposals to settle the dispute. Virgin said the terms - which included a Pounds 3m payment - were not acceptable. Virgin has said throughout that it will consider mounting anti-competitive cases against BA in the US and Europe unless compensation can be agreed. The allegations that BA is continuing to try to poach Virgin passengers centred on statements from a Los Angeles-based travel agent that BA staff, under the mistaken impression that he was a Virgin passenger, had attempted to persuade him to switch flights to BA.</p>

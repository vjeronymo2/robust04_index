This proposal would require modification of the engine nose cowl. This proposal is prompted by several in-flight incidents in which the engine nose cowl separated or nearly separated from the airplane. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent separation of the engine nose cowl from the airplane during severe vibration of the engine. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by September 12, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;87&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

Investigation revealed that these separations occurred following severe vibration of the engine due to failures of the first stage fan blade. The cause of these separations has been attributed to loose or missing attachment bolts of the engine nose cowl. This condition, if not corrected, could result in separation of the engine nose cowl from the airplane during severe vibration of the engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;80 Alert Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bulletin A71&hyph;61, dated May 18, 1994, which describes procedures for modification of the left and right engine nose cowls. This modification entails removal of attachment bolts and nutplates, replacement of nutplates with self-locking nuts and washers on the engine ``A'' flange, and reversal of attachment bolt direction (bolthead facing forward). This modification will ensure the integrity of the nose cowl attachment assembly so as to minimize the possibility of separation of the engine nose cowl from the airplane during severe vibration of the engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require modification of the left and right engine nose cowls. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 1,062 McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 540 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $100 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $232,200, or $430 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

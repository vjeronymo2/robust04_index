			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Talas alleged that Israel duped an American  soldier into carrying the bomb that blew up a Pan Am jetliner over Scotland on  Dec. 21, killing 270 people. "An agent of Israeli intelligence, Mossad, handed  him the bomb-laden bag to carry in return for $300,000, claiming it was  diamonds worth $500,000 needed to be smuggled into the United States," Talas  said in an interview published in Kuwait's daily Al-Qabas. British  investigators determined the plane was destroyed by a bomb placed in the  luggage hold, but they have not said who was responsible. In Israel, a Foreign  Ministry spokesman called Talas' allegation "ridiculous and malicious."  </P></p>

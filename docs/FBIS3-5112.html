The solution of the issue  now depends on how sincerely the United States, a dialogue  partner, works to fulfil its promise.    Kang Sok-chu, first vice minister of Foreign Affairs and  head  of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  to the DPRK-U.S. talks, declared this in a statement released  today as regards ill-boding moves of the United States giving  rise to doubt about its willingness to implement the conclusions  on simultaneous action reached between the DPRK and the United  States in New York.    He said:    The U.S. side made an official announcement that the  exchange  of special envoys between the North and the South and the IAEA's  inspection are preconditions for the renunciation of the "Team  Spirit 94" joint military exercises and the opening of the  third-stage talks between the DPRK and the United States.    On March 3, it expressed full support for the decision of  the  South Korean authorities not to stage the "Team Spirit 94"  conditional on the exchange of special envoys between the two  halves of Korea.    All these are dangerous acts to endanger the implementation  of the DPRK-U.S. agreement, which can never be justified.    As everyone knows, the DPRK and the United States set no  precondition in agreeing on the steps of simultaneous action.    The conclusions reached at the New York contact only  mentioned the resumption of the working contact for the exchange  of special envoys between the North and the South as a step for  simultaneous action. But it did not touch on the fulfilment of  the exchange.    Only when the South Korean authorities stop such  unreasonable  acts as impudently poking their nose into the discussion of the  nuclear issue without their own political view or authority to  discuss the matter and make a clear turnabout towards seeking  national reunification, the exchange of special envoys between  the North and the South will be realised.    We are also willing to sincerely implement the agreement on  the IAEA's inspection for the continuity of safeguards.    A group of inspectors of the IAEA began its activities on  March 1 and a competent organ of the DPRK is rendering a proper  cooperation in its activities.    At a time when the agreement has entered the stage of  implementation, however, the U.S. side has brought forward again  the unreasonable preconditions which it had failed to include in  the conclusions, while fully supporting the conditions raised by  the South Korean authorities. All this cannot be construed  otherwise than factors which may lead to collapse the full  implementation of the agreement.    As prescribed in the agreed conclusions, unless all the  steps  of simultaneous action are implemented fully, all the agreed  points will automatically go amiss.    We have agreed to the inspection by IAEA and the resumption  of inter-Korean working contact on the premise that the agency  will not take an unreasonable attitude in the course of the  inspection for the continuity of safeguards and the South Korean  side will not abuse the exchange of special envoys for such  insidious purposes as putting brakes on the DPRK-U.S. talks.    It is clear that, if the agency and the South Korean  authorities bring forward complicated matters contrary to this  and the United States gives up halfway the decision to renounce  the "Team Spirit 94" joint military exercises and delay the  opening of the third-round DPRK-U.S. talks under an absurd  pretext, we can not satisfactorily ensure the IAEA's inspection  that has already begun, nor can we pin any more hope on the  DPRK-U.S. talks itself.    It is high time that the DPRK and the U.S. faithfully  implement the agreed conclusions on the steps for simultaneous  action published a few days ago, conscious of their  responsibilities and obligations in the solution to the nuclear  issue.    We will watch the future acts of the dialogue partner.</p>

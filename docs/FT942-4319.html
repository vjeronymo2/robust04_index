			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Rich pickings in rare elements Rare earth elements have always been at the obscure end of the chemicals industry. They are expensive to produce and have few discernable large-scale applications. But French company Rhone-Poulenc, which has long championed their use, has developed a rare earth compound, cerium sulphide, as a pigment for plastics, Daniel Green writes. The three-year development programme was aimed at finding an alternative to cadmium sulphide, which is tainted by concerns over the toxicity of cadmium. The company is using cerium because the sulphide, like that for cadmium, is red. In various mixtures it can be made to show a variety of shades from orange to crimson. Rhone-Poulenc: France, 1 47 68 10 74.</p>

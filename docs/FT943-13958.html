			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Minding Your Own Business: A family keen to get ahead - The recession-beating strategy of a hat-making company Rather than growing too big for their boots they have had to avoid letting success go to their heads at Olney Headwear, the only manufacturer of men's hats in Luton, a traditional hat-making town. After 75 years making panama hats and a handful of other styles, including uniform hats, the company made its first takeovers in the late 1980s. The recession years have been excellent for business - sales have risen 60 per cent in five years. 'Although we are making 42,000 men's straw hats a year, nearly all of which are panamas, we now have only 60 per cent of the UK market in these fashionable styles, which is a decrease in market share,' said managing director Michael Olney, 54. 'When the panama boom started in the late 1980s, a number of other manufacturers took up the challenge. Many found they weren't up to the job, but a few have stayed. 'However we are still the country's biggest manufacturer of genuine panama hats, using hand-woven torquilla fibre imported from Ecuador, and in the meantime the two takeovers have meant we have increased our total range of headwear to 500 different styles.' Michael and his brother Nicholas head the family company, which has 60 employees, and which manufactures 12 styles of ladies' hat, mainly for Laura Ashley and other large retailers. Ladies' hats comprise 17 per cent of the company's Pounds 2.5m turnover - about the same percentage as panamas. Workwear hats - mainly for the food and laboratory industries - make up 27 per cent, and gents' tweed caps and hats another 20 per cent. 'We try to make our range a mix of classics and fashion items,' said marketing manager Paul Offord. 'Although the panama has been made by Olney for many of the company's 80 years and is now an established classic it would be foolish to assume it will always remain as fashionable as it has been for the past five years. 'Michael and Nicholas were very wise to buy a small Luton gents' tweed hatmaker in 1988, and in 1989 they consolidated this by buying a Glasgow cap specialist from the receiver for Pounds 12,500 in late 1989, just before I joined the company. The two acquisitions broadened the Olney range of expertise and almost doubled the range of products.' The recent purchase of 5,000 sq ft of extra space adjoining the Luton factory at a price of Pounds 90,000 was financed by a 10-year loan from NatWest. Apart from that, the only borrowings are on overdraft. This arrangement is vital because of the seasonal nature of the hat trade, and also because cashflow is very unpredictable, particularly with suppliers in Ecuador and China, from which Olney buys all its straw. All the overseas buying is done by letters of credit, but getting the money in from the retail trade in this country is frequently a headache, said Offord. That and the other financial aspects of the business are the preserve of Michael's son David, 28, the company accountant. He and his brother Andrew, 31, who is production manager, are the fourth generation of the family in the business. In 1989 - a notable year for the company - the brothers also changed the name from AE Olney (their grandfather Albert Edward founded the company in Luton in 1914) and poached Offord from a competitor to implement their new policy of selling direct to the high street. 'For nearly 75 years we had sold to the trade, but for a variety of reasons we decided to cut out all wholesalers and go direct to the retailers,' said Michael Olney. 'Paul's initial task, together with my brother Nicholas and three agents, was to make this strategy work. A new leaflet was produced detailing the entire range of panamas, cottons and straws, workwear hats, tweeds and caps and gents' felt hats, and Paul took to the road. 'We thought it would be difficult opening up 500 accounts in shops all over the country,' said Offord. 'In fact, we received a very good reception in the retail sector. After 75 years in the trade we were pleased to find we were pretty well-known. A lot of our customers had been buying our hats under different names without realising it. It was hard work legging it all over the country, but well worth the effort. It was very good strategy on the part of Michael and Nicholas - and the move came at just the right time to counteract the effects of the recession.' The company's turnover is Pounds 2.5m. Rates of profit on different lines are a well-kept secret in such a competitive business, but the company seeks a net profit of 25 per cent. The main financial obstacle is one Olney is well used to dealing with: the necessity to carry a large stock. 'Hats are very light, but bulky. Much of the newly-acquired building will be used for warehousing,' Michael Olney said. 'At the beginning of July we had nearly 4,000 hats, valued at approximately Pounds 150,000 in storage. Many have gone out now - but we need the space in anticipation of the increased numbers of tweed hats and caps we are making for autumn.' Despite the prestige of its own-name hats in the high street, the company tries not to forget that the biggest single sector in its business is industrial headwear, of which it make 5,000 units a week. Michael said: 'Many of these products require far less skill than goes into making a panama that retails at up to Pounds 80. But in many ways they are the lifeblood of the company. 'The other vital element in our success is our workforce. A lot of processes in hat-making will always be carried out by hand. At the top end it is still a craft-based industry.'

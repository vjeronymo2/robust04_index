			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Undated announcement by Russian president's press secretary </F> Vyacheslav Kostikov: "In the Spirit of Civil Accord"]    [Text] In connection with the signing of a package of  economic edicts encouraging activity by the government and  legislative organs in the sphere of increasing the pace of  economic reform, Russian President B.N. Yeltsin has sent letters  to State Duma and Federation Council deputies explaining the  motives behind the presidential initiative in the economic  sphere.    The president points out to the deputies that his actions  arise both out of actual constitutional prerogatives and out of  the Treaty on Social Accord. In his letter B.N. Yeltsin informs  the deputies that, acting in the spirit of civil accord,  immediately after signing the package of economic edicts he  instructed the government to submit draft laws based on the  edicts to the deputies for their consideration. So the edicts,  insofar as they impinge on the jurisdiction of the Federal  Assembly, will remain valid until the relevant federal laws are  adopted.    Moreover, on 24 May the president proposed that V.S.  Chernomyrdin, I.P. Rybkin, V.F. Shumeyko, and B.N. Topornin,  chairman of the Public Chamber under the president, immediately  set up a working group representing a wide range of public and  social interests in order to stimulate the speediest adoption of  amendments to tax legislation.    [signed] Vyacheslav Kostikov, Russian president's press  secretary.</p>

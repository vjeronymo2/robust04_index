			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / A second D-Day invasion Normandy is bracing itself for this weekend's commemorative assault, writes David Buchan in Caen. The combined force includes some 14 heads of state and governments, 40,000 D-Day veterans, 100,000 tourists and battalions of broadcasters and press. To ensure it does not finish off in the next few days what Operation Overlord began 50 years ago, France has just declared the remains of Hitler's Atlantic Wall defences an historic monument. But the region will take a pounding before the main commemoration ends on Monday night in a peace extravaganza in Caen. US, British, Canadian and French paratroops are to re-enact tomorrow their 'drops' on the western and eastern edges of the invasion zone. Most will be serving troops. But the landing may feel on the hard side for the 38 veterans of US 82nd Airborne Division, aged between 68 and 83, who have persuaded reluctant French authorities that they are fit enough to fall out of the sky over Sainte-Mere-Eglise, just as they did 50 years ago. On Monday, the five kings and queens, five presidents, four prime ministers and one governor general will criss-cross the area in a complicated quadrille of bilateral ceremonies. One, France's 76-year-old President Francois Mitterrand, will have to be virtually everywhere as host, while all will be at the 'international' ceremony on Monday afternoon at Omaha Beach, the scene of the worst allied casualties on June 6, 1944 with the deaths of 3,000 Americans. Absent, perforce, will be any official representatives of Germany, which lost 58,000 men in the Battle of Normandy to the 37,000 allied dead, even though there will be at least one small unofficial American-German ceremony at the private initiative of veterans of both sides. But Mr Mitterrand has invited German troops belonging to the Eurocorps, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, to attend France's Bastille day parade in Paris next month. Germany will be present, too, at next May's ceremonies marking the end of the second world war. Meanwhile, however, this weekend's events will require considerably more troops than the free French were able to muster for D-Day - 15,000 soldiers to ensure the logistics, 7,000 gendarmes to guard the roads, and 4,000 police controlling crowds. 'It's a bit like organising a summit meeting in the middle of the Olympic Games,' says Mr Roger Gros, the harassed prefet of Lower Normandy, referring to the problem of trying to ensure the safety of so many bigwigs among so many other people in such a large area. But he will have, as the allies did half a century ago, the advantage of air superiority. An air exclusion zone will prevent anything but VIP helicopters from circulating over the Normandy coast. Controlling the sea may be harder. In the royal yacht Britannia, Queen Elizabeth is expected tomorrow to lead a small armada from Portsmouth, where tonight she is to host a state dinner. Her Majesty should have no problem. Pressure on her civil list is not such that Britannia has had to take on cheap Chinese crew, which is the reason that French sailors gave for preventing two P&amp;O ferries from docking at Cherbourg on Thursday. The presence of 45 warships, as well as several thousand private boats, will ease the hotel squeeze in Normandy. The Queen will stay on the Britannia moored in the port of Caen, while President Bill Clinton will repair, aptly, to the Dwight Eisenhower aircraft carrier. Other dignitaries have had to settle for staying in Paris, so as not to disrupt long-made hotel reservations by D-Day veterans. On Wednesday a Caen tribunal ordered a local hotel to pay 50 British veterans from the Lancaster Regiment FFr1,500 each in compensation for cancelling their bookings. In general, the welcome has been warm - and commercial. All sorts of souvenirs for D-Day, or Jour-J as it is known in French, are on sale, including Bordeaux and Beaujolais under the 'Debarquement 44' label. Luckily, it is not actually that vintage, which would not have aged as well as the veterans. D-Day's absent friend, Weekend I Books, Weekend XV</p>

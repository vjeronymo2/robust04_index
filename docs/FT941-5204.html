			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Overthrow of ancien regime - Jean Thibaud explains changes to French banking and company laws Last year, the newly elected French conservative parliament modernised its banking and company laws, signalling a new pro-business attitude in France. By a law of December 31 1993, a number of changes were made affecting the Bank of France and the credit and financial markets. Action was taken to bring the French law on the netting of derivative products, such as swaps and options, into line with the UK and the US. At its simplest level, netting involves the set-off of transactions against each other. When it works effectively, is recognised by the counterparties to a transaction and is designed to reduce insolvency exposures, it allows capital requirements to be greatly reduced, since the credit and liquidity exposures of participants are also reduced. England has recently accepted netting as a basic principle of insolvency law and the US has also passed legislation permitting it, so that it can bring its capital adequacy rules into line with the recommendations of the Basle committee of the Bank for International Settlements. France has now followed suit. The law of December 31 provides that, in the event of the bankruptcy of a French counterparty, French law fully recognises, and gives effect to close out, netting provisions included either in regulations applicable to official markets, or in master form agreements published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association or by the French Banking Association (AFB) for over-the-counter transactions. The practical consequences of the new law are, first, that a French counterparty to such a derivative transaction will not be charged an extra premium for counterparty risk; and second, banks will be able to show their net position with a French counterparty, thereby reducing their capital costs. The December 31 changes also clarify the law on repurchase agreements - instruments by which securities are sold on a short-term basis with an agreement to repurchase. Until the law was passed, there was some doubt among the legal community about the enforceability in a French court of a pension livree (repurchase agreement). This was because the legal bases of this instrument were weak, the first being a memorandum of understanding (accord de place) approved by the Bank of France in co-operation with the Association of Banking Treasurers and the second, purely for the tax aspects, a simple letter from the Ministry of Economy and Finance to the AFB. The invaluable contribution of the new law is that it offers a safe legal framework for such transactions, and it defines the large number of instruments which may be subject to repurchase agreements ('repos') and the institutions which are authorised to enter into such transactions: banks, securities houses, brokerage firms, mutual funds, financial institutions, institutional investors, insurance companies, non-profit corporations and unit trusts. The law also sets out the tax and accounting treatment of 'repos', thereby creating the conditions required for the development of a real international 'repos' market in Paris, such as currently exists in London and New York. The law of December 31 also abolished stamp duty on securities transactions entered into with a non-French tax resident on the Paris bourse. This measure is expected to suppress one of the big incentives for large French stockholders to sell blocks of shares on the London Stock Exchange through the electronic automated quotation system (Seaq). This measure, together with the success of the current privatisation programme, is expected to boost the volume and liquidity of the market on the Paris stock exchange. On the corporate side, the changes are designed primarily to provide a more flexible and modern company law and to restore some of the rights of banks and other secured creditors in the event of the bankruptcy of a French company. The law of January 3 1994 has created a new form of joint stock company, the so-called 'simplified joint stock company' (or 'SAS' in French), which allows for much greater flexibility in, among other things, the decision-making process, management and the exclusion of shareholders than previously permitted under company law. The essential difference is that the shareholders, subject to only a few restrictions, can organise the company as they wish. This type of company is particularly suitable to both domestic and cross-border joint ventures between medium and large-sized companies. French companies had been lobbying for such a simplified joint stock company for some time. Previously they had no alternative but to go into other European jurisdictions, in particular the Netherlands, to find the level of legal flexibility appropriate for certain types of joint ventures between large companies. For the first time in the history of French company law, the law of December 31 1993 expressly permits the forcing out ('squeeze-out') of minority shareholders in a listed company. The issue was hotly debated in the parliament, and the French squeeze-out is subject to strict requirements. First, the majority shareholders should hold either together or 'in concert' no less than 95 per cent of the capital and voting shares of the company. Second, the squeeze-out may occur only after a tender offer or a request for delisting of shares has been made in accordance with the rules issued by the CBV, the regulatory authority for the French stock exchange. Eventually, the minority shareholders should receive fair compensation that is 'the appropriate combination in each case of the value of the assets of the company, the profits of the company, the market capitalisation for the shares, the existence of subsidiaries and the financial prospects for future business'. The national assembly also passed on January 10 this year a draft bankruptcy bill, amending the 1985 Bankruptcy Act. If approved by the Senate, it would significantly alter the rights of banks and secured creditors of a company either under administration or in bankruptcy. The 1985 act favoured employees, and was aimed primarily at keeping the company alive and saving jobs by precluding banks and other secured creditors from enforcing their security and selling off the assets of the company. The principal consequences of the draft bill for the banks and the other secured creditors would be: that in the event of liquidation, the secured creditors would rank before the creditors who granted new money after an administration judgment; the tax authorities and social security would not be given preferential rank in respect of all their claims; and that, in the event of a bankruptcy, the secured creditors would be permitted to enforce their security by selling off the assets of the company. For political and historical reasons, the French deregulation movement took place later than and was not as brutal as in other western countries, such the UK or US. Even if these changes do not appear to be that spectacular from a UK or US perspective, they illustrate a clear departure from the ancien regime. They show a clear political will decisively to integrate France into the worldwide economy, and to offer to participants on the French markets the same types of legal instruments available in the most industrialised countries.

This is because the Finance Ministry  has not yet received the lists of soldiers from both sides to be  demobilized.    The Finance Ministry has the money to begin to pay the  six-month subsidy provided by the government and the 18-month  subsidy provided by the international community. Finance  Minister Eneas Comiche told Radio Mozambique that the Technical  Demobilization Unit of the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz]  has already obtained the list of government soldiers to be  demobilized but has not yet obtained Renamo's list. He said the  government will only begin to pay the subsidy after his ministry  has obtained full lists from both sides.    The Reintegration Commission [Core] met in Maputo today to  discuss various issues connected with the strategy to be adopted  for the reintegration of demobilized troops. Core also examined  a two-year training program for demobilized troops.</p>

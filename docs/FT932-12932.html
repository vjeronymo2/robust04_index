			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Soros puts Dollars 400m into rising gold market MR GEORGE Soros, the international currency trader, has agreed to buy a Dollars 400m (Pounds 259m) stake in Newmont Mining, the Denver-based gold mining company, as a way of gaining exposure to the rising gold market. The company will announce today that funds controlled by the Soros family have bought 6.8m shares in Newmont and agreed to buy a further 3.2m shares at a cost of Dollars 39.50 a share. About 9m of the shares are being sold by General Oriental Investment, which is controlled by Sir James Goldsmith, with the rest coming from Lord Rothschild's RIT Capital Partners. The sale will make Mr Soros the second largest shareholder in Newmont Mining with 13 per cent, leaving Sir James with a stake of about 30 per cent. Lord Rothschild's stake will fall from 7 to 5 per cent. Mr Soros rose to fame in September when he made a Dollars 1bn profit as the UK was forced to leave the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Mr Gordon Parker, Newmont's chairman and president, said yesterday that he 'couldn't have imagined a better home for the shares, for what it tells the world about sentiment on gold'. The gold market has been improving recently with the price reaching a six-month high of Dollars 347 per troy ounce on Friday. 'We're seeing the confluence of gold as a commodity and gold as money,' said Mr Parker. Demand for gold from Asia has been increasing while production has remained steady. At the same time, investors have increasingly been buying gold as a hedge against uncertainty in the currency markets, fear of inflation and economic unrest. Newmont's shares rose by Dollars 3 in New York trading on Friday to Dollars 45 7/8 while trading in gold futures on the Comex was extremely busy. Mr Parker said that Sir James's decision to sell part of his Newmont stake was consistent with his plans when he bought into the company two and a half years ago. Sir James first started selling Newmont shares in February when he placed 1.8m with a range of institutions. At the time, he said he was still bullish on gold. Sir James acquired a 42 per cent holding in Newmont as part of a deal with Lord Hanson in October 1990.</p>

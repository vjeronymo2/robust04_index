Parts having cavities or blind holes shall be tipped or rotated before being removed from any solvent cleaning machine unless an equally effective approach has been approved by the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Parts baskets or parts shall not be removed from any solvent cleaning machine until dripping has stopped.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) During startup of each vapor cleaning machine, the primary condenser shall be turned on before the sump heater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) During shutdown of each vapor cleaning machine, the sump heater shall be turned off and the solvent vapor layer allowed to collapse before the primary condenser is turned off.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) When solvent is added or drained from any solvent cleaning machine, the solvent shall be transferred using threaded or other leakproof couplings and the end of the pipe in the solvent sump shall be located beneath the liquid solvent surface.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

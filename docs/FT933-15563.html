			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Renewable power resources studied BETWEEN 6 per cent and 12 per cent of electricity in the south-west could come from renewable energy sources such as wind, waste incineration and tidal power by the end of the century, according to a study sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry. The study was jointly funded with South Western Electricity, which opened the UK's first wind farm last year. The DTI has set a national target of 1500MW of electricity from renewable sources by 2000.</p>

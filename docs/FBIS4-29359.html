			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Newly elected Keidanren  chief Shoichiro Toyoda said Thursday [16 June] deregulation is  the single most important task for the country's most powerful  business lobby. Toyoda, who was appointed chairman of the  Federation of Economic Organizations on May 27, said it is the  "mandate of our day" to pursue dramatic reforms of the  political, bureaucratic and economic systems of the country.    Speaking at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan in his  first public address as the head of Keidanren, Toyoda said  deregulation is essential for Japan to create a more vigorous  economy and gain international credibility. He promised that  Keidanren under his reign will "think boldly and act steadily"  to harmonize Japan's much-criticized social system into one that  resembles those of other major countries.    Asked how Keidanren will have its schemes for social  revolution realized, Toyoda, who is also chairman of Toyota  Motor Corp., said the organization will do so through constant  consultation with the government. He said clearly Keidanren  will not wield its influence on policy-makers by funneling  corporate donations to politicians as before.    Responding to a question about concerns that deregulation  would lead to a higher jobless rate, he said he hopes the  possibility can be avoided by creating jobs through the  innovation of new technologies and industries.    He was cautious on the state of the economy, which some  observers claim has turned a corner. "There are some quarters  in the economy which are showing bright signs, but such unstable  factors as the political fragility and the high yen have kept me  from saying for sure that the economy has been improving," he  said.    Calling for tax cuts and increased investments -- 100  trillion yen more than the planned 430 trillion yen for the  current decade -- in public works projects, Toyoda said a hike  in indirect taxes such as the consumption tax is inevitable in  order for the plans to take shape. He failed, however, to  specify how far the now 3 percent consumption tax rate should be  hiked.</p>

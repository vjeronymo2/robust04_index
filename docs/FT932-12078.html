			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / US growth falls sharply as exports weaken US ECONOMIC growth fell sharply in the first quarter to an annual rate of 1.8 per cent as consumer spending slowed and exports weakened, the Commerce Department said yesterday. Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the figures showed the economy was growing, but at 'an unacceptably low rate'. He said the Clinton administration would work with its trading partners - particularly Japan - to expand exports. The figures were worse than widely expected on Wall Street, which had forecast growth at an annual rate of 2-2.5 per cent in the quarter. Share prices declined modestly in early trading but late buying helped to lift them back in to positive territory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing 11.62 higher at 3,425.12. Most economists, however, continue to expect an acceleration of growth later this year to an underlying rate of close to 3 per cent. The sluggish expansion in the first quarter followed growth at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent and 4.7 per cent respectively in the third and fourth quarters of last year. Referring to the Republicans' successful filibuster of the administration's economic stimulus, Mr Brown said 'a modest and focused jobs package' remained essential to shore up confidence and boost the growth of incomes and employment. The first-quarter figures showed across-the-board weakness compared with late last year. In real terms, consumption grew at an annual rate of only 1.2 per cent against 5.1 per cent in the fourth quarter. Fixed investment by business grew at 5.6 per cent against 9.7 per cent. Exports contracted at an annual rate of 7.1 per cent against growth of 8.9 per cent. The figures also confirmed a standstill in the housing sector, despite the lowest mortgage rates in 20 years. Residential investment grew at an annual rate of only 0.2 per cent against 25.1 per cent in the fourth quarter. Inflation figures also deteriorated, with a broad index rising at an annual rate of 3.3 per cent in the first quarter against 2.3 per cent at the end of last year. Early data for April, however, are more encouraging, indicating that some of the weakness reflected severe winter weather. Retail sales and vehicle sales have risen in recent weeks; consumer confidence also rebounded this month, although not to the levels of last December. 'We expect growth to bounce back to 3 per cent at an annual rate in the second quarter,' said Mr Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at New York bank J. P. Morgan. He noted several special factors that had pulled down first-quarter growth, including an erratic fall in defence spending at an annual rate of 25 per cent. The weak first quarter was probably also a reaction to unsustainably fast growth in the fourth quarter. Over both quarters, growth averaged 3.3 per cent at an annual rate, in line with last year's third quarter and close to most estimates of the likely growth for this year as a whole.

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / ICI chief presses bankers Pressure from shareholders could hamper banks' efforts to build supportive long-term relationships with large companies, Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, warned yesterday. He told the International Monetary Conference, a meeting in London of senior executives from 103 large banks, that banks should take a 'long-term supportive' stance towards customers. 'I suspect that the pressure on under-performing banks to improve their shareholder value will grow, which may make even the most tolerant more critical of clients' performance than in the past.' A long-term supportive stance 'through fair and foul weather alike' was the normal model in Asia-Pacific, particularly in Japan. Germany's practice was also close to that of Japan but the tendency was less prevalent elsewhere. Sir Denys criticised some banks for being more interested in 'peddling the deal of the day' rather than preserving objectivity in the advice they offered to companies. While other industries wanted stability to make long-term investment plans, 'some parts of the banking industry welcome volatility, which generates excitement and the prospect of large instant gains'. In a separate discussion on financial centres, Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, said London would depend on its 'continuing capacity to innovate'. There would always be the need for a leading centre in the European time zone, but Madrid, Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt had their own aspirations and London's position would be challenged.

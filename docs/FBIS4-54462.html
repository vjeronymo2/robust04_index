			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, April 30 (AA) -- Macedonian Prime Minister  Branko Crvenkovski on Saturday said that the Balkans are under a  war threat, warning that Greece and Serbia are aiming at  creating a joint border after disintegrating Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM].    "Neither country is willing to accept the reality of an  independent Macedonia in the Balkans. Both have common  interests in Macedonia," he said.    Speaking to AA reporters in Skopje, he accused the European  Union and United Nations of following "a passive policy in the  region", adding this indecisive attitude by international  organizations has brought the region on the brink of a new war.    Crvenkovski said there is a great political harmony between  Belgrade and Athens, stressing the greatest support for Serbia  comes from Athens and that the embargo imposed on his country by  Greece was started with cooperation with Serbia.    He said Turkey is Macedonia's "best friend" in the Balkans,  expressing gratitude for its support. "Turkey's policy is one  that Macedonia is looking for and expects," he concluded.</p>

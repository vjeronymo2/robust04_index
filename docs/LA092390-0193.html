			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ET TU, E.T.?  </P> <P> In his review of "Out There," Klass mentions the photos of Floridian Ed  Walters.  </P> <P> Walters' 1990 book, "The Gulf Breeze Sightings," contains color photographs  that show a brilliant, fiery "power ring" or energy source under the saucer as  well as a blue beam flashing to the ground.  </P> <P> Personally, I think that the numerous sightings, photographs and films from  around the world over the past 40 or so years suggest that the UFOs came in  order to patrol (like observers or guardians) our planet, to be seen by and to  enlighten us, and to intervene in order to overcome and protect human beings  from the disastrous effects of a large-scale nuclear war in the Middle East and  involving several nations.  </P> <P> KENNETH LLOYD LARSON  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES  </P></p>

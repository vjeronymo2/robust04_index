			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Terms for Celsius flotation revealed A VALUE of SKr2.9bn (Dollars 396m) was yesterday put on Celsius Industries, Sweden's leading defence group, when the government unveiled terms for the company's privatisation. It means the state will raise nearly SKr2.2bn from the sale of 75 per cent of the company, making this the largest Swedish privatisation to date. Last year, the government raised SKr2.1bn through an offer of shares in SSAB, the steel group. A total of 21m shares is being offered, with institutions paying SKr106 per share and the Swedish general public and employees SKr100. Around 21 per cent of the company will be owned by four Swedish financial institutions, while 43 per cent will be offered to domestic and foreign investors, Celsius employees and the general public. The remaining 11 per cent will be owned by Nobel Industries, which gained its stake in exchange for the sale of its defence electronics activities to Celsius for SKr1.55bn in February. Celsius says it will pay a dividend of SKr5 per share if 1993 profits reach last year's level of SKr545m - its minimum forecast for this year. There is no formal allocation for international investors, although shares are being marketed overseas by four institutions - Banque Indosuez, Alfred Berg Fondkommission, Enskilda Securities and Kleinwort Benson. At least 6.5m shares (23.2 per cent of the total) will be available to domestic and foreign institutions, although this could rise if the take-up by employees and the general public is less than 5.5m shares (19.6 per cent). The offer will run from May 17 to June 4. The government believes Celsius will be able to take a more active part in the broader restructuring of the European defence industry if it is in private hands and has access to external risk capital.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Electricity's poor relation makes good - Why National Grid's results today are of more than passing interest In pre-privatisation days the National Grid was considered within the electricity industry to be a poor relation to power generation. No-one will be feeling sorry for it today. The company, which operates the high voltage transmission system in England and Wales, is this morning expected to report pre-tax profits for 1993-94 of between Pounds 570m and Pounds 580m, against Pounds 533m in the previous year. As an unlisted company, previous results have attracted only passing interest from the City. This year is different. The 12 regional electricity companies (recs) which own the Grid this spring appointed Kleinwort Benson, the investment house, and Herbert Smith, the legal firm, to advise on its future. Few doubt that this will lead to anything other than a flotation, which will give National Grid a valuation of at least Pounds 4bn. So what kind of a company is likely to be floated and what are the implications for the regional electricity companies? National Grid's attraction is that it has a cast iron future with almost as strong guarantees of profit growth. Transmission is a monopoly business in every country in Europe except Finland and, with development costs so high, it will remain so. In England and Wales demand for electricity is likely to grow, albeit at low percentage rates. The main constraint on the Grid's profits growth therefore, is regulation, but even this presents no great threat. Whereas the regional power companies face a potentially severe regulatory review to take effect from next April, the Grid's pricing formula on its main transmission business is in place until 1997. It allows the company to raise transmission prices by inflation minus 3 per cent. 'Since transmission revenues account for 80 per cent of revenues, this relatively benign regulatory settlement emphasises the value of the Grid,' says Mr Nigel Hawkins, Hoare Govett analyst. While transmission will continue to be the main revenue source, the company is growing its non-regulated income by investing in transmission projects overseas and establishing its subsidiary, Energis, as a third telecommunications force. The beauty of Energis is that it can be built on the back of the electricity transmission system. The fibre optics can be wound round existing earth wires or incorporated into new ones. In spite of the more than reasonable prospects for the Grid's businesses, the company is held back by a complicated management structure. The recs own the National Grid Company indirectly through their investments in National Grid Holding Company. The chains of command are not always clear. Some rec chief executives were irked when Mr David Jefferies, Grid Company chairman, announced the appointment as chief executive last year of Mr David Jones, who held the same post at South Wales Electricity. While Mr Jones is well regarded, some of his former colleagues thought Mr Jefferies had not consulted widely enough and, in any case, should have looked outside the industry to fill the post. Some recs feel they are not involved enough in decision making on overseas investment and Energis. On the other hand, running a business where 12 forceful owners with differing objectives want a say can be damaging. Talks this year with AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications concern, about the company taking a stake in Energis were hampered through disagreements between the recs on a suitable price. So far no link has been formed and AT&amp;T has backed away from taking an equity slice. Sorting out the management structures will be among the chief considerations for Kleinwort Benson. Its over-riding task, however, is to maximise the value of the Grid to recs. While the City estimation of the Grid is at least Pounds 4bn and possibly Pounds 5bn, the company is valued in the rec balance sheets at Pounds 780m on a historic cost accounting basis or Pounds 2.2bn on a current cost basis. There is therefore significant scope for unlocking value and boosting the recs' share prices. But the companies will have to tread carefully politically. One problem is that the Grid was a government gift to the recs when they were vested. Capital gains tax could therefore be as high as 33 per cent of the value of whatever proportion of the company the recs decide to sell. Offering shareholders separate shares in the Grid also presents problems to shareholders since there could be an advanced corporation tax liability. Mr Nick Pink, analyst at SG Warburg Securities, says a tax efficient structure could be devised but there are dangers. 'Avoidance could damage relations with the government and there is considerable scope for unflattering media coverage.' Such considerations will influence the recs' decision on how much of the Grid to sell, with anything from 25 per cent upwards possible in one or more tranches. They will also have to decide if they want to sell as separate entities some of the non core businesses like Energis or pump storage facilities for generating electricity. The final uncertainty is timing. Labour's threat before the last election to 'take control' of the Grid still weighs heavily on the recs. If the shares are widely distributed, it would be more difficult for a future government to effect renationalisation. That means a flotation before 1997 is a virtual certainty. Within the National Grid, next spring is considered the best bet.  -------------------------------------------                POWER SHARING:            National Grid's owners  -------------------------------------------                                     %  ------------------------------------------- Eastern Electricity              12.5 East Midlands Electricity         8.4 London Electricity               10.5 Manweb                            5.5 Midlands Electricity              9.2 Northern Electricity              6.5 Norweb                            8.2 Seeboard                          7.3 Southern Electricity             11.0 South Wales Electricity           5.4 South Western Electricity         6.3 Yorkshire Electricity             9.2  ------------------------------------------- The government holds one special share  -------------------------------------------</p>

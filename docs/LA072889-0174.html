			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BOOK CLAIMS PLAYER ABUSE;  </P> <P> 'SUGAR DADDY' TIED TO NORTH CAROLINA DRUGS  </P> <P> "Personal Fouls," the book about North Carolina State basketball, alleges that  Chris Washburn used cocaine as a player and that a "sugar daddy" gave the team  gifts and substances to mask drug abuse, the Charlotte Observer reported.  </P> <P> The newspaper, which obtained an advance copy of the book Thursday, also said  author Peter Golenbock quoted an unidentified player as saying Coach Jim  Valvano knew Washburn was using cocaine.  </P> <P> The book, the Observer said, quotes an unidentified former teammate as saying  the following about Washburn:  </P> <P> " 'Wash' would play games on coke. The first half he'd play great, and then the  coke would wear off, and in the second half he wouldn't do a thing."  </P> <P> Washburn, who left North Carolina State after his sophomore year, has been  banned for life by the NBA for substance abuse.  </P> <P> The book also says "sugar daddy" supplied players with money, clothes, stereo  equipment and substances to mask drugs in urine tests, according to the  newspaper.  </P> <P> Valvano, North Carolina's basketball coach and athletic director, could not be  reached for comment. His lawyer, Art Kaminsky, said neither he nor Valvano  could comment until they read the book.  </P> <P> "A quick review of 'Personal Fouls' by university officials indicates the book  is a work of fiction and has no relationship to the reality of the fine  basketball program at NCSU," Albert Lanier, vice chancellor for university  relations, said in a statement read by a university spokeswoman.  </P> <P> "Therefore the university does not find any reason to further address the book,  point-by-point or in general."  </P> <P> Golenbock quoted former Wolfpack Manager John Simonds extensively but did not  identify many of the players he claimed to have interviewed.  </P> <P> Golenbock referred to that practice as "something I hate to do but in many  cases the only way I could impart the information and at the same time protect  the source. Almost every conversation I had, I taped. The tapes are in a safety  deposit box."  </P> <P> Simon &amp; Schuster announced in February that its Pocket Books division had  dropped plans to publish the book. It was published by Carroll &amp; Graf  Publishers.  </P> <P> The original dust jacket, distributed in January, accused Valvano of exploiting  his players and claimed wrongdoing in academics, drug testing and finances,  among other things.  </P> <P> Valvano and Chancellor Bruce Poulton denied the claims. Valvano said Golenbock  did not contact him about the book.  </P></p>

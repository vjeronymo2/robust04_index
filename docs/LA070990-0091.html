			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOY, 6, PULLED UNCONSCIOUS FROM POOL  </P> <P> A 6-year-old boy who was found at the bottom of a back-yard swimming pool in  which he had been playing with four other children remained in critical  condition Sunday night.  </P> <P> Adam Christopher Harris of Los Angeles was pulled from four feet of water at a  home in the 200 block of Virginia Place, Costa Mesa Police Sgt. Loren Wyrick  said.  </P> <P> Adam and his brother came to the Costa Mesa home Sunday morning with their  neighbor, Javier Rangel, a Los Angeles parking lot attendant, and Rangel's two  children.  </P> <P> Rangel's nephew, Carlos Montes, has rented the three-bedroom home for the past  year, along with two cousins. Roberto Montes, 26, and Felipe Montes, 19.  Several times since then, the three have invited friends and relatives over for  barbecues and to swim in the home's 15-by-30-foot pool.  </P> <P> During the late morning and early afternoon, Adam and four other children  played in the pool as adults watched them from the back-yard barbecue area,  said Carlos Montes, who works in a welding shop.  </P> <P> But around 1:50 p.m., one of the children ran to them and said that Adam was at  the bottom of the pool, Montes said.  </P> <P> "The last we saw he was at the edge playing on the stairs," Montes said. "The  next thing we knew, he was in the middle of the pool, lying at the bottom. It  was very rapid the way it happened."  </P> <P> Rangel immediately jumped in the pool and pulled Adam out, Montes said. As  others went to call an ambulance, Rangel tried to revive Adam by mouth-to-mouth  resuscitation and by massaging the boy's chest, but the boy didn't respond,  Montes said.  </P> <P> Paramedic Keith Fujimoto said that when he and three other paramedics arrived,  the scene was "pandemonium."  </P> <P> Adam was lying on the deck face down, he said. Paramedics then tried to revive  him, but "he was already in cardiac and respiratory arrest," Fujimoto said.  </P> <P> They then rushed him to College Hospital Costa Mesa, where doctors were able to  restore a pulse, although Adam was still in a coma, he said.  </P> <P> Witnesses at the house said Adam could have been under water as long as three  minutes, Fujimoto said. He added that Adam did not know how to swim and had  been told to remain "on the edge of the pool."  </P> <P> Montes estimated Sunday afternoon that Adam had been underwater no longer than  30 seconds judging by the last time an adult had glanced over at the pool area.  </P> <P> Fujimoto said that although so many adults were around, "something like that  can happen so quickly."  </P> <P> Adam was later transferred to Childrens Hospital of Orange County, where he  remained in critical condition.  </P> <P> Fujimoto said children can experience brain damage after four to six minutes  under water.  </P> <P> "It was real touch-and-go," he said.  </P> <P> Montes described the boy as quiet and "very tranquil." He said that this was  Adam's first visit to the Costa Mesa home.  </P> <P> Police contacted Adam's parents later in the day, Wyrick said.  </P> <P> "We all feel bad here," Montes said.  </P> <P> Since the beginning of the year, five children have drowned in swimming pools  or hot tubs in Orange County. Drowning is a leading cause of death in the  county among children under the age of 5.  </P> <P> "It's very tragic, but it could happen to anyone," said Elizabeth McGrail, a  next-door neighbor.  </P></p>

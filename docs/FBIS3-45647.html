			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Zhao Jiangping (6392 3068 1627) of the Policy </F> and Regulation Department of the State Administration of  Exchange Control: "Foreign Exchange Control System and Foreign  Exchange Market"; from "XINHUA Mail Box"]    [Text] Beijing, 20 Dec (XINHUA) -- "We should reform the  foreign exchange control system, set up a market-based  manageable floating exchange rate system, and an integrated and  standardized foreign exchange market. The Renmini should  gradually become a convertible currency." This idea was put  forward in the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some  Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market  Economic Structure." It represents an important decision by the  CPC Central Committee to resolve key issues in our reform of the  foreign exchange control system, after comprehensively and  systematically analyzing and summing up the history and present  conditions of China's foreign exchange control. It will play an  active role in pushing forward the drive to improve and develop  foreign exchange control.    China has achieved fairly rapid economic growth since the  reform and opening up; but the overall economic level is low.  To fully utilize limited foreign exchange resources, it is  still necessary for the state to exert various degrees of  control. The main purpose is to ensure an increase in foreign  exchange and its reasonable usage, and to facilitate a basic  balance in China's foreign exchange income and expenses as well  as international account income and expenses so as to ensure the  opening up policy; economic ties and trade with foreign  countries; and to create conditions for the final goal of making  the Reminbi a convertible currency.    China's current foreign exchange control system was  established and developed during the course of deepening reform  of the economic structure. It has played a fairly active role  in promoting China's economic ties and trade with foreign  countries. But during the course of building a socialist  economic structure, problems existing in the current foreign  exchange system began to crop up. Such problems need to be  gradually improved through various concrete measures.    1. To change the coexistence of the official rate and market  rate of the Renminbi. The official rate is adjusted and  announced by the State Administration of Exchange Control in  accordance with China's economic development and the condition  of its foreign trade in particular, in overall consideration of  commodity price levels at home, international income and  expenses, and the fluctuation of major foreign currencies on the  international financial market. The official rate is mainly  applied to part of the foreign exchange income and expenses of  the central authorities, part of non-trade foreign exchange  income and expenses, as well as the settlement of some  international accounts. The market rate is regulated and  decided by the demand-and-supply rule of the market. Under  normal conditions, the government will not interfere in the  fluctuation of the exchange rate. The market rate has played an  important role in regulating China's foreign exchange funds.    The system affording the coexistence of the renminbi's  official and market exchange rates took shape under special  historical circumstances, it is an expression of China's price  system and distribution system in the distribution of foreign  exchange at the present stage, and it is a transient phenomenon  appearing during the course of economic reform. As a system  governing exchange rates during a special period, this system  has played its part in promoting the development of China's  economic relations and trade with foreign countries, but it has  also some harmful effects. The renminbi's two different  exchange rates and the two different ways of settling accounts  that this phenomenon has created are neither favorable for the  efficient use of the nation's foreign exchange resources nor for  reestablishing China's lawful status in GATT. Thus, the  mechanisms causing the coexistence of two different exchange  rates must be replaced by a well-managed and market-based  floating exchange rate system.    2. The current market which regulates foreign exchange must  be restructured and a foreign exchange market with uniform  standards to follow should be established.    China started to regulate foreign exchange in October 1980,  and the scope of regulation has been expanding over the past  decade or so. From regulating foreign exchange held by Chinese  and foreign enterprises, the scope of business has now expanded  to regulating foreign exchange held by individuals. The  regulated prices are determined by supply and demand in the  regulated foreign exchange markets. [sentence as received]  There are now more than 100 foreign exchange regulatory centers  and 18 foreign exchange open markets. These markets have been  playing positive roles in adjusting a foreign exchange surplus  or shortage, alleviating problems caused by a foreign exchange  shortage, accelerating the circulation of foreign exchange, and  making more efficient use of foreign exchange.    However, because the regulatory markets in various parts of  the country are established according to administrative  demarcation, their establishment has given rise to problems  which hinder the development of China's foreign exchange markets  and which restrict them from demonstrating their functions --  problems such as regional barriers, the inefficient lateral  circulation of foreign exchange, unequal and unstable foreign  exchange rates, and restricted market development. Thus,  establishing a foreign exchange market with uniform standards to  follow is an important aspect in restructuring the foreign  exchange control system.    3. To attain the goal of having the renminbi be exchangeable  for foreign currencies is a long-term development target that  China has set for reforming its foreign exchange control system  and banking systems, but this reform will take time.    The ultimate goal that China has set for reforming its  foreign exchange control system and the scientifically conceived  plan for the process is to make the renminbi a convertible  currency step by step. Attaining this goal is an objective  demand set for China to reform its foreign exchange control  system so that the nation can open wider to the outside world  and establish a socialist market economic system. But the level  of China's development shows that we still cannot meet certain  basic requirements needed for the renminbi's convertibility, and  so we still need time to create the necessary conditions to  attain this objective through real reforms. For example, we must  reform the current foreign exchange system to improve the  mechanisms governing the operation of the foreign exchange  market; we must improve the mechanisms for setting the  renminbi's exchange rates through establishing a market-based  and well-managed system which governs floating exchange rates;  and the state must increase its foreign exchange reserves  through improving its ability to increase foreign exchange  revenues and conserving foreign exchange spending. As China's  overall national strength becomes greater, becomes more capable  of establishing foreign contacts, and enjoys higher economic  status in the world, the process which seeks the renminbi's  convertibility also will accelerate.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Radio Today" program] </F>   [Text] The African National Congress has removed the name  of Nelson Ramodike, the chief minister of Lebowa, from its list  of national candidates for next week's election. We approached  him for his response to this development:    [Ramodike] The leader of COSATU [Congress of South African  Trade Unions], Mr. Sam Shilowa, approached me over the weekend  and we had a private talk at the ranch hotel, and he requested  me to withdraw from the national list of the African National  Congress because the ANC regional executive council under the  chairmanship of the premier candidate of the African National  Congress, Mr. Ngoako Ramatlhodi, said their followers are not  satisfied that my name is placed on the national list. He  accused me of having allowed my colleague, Mr. Lawrence Mokhudu  Ledwaba, to register United People's Front [UPF] for election  purposes. I explained that it is my profound policy, and it is  on the other hand a democratic right for each and every person,  each and every political party, to take part in the elections.    [Correspondent Angie Diedrichs] Mr. Ramodike, but at this  stage, you are apparently going to be taken off the list. What  are your plans now?    [Ramodike] Well, my party, the United People's Front, has  already demanded that I should come back and we forge ahead  together for campaigns in the Northern Tranvaal region.    [Diedrichs] Mr. Ramodike, I take it then that you intend  returning to the UPF?    [Ramodike] Well, that is a demand and the request by our  political organization, that if the ANC followers in the  Northern Transvaal are not satisfied with me for problems that  are here in the Northern Transvaal, especially administrative  problems, then they are welcoming me back to United People's  Front.    [Diedrichs] Mr. Ramodike, looking at administrative  problems,  the TEC also announced today that it was going to appoint two  executive directors to govern Lebowa before and during the  elections. What are your reactions to that?    [Ramodike] I rejoice; the people of Lebowa rejoice. The  cabinet of Lebowa welcome the decision taken by the TEC upon our  request, and we indeed feel very much gratified that Mr. Fourie  should pull out of Lebowa and in his place, or in the place of  task teams, the executive directors be appointed.</p>

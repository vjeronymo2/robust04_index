			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Observer: Leaderless in . . . And just what is wrong with Leeds anyway? One year to the day since Mike Blackburn said he was quitting as boss of Leeds Permanent building society to head for Halifax, the UK's fifth-biggest society still lacks a chief executive. Even allowing for an interruption while the society flirted with National &amp; Provincial, it's clear that qualified candidates have scarcely been falling over themselves to apply. Leeds insists it doesn't feel snubbed and underlines how well it's doing under its existing management. So why does its spokesman have to say 'if you're writing something, say that Leeds is a nice place; it's a very vibrant northern city'?</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 22 (CNS)--There is an urgent need  for a fundamental change to China's statistical and survey  system, because the system no longer meets the increasingly  complicated economic structure and diversified patterns involved  by bodies subject to the current statistical system, the  Director of the State Statistical Bureau, Mr Zhang Sai, said at  a national statistical work meeting held today here.    The bureau sees the pattern for restructuring of the  statistical system in such a way that a new statistical system  had to be set up by which periodical general surveys would be  staged centering on a regular sampling survey and helped by a  comprehensive statistical graph, key investigation and  scientific projection. The new system is aimed at ensuring the  gathering of evidence for accurate, timely and comprehensive  statistical figures for reference by the government in its  decision-making.    Starting this year, the bureau will adopt a new statistical  system in which collection of information will be made on a  regular basis from the grass roots which can effectively reflect  the market economy, marking a change from the planned economy to  the market economy. Mr Zhang pointed out that some significant  statistics collected in recent years showed trends and changes  in the economy. As contradictions are growing prominent between  partial and overall interests, regional and central interests  and between individuals as well as collective interests and the  state interests, the possibility of distortion of statistics is  becoming greater. The original statistical system in line with  the planned economy no longer meets the needs of the new  situation and it is yet to be restructured.    The bureau has warned against falsification of statistics  aimed at showing inaccurate results. Such statistics would have  an adverse impact on decision-making regarding the economy made  by the government and in turn result in damage to the national  economy. It has to be seriously dealt with.    A large overhaul of national statistical practical will be  jointly held by the Financial and Economic Committee of the  Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the  Ministry of Supervision, the Bureau of Legislative Affairs of  the State Council and the State Statistical Bureau in the second  half of this year. Entities and officials found guilty of  malpractice in statistical practice will be seriously dealt with  and punished.</p>

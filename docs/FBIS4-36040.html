			<p>CSO     [Text] Washington, 16 Ordibehesht [26 April] IRNA -- Last  week, after several rounds of negotiations with financial  officials in this country's Export Insurance Company in  Copenhagen, the delegation from the Central Bank of the Islamic  Republic of Iran to Denmark succeeded in signing a contract for  the repayment of credits due.    Seyyed Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli, chief of the Central Bank of  the Islamic Republic of Iran, who was in Washington with a  high-level economic delegation to take part in joint sessions of  the IMF and the World Bank, announced above. He said: Based on  this agreement, all unpaid credits to Iran's government and  private institutions will be paid out of credits given to the  Islamic Republic of Iran for this purpose.    The aforementioned credits exceed $210, and they cover all  the commitments that are due in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20  March 1995].    Based on the signed agreement, the grace period before  repayment begins on these new credits is two years and the  repayment period is two years (until the year 2000).    The credits lacking insurance will also be repaid based on  the same conditions.    According to 'Adeli, the delegation from the Central Bank of  the Islamic Republic of Iran to Germany, which was responsible  for negotiating with a number of German companies, including  Siemens, Benz, Grundig, Krupp, Philips, [?Prusag] and others,  has also recently been able to reach agreements about extending  the repayment of 520 million marks [DM], which lacked Germany's  Hermes export insurance.    This agreement is separate from the previous DM4 billion  agreement recently made between the Islamic Republic of Iran and  the German bank.</p>

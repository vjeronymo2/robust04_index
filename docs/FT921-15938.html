			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Observer: Dutch connection Ocean Group is only a fifth of the size of its old enemy - P &amp; O - but it still seems able to hire a classier sort of non-executive director. Its latest recruit - 55-year-old John Loudon - is one of business's international smoothies. Loudon's father and grand-father were managing directors of Royal Dutch Petroleum. His cousins include the chief executives of Akzo, and Pierson, Heldring and Pierson, and his younger brother, George, is chief executive of Midland Montagu. Although John sits on the boards of Freddy Heineken and Paul van Vlissingen's companies and served in the Dutch cavalry, he has spent most of his career as a London merchant banker, first with Lazards and then Rothschilds. Since 1988 he has been involving himself with merchant banking boutiques and a string of international directorships. Loudon's friendship with Royal Dutch Petroleum's Dirk de Bruyne, who recently retired from Ocean on reaching 70, probably had something to do with his new appointment. He should be able to open doors for Ocean but his family pedigree still looks more impressive than his own achievements to date.</p>

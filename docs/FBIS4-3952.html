			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] Two former Iranian military officials have demanded  at a court hearing that a Taiwan state-run bank return $15  million that Iran paid for arms that were never delivered. The  mysterious arms deal began in 1991 when Iran transferred the  money to a Midland Bank in London to the Taiwan Changhua  Commercial Bank [sentence as heard]. Iran had wanted to buy  bullets and other like ammunition from Taiwan's arms dealers for  use in its eight-year war against Iraq, which ended with a cease  fire in August 1988. But the Taipei government later turned  down the sale.    (Aduba Hatami) and (Motosher Fatayi) told the Taiwan High  Court they came to Taiwan in 1981 with another defense ministry  official but the Taiwan bank rejected their demand for the  money. The bank said that the money already had been withdrawn  by three men presenting passports bearing the names of the  Iranian officials listed by the Midland Bank as the recipients.  Iran's Defense Ministry filed a lawsuit in the Taipei District  Court to reclaim the amount. The Changhua Bank argued that its  clients had been the Midland Bank, not the Iranian Government.  The local high court did not say when it would deliver its  final verdict.</p>

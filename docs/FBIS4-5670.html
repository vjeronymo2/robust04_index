			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- New party Sakigake leader  Masayoshi Takemura on Wednesday [13 April] expressed  disaffection with burgeoning intra-coalition moves to put  forward Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as next prime minister.  Takemura told a news conference at Sakigake's headquarters in  Tokyo that coalition parties should conclude discussion on a  possible recombination of political parties that will comprise a  new coalition government before picking their prime ministerial  candidate.    Coalition parties "have not initiated discussion on what  framework a new government should have," Takemura said.    Takemura called on other chiefs of coalition parties to band  together to reconcile their difference over key policy  objectives before initiating full-fledged talks on picking a new  prime minister.    "The responsible leaders of coalition parties should  assemble, analyze the situation and then start debate on what  prospects (a new government) should have," he said.    "If they could reconcile their differences, we could go  ahead  with the current framework. However, if we failed to strike  such accord, we should consider forming a new recombination of  parties," he said.    Earlier in the day, a senior Sakigake official said the  party  will remain in the ruling coalition.    There may remain "an unpleasant feeling" between Sakigake  and  Shinseito, however, said the official, who spoke to reporters on  condition of anonymity. Shinseito is regarded as the most  influential force in the seven-party coalition.    During the course of the power struggle following Hosokawa's  announcement of his resignation last Friday, Sakigake has sided  with the coalition's biggest group, the Social Democratic Party,  to oppose Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's influence  over the choice of a successor to Hosokawa, political sources  said.</p>

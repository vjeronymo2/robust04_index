			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Patten bears in mind where his popularity comes from: Limits to governor's room to move If there was one thing which came out of Governor Chris Patten's speech to Hong Kong's Legislative Council yesterday it was the attention he and his top advisers pay to public opinion in the colony. Hong Kong's willingness to stick by Mr Patten, in open opposition to China's wishes, has become a limiting factor on the governor's room to manoeuvre and partly explains why yesterday he said he would be introducing only part of his democracy plans on December 15, leaving the more contentious issues to a later bill. The governor told LegCo his administration would introduce a bill to: lower Hong Kong's voting age to 18 from 21 years; abolish appointments to local government so that elections for district boards and municipal councils would be conducted on a fully democratic basis in 1994 and 1995; allow Hong Kong delegates to 'people's congresses', the mainland's rubber-stamping legislatures, to stand for election in Hong Kong; legislate for a third of LegCo's 60 seats to be drawn from 20 single-member constituencies. Mr Patten is fond of pointing out that his colleagues in the British government would die for his popularity ratings. But this disguises a shrewder calculation: that a Hong Kong governor's popularity is only skin deep, especially just 3 1/2 years away from the resumption of Chinese sovereignty. The governor admitted as much when asked what he would put in this yet-to-be-drafted second bill. Would it be his original 1992 proposals for broadening the democratic franchise, or the compromise offer made during talks at which he backed away from those plans? 'We've got to try to find the broadest ground on which to pitch our tents,' he said. His close aide on constitutional matters, Mr Michael Sze, secretary for constitutional affairs, stressed this point when commenting on why Mr Patten had decided to wait 11 days to table the first bill. 'As a local citizen of Hong Kong, I think the community, especially in light of its reaction to March 12, would expect us to act in a measured manner,' he said. This is a reference to the momentary evaporation of public support when Mr Patten went to the wall last March for Hong Kong representation - especially Mr Sze's - at bilateral talks about the colony's political future. Opinion polls showed that if faced with a choice between representation at the talks or negotiations, Hong Kong's community would choose the latter. China has told Britain that it will break off talks about Hong Kong's political development if Mr Patten tables his first-stage bill. Such a threat will no doubt unsettle public opinion and the business community, but on these narrow issues Beijing's threats are unlikely to persuade Legco members not to support it. So Mr Patten can feel relatively confident that he has this support. There is no political party in LegCo with a representation greater than two members that opposes these measures. Conservative members, notably those aligned with the Liberal party, will no doubt come under pressure from the Xinhua news agency, Beijing's bulwark in the colony, to oppose the governor's bill. But Mr Allen Lee, the Liberal leader, has said publicly too often that his party supports the measures contained in the first-stage bill for them to back down. Beijing will also run the risk of looking wholly unreasonable if it opposes the first bill, especially given that it allows Hong Kong delegates to its own National People's Congress and other congresses to serve on LegCo. Hong Kong law currently prohibits those serving in a legislature of another territory from standing for public office. Where Mr Patten's difficulties will lie, and where China's influence in LegCo is predominant, is on measures which will be included in the second bill, which goes to the heart of Mr Patten's attempt to increase democracy in Hong Kong. These concern broadening the franchise in LegCo's 30 'functional constituencies' (industry votes) and possibly on the structure of an election committee that will nominate 10 members to the 1995 LegCo. However, Beijing's veiled threat yesterday to harm Hong Kong's economy will unsettle the stock market. And in the coming weeks the governor may find that he receives indirect support from a source that is usually opposed to his plans: the business community. Many of China's advisers are leading tycoons in the colony; many of the children of China's most senior leaders have, or manage, large family investments in Hong Kong. This coalition of forces opposes what Mr Patten wants to do, but it also has a keen sense of its and China's economic self-interest. The business lobby has proved powerful in the past in staying the hand of those in the Chinese leadership who might have been tempted to act before they think. It may yet prove successful again.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Air France link with Continental AIR France and Continental Airlines of the US yesterday agreed to co-ordinate their businesses. Both carriers already have links with Air Canada and the new deal creates one of the biggest transatlantic alliances in the airline industry. Air France and Continental will sell seats on each other's flights and adjust timetables to improve connections between their services. The deal will also see the two airlines moving into each other's terminals in their main airports at Charles de Gaulle in Paris, and Newark, New Jersey. They are already together at Houston, Texas, another of Continental's hubs. The two carriers will link their frequent-flyer incentive programmes, run joint promotions and link package tours. The move is Continental's first collaboration since it emerged from Chapter 11 protection in April this year. It completes a triangular alliance that compares in size with other transatlantic teams such as British Airways and USAir and KLM and Northwest Airlines. Mr Bernard Attali, chairman of Air France, said the French carrier and Continental would look at ways to extend their agreement to 'intertwine' businesses further. This would include possible collaboration in maintenance, catering, information systems and code-sharing, under which a passenger booking a two-stage flight involving both airlines would receive a single ticket and flight number. 'An equity stake is not on the agenda today,' Mr Attali added, although both airlines refused to discuss the possibility of such a link in the future. Air Canada took a 27.5 per cent stake in Continental as part of the arrangement which took the US carrier out of Chapter 11. It already does maintenance work on some Continental aircraft and has begun flights to Houston. The alliance between Air France, Continental and Air Canada may increase pressure on other European and US carriers to conclude discussions successfully on closer co-operation. American Airlines, one of the big three carriers in the US, had been in talks with several European airlines, including Air France and Lufthansa of Germany. Continental's revenues last year exceeded Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) and it serves 197 airports in 28 countries. Air France's 1992 sales were FFr57bn (Pounds 6.44bn) and it flies to 228 destinations in 109 countries.</p>

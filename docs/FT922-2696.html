			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Letter: The case for proceeding with the Jubilee Line extension Sir, Your correspondent Richard Tomkins failed to address the wider issues in his analysis of the Jubilee Line extension ('No jubilation at the end of the line', June 5): The development of Docklands as a commercial centre to supplement the existing City and West End will help to spread the load from those established areas where the pressure on the existing services, particularly transport, is too great. The Jubilee Line will provide a much needed new link to the Underground network from Waterloo and London Bridge mainline stations (north of the river). This will improve mobility for commuters around the whole of central London and again will spread the load and take some of the pressure off the existing Underground interchanges north of the river. The Jubilee Line extension will create greater accessibility to the consistently deprived south-east and east London areas and this accessibility will enhance the opportunity for increasing economic activity in these areas. A forward thinking London should wish to enhance accessibility over a much wider area of the centre if it wants to maintain its status as one of the premier world financial centres as well as enhancing its prospects for increasing market share against world competition through to the next millennium. Far from shelving the project, the financial case for immediately proceeding with the Jubilee Line extension is compelling. If our forefathers had taken your correspondent's view, we would not have today's underground network at all. Much of it was built into green fields. Economic activity followed the newly created accessibility. Paul Rubie, Flat D, 13 Crediton Hill, London NW6</p>

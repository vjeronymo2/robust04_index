			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Government treads fine line on Sinn Fein queries Early reaction to last night's government comments on Sinn Fein's questions suggested that London had successfully trodden the fine line between responding to genuine republican queries on the Downing Street Declaration and not being lured into arm's-length negotiations. The only jarring note in a chorus of positive or neutral remarks came from the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, which has put opposition to the declaration at the heart of its European election campaign. Mr Paisley accused the government of being 'in cahoots with Dublin while Dublin is in cahoots with the murderers'. He was sick of the 'lying duplicity' and arrogance of the government which had taken time to write a 20-page 'love letter' to Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. But Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, was much more positive, saying it was 'a very good thing that the government refuted and rebutted all the monstrous assertions which appeared in Mr Adams's paper.' He added: 'If that not been done it would have given encouragement to republican terrorists and would have made the law-abiding people of Northern Ireland uneasy. Now it has all been cleared up.' There was 'no room, no excuse, no justification for violence and there is no need for any further clarification,' Mr Molyneaux said. But he predicted Mr Adams would 'go on rabbiting on until he devalues that device just as he has devalued the phoney ceasefire.' Mr David Trimble, the UUP MP for Upper Bann, called for political talks on the province's future to resume as soon as possible. 'There is going to be no change in government policy,' he said. 'There is nothing new in it.' Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party, said the government was 'right to answer so straightforwardly, comprehensively and honestly'. He added: 'It was not a fudge nor was it a brush-off. The ball is very firmly in the court of Sinn Fein. A line is drawn in the sand. The reality is that they must make up their minds.' Mr Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said: 'Sinn Fein can no longer use clarification as an excuse to prolong their support for and justification of the use of violence for political ends.' 'Sinn Fein must now renounce the use of force and enter political negotiations to seek a just and lasting settlement on the basis of Irish self-determination as specified in the Downing Street Declaration.' Lord Holme, Liberal Democrat Northern Ireland spokesman, called on Sinn Fein to call an immediate end to violence and said the IRA's support deserved to 'dwindle even further if they procrastinate another day'. In addition to answering one of the questions directly (see left), the government spelt out a number of points more clearly than it has before. First, it stated categorically that 'acceptance of the joint declaration is not a precondition for entering the talks process.' Downing Street had edged towards clarifying this point earlier in the week, saying an end to the IRA's armed campaign was the 'primordial' requirement for Sinn Fein to enter political talks. Second, it emphasised that 'no political objective could properly be excluded from discussion in the talks process.' Third, it said that 'a lasting and general peace would render military operations in support of the police no longer necessary'. Whether the exercise is judged ultimately to be a success now depends on the republican response. If it did decide to throw down its arms, the IRA would face the difficult task of explaining why it had pressed on with its campaign over the five months since December for the sake of one direct clarification and a few supplementary comments. London last night appeared to recognise this when it said there was 'no conceivable justification for continuing to rob people of their lives, least of all a call for a textual explanation of the joint declaration'. But Sinn Fein's guarded initial reaction suggested it at least welcomed London's decision to take genuine queries over the joint declaration's meaning seriously. The ball is back in their court.</p>

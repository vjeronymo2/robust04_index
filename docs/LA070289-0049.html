			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHERE THERE'S SMOKE  </P> <P> R. W. de Vries' letter of June 11 assures us who choose to smoke that Paris is  the place to be. He further indicates that most of Europe happily puffs away.  What a relief. Although I have paid the same prices for travel, food and  lodging as nonsmokers, recent experiences have led me to believe that it is  better to sit home and watch my bank account accumulate than try to travel.  </P> <P> To be treated as a pariah and subjected to vicious attacks by health-fad  terrorists is not my idea of enjoyable retirement travel. Although I have  always dreamed of seeing my own country first, I am packing my bags for Europe.  </P> <P> JANET MAIN  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

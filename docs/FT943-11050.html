			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / De Klerk vows to stay in coalition South African Deputy President F W de Klerk yesterday dismissed speculation that his National party planned to pull out of the country's coalition government of national unity, saying that the party's aim was to prove that consensus government could succeed. Persistent reports that backbench MPs wanted the National party to withdraw from the coalition cabinet have unsettled financial markets and shaken confidence in the three-month-old government. Some MPs have complained that the party, which is a junior partner in a coalition dominated by the African National Congress, should act as a traditional opposition party rather than merely appearing to endorse ANC decisions. Mr de Klerk dismissed such speculation, saying some MPs might advocate withdrawal but the party caucus had never discussed the issue. The NP, which ruled South Africa alone for 46 years, fought to ensure the country's new constitution would enforce coalition government, rather than allowing the majority party to rule alone. Under the constitution, all parties that won more than 5 per cent of the vote in April's elections are entitled to proportional representation in cabinet. But the NP is struggling to define a role for itself within the new cabinet. Mr de Klerk acknowledged that this meant 'walking the tightrope' between classic opposition and subservience to the majority party. So far, he said, he had deliberately taken a low profile within government, where he is second deputy president after Mr Thabo Mbeki of the ANC. But he was now 'firing on all cylinders'. Political violence has risen again in KwaZulu/Natal province, with 22 dead at the weekend. Some of the killings were believed to be linked to Saturday's screening of the controversial TV series The Line, which the Inkatha Freedom party has complained is biased against Inkatha.</p>

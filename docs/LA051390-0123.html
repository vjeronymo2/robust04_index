			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PHYSICIAN PLEADS GUILTY TO COCAINE POSSESSION  </P> <P> A Torrance doctor already forced to give up his practice for a year for  illegally dispensing diet pills has been ordered to check into a drug  rehabilitation center and serve three years' probation after pleading guilty to  cocaine possession.  </P> <P> Martin Fred Bain, 62, will enroll at the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho Mirage for  at least four weeks of rehabilitation as part of a plea agreement reached  Thursday in South Bay Municipal Court.  </P> <P> As part of the agreement, a charge of driving under the influence of the drug  will be dropped at Bain's sentencing June 19, Deputy Dist. Atty. Diana Teran  said.  </P> <P> Had Bain been convicted after a trial, he would have faced a mandatory 90-day  jail sentence.  </P> <P> The charges grew out of a traffic arrest in November, 1988. Sheriff's deputies  reported that they found a vial of liquid cocaine, 40 tranquilizers, 11  hypodermic needles and $12,000 in cash in Bain's car.  </P> <P> Last month, Bain agreed to close his practice for a year after pleading no  contest to illegally dispensing diet pills and to charges that he allowed an  unqualified office assistant to do the same.  </P> <P> He was also fined $5,640 and placed on three years' probation.  </P></p>

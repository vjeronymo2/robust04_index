			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares easier after an active session THE UK stock market remained depressed yesterday as it waited for last night's Mansion House speech from Mr Norman Lamont, the British chancellor of the exchequer. With hopes for immediate cuts in interest rates again discouraged both in London and Frankfurt, UK stocks were left to make their own response to a flow of corporate developments. Investment activity remained high, with retail or customer business boosted by substantial placings of stock in blue chip companies. But the institutions traded very selectively and the FT-SE Index was influenced by arbitraging with stock index futures and by reaction to ICI's trading statement. The chief feature was an unexpected but agreed Pounds 935m counter-bid from Tomkins, the industrial conglomerate, for Ranks Hovis McDougall (RHM), the bakery group under offer from Hanson. ICI's third quarter results were every bit as bad as feared. Nor did the chairman's comments on the outlook provide much encouragement for a stock market already upset this week by statements from British Steel and Marks and Spencer. Shares in ICI fell very sharply in initial response to the profits news, helping to drag the Footsie down by 22.2 to its day's low. However, the shares rallied after ICI removed one cause for uncertainty by confirming that plans for the proposed demerger of its bioscience businesses remain on track. The absence of any change in rates following the routine Thursday meeting of the Bundesbank policy council, while no surprise in London, provided a further dampener on share prices. The Bank of England, through London money market activity, indicated that, as was also well understood, UK rates would not be changed during the session. However, the City's underlying conviction that domestic rates will be cut again soon was reflected in continued firmness in UK government bond prices, despite a further dip in sterling. The stock market was left to follow its own devices ahead of the chancellor's speech to the bankers and City representatives, which was not delivered until well after trading hours. The FT-SE Index steadied, helped by a calm opening to the new Wall Street session, and closed at 2,642.3, down 8.1 on the day. Seaq volume, boosted by the activity in ICI and in the RHM situation stocks, totalled 567.1m shares against 517.2m in the previous session. On Wednesday, retail business was worth Pounds 1.1bn, around the levels regarded as profitable for the London investment community. However, it was confirmed yesterday that BZW, the UK investment bank, had reduced staffing in its corporate finance division. Few City professionals expected any dramatic developments in Mr Lamont's speech in London last night, and most agreed that the financial markets will remain nervous over the next week as they await the outcome of the US presidential elections as well as of the Maastricht debate in the UK. Further reductions in UK interest rates are likely to provide the basis for the next move by the stock market.</p>

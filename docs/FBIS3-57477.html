"Its agenda was so crammed that the foreign ministers of  the two countries had to prolong the talk for almost one hour,"  said Galina Sidorova, political adviser of the Russian foreign  minister.    The ministers stressed that "a progressive and constant  exchange of views and visits at summit and high levels would be  continued between the two countries. A visit of PRC chairman  Jiang Zemin to Moscow is being planned. It will apparently take  place in the third quarter of the year. In preparation for a  new Russo-Chinese summit, Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin  will visit Beijing and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will  pay a visit to Moscow.    In the course of the negotiations, Sidorova noted, the sides  have discussed various aspects of economic and  military-technical cooperation between the two countries.  Kozyrev stressed Russia's readiness to go over to large-scale  ventures while simultaneously continuing the policy of expanding  traditional forms of economic relations. For instance, Russia  is expected to take part in the construction of the huge "three  gorges" hydropower complex in China.    The sides also discussed the possibility of Russia helping  China to reconstruct many enterprises, which were built with  Soviet aid.    The ministers noted the progress made during the talks on  the  mutual reduction of armed forces and confidence-building  measures on the border between the two countries. These talks  will be continued to try to conclude a corresponding agreement  already this year, Sidorova said.    The sides announced their readiness to continue negotiations  on border problems. The joint delegation of Russia, Kazakhstan,  Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to these talks will be led by  Aleksandr Panov, the new Russian deputy foreign minister.    During the discussion of problems linked with the  demarcation  of the border between the two countries, the ministers pointed  to the possibility of joint economic activity in the border  districts, including the disputed areas. The sides want a  status quo to be observed on the border after its demarcation.    Mutual interest in developing constructive cooperation in  the  military-technical sphere was expressed in the course of the  talks. Kozyrev said that it should be promoted with due account  of mutual interests and the observance of corresponding  international commitments.    Sidorova noted that the idea of promoting constructive  partnership with China, expressed by the Russian minister, "Does  not mean that we are allies with China in the direct sense of  the term. It implies Moscow's readiness to promote very close  interaction with Beijing in matters of mutual concern".  Moreover, Russia and China, as two great powers, proceed from  the understanding that they have both national and huge common  interests of regional and global character.    In reply to a request of his Chinese counterpart, Kozyrev  shared his view with him on the current political situation in  Russia, laying stress on the immutability of its foreign policy  which "remains presidential".</p>

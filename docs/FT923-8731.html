			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Israeli pledge to legalise PLO contact ISRAEL'S new government has indicated it will legalise contact with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, in a controversial step certain to draw strong criticism from the right. Mr Yossi Beilin, Israel's deputy foreign minister, yesterday described the law forbidding contact with the PLO as 'stupid', and said the government had a 'deep obligation' to change it. 'Everyone thinks this law is idiotic, that you cannot meet someone connected to the Palestine National Council (Palestinian parliament in exile) even if he is a professor in a Washington university,' Mr Beilin said. He was amplifying remarks made earlier by Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, who had told an Italian newspaper that the government planned to amend the 1986 law. Successive Israeli governments have described the PLO as a terrorist gang and have rejected any dealings with it. Mr Peres insisted he had no intention of meeting Mr Arafat, saying that such an event would be a media circus without consequence. The PLO has urged Israel to go beyond its plans simply to legalise contacts, by allowing Palestinians from outside the occupied territories to join Middle East peace talks, which resume in Washington later this month. Mr Suleiman Najjab, a member of the PLO executive committee, said: 'What is needed now from the Israeli government is a clear and public declaration that it recognises the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.' Under the terms of last October's Madrid conference the PLO was excluded from formal participation in direct talks aimed at ending the Arab-Israel dispute. But the new Israeli government has indicated flexibility about allowing Palestinians from the diaspora to take part in multilateral discussions on such issues as regional disarmament, economic assistance, water and the environment. The 1986 law had embarrassed the previous government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir. Israel had, under Mr Shamir, proved reluctant to implement the law in spite of its being flouted by Palestinian peace delegates from the occupied territories.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by jurist Sergey Zamoshkin, under the rubric </F> "Expert Opinion": "Crime Report: Reality or Myth?]    [Text] The Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD] has  published a "Report to the Citizens of Russia" on its work over  the year. It is a notable fact. But the real sensation is in the  data it published on the state of crime. The report says  proudly: "For the first time over the past five years, through  the common efforts of state and regional structures, the growth  of crime has been somewhat contained. In 1993 it increased by  only 1.4 percent." One would think we should cheer such a  progress. But somehow we are not happy.    Over the entire past year militia officers of all ranks, led  by Minister Viktor Yerin, had been scaring us with tales of  crime, quoting figures and facts, and saying that it was growing  at a horrible rate. They also explained the causes: imperfect  laws, insufficient powers of the MVD, loyalty to criminals, and  so on. So what happened? Is it that we were being scared on  purpose and now the deception has come out? More likely it is  now that an attempt is being made to deceive us. Many jurists  maintain that there has been no real improvement in the  situation.    If one carefully reads the MVD report, it becomes clear that  it contains far more significant data than the miserly  percentage points of the total increase in crime. Judge for  yourself. What kind of success are we talking about when grave  offenses--those that really frighten everyone--have increased  over the year by one-quarter? Premeditated murders are up by 27  percent; grave bodily injury, by 24 percent; assaults, by 32  percent; robberies, by 12 percent; incidents of hooliganism, by  31 percent; and the increase in the registered incidence of  swindling amounted to a whopping 140 percent. The overall  decline is achieved mainly by "trifles." But the worst part is  that crimes are not being solved. In one-half of the  instances--which is 1,360,000 crimes--the culprits have not been  found.    One more important point. Departmental statistics do not  correspond to reality--they embellish it. A considerable number  of crimes by different means are deliberately kept out of  reporting by the militia. Many of those who have been victimized  by criminals know that local militia precincts are reluctant to  register citizens' claims. Under all sorts of pretexts the  victims are persuaded not to file a claim or are forced to  change the circumstances of the event. The purpose is simple--to  avoid registering the crime. If they succeed, it immediately  improves two indicators of militia work: reports on crime and  reports on solving crimes. For the sake of good indicators,  criminal proceedings are not initiated, investigations are not  conducted, nobody looks for criminals, and they continue with  impunity, committing new crimes. The situation with respect to  car theft is indicative. According to the MVD report, over the  past year there have been 60,415 -- 3,067 fewer than in 1992.  Who will really believe that fewer cars get stolen? The  explanation is quite different: Not all victims' claims are  registered by militia.    It is impossible to develop reasonably effective measures  for  combating crime when we have reports that so clearly contradict  real life: It is hard to cure a disease when one does not know  the diagnosis. But our militia commanders want so much to look  good in the eyes of their superiors. As a result, while  admitting in the report that crime is a social phenomenon, and  that problems are growing, the MVD nevertheless promises to  somewhat "restrain" crime. The MVD is willing to admit its "own  shortcomings and considerable reserves to increase the efforts,"  but insists that their department still "is a steadily  functioning state structure capable of mobilizing and  effectively carrying out the tasks set for it. Attempts of some  political forces to weaken it and compromise it have been  unsuccessful." With such conclusions, it is hard to count on  truthfulness in MVD reports on its activities. Because any  criticism of the agency may be labeled a subversive action.    Of course, from time to time manipulations involving  failures  to register crimes come into the open. Sometimes it happens  because citizens complain; more often, as a result of procuracy  audits. Last year, for instance, the Procuracy registered more  than 40,000 crimes unregistered by militia--almost five percent  more than in 1992. It is impossible, however, to place a  procurator to look over every militiaman's shoulder. Besides,  what can the auditors do considering that their bosses, too,  demand that crime be "reduced?"    What to do? At this point, probably the only solution is in  a  more active position of local authorities. To a great extent,  the material and technical equipment of militia and personnel  matters are in their hands. The national crime suppression  program is useful, of course, but it will not be a panacea--the  main burden will still remain on the shoulders of local budgets.  So why pay for fake crime reports when people are afraid to  leave the house at night?</p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY FRIEND SOUGHT IN TEEN BEATING  </P> <P> "A friend of the family" is being sought for questioning in the brutal beating  of a 13-year-old girl in Hillcrest last week, authorities said Sunday.  </P> <P> The victim, Marcie Bradburn, was discovered about 10:30 a.m. Friday,  unconscious and lying near the site of the abandoned Sears store at Cleveland  and University avenues, police spokesman Bill Robinson said.  </P> <P> She apparently had been beaten with a baseball bat or other heavy instrument  and then choked. The girl lived with her mother in an apartment in the 1400  block of Morrow Way, less than two blocks away.  </P> <P> A 27-year-old man whom the family had befriended was believed to be involved in  the beating, Robinson said, but the spokesman stopped short of calling him a  suspect. Police did not release the man's name or his description, but said  they believe he is still in the San Diego area.  </P> <P> Bradburn is hospitalized in critical condition with extremely serious head  injuries, according to police. Her location is being withheld because the  assailant remains at large.  </P></p>

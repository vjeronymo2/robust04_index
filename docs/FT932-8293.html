			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (11): Coalition confounds its critics - There is new political stability IT is a tribute to President Aylwin's ability to govern by consensus that politics in Chile, once a matter of life and death, has become boring. Seven months ahead of general elections, it is already a foregone conclusion that the ruling Concertacion coalition of centre-left parties will form the next government, and that Senator Eduardo Frei, leader of the Christian Democrats, will become Chile's next president. The key to the Concertacion's success has been its unity and discipline, which have given Chile three years of stable government following the transition from dictatorship to democracy in 1990. The Concertacion confounded critics who believed the 17-party coalition would unravel once its principal goal - to oust General Pinochet - had been achieved. But according to Mr Edgardo Boeninger, President Aylwin's chief of staff, the experience of government has given the Concertacion a 'shared diagnosis and shared solutions that will make the coalition strong enough to last one or two decades.' 'At this point in history,' Mr Boeninger continues, 'the parties of the Concertacion need each other. The challenge will be to sustain this consensus over time.' The authority of the ruling coalition has been heightened by the total disarray in the opposition camp, where two right-wing parties are locked in a marriage of convenience, in a country where divorce is still illegal. Even Mr Manuel Feliu, the presidential candidate of the main opposition party, Renovacion Nacional, admits: 'The Chilean right today is shattered. We are not an alternative for power. Our main task is to unite the right to ensure it polls one-third of the votes, so that it can check the excesses of the next government.' Renovacion's spouse in this damage-limitation exercise is the Union of Independent Democrats (UDI). UDI wants its own party leader, Mr Jovino Novoa, to be the right's presidential candidate. The partners have yet to have their big showdown on who will finally go forward. Since the return of democracy, the two opposition groups have been locked in a battle of supremacy for Chile's sizeable right-wing constituency. While Renovacion's efforts to forge a modern conservative party along European lines have foundered, through political infighting, UDI remains unashamedly nostalgic for the days of authoritarian rule. The right has also been robbed of political ammunition, because President Aylwin's government successfully hijacked Gen Pinochet's economic model. Nevertheless, the Concertacion and the opposition remain deeply divided over the legacy of military rule. The government recently failed to pass a package of constitutional reforms in Congress, because it lacked the necessary two-thirds majority. Among other things, the reforms would have restored the president's power to dismiss military commanders-in-chief, and would have abolished the nine non-elected Senate seats that were filled with Pinochet appointees before he relinquished power. Although these issues lie at the heart of a fully-functioning democracy, they are unlikely to figure prominently in electoral debates. To understand why, it is necessary to remember that the Chilean military negotiated their departure from power, and effectively dictated the ground rules of civilian government. This explains the Concertacion's acceptance of Gen Pinochet's unassailable position at the helm of the army, why it turns a blind eye to the surveillance activities of army spies, and why it has not pressed human rights trials. 'The effects of the negotiated settlement will be around for at least another 20 years,' says Mr Oscar Godoy, a political scientist at the Catholic University in Santiago.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS LEFT-HANDER IS UNDER THE GUN;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASEBALL: MAJOR LEAGUE SCOUTS ARE EAGER TO GET A READING ON UCLA'S DAVE  ZANCANARO.  </P> <P> There are times when it looks as though a military platoon has been assigned to  Jackie Robinson Stadium. Actually, they are units of major league baseball  scouts, all with speed guns drawn and pointed through the backstop at UCLA  pitcher Dave Zancanaro.  </P> <P> Zancanaro's weapon? A 90-m.p.h. fastball and a change-up that tails away.  </P> <P> Sometimes, it has been more like a stampede. The scouts, who have spent hours  waiting for this hot prospect to pitch, will draw their guns during a game and  run over to the bullpen to clock Zancanaro's warmup pitches. They take what  they can get.  </P> <P> "Maybe I would be playing center field, or (designated hitter), and the coach  would have me warm up to relieve," Zancanaro said. "The scouts would follow me  down to the bullpen and point those guns at me, and I just look at my pitching  coach and shake my head. It's kind of a comedy thing. But it's flattering that  all these scouts are here to see me."  </P> <P> This is crunch time for Zancanaro, and it has little to do with UCLA's final  examinations. As a junior, he is expected by baseball experts to be one of the  first 10 players picked in major league baseball's amateur draft June 4.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for the scouts, though, it hasn't been easy to catch this  left-hander's pitching act. Instead, they have seen him run down fly balls,  hit, and, to their dismay, risk injury when he dives headfirst into a base.  </P> <P> "It make the scouts cringe," said his father, also Dave Zancanaro.  </P> <P> At the start of the season, the Bruins had an abundance of pitching talent, so  Zancanaro was a reliever. The plan was to use him in the outfield and then have  him relieve in the seventh or eighth inning.  </P> <P> For a time, it worked. For example, in a game March 6 against Cal State  Fullerton, Zancanaro started in center field, went three for five with five  runs batted in, and pitched the last three innings, earning the victory. He has  started 17 games as the designated hitter and 11 in the outfield.  </P> <P> "At one game against Cal, UCLA was ahead, 7-5, when Cal started rallying," said  his father. "David was playing center field, and UCLA had a pitcher warming up  in the bullpen. Time out was called to change pitchers, and (Coach Gary) Adams  had David warm up in the outfield with the right fielder.  </P> <P> "When Cal scored a run to close within 7-6, David was brought in from center to  pitch. They have done that a few other times and it was beginning to get a  little trying and tough on David. So he was about to go to the coaches when  they came and told him they weren't going to use him that way anymore."  </P> <P> Simply, Zancanaro was tired. Realistically, because of injuries, Adams needed  him as a starter. Since March 11, Zancanaro has been a regular in the rotation,  and has raised his record to 10-5 with five saves and a 2.98 earned-run  average. Moreover, he is still used as a designated hitter against right-handed  pitchers, and has a .257 batting average with three home runs and 20 RBIs.  </P> <P> But Zancanaro has always been an all-around athlete. His father talks about how  former Dodger left fielder Dusty Baker, who attended the same high school as  Zancanaro -- Del Campo in Fair Oaks near Sacramento -- would run track before  he played baseball.  </P> <P> "So on an off-day, David decided to do that too, and he ran in a track meet,"  Zancanaro Sr. said. "He won four events -- the 100, 200, long jump and anchored  the 400 relay."  </P> <P> And in a prep baseball tournament after Zancanaro's senior year, he got 15  hits, breaking the record of 11 held by major leaguers Steve Sax and Ricky  Jordan.  </P> <P> Zancanaro wasn't drafted then, but he says he wouldn't have been ready anyway.  </P> <P> "I'm ready to turn pro now, but then I just wasn't mature enough," he said. "I  would like to pitch, and that's what the scouts are looking at me for. I like  to start because it's like you have control of the game. But I like to relieve,  also. And a few scouts have asked me if I would be interested in playing the  outfield. I just want to play."  </P> <P> Scouts turned their attention to Zancanaro after last summer when his team, the  Auburn Cardinals of the Stan Musial League, won the West Regional and finished  second in the league's championship series. Zancanaro hit three home runs in  the regional, and was named most valuable player.  </P> <P> Then, during UCLA's fall league, the scouts began to show up, and have never  stopped. At one game, 10 members of the Dodger organization showed up.  </P> <P> The irony of this is that scouts say they have been told by their clubs not to  tout their prospects to the media because it makes it more difficult and more  expensive for clubs to sign the player.  </P> <P> At first, Zancanaro said the attention affected him a little.  </P> <P> "But I don't feel the pressure now," he said. "(Scouts) are only here because  of what I have done in the past, and nothing will change that. I figure I'll  just try my best and keep doing what I always have done."  </P> <P> And the agents?  </P> <P> "There's really nothing to talk to agents about yet and it's illegal to have  one while you are playing college ball," Zancanaro said. "Besides, my dad can  handle this. What's an agent going to get me at first, $5,000 more? It's not  certain yet that I'll be drafted in the first round anyway. That's something we  won't know until it happens."  </P> <P> For now, Zancanaro has set his sights on UCLA making the NCAA tournament and  the College World Series. Going into this weekend's final nonconference series  against Nevada Las Vegas, the Bruins were 37-23. Zancanaro is scheduled to  start today.  </P> <P> Should the Bruins not make it to the College World Series, Zancanaro says he  and his roommate, catcher Paul Ellis, will be home on June 4. Ellis leads the  nation in home runs and is also considered a top prospect.  </P> <P> "I'll be in bed," Zancanaro said, "just waiting for that phone to ring."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fang Su (2455 5685): "Hong Kong Economy: 1994 </F> Outlook Good All Along the Line?"]    [Text] A quarrel between China and the UK has greatly  damaged the political atmosphere, but feelings of political  uncertainty have vanished. People think: So what if there is a  spat? The outlook for the coming year is generally good for the  four main components of Hong Kong's economy: trade, the stock  market, real estate, and economic relations and trade between  China and Hong Kong, as well as for employment.    Hong Kong is a large corporation that is about to change  hands. The old boss is about to leave, and the new boss is  waiting to take over. However, the old and the new bosses are on  the outs with each other. They quarrel from morning until night.  What is interesting is that even though the bosses squabble, the  sky has not fallen. The work of the corporation has not only not  been impaired but has become more intense, and prospects are  that tomorrow will be better.    The following is the general situation in Hong Kong today:  Because of the wrangling between China and Hong Kong over the  political system, the political atmosphere has been greatly  damaged. Economically, however, even though political factors  unavoidably affect the economy, the people's general reaction  is: So what if China and the UK are having a spat? This also  makes sense. Before the two parties had a falling out, everyone  had a feeling of uncertainly because the political haze had  still not cleared. Now that they have turned on each other, each  taking up diametrically opposed positions, the feeling of  political uncertainty has vanished. Psychologically, everyone is  "relieved." Actually, despite the bad political atmosphere, both  the Chinese and the British know that the "economic card" is a  bad one to play. What can the Chinese Communists do to the Hong  Kong economy? At most, they may be able to continue to drag  their feet on the financial arrangements for the new airport.  Other matters pertaining to special operating rights may be side  issues, but mostly certain British-owned businesses would be  hurt. Aside from this, the Chinese Communists cannot bear down  too hard without damaging Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.  What is more, Chinese capital is at risk in Hong Kong, and Hong  Kong has such great economic value to the China mainland.    Inasmuch as the political atmosphere has gone from  uncertainty to relative certainty, political factors may be set  aside for the time being when discussing Hong Kong's economic  situation and prospects. Because the sky has not fallen, and the  basic elements in Hong Kong's economy are relatively good, it is  generally estimated that Hong Kong's economic growth during 1994  will be on a par with 1993. Actual growth will be more than 5  percent. Below, an evaluation of Hong Kong's future economic  situation is made on the basis of four things: 1) trade, 2) the  stock market, 3) real estate, 4) and Sino-Hong Kong economic  relations and trade, which taken together can convey an overall  picture of Hong Kong's economy.  <H5>  Trade: Growth of Two Large Markets </H5>   Abroad, inventories are low while mainland growth is  high. The trend of the two large markets can be perceived, and  trade prospects can be half predicted.    Hong Kong's economy has always depended on trade.    One source of data for evaluating Hong Kong's trade  situation  in the coming year is the semi-official report that the Hong  Kong Trade Development Bureau published at the beginning of  December 1993 titled, "Hong Kong Trade Prospects in 1994." This  research report may be summarized in the following two points:    1. Overseas markets are reviving slowly, but inventories are  low. In principal markets such as the United States, recovery  remains slow, but prospects are better than last year. Such  areas have imported little for some time, and they have pretty  well sold their inventories. If their economy takes an upturn  and the consumer market picks up, orders will increase.    2. The China mainland shows high growth, but inflation is a  worry. The China mainland economy has grown rapidly in recent  years. Its annual growth rate is 13 percent. During the last  half of 1993, regulation and control was instituted with a  tightening of credit, but recently the money supply has been  relaxed again. Economic growth during 1994 should be vigorous,  but the rise in inflationary pressures and a possible new  government retrenchment during the second half of the year are  worrisome.    This report rests on two basic assumptions, namely that the  United States will continue to extend the China mainland's most  favored nation trade status. On the basis of this assumption,  the report predicts that Hong Kong's exports will improve in  1994, total export value increasing 18 percent, for an actual 17  percent increase. (The 1993 estimate was 14 percent.) Entrepot  trade is also expected to increase by an actual 23 percent. (The  1993 estimate was 20 percent.)    The United States and China are Hong Kong's largest markets  (together accounting for half or more of Hong Kong's exports,  and more than half of its total entrepot trade). The situation  in 1994 will be one in which the United States market will grow  fairly steadily and the China mainland market may slow during  the second half of the year. By understanding the trend of  these two large markets, it is possible to know in advance most  of Hong Kong's trade prospects.    Of the issues between China and the United States, the one  that affects Hong Kong most is whether China's most favored  nation status will be extended. The importance for Hong Kong of  most favored nation treatment lies in the current reality that  China's and Hong Kong's economies are closely linked. The  mainland is the factory, and Hong Kong is the store. Many  mainland products transit Hong Kong for sale abroad.    In recent years, both the Hong Kong government and  businessmen have sent leading figures to the United States each  year to lobby in an effort to get the United States to extend  China's most favored nation treatment. Their most important line  has been that unless most favored nation treatment is extended,  Hong Kong will lose 70,000 jobs and 3 percentage points of its  GNP.    Although whether the United States will extend China's most  favored nation treatment in 1994 is still an unknown quantity,  everyone assumes it will be maintained. The first condition for  extension that the United States has expressed is improvement of  the China mainland's human rights situation. In this regard, it  is estimated that Beijing will do all possible to take some  actions and improve its posture to maintain most favored nation  treatment. In the final analysis, Beijing also realizes that it  cannot be swayed by personal feelings. As for the United States,  recently there have also been some indications that it feels  Beijing has responded to improve human rights.    In December, GATT finally reached an overall agreement in  the  Americas and Europe, bringing to an end the seven-year Uruguay  round of negotiations. Basically, this assures the continued  liberalization of trade. The conclusion of the GATT talks is  naturally advantageous for Hong Kong. This is by no means the  final talks that will directly benefit Hong Kong, but Hong Kong  has always stood for free trade, and it benefits from the  liberalization of trade. Strong protectionist sentiment has  always existed in international trade. Failure to maintain  liberalization will mean a slide toward protectionism, and  protectionism is the thing that Hong Kong least wants to see.  <H5>  The Stock Market: Foreign Capital Dominates; Great </H5> Bullishness    Foreign Capital Speculation in the Stock Market Not  Likely To Abate in a Short Time. New Products and New Facilities  Increase; Market Will Likely Become Hotter.    The stock market has always been regarded as a political  thermometer. However, despite the worsening of the political  dispute between China and the UK, the Hong Kong stock market  runs counter to this precept. The more speculation, the more it  booms. In early 1993, the Heng Seng Index was more than 5000,  the daily trading volume reaching more than HK$1 billion. Before  the end of the year, however, the Heng Seng Index broke the  10,000 points mark, daily trading volume exceeding HK$10 billion.    The main reason for this recent bullishness is the entry  into  the market of foreign funds, which caused a "three grade jump"  in the more than 7,000 points Heng Seng Index at the end of  September. Foreign capitalists do not regard the Sino-British  political squabble as a matter of any importance. They proclaim  the good prospects of the China mainland market, and that Hong  Kong is the best entry way to the China market. The "instigator"  was the U.S. investment form of Morgan-Stanley, followed by a  surge of Japanese and European funds. "Intercontinental  ballistic missiles" struck, and the temperature of the Hong Kong  market increased greatly.    Many people feel that it is unbelievable that speculation  has  gone on this way for two or three months, and even old hands  have been caught flat-footed. The trend during the coming year  is hard to predict, but the consensus of insiders is that the  "gold fish bowl" (i.e., the stock market) is a "big crocodile"  world, meaning the big foreign investors in particular. What  happens in the market will depend mostly on what foreign  investors do.    One insider said that the logic for the flow between fund  operators recently is as follows: The market price profit rate  on the H shares that mainland state-owned business list on the  Hong Kong market should not be lower that the profit rate on A  shares (for sale inside China) and the B shares (for sale  outside China). Furthermore, the market profit rate for the blue  chip shares of large Hong Kong firms should also not be lower  than for the H shares. In addition, the market profit rate on  the Hong Kong stock market (less than 19 times) is lower than in  very many other places, yet Hong Kong corporations are doing  well and their profits are high. Thus, the conclusion is that  Hong Kong share prices should be higher than the current level.  These insiders figure that during the first quarter of 1994, the  Heng Seng Index should reach 12,000, meaning 16,000 for the  whole year.    Will the foreign investors withdraw? It seems that they will  not withdraw for a fairly long time. The first reason is that  the Chinese mainland economy still seems to be growing at high  speed. Negative factors during the coming year are few:  regulation and control have been relaxed recently, and most  favored nation treatment will likely be extended. One possible  negative factor is the death of the great helmsman, Deng  Xiaoping. The second reason is that there is no place for  foreign investment funds to go. A lot of hot money is available;  interest rates are low, and the European, American, and Japanese  economies are in a bad slump. Of course, there is apprehension  lest foreign capital cause Hong Kong shares to go up, thereby  bringing Hong Kong investors into the market only to depart once  they have taken their fill. Actually, money could be withdrawn  very rapidly, because in addition to stock shares, there are  other instruments available such as indexed futures and futures  options that can be used, so selling off and recovering funds is  extremely easy. Nevertheless, very many small speculators have  already left the market. Furthermore, not everyone feels that  political factors can be ignored. In addition, present prices  are too high. Therefore many people are still very wary.    With the advent of a new year, expectations are that the  Hong  Kong stock market may become even hotter. This is because of the  continuing increase in new products and new facilities in the  stock market.    First, the automatic settlement system went into operation,  every kind of share certificate being fed into the system  continuously. Following adoption of this system, shares were  bought and sold using an electronic board listing method,  inputting into the buying and selling board being done with the  push of a button for immediate execution of a trade. Trading was  faster and efficiency increased.    Second was approval of short sales of shares. Formerly,  short  selling (selling of shares one does not have) was illegal in the  Hong Kong stock market, but foreign stock markets have long  approved it. Once the automatic settlement system went into  operation, selling short was allowed in Hong Kong as of January  1994.    In 1994, options trading will be promoted. Trading of  indexed  options already exists. The next step will be buying and selling  of options for individual shares (mostly blue chip stocks).    In addition, more and more China mainland enterprises are  listing on the Hong Kong exchange. State-owned firms issue H  shares (currently there are seven or eight of them), and other  firms come to Hong Kong to shop for empty shells (to buy empty  shell companies).    Inasmuch as more new products and new facilities have been  introduced, the amount of trading and investment should increase.    In addition, since the price of blue chip shares is  presently  high, quite a few individual investors deal in H shares and  second and third line shares. Since the index may rise or fall  two or three percentage points in a single day, some individual  investors speculate on the market each day; thus, the volume of  trading in futures index contracts has increased greatly (to  more than 10,000 each day).  <H5>  Real Estate: No Reversal of Rising Trend </H5>   Prices of buildings are at an all-time high. The rising  trend will continue unless an upheaval occurs. Luxury apartment  prices may rise by one-quarter, and medium and small apartment  prices may rise 15 percent.    During the last land sale of 1993, competitive bidding on a  parcel of land to be used for dwellings in North Kowloon  resulted in a sale at an all-time high price (more than HK$3.9  billion, or more than HK$5,400 per square foot of floor space).  It is estimated that once built, the cost of the premises will  be 8,000 yuan per square foot). The earliest that buildings can  be put up on that land will be 1997. Apparently real estate  dealers view prospects favorably.    Is it really true that the real estate market need not take  political factors into consideration? Chung-yuan Properties  Agency director, Shih Yung-ch'ing, feels that one cannot say  that political factors have no effect. When Sino-British talks  break off for a day or two, the number of inquiries about  properties decrease, the atmosphere improving only after the  stock market rises. Of course, big buyers and sellers are not  much worried about spats between China and the UK in the run up  to 1997, particularly those who invest in real estate. This is  because real estate is immovable property. The payback rate will  extend beyond 1997. During the 1980s, Hong Kong real estate  gradually went from the hands of those who had no confidence to  those who had confidence. Most of those who hold real estate  today are those who feel confident about 1997. Spats between  China and the UK will not make them unload real property.  Therefore, it is not political factors that are the main factors  today, but rather that economic factors favor the real estate  market.    An analysis of the high rise buildings market shows,  according to Shih Yung-ch'ing, that because the Hong Kong  economy has grown rapidly, quite a few people on the mainland  have made money. (This income is not reflected in any economic  growth statistics.) Their increased wealth has increased the  demand for luxury dwellings. In addition, some people in  Mainland China who have become rich first, and some  "princelings" and entrepreneurs who have come to Hong Kong to  make money, also want to buy luxury accommodations in Hong Kong.  The overseas employees of foreign-owned companies also have such  a need. The supply of luxury accommodations increases by no more  than 1,000 or so units each year, yet the demand is for 2,000.  Supply cannot meet demand, so high rise prices rise by at least  20 percent and as much as 40 percent each year. Today, the price  rises between HK$5,000 and HK$6,000 per square foot each year.    The market price of a medium or small apartment is between  somewhat more than HK$3,000 and somewhat more than HK$4,000 per  square foot, depending on location. Because of the effect of  things such as banks 70 percent collateral requirement, the rate  of increase during the past year was not great. It averaged  about 10 percent, which is still higher than the inflation rate.    High rise building prices today are at an all-time high.  Shih  Yung-ch'ing believes that during the coming year favorable  factors will outweigh unfavorable factors in the high rise  building market, including unfavorable political factors.  Barring a turn to the left on the mainland away from the  movement toward capitalism that produces a large upheaval, the  rising trend will not reverse. It is anticipated that prices of  luxury high rise apartments will rise 25 percent in the coming  year, and that prices of medium and small apartments will rise  approximately 15 percent. Also, because land sale prices set an  all time high at the end of 1993, this will be reflected in the  future market.    Each year more than 30,000 new residential units are  completed in Hong Kong, but because of the high prices of  apartments, most people can only look at them and sigh.  Recently, large numbers of Chinese mainland-owned apartments  have been sold in Hong Kong, the number reaching 100,000 units  in slightly more than a year. Shih Yung-ch'ing says that many  Hong Kong people have purchased apartments on the mainland  mostly because they cannot afford a Hong Kong apartment, and  mainland apartment listings account for approximately one-third  the total for sale in Hong Kong. The effect of mainland  apartment listings on the Hong Kong apartment market has mostly  been to soak up savings. Much money has been withdrawn from  banks, thereby hurting the banks lending ability. This is also  one of the reasons why Hong Kong banks have tightened their  collateral requirements.  <H5>  Sino-Hong Kong Economic Relations and Foreign Trade: </H5> Development Is the Last Word    Future Years To Be Decided by How Mainland Pursues  Reform and Opening to the Outside World. Continuation of  Regulation and Control Will Also Not Employ the Methods of 1993    As regards economic relations and trade between China and  Hong Kong, so long as the China mainland continues decontrol, it  will be possible to apply Deng Xiaoping's descriptive phrase,  "Development is the last word."    The event that had greatest impact during the past year was  the China mainland's institution of macroeconomic regulation and  control measures in mid-1993 only to relax them once again at  the end of the year. The outlook for the next stage of Sino-Hong  Kong economic relations and trade is that factors for optimism  will predominate and political factors will not have much  effect. This is the assessment of Chen Honglin, general manager  of China's Tianan Investment Corporation.    Chen Honglin feels that the mainland's macroeconomic  regulation and control measures also play a positive role. First  of all, regulation and control straightens out some ways of  doing things; it reduces the formerly chaotic situation. Some  new policies may be tried that can improve the system. Thus,  operation of the economy may become more normal giving impetus  to future development. Second, regulation and control is not a  turning back, nor does it sacrifice speed. The present is a  period when development is moving ahead.    With the recent relaxation of regulation and control,  various  indicators appeared. Chen Honglin noted that with a little more  relaxation, more capital will flow out of the mainland. right  now, capital in south China is trying to break loose, but is  being held back. Once relaxation occurs, it will come to Hong  Kong to buy company names and put them on the stock market, or  to buy real estate or negotiable securities. Even though the  amount of money coming to Hong Kong may be limited, it helps  attract more foreign capital to Hong Kong. Another psychological  role it plays is that the regulation and control measures of the  previous stage appeared without warning. No one knew how long  the retrenchment would last. Not that they have been relaxed,  even though not greatly, everyone feels there will be no further  retrenchment. What real changes has relaxation brought? Chen  Honglin said that trade was rather difficult during the previous  stage because of the effects of regulation and control. The  banks tightened the money supply. Deals that had been made could  not be consummated for lack of money. However, by the end of  the year, buying and selling increased. This may have been  because of the relaxation of the money supply, but it may also  have been because of the desire to use retained foreign  exchange, or a combination of the two, a final spurt appearing  at the end of the year. Nevertheless, despite the relaxation,  there will be no verging on loss of control like previously. The  relaxation will be focused on the development of bottleneck  industries such as energy and transportation.    Economic relations and trade between China and Hong Kong  during the coming year will be determined by how the mainland  pursues reform and opening to the outside world. Chen Honglin  predicts that the situation in 1994 will be better than in 1993.  This is because regulation and control has produced initial  results. Even if regulation and control continues, the methods  of the lat half of 1993 will not be used. The mainland's  continuation of reform and opening to the outside world provides  development room for Hong Kong businessmen. In the trade field,  the basic stability of the renminbi, in particular, is a  favorable factor. As for America's extension of most favored  nation treatment, this is a matter at a different level. In the  real estate field, too much was attempted during the previous  period. Projects lacking viability will be eliminated, but a  development potential exists in large cities such as Guangzhou  and Shanghai. In the finance and banking field, the mainland  will introduce a number of international practices, which it is  hoped will help economic development. Chen Honglin expects that  pilot projects will be decontrolled to permit the branches of  foreign owned banks to handle renminbi business. Activities  inside China and abroad to raise capital (including the issuance  of stocks and bonds) will also increase under regulation and  control. Chen Honglin predicts that prospects will be bright for  finance and banking activity.    On the political factors issue, Chen Honglin said the effect  of political disputes between China and Hong Kong have weakened.  The political changes that will have the greatest effect are  still in the China mainland itself, and naturally the event that  will have the greatest impact is Deng Xiaoping's death. However,  Chen Honglin believes that the psychological effect of Deng  Xiaoping's death may be greater than the real effect. This is  because no turn around of the policy of economic reform and  opening to the outside world is apparent. The conservatives are  no longer able to reverse this direction of development. Some  people speculate that the CPC leadership will have a power  struggle after Deng dies, and that regional separatism may  occur. These matters are difficult to estimate, and what effect  they might have on the economy will depend on whether the  political situation is stable. In short, unless there is some  major change in the Chinese mainland political situation, future  economic prospects should be good, and this should stimulate  Hong Kong's economy.</p>

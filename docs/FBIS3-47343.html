The top government spokesman told a news conference that  Tokyo "attaches great importance" to the summit, which comes at  the final stage of framework trade negotiations between the two  countries.    Hosokawa and Clinton are scheduled to meet February 11 in  Washington to assess the progress of the trade talks, which are  being held under the Japan-U.S. trade framework accord reached  last July.    Takemura said that in addition to talks on bilateral  relations, the premier also plans to present Clinton with a  specific plan to boost the languishing Japanese economy.    Hosokawa will likely visit the U.S. capital from February 10  to 12, Takemura said, adding he had not heard if the Japanese  leader would confer with Clinton on more than one occasion.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> LAIMBEER'S LONG SHOTS NOT QUITE ENOUGH  </P> <P> Records were set or tied Thursday night, but none was better than the six  three-point baskets by Piston Bill Laimbeer, losing effort or not.  </P> <P> "It was a great performance," teammate Isiah Thomas said. "Too bad we had to  waste it."  </P> <P> Laimbeer, a 6-foot-11, 245-pounder who has made his tough-guy reputation  playing inside but leaves his offensive mark with outside jump shots, was one  of two on three-pointers in the first quarter. He was zero for one in the third  quarter. In the fourth, he went two for two, 35 seconds apart that first tied  the game and then put Detroit ahead, 89-86.  </P> <P> By sinking three of four attempts in overtime, he finished six of nine, the  most memorable numbers in a game in which he totaled 26 points and 11 rebounds.  The six three-pointers tied the finals mark of Michael Cooper, the Laker guard  who made six against the Boston Celtics on May 27, 1985.  </P> <P> Other Game 2 achievements:  </P> <P>  -- The nine three-point attempts by Laimbeer broke Cooper's record of eight,  done twice.  </P> <P>  -- Portland's Terry Porter went 15 of 15 from the line to set a finals record  for most successes without a miss. Magic Johnson had the former mark of 14, set  May 16, 1980.  </P> <P>  -- The eight three-pointers by the Pistons broke the team record of seven held  by Boston since the May 27, 1985, game against the Lakers.  </P> <P>  -- This was the first overtime in a finals since the Celtics beat the Lakers,  129-125, June 6, 1984, at the Forum.  </P> <P>  -- The loss broke Detroit's playoff winning streak for 1990 at 10 and overall  at 14. Both tied previous marks.  </P> <P> One Piston streak survived. This was the fifth time that Detroit loss when an  opponent has scored at least 100 points.  </P> <P> Piston James Edwards may have snapped out of his shooting slump by starting  five of five and finishing 13 of 23 for 26 points, but Vinnie Johnson continues  to struggle.  </P> <P> He came in having made just two of 21 attempts the previous three games, going  back to the Eastern Conference finals against Chicago. Thursday, he went one of  four.  </P> <P> Portland took advantage. Trail Blazer reserves outscored their Piston  counterparts, 20-13, though Drazen Petrovic led with the way with only eight  points.  </P> <P> Game 3 is Sunday afternoon at Portland, where the Pistons have lost 20 in a  row, a streak that dates back to Oct. 19, 1974 and includes a 20-point defeat  this season.  </P> <P> NBA Notes  </P> <P> The Pistons say they will again show road games during the finals on the  big-screen television at the Palace, with the $3 admission going to charity.  Impressively, Game 4 last year against the Lakers at the Forum drew a sellout  crowd of 21,454. . . . In reaction to the death of Hank Gathers, the NBA is  using more extensive heart examinations during the final scouting combine for  pro-bound college players. The tests Tuesday and Wednesday in Chicago revealed  that one player had cardiovascular abnormalities that could put his future in  the sport in question, according to Northwestern University physician Mark  Upton, who helped administered the screenings. The player's name is being  withheld and more thorough evaluations are planned.  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle attended the game. . . . The 15 points in the second  quarter tied a Piston low for points in a quarter in the playoffs. . . . Don  Casey interviewed Wednesday with Atlanta Coach Bob Weiss regarding a spot as an  assistant with the Hawks. . . . The Phoenix Suns have determined Kevin Johnson  has a muscle imbalance in his leg that caused two separate incidents of  hamstring problems, including one that forced him out of Game 6 of the Western  Conference finals. Weight training is expected to correct any problems.  </P></p>

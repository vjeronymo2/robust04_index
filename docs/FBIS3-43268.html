			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address to nation by UNITA President Jonas Malheiro Savimbi </F> on New Year's eve -- recorded]    [Text] Angolan men, Angolan women, compatriots, proved  militants of our glorious movement, the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], members of the UNITA armed  forces, on this first day of 1994, I have the solemn duty to  address the entire nation in order to be able to explain in a  firmer, more precise, and in greater detail what we feel are the  reasons for the situation we are currently experiencing in our  beautiful country and the measures that UNITA intends to adopt  so that peace may once again reign throughout the national  territory.    First of all, we would like to declare to the entire Angolan  people that our desire to reach an agreement with the government  led by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA]  is serious. Our commitment to peace is also very serious. We  would like, before anything else, to also clarify that there is  an infernal disinformation machine mounted in complicity with  the MPLA, and for the MPLA, to convince the Angolan people and  the international community that UNITA took up arms because it  lost the legislative elections in September 1992.    All the Angolan people know and nobody should forget that  the  results of the 1992 legislative elections were announced on 17  October 1992, but armed clashes only began in November 1992,  after the massacres which took place in Luanda. We would like  to point out without ambiguity that the reason for the war that  is currently being waged in the country is not because we  contested the results of legislative elections held in September  1992. What caused this war is UNITA's moral and civic duty to  defend itself from the elimination designed for it by the MPLA  because of the MPLA's (?hatred) and [word indistinct] toward our  movement. It is not very easy for us to forget the memory of  our ever-missed Vice President Jeremias Kalandula Chitunda, a  (?firm negotiator). We cannot forget the memory of our  Secretary General Adolosi Paulo Mango Alicerces and Engineer  Elias Salupeto Pena, who was the head of our representation to  the Joint Political and Military Commission [CCPM].    What is more, the massacres continued in Novo Redondo,  Benguela, Lobito, and Lubango. We experienced treacherous  attacks in Huambo, Bie, Menongue, Malange, Ondjiva, Luena, and  Saurimo. All this forced us to try with all the resources at  our disposal, no matter how few they were, to defend our  populations, our militants, and sympathizers. All of you also  know that (?there was a desire) to make the first multiparty  elections in the country transparent; but from registration to  voting processes, we witnessed only unrestrained manipulation by  the MPLA. Already in August 1992, the MPLA [words indistinct]  the winner, and asked the UNITA leadership to subscribe to a  document in which our party accepted the results of the  elections which had not yet been held. They were very sure of  victory.    The catastrophe came, however, when Ms. Margaret Anstee  declared the elections to be free and fair. After [words  indistinct] months, the same lady says that she did not have the  resources to organize and observe the elections. This is what  she should have said on the occasion. Only after having plunged  our country in [word indistinct], the lady says that of the two  [words indistinct] one was doubtful and [words indistinct].    Those who took part in manipulating the election results are  now confronted with a conflict whose end is completely  unforeseen. As is always the case in history, there must be  scapegoats. The scapegoat in the present national crisis is  UNITA. There is a witness, however, who does not forget -- the  Angolan people themselves [words indistinct].    Despite all this, we took upon ourselves the serious  responsibility to accept the results of these elections. There  is a major problem, however, in the legal framework emerging  from these elections -- there is a lack of moral strength to  understand, to forgive, (?to work), and to reconcile the Angolan  nation whose fabric was damaged by much [words indistinct].    The MPLA regime has been desperately sticking to the  principle of sovereignty, even when its police (?steals),  violates, and humiliates common citizens, [words indistinct],  and many Angolans today [words indistinct]. The MPLA propaganda  is only aimed at oppressing the people. It is equally aimed at  [words indistinct] the international community regarding its  real intentions. All the same, we think that the MPLA  propaganda's effectiveness is already reaching its end. [Words  indistinct] we in UNITA think that they remain the only [word  indistinct] judges [words indistinct] our own conscience and our  people themselves. The others are just messengers, carrying  messages, as we have seen them do for over 15 years. What UNITA  is worried about is the constant resort to weapons. What UNITA  is worried about is the existence of political, economic, and  social differences among the Angolan people.    Thirty-three years of war for a people and for an African  country are too much. The African culture believes in dialogue  and not in a constant resort to violence. It is for this  reason, and it is not a minor reason, that we are committed to  peace. We believe, however, in a true peace which demands  concrete and real actions. The Angolan people know today that  as part of its contribution to peace, UNITA has taken the  following steps forward:    It accepted the results of the elections held in September  1992. It accepted the Bicesse Accords as a foundation for  discussions. It accepted the Abidjan Protocol and the many  resolutions approved by the UN Security Council against [words  indistinct]. What is more, UNITA unilaterally declared a  cease-fire [words indistinct] which permitted the resumption of  negotiations and the sending of humanitarian assistance to needy  people.    In addition, all the concessions made in Lusaka were made by  UNITA. At the present period, the cease-fire is already  (?real), and the formation of the Angolan Armed Forces has been  accepted, as well as all the consequences resulting from there.    What are we seeing on the side of the MPLA, however? We are  seeing a very serious (?desire) to eliminate UNITA militarily  and to transform our glorious party into an instrument [words  indistinct] of what we are, where we came from, and where we are  going. What is more, the MPLA regime has not yet learned to  coexist with other parties. Accordingly, it concerns us to see  a party that was officially recognized by the MPLA Supreme  Court, the Democratic Party for Progress of the Angolan National  Alliance [PDP-ANA], infiltrated today, because its president who  has been an authorized voice of a true opposition [words  indistinct].    Over the last 18 years, we have seen many ploys by the MPLA  government to try and create a new UNITA: UNITA B, UNITA C,  UNITA E. None of those UNITA's has survived because there is  only one UNITA and it has its own philosophy, its own  objectives, and wants to contribute with its role and with its  own [word indistinct] (?suffering) to the building of a strong  and united Angola, which is, however, [words indistinct]. All  attempts to create a new UNITA are bound to fail.    Furthermore, the MPLA has lately embarked on a  disinformation  campaign concerning possible UNITA military [word indistinct],  the sole aim of which is to disguise the MPLA's undoubted desire  to militarily eliminate all its opponents. [Words indistinct]  in the cover of democracy, a one-party regime for many long  years. This kind of democracy does not promote us. What is  more, it does not [words indistinct].    The UNITA delegation to the Lusaka peace talks will leave  today, 1 January 1994, with the firm desire to meet with the  MPLA. Those who tried to speculate that UNITA would not leave  for Lusaka have erred yet again. We leave two days earlier so  that the Angolan people and also the international community can  see that we want to hold serious discussions and that we want to  find solutions within a legal, political, and administrative  framework which will guarantee peace, the tranquility of the  people to promote economic and social development for the  well-being of all Angolan people.    What is more, we are realistic. If we cannot [words  indistinct] we should at least reach a general cease-fire so  that with the silencing of weapons, (?civilians) can [words  indistinct] but this time, we are not going to Lusaka [words  indistinct]. We would like a cease-fire that will allow  humanitarian organizations to continue to assist people affected  by famine, disease, and nakedness. UNITA would be ready to sign  such a cease-fire immediately. Perhaps it is very difficult for  the MPLA, which has purchased arms to assume the same attitude  of transparency, clarity, and [words indistinct].    During the coming round of talks, UNITA [words indistinct]  political and administrative throughout the country since this  balance was seriously thwarted by the Luanda massacres. That is  why, [words indistinct] since we shall no longer accept [words  indistinct] guarantees. We cannot repeat the (?mistakes) [words  indistinct].    Furthermore, our delegation [words indistinct] to reach  viable and verifiable agreements. We would also like to ask UN  mediators not to treat Africans (?as inferiors). It pains me to  say that, with so many conflicts in the country, so many  conflicts in the world, so many conflicts on the continent,  there are [words indistinct] but there is always a time for  discussion and a time for reflection. There are many conflicts  on the African continent, as the conflicts that are now emerging  in Eritrea, the Sudan, the Congo, Sierra Leone, and other parts  of our beautiful continent bare witness. There has always been a  time for discussion and time for reflection.    In the case of Angola, timetables of slavery have been  imposed on us, however. This was the case in Bicesse. It was  the case in Abidjan, and it was also the case in Lusaka  recently. This behavior does not only detract from the prestige  of the mediation because it is a behavior that is adopted only  toward Africans, but the world is experiencing conflicts such as  the one existing in Bosnia, conflicts between Israel and  Palestine, [words indistinct] discussions, a break for  reflection and the resumption of discussions. I profoundly  regret such behavior which makes Africans inferior beings. No  one can doubt UNITA's [words indistinct] political problems,  problems arising from a newly born democracy, economic problems,  but we continue to believe in the destiny of our continent.  After we have learned, we shall one day know [words indistinct].    We would like to take this opportunity to thank the patience  shown by UN Special Representative Dr. Alioune Blondin Beye, who  has never spared any efforts to try and bring UNITA and the MPLA  together. We would also like to remember a great African [words  indistinct] the principles of African culture. It is not by  negotiating under (?duress) [words indistinct] dialogue must be  [words indistinct] but firm. Dialogue must be [word indistinct]  but determined. Dialogue must be intelligent but also [words  indistinct] that we Africans find solutions to our various  problems.    We would also like to express our gratitude for the role  played by the peace process observers. They have tried by all  means to find [words indistinct] the MPLA government and UNITA.  We also think that the United States, Portugal, and Russia have  an important role to play in the peace negotiations in Angola.    I would also like -- since circumstances so dictate [words  indistinct] -- to say a word about Portugal. UNITA hopes that  in 1994 our relations with the Portuguese Government will  improve, for the interest of our peoples [words indistinct].  Our relations have been very difficult. This has greatly  hampered the negotiating process in Angola. We have a common  language, culture, and [word indistinct] but, Africans that we  are, we should not be penalized for trying to defend our values.  At this stage, we are [words indistinct] of Angola. Portugal  has an important card to play so we can find an agreement [words  indistinct] at least try to arrive at an understanding with  UNITA. It has an ambassador in Luanda and it has a great  capacity to talk.    Other European countries, notably France, Germany, Belgium,  the United Kingdom, Spain, and Italy, should not in any way  encourage the MPLA to follow unjust paths, because, by selling  weapons to the MPLA and giving economic support to Jose Eduardo  dos Santos -- who is still a candidate in the second round of  presidential elections -- they only make the MPLA more  intransigent, more radical and [words indistinct] with little  desire to make concessions.    Peace is the overriding interest both to the Angolan people  and to the other countries concerned about Angola [words  indistinct] UNITA [words indistinct] attitudes that were [words  indistinct] we also share a common background, culture, and  language with Brazil. We hope that relations with Brazil will  improve in 1994.    Regarding the United States, now that the USSR has become a  conglomerate of countries, it is up to the United States to  guarantee peace for all, whether they be big or small. The  UNITA team will hold constant contacts with Holden Roberto,  president of the Angola National Liberation Front  representative, brother Daniel Julio Chipenda, Engineer Catete,  and all opposition leaders who are abroad because the issue of  peace is not a matter that only concerns UNITA. It concerns  all the Angolan people, all of us. It is not because [words  indistinct] in 1992 that UNITA [words indistinct].    To all Angolans, to the proven militants: We have passed the  thorny path of 1993. The year of 1994 shall be known as the  year for thinking about our African identity and it will lead to  new gains, the greatest of which shall be peace. Peace will be  built with UNITA and peace will not [words indistinct] UNITA.    To all the Angolan people, to all our militants, our wishes  of a happy new year.</p>

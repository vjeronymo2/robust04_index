			<p>BFN     [Text] Two Israeli citizens were arrested by Palestinian  policemen in Jericho and their personal weapons were  confiscated. The two Israelis were released a short while ago.  The men are residents of the Na'ama settlement, who apparently  went to Jericho to shop.    The incident was reported to our correspondent in the  territories Golan Yokhpaz today by residents of the Jordan Rift  Valley. One of the men who was arrested is Arye Shahar, the  security officer at Na'ama. Shahar managed to use his  walkie-talkie to report that he and his friend had been detained  and taken to the Palestinian police station in Jericho. Na'ama  residents expressed great fury at what they called a flagrant  violation of the Cairo agreement. The circumstances leading to  the arrest of the two Israelis remain unclear, as does the  reason for their release.</p>

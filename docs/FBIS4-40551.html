			<p>BFN     [Text] Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin spoke out in favor of  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's call for a conference  on the Korean peninsula.    Talking to journalists in Bonn on Thursday, he said that  even  if sanctions were imposed on North Korea, they should be  implemented in stages. In his opinion, sanctions could be  applied only after stern warnings.    Meanwhile, the head of the Duma's International Affairs  Committee Vladimir Lukin said that the lower house expects  Kozyrev to report on the situation in North Korea on Friday.  And on June 20, the committee will hear from the ambassadors of  the countries concerned.</p>

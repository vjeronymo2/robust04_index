Prime  Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali made a statement last Wednesday  [29 December] at the start of the debate on developments in the  negotiations. His statement followed a vote in favor of a  closed door meeting.    Several representatives today demanded that their meeting  should be held open and they argued the government had made its  statement and that many things became clear after yesterday's  speech by his majesty the king.    After a discussion of the move the house speaker decided  that  the debate should again proceed behind closed doors.</p>

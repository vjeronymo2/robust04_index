			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Irish reform of extradition halted THE IRISH government yesterday halted progress towards the reform of controversial procedures for the extradition of terrorist suspects to the UK. Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister, stressed the move was temporary. He said the hold-up was due to problems that had been uncovered by officials in the Irish attorney-general's department during the final drafting of a bill aimed at closing loop-holes in the extradition legislation. It was emphasised by government sources that the difficulties were legal rather than political, and would lead only to a delay in ratifying the changes, which centre mainly on the classification of terrorist firearms crimes considered to be extraditable. Mr Reynolds said the reform bill would now be tabled in the autumn.</p>

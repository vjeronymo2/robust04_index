			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: First Leisure takes a Pounds 20m step into bingo FIRST LEISURE, the group that took ten-pin bowling upmarket in the UK, has finally made its move into bingo. It has paid Pounds 19.9m for Nudge Leisure, a private company which owns seven large bingo clubs operating mainly in the Midlands, and intends to build a national chain of lavishly equipped venues. The UK market of 1,000 bingo clubs is currently dominated by the Rank Organisation and Bass, which between them control more than 30 per cent of the clubs and a bigger share of the total revenue. The market has long suffered from a dowdy image, being associated with middle-aged customers playing for low stakes in converted high street cinemas. However, in recent years Rank and other operators have developed a new sector of the market, operating out of purpose-built units with extensive parking facilities. Lord Rayne, chairman of First Leisure, said: 'These units are attracting a new bingo customer who is more affluent and younger than the traditional target customer. 'It is the possibilities afforded by this structural change that make the bingo market particularly attractive to us.' Mr John Conlan, chief executive, said the group's new bingo division would grow mainly through the development of large units in main towns, close to residential areas, but with extensive parking. All would feature bars, food and gaming machines, which yield high profit margins. He expected to spend Pounds 3m-Pounds 4m on each outlet and aimed to open two or three sites a year - eventually building a chain of 20-30 outlets, each with capacity of up to 2,000 people. This would give First Leisure another business of similar size to its three other core activities - Super Bowls, discotheques and resorts such as the Blackpool Tower. Mr Conlan said he had wanted to move into bingo for a long time, but Nudge was the first opportunity which offered the right size of sites with good management. In the year to March, Nudge made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.5m on sales of Pounds 9.6m, so a maintained performance would enhance the group's earnings per share. The new bingo division will be managed by Mr Paul Talboys, 39, who joins First Leisure from Bass, where he is a senior bingo executive. The Nudge operation will continue to be run by Mr Peter Williams, who has managed the company for the last five years and previously worked with Bass and Mecca. The acquisition was funded with a vendor placing of 5.65m First Leisure shares with institutions at 353p by Hill Samuel, with Cazenove as brokers. The shares closed 1p lower at 364p.</p>

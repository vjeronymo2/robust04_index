			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are about 55 handlers of Washington apricots, 55 handlers of Washington sweet cherries, and 30 handlers of Washington-Oregon fresh prunes subject to regulation under their respective marketing orders. In addition, there are about 190 Washington apricot producers, 1,100 Washington sweet cherry producers, and 350 Washington-Oregon fresh prune producers in the respective production areas. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An annual budget of expenses is prepared by each marketing order committee and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committees are handlers and producers of the regulated commodities. They are familiar with the Committees' needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local areas and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The budgets are formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment rate recommended by each Committee is derived by dividing anticipated expenses by the tons of fresh fruit expected to be shipped under the order. Because the rates are applied to actual shipments, they must be established at rates which will produce sufficient income to pay the Committees' expected expenses. Recommended budgets and rates of assessment are usually acted upon by the Committees shortly before a season starts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore, budget and assessment rate approvals must be expedited so that the Committees will have funds to pay their expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Washington Apricot Marketing Committee met on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> May 16, 1994, and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 expenses of $13,602, which is $1,216 more in expenses than the $12,386 amount that was recommended for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.00 per ton of fresh apricots, which is a decrease of $2.50 in the assessment rate. In comparison, the 1993&hyph;94 assessment rate was $2.50 per ton. The Committee unanimously recommended bringing forward its reserve fund of $22,170 to pay budgeted expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year as an alternative to charging handlers an assessment rate. Shipments of fresh apricots are estimated at 5,200 tons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, estimated at $8,568, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Washington Cherry Marketing Committee met on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> May 17, 1994, and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 expenses of $100,213 and an assessment rate of $1.00 per ton of sweet cherries. In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 budgeted expenses were $139,313, with an approved assessment rate of $3.00 per ton. This represents a $39,100 decrease in expenses and a $2.00 decrease in the assessment rate from the amounts recommended for the current fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 40,000 tons of cherries, would yield $40,000 in assessment income. Adequate funds exists in the Committee's reserve to cover additional expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, estimated at $74,695, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Washington-Oregon Fresh Prune Marketing Committee met on June 1, 1994, and recommended 1994&hyph;95 expenses of $18,760, which represents a $8,042 decrease in expenses from the $26,802 that was recommended for 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

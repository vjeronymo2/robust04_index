			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOARD TENTATIVELY OKS INCOMPLETE COUNTY BUDGET  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors on Wednesday tentatively adopted a $2.9-billion budget  for the fiscal year that begins July 1. The vote was the first in a budget  process that will continue into August.  </P> <P> The budget anticipates a $24-million deficit, which county officials hope can  be erased with the distribution of state funds now being debated in Sacramento.  </P> <P> John Sibley, associate county administrative officer in charge of the budget,  said the county hopes to learn this week whether the state Legislature will  approve a block grant that could give Orange County more than $19 million.  </P> <P> County officials have warned about the possibility, if the grant is not  approved, of drastic program cuts that could include hundreds of layoffs.  </P> <P> Wednesday's vote, taken without debate, was actually a legal technicality to  satisfy a law that requires the county to adopt a balanced budget by June 30,  even though the county is still waiting to learn how much money it will receive  from the state.  </P> <P> The budget adopted Wednesday -- which does not fully fund all departments for  the complete year -- will allow the county to operate during the first weeks of  the new fiscal year until a final version of the budget can be passed.  </P> <P> The supervisors are scheduled to hold hearings during the last week of July on  the budget for the 1989-90 fiscal year. The budget must be adopted in its final  form by Aug. 30.  </P> <P> The awkward budget schedule -- in which the hearings are held after the fiscal  year begins -- is a frustration forced on the county because it is so dependent  on state funds. The Legislature has not adopted its budget, so the county can  only estimate parts of its budget.  </P> <P> The County Administrative Office released the proposed budget last week. The  board's vote was unanimous, with Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez absent.  </P> <P> In other action Wednesday, the supervisors:  </P> <P> * Approved new contracts with two of the county's employee bargaining units  representing about 1,100 technicians, heavy machinery operators, maintenance  employees and welfare eligibility workers. Both two-year contracts, which have  been ratified by the union memberships, call for a 4.3% salary increase  starting Friday and another increase on June 29, 1990, that will range between  3.5% and 5% depending on the previous year's consumer price index. In addition,  the county increased its contribution to the unions' funds for disability and  life insurance.  </P> <P> Both contracts were scheduled to expire Friday. The contracts for two other  unions -- the 9,000-member Orange County Employees Assn. and the county  firefighters -- are also scheduled to expire Friday. Russ Patton, the county's  personnel director, would not comment on those negotiations. There are about  12,000 union employees in the county government and almost all of the contracts  are scheduled to expire this year.  </P> <P> * Adopted a fee of $362 for a massage therapy license after the Sheriff's  Department proposed last October that the cost be raised to $939. Several  massage therapists told the supervisors Wednesday, however, that the rate is  still too high.  </P> <P> The sheriff's proposed increase reflected the county's new cost-recovery policy  intended to prevent taxpayers from subsidizing special industries or  individuals. Last October, the supervisors asked for a study of the sheriff's  proposed rate increase when dozens of Orange County massage therapists  protested the rate hike in a meeting. The county auditor subsequently reviewed  the actual cost for background checks and license preparations and recommended  the fee be set at $362 for new permits and $218 for renewals.  </P></p>

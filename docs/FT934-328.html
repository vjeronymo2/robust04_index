			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Pensions under pressure The mis-selling of UK personal pensions uncovered in the final months of the year will doubtless reverberate through 1994, especially for companies found guilty of malpractice. But the shape of retirement provision in the UK is being decided elsewhere. The regulatory reforms proposed by the Goode Committee, which delivered its report in October, have been accepted by government and are now in the consultation process. Last month Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, promised a review of taxation of savings which will presumably include pension funds. In the New Year, the Accounting Standards Board plans to review the way companies account for pension costs. Better prudential regulation, a more rational tax regime and greater consistency in accounting are all worthy objectives. But there are pitfalls along the way. The greatest danger is that reforms will, in aggregate, discourage companies from setting up defined-benefit occupational pension schemes. With contributions on a rising trend, companies already have a reason to consider money-purchase schemes instead. There can be no surplus or contribution holiday under such an arrangement, but the investment risk lies with scheme members. Once companies are making full contributions, making the transition would involve no additional cost. If reform is seen to increase the long-term risks of running defined-benefit schemes, the incentive to switch would be great. Any drift to money-purchase schemes would have implications for financial markets too, since such funds generally pursue more risk-averse investment strategies. In the long run, pension funds would probably hold more gilts and fewer equities.</p>

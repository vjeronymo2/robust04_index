			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway sets offshore 'record' NORWAY WILL set a record for annual capital expenditure of NKr46bn (Pounds 4bn) on offshore oil and gas developments next year, but over the next five years investment will reach NKr216bn, according to a report issued by Edinburgh-based brokerage house County NatWest WoodMac. According to CNWM, 21 probable offshore developments will be approved by the Norwegian government in the short- to medium-term, covering 2.6bn barrels of oil and natural gas equivalent and 31 trillion (million million) cubic feet of gas, representing 27 per cent of total remaining reserves in Norway on an oil equivalent basis. These 21 developments will contribute 700,000 barrels of oil and NGL a day by the end of the decade. Total production will peak in 1996 at about 2.43m b/d from the expected level this year of 2.18m, the report forecasts. But, operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent will rise to NKr38 by 1996  -or a total annual NKr46bn - from the current level of NKr33  - or NKr33bn. The report also says that the increase in the charge from 1992 for gas flared and used for fuel offshore has significantly increased operating costs for the industry. It estimates operating expenditure in 1996 will rise to 58 per cent of total industry spending from 47 per cent in 1992.</p>

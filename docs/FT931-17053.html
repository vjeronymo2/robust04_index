			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Slow but sure comeback - The homes market will begin to move in 1993 MORTGAGE lenders are making tentative predictions of a gradual recovery in the property market. Halifax, Nationwide and Leeds Permanent building societies all said this week they expected house prices to stabilise this year, but none predicted a rapid recovery. Halifax, the largest society which lends to just under a fifth of mortgage holders, said it expected prices to stabilise by the spring. They have been falling by 0.5 to 0.7 per cent a month and are expected to continue dropping over the winter. The Halifax house price index showed a fall of just under eight per cent in the year to November 1992. The society is reluctant to predict the extent of recovery for this year, perhaps because it was too optimistic in its predictions for last, when it forecast a rise in house prices in line with an inflation rate of about four per cent. In its review of the housing market in 1992, the society does, however, forecast an important increase in the level of activity in 1993 - a prerequisite for the market's recovery. Last year there were just 1.1m housing transactions nationwide, representing about half the level of activity in 1988. Halifax says it expects this number to rise by 15 per cent in 1993. It finds the main barrier to recovery is a lack of confidence among buyers rather than an inability to afford property. Halifax says mortgage payments now account for 25 per cent of earnings in the south east - the area worst affected by the housing decline - compared with more than 60 per cent in 1989. The Halifax says further measures could promote a more robust housing market recovery, and suggests a number of moves the government could introduce. These include reforming mortgage interest tax relief to increase benefits for first-time buyers, and introducing a mortgage benefit scheme to assist low-income homeowners. By contrast, Mike Blackburn, chief executive of Leeds Permanent, eschews 'pill-popping policies which tend to give you a hangover'. The temporary abolition of stamp duty on homes worth under Pounds 250,000, which was lifted in August, is one measure he believes hindered, rather than helped, the housing market. 'We believe house prices generally have stabilised and will show some signs of an upturn, accompanied by increased market activity,' he said. 'But these 'green shoots' will only really take hold if they are rooted in the right climate, and that means we need to see evidence of some global warming in the industrial and commercial sectors.' Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, the second largest lender, said the government's plans to enable housing associations to buy around 20,000 empty houses would help reduce the overhang of unsold properties. 'There is undoubtedly pent up demand from would-be house buyers, particularly first-time buyers, who have put their decisions to purchase on hold over the past two years,' he said. 'However, this is counterbalanced by the continuing overhang of unsold homes and there will have to be a significant increase in turnover before we see any increase in prices.' The National Association of Estate Agents reported this week that December had been the busiest month in the past three years for agents. Michael Jones, president, said: 'Although we anticipate there will be regional variations, we suspect the market has already turned the corner and that it could revive much quicker than even the Halifax is predicting.' But bursts of activity have been seized on as evidence of a full recovery too often in the past and cautious optimism is now the catchword of the big building societies. 'Fears about job security and the economy as a whole are the main factors affecting the housing market. Changes in confidence could mean the recovery could be delayed or could be much stronger than now seems possible,' said Melville-Ross.</p>

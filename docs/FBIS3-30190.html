			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] On 15 December 1993, the Ho  Chi Minh City People's Court tried Nguyen Thanh Van and his  accomplices on charges of sabotaging security and disturbing  public order. The presiding judge was Le Thuc Anh, deputy chief  judge of the Municipal People's Court; the prosecutor was Truong  Hoang Minh, chief of the security investigations bureau of the  Municipal People's Organ of Control.    Defendants Trinh Van Thuong, Nguyen Thanh Van, Nguyen Duc  Loi, Nguyen Van Trong, and Nguyen Huu Son were military officers  under the former regime. In 1978, while undergoing  re-education, they created the so-called Vietnam People's Party  under the leadership of Trinh Van Thuong with objective of  overthrowing the "revolutionary government." After leaving  re-education, they helped Nguyen Thanh Van flee to contact  reactionary groups overseas in order to organize forces to  oppose and sabotage the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.    In November 1990, Van returned from the United States,  re-established contact with Thuong, Loi, and Son, and helped set  up the "Hung Gia Dai Viet United Front," chaired by Son. They  launched their "Nguyen Trai campaign" but did not achieve the  desired result. Next, Thuong discussed with Loi the idea of  exploiting some unresolved complaints about ricefields by a  number of peasants from Gia Tan 3 Village, Thong Nhat District,  Dong Nai Province, to incite them to oppose the authorities. In  May 1991, Van returned to Vietnam and planned with Loi and  Thuong to organize the Gia Tan 3 peasants to demonstrate in Ho  Chi Minh City. Van intended to photograph the demonstration as  evidence that he could take abroad in order to seek support from  exile groups. On 16 June 1991, Nguyen Van Chinh and La Thi Na  organized about 100 peasants who gathered at Office 2 of the  Council of Ministers; Van, Thuong, and Loi were also there to  observe and take pictures. All three were uncovered and  arrested afterwards.    The Municipal People's Court ruled that Van, Thuong, Loi,  Son, and Trong were reactionaries who had carried out many acts  against the people's government. Chinh and Na, though knowing  the five were "bad elements", had cooperated with them to  organize two demonstrations. After discussing the defendants'  roles and degrees of guilt, the court handed down prison  sentences: Nguyen Duc Loi, 11 years; Trinh Van Thuong, 10  years; Nguyen Thanh Van, nine years; Nguyen Huu Son, six years;  Nguyen Van Trong, three years; Nguyen Van Chinh, 32 months; La  Thi Na, 30 months.</p>

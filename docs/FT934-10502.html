			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Electronics companies cut staff bonuses: Payments reduced for a third year after profits decline JAPAN'S leading electronics companies are to cut bonuses, an important part of employees' income, to the lowest level for 18 years. They yesterday set bonuses at an average of around five months' salary, the third annual decrease in a row, reflecting profits declines caused by the economic downturn. This sets the tone for other industrial sectors' bonus negotiations, due to take place over the rest of autumn. Widespread cuts are expected, a further blow to depressed consumer spending. The electronics payout is well below demands by the Japanese Electric Electronics and Information Union, for a small rise from last year's bonus of 5.22 months' pay to at least 5.4 months. Yesterday it accepted companies' offer after 'the hardest negotiation we have ever had,' said Mr Katsutoshi Suzuki, its secretary general. However, Sanyo's company union broke ranks with the industry organisation and refused the offer, a rare crack in traditionally harmonious labour relations. 'The tension is high. The union will never compromise,' said Mr Yoshito Ishibashi, secretary general of the Sanyo union. He is holding out for the same bonus as last year, in cash terms, equivalent to a small reduction as measured in monthly salary terms. Bonuses, paid in two chunks at the year end and in the summer, represent on average around 30 per cent of employees' annual income. Most workers use them to repay loans or buy consumer goods. Overtime brings in another 5 per cent and basic wages the rest, according to the Nikkeiren employers' federation. Employers believe that it will be less painful for staff to accept bonus cuts now than risk reductions in wages, on which annual negotiations take place in the spring. 'We have started cutting overtime, and now we need to cut bonuses. If the unions agree to a large cut in the bonus, we might not have to go into wages,' said Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren. 'The aim is to start with the top layers of the wage structure,' he said.</p>

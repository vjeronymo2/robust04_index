			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Mulayam Keeps Cool Despite Provocation"; all </F> quotation marks as published]    [Text] Patna, March 7. What impressed the people most about  the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav,  during his two-day visit here, apart from his simplicity and  unassuming manners, was that he scrupulously refrained from  attacking any political party or leader.    The gesture was, however, not reciprocated by his Bihar  counterpart, Mr. Lallu Prasad Yadav, and his colleagues, none of  whom, barring the dissident Cooperative Minister, Mr. Ramdeo  Singh Yadav, showed the usual courtesy of receiving the visiting  Chief Minister as they did when the West Bengal Chief Minister,  Mr. Jyoti Basu, came here recently.    As though this was not enough, a procession of so-called  Dalits, organised obviously at the behest of the establishment,  held up the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister's motorcade. Also,  derogatory slogans were raised against the former Chief Minister  and Scheduled Caste leader, Mr. Ram Sundar Das, whose Loktantrik  Samajwadi Party merged on Sunday with the Samajwadi party.    Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav, on his part, showed restraint and  political finesse. When, at a dinner meeting at the residence of  Mr. Kapildeo Singh, national general secretary of the Samajwadi  party, Mr. Ramdeo Singh Yadav presented a list of 57 ruling  Janata Dal MLAs (Members of Legislative Assembly), including 28  Ministers, who, he claimed, were ready to break away from the  party, the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister counselled patience.  `Let us wait for the opportune moment and devote our energies to  strengthening the Samajwadi party.'    That Mr. Ram Sundar Das has assumed a key role in the  political calculations of the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, so  far as Bihar is concerned, and that gate crashers with dubious  antecedents such as Mr. Pappu Yadav, MLA, detained once under  the Crime Control Act, would find no place in the party, were  clear from the tone and tenor of Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav's  utterances at the merger meeting.    The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, according to sources close  to him, was annoyed at slogans -- `Pappu-Mulayam zindabad and  Bihar needs a leader like Pappu' -- raised at a civic reception  according to him, albeit out of courtesy he did go to Mr. Pappu  Yadav's residence to wish him and his bride a happy married life.</p>

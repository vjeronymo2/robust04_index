			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management 4: A long, hard look at controls - Ways of managing the risk managers, assessed by Simon London THE currency trading losses which hit Allied Lyons two years ago caused many UK companies to take a long, hard look at the risks and controls on their own treasury operations. While most finance directors vigorously denied that the scale of losses could be repeated at their company, the episode opened a wider debate about the best way to manage the risk managers. The most obvious division is between companies which organise treasury as a cost centre and those which see treasury as a discreet profit centre - making a visible contribution to the bottom line. Among the best-known profit-centred treasuries is Abbey National Treasury Services (Ants), which was set up as a separate limited company when the former building society converted to public status. Last year Ants made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 62m. A common objection to the profit centre approach, though, is that the 'profit' contribution of a treasury operation can be subjective. 'What is the market cost of foreign exchange to a Courtaulds subsidiary? The whole issue of transfer pricing of treasury products within a group like ours is highly subjective,' commented Mr James Wrangham, Courtaulds treasurer. Partly for this reason, the Courtaulds treasury is organised as a 'limited profit centre' which aims only to cover its costs. Another contention is that it is easier to set the right culture within the treasury team if the department is organised as a cost centre which provides a service to the rest of the group. Otherwise, it is argued, treasury can become an internal monopoly, more concerned with its own profits than its contribution to the group. But the decision whether to make treasury a cost centre or a profit centre is by no means the end of the risk control process. A profit-centred treasury will not necessarily engage in speculative risk-taking. Equally, a cost-centred treasury can still make significant losses if it is allowed to trade in an uncontrolled manner. However treasury is organised, then, risk control starts much higher in the company hierarchy - ideally at main board level. For example, both the treasury and operating subsidiaries are set clear objectives which reflect the company's broader attitude towards risk. For example, some companies - Courtaulds among them - have a policy that all known cash flows should be hedged. But it does not encourage forward hedging of anticipated cash flows, which it sees as a speculative activity. Subsidiaries are under orders to be as risk averse as possible, so anticipated cash flows which experience shows may never materialise - due to slippage in large contracts, for example - are not hedged. This attitude is not the rule, however. A survey by Touche Ross Management Consultants found only 15 per cent of large companies held to a policy of hedging all known cash flows. The majority hedge selectively, depending on the perceived risks. This is an area where the distinction between hedging and speculating is by no means clear-cut. For example, companies which hedge cash flows selectively must decide what to hedge and what to leave uncovered. There is clearly an element of taking-a-view on the direction of the markets in this decision-making. When a company has set broad policy guidelines, though, lines of reporting and conventional financial controls become vital. A big treasury operation such as Tate &amp; Lyle, for example, measures all its outstanding positions daily, has a specialist back-office to handle trade confirmations, and tape-records all dealers' telephone conversations just like a small bank. Volume of hedging greatly in excess of the amount of underlying cash flow is a sure sign of speculative trading. Setting position limits for dealers is an obvious place to start. These often limit the size of individual transactions and include cumulative limits for each dealer and the treasury team as a whole. Many treasuries also have counterparty limits to minimise the risk of default if a bank or securities firm fails. Tate &amp; Lyle is an example of a company which runs its treasury as a profit centre, but with the aim of increasing management control rather than encouraging speculation. As a commodities-based company, T &amp; L already has something of a trading culture and its foreign exchange dealers are allowed to trade within tightly defined limits. The aim is to sharpen the dealers' sensitivity to market movements. Controls often extend to the types of financial instruments a treasury operation is authorised to use. Allied Lyons' involvement in writing currency options - which left it open to unlimited risk when the currency market turned against it - is an example of the risks that can arise from certain types of transaction. But different instruments offer different balance of risk and reward to the company. Buying a currency forward offers a cast-iron guarantee of the rate at which a cash flow can be exchanged. But if the market moves in the company's favour, any potential rewards are lost. Using currency options presents a different risk-reward profile - and a different cash cost for buying the instrument. Leaving cash flow completely unhedged produces a different result again. One positive result of the Allied Lyons affair is a greater degree of disclosure by companies of exactly what their treasury management policies are. An increasing number of annual reports contain a passage on treasury policy - including which instruments are used and which cash flows are hedged. This level of disclosure could, in itself, act as a management control by making treasury publicly accountable.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    The framework of dealing controls  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     Management controls                 Organisational controls   Objectives and policies                    Authorisation   Limits and authorities                 Segregation of duties         Reporting                      Reconciliation &amp; checking                                           Bank mandate clauses                                              Systems control                                           Operational reporting  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / The most taxing question When the choice before the voters is paying less tax or financing a larger public sector, less tax wins every time. Or does it? The opinion poll answer is that most people would rather have better services than tax cuts. The standard Conservative response is that human nature is not like that - in the privacy of the voting booth people will forget the pious lies they told the pollsters and vote for lower taxes. The argument has been placed before us, fair and square, by the Labour party this week. It is the current focus of the opposition's relentless, 24-hours-a-day election campaign. It is probably the most pertinent question about fiscal policy that can be asked of a democratic electorate in which all the main parties are sitting one or two infinitesimal degrees to the left or right of centre. On Wednesday Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, used one of his current series of set-piece lectures (designed to establish him as a serious person, of prime ministerial calibre) to proclaim that 'available revenues should be used for health and other essential services, not for tax cuts'. Reductions in the standard rate of income tax from 25 per cent to 20 per cent would, over the lifetime of a government, mean a Pounds 30bn loss of revenue. In the same period, maintaining the real value of tax allowances and not cutting tax rates would generate Pounds 20bn of revenue, assuming a 2 1/2 per cent rate of growth of the economy. The figures are not incompatible: they both serve merely to illustrate the same rather obvious point. If you keep the rate of tax constant, and it is not too high to stifle enterprise, economic growth will see to it that you get more revenue. Purists insist that this is merely a sneaky way of raising taxes; they want fiscal drag to come out of the closet. Yet all is revealed in the red book that accompanied this year's Budget statement by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer. That assumes negative growth in 1991-92 and 3 to 3 1/4 per cent growth in the following three years. Say there is no change in tax rates, but that allowances, thresholds and duties are indexed. Then general government receipts, excluding North Sea oil revenues, increase from Pounds 225bn in the current financial year to Pounds 279bn in 1994-95. The figures take no account of probable inflation, but neither do Labour's. This extra cash is more than covered by projected spending. So Labour's promise to reduce the 'underfunding' of the health and education services is in theory already met in existing Treasury forward plans. You can see it all in Table 2A. 3 of the red book. The actual numbers are certain to be wildly wrong, since they have been prepared by the Treasury, whose forecasts would be better if they were based upon readings of the entrails of chickens. But the principle remains the same. Whichever party forms the next government will have the same amount of money to spend for a given rate of growth, unless it either cuts taxes, in which case it may have less, or raises them, in which case it may have more. So Mr Kinnock does have a point. If the Conservatives reduce the standard rate to 20p there will probably be less revenue and less to spend. I say 'probably' because cuts in higher rates of taxation have resulted in a higher overall yield, but this equation may not apply at the lower levels. The Dollars 64bn question is, would the growth rate be as high under Labour as under the Tories? Labour cannot win the argument if the debate goes in that direction, as a suddenly combative prime minister made clear in the Commons yesterday. It is, in Mr John Major's phrase, a 'sheer wish fantasy', to assume that the public will believe that Labour has the better chance of stimulating growth. Meanwhile the opposition is hammering away at its campaign to rubbish the Tory promise to cut direct taxation. It may be making headway. Mr Lamont put no timetable on his 20p target in his recent speech to the Adam Smith Institute. 'A 20p basic rate remains our firm objective for the medium term,' he said. Nowadays his thinking stretches over two parliaments rather than one. Labour is quick to pick up such nuances. The shadow chancellor, Mr John Smith, has lighted on a statement by Mr Major, that the tax cut is a 'primary objective' and, canny Scottish brief that he is, he rubs the phrase home. The government could be in trouble if people started to believe Labour's promises to put more money into health and education without increasing the basic rate of income tax. 'No change' sounds less painful than 'more taxation'. The Conservatives may have their own solution. They could increase indirect taxation. My guess is that they would start to whittle income tax down but raise VAT, this time to 20 per cent. I haven't asked any of them about this because such a question invites the answer no. Of course under Labour the effective top rate would go to 59 per cent, as already announced, but that is supposed to pay for Mr Kinnock's undertaking to shell out more for child benefit and state pensions. Maybe 59 per cent sounds terrible, but the Tories' top rate was 60 per cent until April 5 1988. So as the public auction proceeds, Mr Lamont could be obliged to qualify the 20p commitment. He is, however, in no hurry to do so. The chancellor is looking as relaxed as a man of his occasionally lugubrious temperament can; perhaps he really does see a recovery on the way. He is aware that the striking fall in the headline inflation rate due to be announced next Friday may be overshadowed by a less impressive figure for the underlying rate, but would argue that, after a suitable lag, the drop in headline inflation will have its effect on wage settlements. Will the true Tory fight-back begin then? I wonder. There is no set of Conservative ideas, or none that I am aware of, to put before the voters. It is not difficult to deride Labour's voluminous proposals as a plateful of warmed-up quangos, and quite easy to demonstrate that a great many of Mr Kinnock's promises could not be financed by his proposed taxation strategy, even now. But at least Labour has fresh-looking centrist policies to offer. The Conservatives are banking on a series of good-news announcements, a popular prime minister, and a general impression that there was a change of government last November. Their proposed 'citizen's charter', promising to hold public bodies accountable for good service, differs little from what is likely to feature in the Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos. Here is a piece of free advice for Mr Major: talk to your chancellor. I fancy that he has dreams, perhaps not unlike your own, of the day when a system of tax credits and a negative income tax might support or replace the present cumbersome social security structure. I suspect that these are stimulated more by what my colleague Mr Samuel Brittan writes than by the 'citizen's income' proposed by the Liberal Democrats. It certainly has nothing in common with Labour's minimum wage. Dreams need working up into practical policies, and I am sure that the careful Mr Lamont has no intention of putting his mind to the tricky matter of unifying the tax and social security systems until the election is safely out of the way. He would no doubt move at a prudent pace even then. Any worthwhile scheme is sure to cost more than the present arrangements. Yet there is - is there not? - a potential manifesto proposal in all this that could regain the initiative from the wily firm of Kinnock and Smith. Merely dissociating the party from the unpopular elements of Thatcherism is not a sufficient condition for Tory victory.</p>

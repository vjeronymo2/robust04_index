			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMART ACQUIRES SITE FOR OFFICE BUILDINGS, PLAZA  </P> <P> A Chicago development company said last week that it has bought land on which  it will build two office buildings and an outdoor plaza across from the  Glendale Galleria.  </P> <P> Homart Development Co., one of the nation's largest shopping center and office  building developers, announced the purchase of 4.23 acres for more than $16  million. The site is bounded by Broadway Street, Brand Boulevard, Wilson Avenue  and Orange Street.  </P> <P> The plaza will give downtown shoppers a place to rest and the city a sort of  town square, planners said.  </P> <P> "The Homart complex, with its pedestrian retail orientation, will provide a  physical and functional link between the Glendale Galleria and the center of  downtown," said Barbara Knight, acting deputy director of the city  Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> The plaza is to have a fountain and occasional live entertainment, such as  carolers during the Christmas season, Homart officials said.  </P> <P> Homart, a Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. subsidiary, will spend $150 million on the  complex, said Chris Stirling, a Homart official. Construction is to begin by  late summer, and the project is to be completed by 1994.  </P> <P> The plaza will be between 18- and 22-story office towers.  </P> <P> Besides bringing more tax revenue and jobs, the complex will improve parking  downtown, Knight said. Its 2,600 parking spaces will be available to Galleria  shoppers on weekends and holidays.  </P> <P> "It's a positive step," Knight said. "The whole block has been vacated for  years, and we've been trying to do something about it."  </P> <P> Nearby merchants have long complained that the vacant lot, surrounded by a  deteriorating fence, is an eyesore in the heart of the city's retail district.  But some city officials are concerned that the project will lead to increased  traffic congestion downtown.  </P> <P> In August the City Council, sitting as the city Redevelopment Agency, approved  3 to 2 a Homart request to enlarge the office and ground-floor retail space by  90,000 square feet to a total of 790,000, clearing the way for the purchase.  Council members Larry Zarian and Ginger Bremberg voted against the enlargement.  </P> <P> Knight said the impact of the increase in traffic will be minimal because the  developers will be required to include such mitigating measures as restriping  adjacent streets, adding left-turn signals, and planning traffic circulation in  and out of the Homart garages.  </P> <P> Zarian disagreed, saying the enlargement will help slow downtown traffic to a  "near-gridlock" level.  </P> <P> "The growth of our city depends on how much traffic we can handle, not on the  space available for development," he said.  </P> <P> "This is a very good community with a pro-business attitude," Homart's Stirling  said. "We are committed to Glendale and will continue looking for opportunities  in the retail and office sectors."  </P> <P> Homart bought the land from the American Trading Real Estate Co., which cleared  it five years ago and planned to build two office buildings.  </P> <P> American Trading abandoned the plan, citing unfavorable economic conditions and  disagreements with the city.  </P> <P> Homart, a Chicago-based company, said it has developed 61 U.S. shopping centers  in its 28 years of existence.  </P></p>

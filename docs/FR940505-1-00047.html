			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (SMAQMD), the Yolo-Solano Air Pollution Control District (YSAPCD),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Placer County Air Pollution Control District (PCAPCD), the El  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dorado County Air Pollution Control District (EDCAPCD), the Feather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> River Air Quality Management District (FRAQMD), SACOG and CARB plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to submit a comprehensive revised ozone attainment SIP on or before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 15, 1994. The local agencies hope to release a draft of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this SIP in the Spring of 1994 and to modify it after EPA finalizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FIP in February 1995. The air quality modeling in the SIP and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP are based on similar data and should be consistent. There may,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, be significant differences between the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the two plans to attain the ozone standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Ventura  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 15, 1993, the State submitted a Ventura ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate-of-progress plan addressing the Act's requirement that a plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be submitted by that date demonstrating creditable VOC reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of at least 15 percent from 1990 to 1996. The plan describes how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this reduction can be accomplished with an enhanced I/M program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plus measures that the State committed to adopt and implement by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996 in Ventura's 1991 Air Quality Management Plan. Many of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promised local measures have already been adopted, but an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approvable enhanced I/M program has not been authorized by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State legislature. As in the case of Sacramento, EPA cannot now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approve this Ventura plan submittal with respect to the progress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CARB plan to submit a comprehensive revised ozone attainment SIP on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or before November 15, 1994. VCAPCD hopes to release a draft of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this SIP by the Spring of 1994 and to modify it after EPA finalizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FIP in February 1995. The air quality modeling in the SIP and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP are based on similar data and should be consistent. As in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case of Sacramento, however, the regulations included in the two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans may be different.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. South Coast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 31, 1992, the State submitted the CO plan for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Coast. This plan includes a demonstration of attainment by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the year 2000 relying on emission reductions from previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted regulations as well as from an enhanced I/M program meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements of sections 182(c)(3) and 187(a)(6). Because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State legislature has not yet enacted legislation authorizing such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an enhanced I/M program, EPA proposes to disapprove the CO plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with respect to the requirements for an attainment demonstration,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable further progress, reasonably available control measures,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and enhanced I/M.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 15, 1993, the Agency issued a finding of failure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit two other mandatory elements of the CO plan: (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transportation control measures (TCMs) to offset growth, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by section 182(d)(1)(A); and (2) adopted contingency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures to be implemented if vehicle miles traveled (VMT)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forecasts are exceeded, in accordance with section 187(a)(3). In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section II.C.1., below, EPA is proposing to disapprove the CO SIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with respect to these six elements: attainment demonstration,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable further progress, reasonably available control measures, provision for an enhanced  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> I/M program, TCMs to offset growth, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingency measures to be implemented if VMT forecasts are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeded. EPA is also proposing a partial approval of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions of the plan that represent an improvement over what is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently in the SIP, do not conflict with proposed FIP provisions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and meet some of the applicable requirements of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 15, 1993, the State submitted a 15 percent rate-of-progress plan for the South Coast. The 15 percent plan relies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on reductions from currently adopted rules, but also depends upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a relatively small contribution from 10 SCAQMD measures scheduled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for full adoption in 1994 or 1995 and an improved I/M program. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the case of Sacramento and Ventura, EPA cannot at this time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propose to approve this South Coast submittal with respect to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15 percent rate-of-progress demonstration. However, in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II.C.2., below, for entirely different purposes EPA is proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditionally approve the SCAQMD commitments to adopt rules during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994 and 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 15, 1993, the SCAQMD adopted rules implementing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) program for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sulfur oxides (SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). This innovative program establishes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> declining cap ``bubble'' requirement on most facilities with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions greater than 4 tons per year of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes emissions allocation and emissions trading components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends to propose to approve (or conditionally approve) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RECLAIM regulations in separate rulemaking, following SIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submittal. For the purposes of the FIP attainment demonstration,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes to assign credit to the adopted RECLAIM program, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> went into effect on January 1, 1994. If EPA does not finally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approve the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RECLAIM rules, EPA would not be able to grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits for associated reductions, and would need to amend the FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordingly. For more details on the RECLAIM rules, see section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.C.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SCAQMD, SCAG, and CARB are currently preparing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive revision to existing air quality plans, addressing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all pollutants and the requirements of both the federal and State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clean Air Acts. SIP submittal of this comprehensive plan (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions of the plan) is scheduled to occur on or before November  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15, 1994. The new plan will include revised 1990 baseyear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions inventories, and projected inventories for interim years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the year 2020. With respect to motor vehicle emissions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these inventories may be significantly different from those used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed ozone and CO FIPs, because the 1994 plan is expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to rely on new trip modeling input data and revised motor vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions factors. For ozone, the plan may analyze additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> episodes, including a weekend episode.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5.

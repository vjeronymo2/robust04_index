			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Hussein hopes to meet Fahd King Hussein of Jordan led a delegation to Saudi Arabia yesterday, on his first visit to the kingdom since relations deteriorated because of the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis, James Whittington writes from Amman. Jordan's media reported the king had left for Saudi Arabia to perform the Ummra, a minor Moslem pilgrimage. But officials acknowledged he was seeking a meeting with King Fahd. One western diplomat in Amman described the trip as 'significant'. It demonstrated Jordan's desire to achieve a rapprochement with the Saudis, still bitter over King Hussein's refusal to back the US-led effort to force Iraq out of Kuwait in early 1991.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Campaigners lose Barts battle Campaigners yesterday lost their High Court battle to stop the closure of the accident and emergency unit at St Bartholomew's hospital in London. Two judges rejected their accusations that Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, 'perversely and irrationally' ordered the closure of the department last December. The protesters claimed public consultation procedures were flawed because Mrs Bottomley had made up her mind to go ahead with closure before these had even started.</p>

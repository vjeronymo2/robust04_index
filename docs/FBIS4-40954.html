At the same time price increases for food goods were less  than 1 percent in the Northwest, Volga-Vyatka, and Urals regions.    As of 17 June the average cost of the basket of the 19 most  important food products was 55,400 rubles [R], an increase of  2.7 percent during the week and 80 percent since the beginning  of the year.

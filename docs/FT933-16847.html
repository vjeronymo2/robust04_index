			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: TV network names founding investors SEVEN Network, the Australian broadcasting company formerly controlled by Mr Christopher Skase, has confirmed its planned public float will have News Corporation and Australian telecommunications group Telecom as founding shareholders. Mr Ivan Deveson, Seven Network chairman, said yesterday News Corporation, the international media group, would hold a 15 per cent interest in the company and Telecom, the Australian Government-owned telephone group, 10 per cent. He said News and Telecom would be entitled to nominate one director each to the Seven board, but no nominations had yet been received. Seven, which had been in the hands of its bankers following the collapse of Mr Skase's Qintex empire, has circulated a draft prospectus for the float, likely to seek between Dollars A600m (USDollars 402.7m) and Dollars A725m. The prospectus is believed to price Seven Network shares at just over eight times forecast earnings for 1994. The offering is expected in August and analysts said last night the presence of News and Telecom would make the public marketing task easier. The float marks a return to metropolitan television in Australia by News Corporation, which sold its stake in the rival Ten Network in the 1980s to Westfield, the Australian property investment group. For Telecom, the investment would be its first in a large television network.</p>

It is  the beginning of the road to the aim pursued, namely to a  European security system. We are counting on mutual contacts  between the Polish Army and the armies of the NATO countries and  we favor joint maneuvers; for the time being, at the lowest  tactical levels. We are trying in various ways to become  acquainted with and get used to each other. In this sense, we  are creating numerous opportunities, the West is doing the same,  and this inspires us with moderate optimism."    In connection with the stage of Polish-Romanian military  relations and their development, the Polish defense minister  said:    "Were we to check the history of the two peoples, we would  find numerous elements of friendship, fruitful cultural  contacts, economic, and, of course, military cooperation. Now,  we are jointly solving problems linked to higher military  training and improving cooperation between our topographical  services and in the area of health care. We are relying on  technical cooperation. The access by our two countries to the  PFP initiative is opening up new opportunities for cooperation."</p>

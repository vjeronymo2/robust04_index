			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> SPANISH CIVIL WAR AND FAMILIAL DEVOTION;  </P> <P> THE STUFF OF HEROES BY MIGUEL DELIBES TRANSLATED FROM SPANISH BY FRANCES M.  LOPEZ MORILLAS PANTHEON $19.95, 295 PAGES  </P> <P> The war between righteous and unrighteous can be fierce and bloody; nowhere  near as bloody, though, as the civil war between two of the righteous.  </P> <P> Spain was bled dry by such a civil war half a century ago, and it is still  recovering. Pity the land with a surplus of the just or, as someone put it in a  context I cannot recall: Alas for the country that requires heroes.  </P> <P> It is the theme of Miguel Delibes's novel, titled with an ironic ambiguity that  becomes abundantly plain well before the end. Delibes has written a  post-convalescent novel; his is one of many voices to declare the Spanish Civil  War dead, and buried too; though perhaps not entirely composted, broken down  and dispersed.  </P> <P> Published in 1987, or 48 years after the war ended, it strikes this reader, who  lived and wrote in Spain at the end of the 1960s, as something of late and old  news. Which does not deprive the book of value. Its humane political message,  voiced throughout, comes in at the end with a sharp epigrammatic force that  makes it feel new. As fiction, the book seems uncertain as to what it wants to  be. It makes several choices, one or two quite good, and a third -- which  submerges the second half -- like lead.  </P> <P> The novel begins in 1927 in the bosom of a provincial family whose patriarch  had fought as a red-bereted traditionalist in the Carlist wars and who -- in  family legend -- could have a been a count, had he been pushier. The house is  dark and stolid and emblazoned with an escutcheon.  </P> <P> The stolidity is deceptive. Grandfather Leon, his three children and their  spouses live in perpetual disputation. Although all but one are conservatives,  the Spanish right was divided three or four ways, and each division was a small  civil war to itself.  </P> <P> Leon was one kind of monarchist; Uncle Felipe Neri, a colonel, was a different  kind. Uncle Vidal was an anti-monarchist, a proto-Fascist and a free-thinker.  Several of the women seemed to believe that the rightful ruler of Spain was Our  Lady of Pilar and her attending clergy.  </P> <P> Delibes softens these wars with familial devotion. And he lightens them with  eccentricity. Into this faintly comic provincial pressure-cooker comes a  portent.  </P> <P> Gervasio, the grandson, erupts whenever he hears martial music. His skin  develops bumps, his hair stands up straight. The grandfather is overjoyed;  surely, the boy is a future hero.  </P> <P> His uncle, Colonel Felipe, is also much moved, though more cautious. He keeps a  journal of what he calls Gervasio's horripilations. They occur not only from  music but at patriotic rallies, and at the Good Friday procession of  blood-stained Christs. He gives Gervasio a set of his uniforms.  </P> <P> Telmo, the boy's father, has them burned. He is the plebeian in-law who married  upward; his family are shopkeepers, he is an atheist and a liberal. His wife  prays for him; his son wonders if he is damned.  </P> <P> Gervasio and his prothetic stigma -- we see the Civil War coming, of course --  make a wonderful image, particularly as the author writes as a real little boy  living in the picaresque life of his family and his town. The passage of time,  however, is not kind either to him or to the book.  </P> <P> Gervasio turns into an adolescent who hangs out with his schoolmates and gets  up to various kinds of unremarkable mischief. The horripilations go into  temporary recess. They reappear when the Civil War breaks out. Telmo is  imprisoned with other "leftists" in the town bullring, though Felipe's  gallantly exercised connections keep him alive; unlike his two socialist  brothers, who are murdered and mutilated. At the same time, other relatives are  horrifically killed by the Republicans in Madrid.  </P> <P> Dreaming of heroism, Gervasio joins the navy with his schoolmates. The second  half of the book shows him on a training ship and then on a warship. We miss  his family; the last part of the book is a tedious account of a young man who  dreams of glory but finds he's a terrible sailor.  </P> <P> His wartime experiences break down his illusions about the glory of the Franco  "crusade." A kindly superior turns out to be a Republican spy, and is arrested  and shot. At the end, he reflects. His Republican superior was a hero too. So  were his murdered relatives on both sides. It is not the cause -- the  righteousness that confers glory. "Couldn't it be the other way around?  Couldn't it be that the man who dies generously is the man who ennobles the  cause he serves?"  </P> <P> It is an apt and shining discovery, a redefinition of heroism for a  post-convalescent Spain. Unfortunately it comes after about 150 pages that  don't do much except stand still in vignettes about a long-ago life in the  navy.  </P> <P> Next: Elaine Kendall reviews "Etchings in an Hourglass" by Kate Simon (Harper  &amp; Row).  </P> <P> </P></p>

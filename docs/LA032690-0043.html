"We're providing a summary  of information that we think people will need."  </P> <P> Matz said members of the council last year suggested the city open an  information line to keep residents better posted on upcoming events. He added:  "This is a 24-hour service. We hope people will take advantage of it."  </P> <P> The Information Line number is (714) 220-0500.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHAT HE SAW IN LAGUNA CANYON'S 'TELL' TOLD HIM A THING OR TWO  </P> <P> After reading Calendar's two-page laudatory but very questionable coverage of  Laguna Canyon's "The Tell" (Sept. 3), I revisited the site just to make certain  my eyes hadn't deceived me.  </P> <P> Second time around, you can ignore the sheer ugliness of that 600-foot strip of  plywood pictorial bologna and the rubbish about it being "poetry" or "depicting  family life as it is now" and concentrate on the anti-development statement  "The Tell" is supposed to be making.  </P> <P> Do photos of bikini bottoms and Coke stands, Barbara Walters and Chinese dogs  make a forceful statement about the necessity to preserve the beauty of Laguna  Canyon? I think your reporter wore rose-colored glasses or maybe his lemonade  was spiked by the photographer-promoters.  </P> <P> He made no mention of the destruction of the land or the tearing up of animal  habitat. The duped city, of course, first began that damage with earthmoving  equipment, both machine and man-hours paid for by taxes. The city fathers (and  mothers) who approved this venture, committing resources to it, should have  their heads examined.  </P> <P> In a community where you almost have to file an environmental impact report to  put out a garbage can, I doubt an EIR was even considered for this canyon rape  job of which an admitted goal is a Guinness record.  </P> <P> Mention was made of a $10,000 contribution by the Festival of Arts. To see what  their $10,000 bought or wrought, I hope the committee members have driven out  to "The Tell" -- unmistakably marked by a junked car half buried in sand. From  there, the artistic endeavor goes down. The festival was likewise duped.  </P> <P> The late Ansel Adams would rotate out of his grave at the sight of what has  been done in the name of conservancy and photography.  </P> <P> THEODORE TAYLOR  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

The officer also said that no gunmen had taken over the  mayor's office Thursday. Cherepkov and his deputy had been  evicted from the mayor's office Wednesday.    The officer said that as few as twenty, mostly elderly,  supporters of Cherepkov, had been outside the city  administration office in the early hours of Thursday.    Igor Lebedinets, deputy head of the territorial  administration, told Interfax that the former mayor's supporters  exaggerated the importance of the event.    An officer on duty in the Federal Counterintelligence  Service  said that the police, and not his agency, were handling the case.    The official representative of the territory in Moscow told  Interfax that the situation in Vladivostok was quiet and  Cherepkov had been removed from the mayor's office the day  before.    Cherepkov could not be reached by phone. The territory  representative said that Cherepkov had changed his telephone  number on several occasions during his tenure of office. Now he  probably simply did not want to lift the receiver. The official  said that the exact whereabouts of Cherepkov were unknown. He  had not been arrested but had been told not to leave the city.</p>

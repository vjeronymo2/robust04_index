			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: A desirable reform Sir, Why would it be 'unthinkable' for member states to compensate farmers for price reductions from their own treasuries? Mr Terry Wynn MEP (Letters, January 18) says such a move would be to 'renationalise' the Common Agricultural Policy. On the contrary, it could be part of a highly desirable reform whose other main element would be a steady reduction in EU farm prices until they are in line with world prices. The impact on some farmers - mainly those operating small, barely profitable holdings - would be a social problem requiring social policies to be devised by member states. Why on earth should the EU embrace Mr Wynn's idea of one-off transferable bonds to compensate farmers when it would never dream of such a benefit for any other victims of industrial restructuring? The EU's social and environmental objectives for agriculture are no longer being served by the CAP. If these were left to member governments, subsidiarity would be made flesh and national democracies strengthened. Responsibility for agricultural trade would remain with the Union, as would the application of competition policy. The EU would become a good world citizen, surpluses would disappear, environmental damage be much reduced, a source of rows between member states eliminated and a major obstacle removed to membership of the Union for central and eastern European countries.

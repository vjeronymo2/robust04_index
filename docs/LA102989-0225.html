			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SIBERIAN ISLAND, WITH FEW AMENITIES, SEEKS INVESTORS  </P> <P> The Soviet Union is trying eagerly to lure investors to Sakhalin, but foreign  businessmen think Moscow is naive in thinking that foreigners will flock to the  remote island off Siberia under present conditions.  </P> <P> Sakhalin, in the Soviet Far East, opened to foreigners only last year, has  recently played host to foreign businessmen, mostly from South Korea and Japan.  </P> <P> But a gulf seems to separate the two sides on what comes first --  infrastructure or foreign investment.  </P> <P> "This question of infrastructure may be solved only by foreign capital from  joint ventures," said Ivan Kuropatko, a Sakhalin official. "The Japanese are  hesitating just because they don't want to lose their money. There are no real  obstacles (to investment)."  </P> <P> "We think it's possible to establish joint ventures from zero by reorganizing  certain existing enterprises and using foreign capital to modernize them," said  economist Piotr Baklanov of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences in Khabarovsk.  </P> <P> Foreign trade official Valerian Timofeev said he believed that the rich  resources of timber and fish on the island -- which lies some 25 miles to the  north of Japan's northern island of Hokkaido and covers almost 30,000 square  miles -- would provide the main lure to foreign investors.  </P> <P> An internal Japanese Foreign Ministry memorandum obtained by Reuters was  doubtful that Japanese businessmen should leap into ventures in Sakhalin.  </P> <P> "The Sakhalin authorities eagerly press for foreign joint ventures, but  transport, accommodation and other infrastructure need to be taken care of by  them beforehand," it said.  </P> <P> The Japanese, wooed assiduously for their technology and money, worry that  there is no clear-cut law or government policy on joint ventures, the memo  noted.  </P> <P> A Japanese official who visited the Soviet Far East recently said he was asked  repeatedly by his Soviet counterparts why the Japanese are not flocking to  invest there.  </P> <P> He cited problems of communications -- three hours or more to place an overseas  call. "That's even without a typhoon as an excuse," he said.  </P> <P> "And after midnight, the water stops in these places," the official said. "On  top of that, there's a labor shortage. How can you expect Japanese to put money  into such a place?"  </P> <P> It will take at least 20 years before the infrastructure could be in place --  unlike the three years predicted by the Soviets, the official said.  </P> <P> H.K. Kang, a Tokyo-based South Korean businessman who was in Sakhalin to  explore business opportunities, said he left without making a deal.  </P> <P> "Although they talk about perestroika, their allocations of electricity,  gasoline and other key things are totally inadequate," he said.  </P> <P> He bemoaned a lack of precise data on local conditions.  </P> <P> "I talked to many groups about population, etc., but everybody gave me  different figures, especially on industry. This wouldn't work with the  Japanese, who want precise data."  </P> <P> So far, six joint ventures have been made, including a Japanese restaurant in  the southwestern Sakhalin port of Kholmsk. The largest is a $26-million  fish-processing plant venture, also with Japanese partners.  </P> <P> One grave problem on Sakhalin is the complete lack of decent hotels to attract  foreign businessmen or tourists.  </P> <P> The shabby Tourist Hotel where a group of Western reporters stayed lacked hot  water and had leaky toilets, with the water level rising to ankle-level.  </P></p>

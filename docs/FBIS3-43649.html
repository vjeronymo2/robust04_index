The Ciskei  homeland, a member of the right-wing Freedom Alliance, said  earlier on Monday it would join the Transitional Executive  Council (TEC) helping to chart South Africa's transition to  majority rule.    Brig Gqozo also announced that 250 Ciskei troops would serve  alongside government soldiers and former guerrillas in a  national peacekeeping force.    In a statement issued in Pretoria the NP said brig gqozo's  vision to avoid a cul-de-sac for his own people and his  breakaway from an unhealthy partnership of groups who had very  little in common was a wise move. "It is also the first visible  crack in the Freedom Alliance and will set the pace for others  to follow. We sincerely hope and trust that other individual  groups within the alliance will also display their commitment to  a democratic solution by following suit.    "We also wish to accept that the more moderate leaders  within  the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] and the IFP  (Inkatha Freedom Party) are rethinking their situation with the  aim to follow the example set by the Ciskei," the statement said.    Transkei military leader Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa in welcoming  Ciskei's move said there was no doubt in his mind that the  action by the homeland's government would imporve stability in  the region. "The future of the civil servants and security  forces in Ciskei would strengthen these workers to redouble  their efforts in supporting the democratic changes which are  taking place now and after the elections.    "The move by Ciskei should also make things easy for the  finalisation of the regional government and other related  issues, as far as the eastern Cape -- which includes Port  Elizabeth, Ciskei, Border and Transkei -- is concerned," Gen  Holomisa said.    He said Transkei wished that the relationship among the  political organisations in the region would improve as a result  of Ciskei's move. "I hope that the government employees in  Bophuthatswana and kwaZulu will seriously consider pressurising  their political heads that their future depends on their future  paymaster, which would be a government of national unity.  Therefore they must demand to be catered for in the deal."    An African National Congress spokesman said any move by  members of the Freedom Alliance to join the ranks of people who  wanted democracy should be welcomed.</p>

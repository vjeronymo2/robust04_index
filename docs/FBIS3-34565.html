			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Hamid al-Yahyawi: "Algerian Foreign </F> Minister: Zeroual To Issue General Amnesty"]    [Text] Brussels--Algerian Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah  Dembri announced yesterday that Algeria has abandoned the  security option in favor of dialogue. He stressed that the  dialogue is being conducted with all political groups without  exception. He urged the renunciation of violence. He said:  Elections will be held in three years. In a statement to  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Dembri said that a general amnesty will be  issued soon for all political prisoners.    The Algerian foreign minister was speaking to AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT in Brussels, where he attended the meetings of the  European-Algerian joint cooperation council. He asked for  European aid to help to extricate Algeria from its economic  crisis. It was announced yesterday that President Liamine  Zeroual had received the national dialogue committee, which  arranged the national conference held on 25 January.    On the situation in Algeria, Dembri said: The dialogue plan  is continuing among all Algerian political groups without  exception. It is essential, because the political and economic  crisis requires united efforts from all Algerian people. We  also urge those taking part in national accord to renounce  violence as a means to reach or remain in power. I believe that  in three years we will return to the electoral march and build a  new legitimacy to establish an authority in Algeria.    Pointing out that he is the foreign minister and a member of  the committee that appointed the head of state, he said: I  believe that President Zeroual has from the outset -- as  mentioned in his swearing-in speech and the speech delivered the  day before yesterday -- clarified the new framework for dialogue  in Algeria, clearly excluding the security option as a solution  in Algeria and giving precedence to dialogue. Because security  and stability are the responsibility of every Algerian man and  woman. Dembri added: There are very reassuring prospects in  Algeria, which causes us to ask Arab public opinion to support  the transition phase the country is experiencing and not to  choose between Algeria's sons.    Regarding his current mission in Brussels, the Algerian  foreign minister said: We are hoping to reach during our  meetings with European officials a formula leading to the  signing of a new partnership agreement between Algeria and the  EC as soon as possible and laying common ground for a free  exchange between the two parties. The agreement we are seeking  will also expand within the framework of cooperation with the  Maghreb community, especially Tunisia and Morocco. It is  necessary that we as the Maghreb Union act as a bloc to  negotiate with the EC in order to guarantee for ourselves a  flourishing future.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Halifax schedule slips for deal with BNP The schedule for Halifax Building Society to buy the UK mortgage business of Banque Nationale de Paris has slipped by about a month, and the deal is now unlikely to be completed until late January or early February next year. The total of outstanding mortgages in the BNP business is also slipping and will probably amount to about Pounds 1.4bn when the deal is concluded, compared with the Pounds 1.5bn it represented when the negotiations were announced in August. However, this still amounts to almost 0.5 per cent of the total UK mortgage market, where Halifax is already the UK's largest mortgage lender. The society's proposed merger with Leeds Permanent, the UK's fifth largest society, would give it about 20 per cent of the total. Mr Dick Spelman, marketing general manager at Halifax, said that all the main negotiations had been completed satisfactorily, and the remaining task was to agree the detail of the sale and purchase arrangements.</p>

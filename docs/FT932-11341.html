			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Murdoch staff to vote on pay plan MR RUPERT MURDOCH'S News International is balloting its employees, seeking their agreement to a government-approved profit-related pay scheme. The scheme would replace the annual salary review for the 1993-1994 financial year and might be extended for a further 12 months. Under government regulations at least 80 per cent of all employees must approve the proposal by May 19 for it to come into force. The maximum tax-free PRP element of total pay can be 20 per cent or Pounds 4,000, whichever is the lower. News International is proposing that 15 per cent or Pounds 3,000 of an employee's salary, whichever is the lower, will be the PRP element of their pay. The company says it will assume that anybody who does not vote in the ballot approves of the scheme. News International director Mr August Fischer, in a letter to employees, says if the scheme is successful in the first year the company's 'present intention would be to continue it for a second year and possibly expand the scheme to the full tax-free PRP allowance'. He adds that the benefit of the scheme will be that it can 'allow a greater rise in take-home pay than would have been possible in any review, since inflation is running at such a low rate'. Someone earning Pounds 25,000 a year would be paid Pounds 3,000 of it in PRP, equivalent to a Pounds 750 pay rise. More than 100 journalists working on magazines published by Morgan Grampian will take a second consecutive day of strike action today in protest at their employer's plan to de-recognise the National Union of Journalists. Morgan Grampian, which publishes magazines including The Engineer and Pulse, said all titles would be published as planned.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Poll wants Patten to dilute plan AN OPINION poll released on the eve of the meeting today between the foreign ministers of Britain and China to discuss political proposals for Hong Kong has indicated that the people of the territory want to see the democratic blueprint of Governor Chris Patten proceed rapidly, but in a diluted form. A University of Hong Kong poll found that 52.5 per cent of respondents wanted Mr Patten to put his proposals before the Legislative Council (Legco), the colony's parliamentary body, as planned in mid-October. Such a move would draw an aggressive response from China. Few, however, wanted the proposals to proceed unchanged. While Mr Patten will be able to draw encouragement from the response, investors continued to speculate on the fate of the proposals. The Hang Seng Index, the main barometer of market sentiment, rose 125.12 points to an historic high of 7,676.22 amid suggestions that Britain was preparing to make substantial concessions to China over the Patten plans. The stock market rise was in part a reaction to a letter sent to British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by Mr Martin Lee, leading pro-democracy Legco member. Mr Lee wrote: 'It is widely suspected that the British government does not have the backbone to follow through on its moral and political obligations to us and is on the brink of total capitulation to Beijing.' Brokers take this as a positive sign. Tension has been mounting ahead of the New York meeting between Mr Hurd and Mr Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, and the governor's address to Legco on October 6.</p>

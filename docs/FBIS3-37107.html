			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oleg Panfilov in the "Tajikistan" column] </F>   [Text] A resolution by the Tajikistan Supreme Soviet  Presidium has changed the structure of the government, which now  includes 23 ministries and three committees. The number of  deputy heads of government has been cut from eight to five. In  his first weeks in office new Prime Minister Abdudzhalil Samadov  appealed to his countrymen to "submit constructive proposals" on  improving the operation of the national economy, at the same  time apologizing that he cannot respond to each letter from  citizens.    The new prime minister's concern is understandable: The  economy has been brought to a critical point. Since last  October, Uzbeksgaztrans has reduced gas deliveries to Tajikistan  by 70 percent, and in particular the Dushanbe thermal power  station has had to operate at only 30 percent of capacity. As a  result, trees began to be cut in Dushanbe in late fall, just  like in Yerevan some time in the past. As the economic crisis  mounted, the flow of Russian-speakers from the country  increased. And although the Tajik press still writes that the  cause is the language law adopted a few years ago, in fact the  true reason lies in increased confrontation by armed groupings  inside the "winners'" camp. The uncontrolled movement of arms;  more than a thousand criminals at large, released by People's  Front gunmen from the Kurgan Tyube prison in summer 1992; and  finally, the makeup of the Internal Affairs Ministry, including  officers with a criminal record -- these are the reasons which  will hardly be conducive to improving the situation. And  although writing in VECHERNIY DUSHANBE, city prosecutor  Salomiddin Sharopov suggested that crime has fallen, he could  not hide the fact that the number of serious offenses in  Dushanbe has increased by 19.3 percent, including murders, 2.2  times, and robberies, by 31.9 percent.    Nonetheless, the Supreme Soviet Presidium decided not to  dismiss power ministry chiefs for failing their duties, but  quite the contrary upgraded the level of the state security  committee to a ministry. It seems that this will have only  marginal effect because the political and economic crisis will  hardly allow the law enforcement bodies, "diluted" with former  racketeers, to make the population more secure. Tajik security  officers more or less show their worth only on the border, but  even then with heavy losses.</p>

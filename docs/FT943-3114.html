			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Credit Lyonnais withdraws from UK personal banking Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled French banking group, is to withdraw from personal banking in the UK and will close half its regional corporate banking centres in a re-focusing of its activities. The number of staff in the UK is expected to fall by about 60 to around 400: some but not all of these will be compulsory redundancies. The group expects to close its personal banking facilities within six months and will aim to help its few thousand UK personal banking customers find alternative facilities. Mr Bernard Darmayan, UK general manager, said the number of personal customers was too low to justify the investment that was required. Regional corporate banking centres at Bristol, Cambridge, Newcastle, Nottingham and Southampton would be closed by the end of the year, he said, but this would be offset by investment in information technology at the remaining five centres, enabling them to provide better services and to cover the areas previously dealt with by the wider network.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The provincial government called a meeting  yesterday to analyze the province's economic situation. During  the meeting, the participants reviewed the province's economic  operation in the first quarter this year. The objectives and  primary tasks were set forth for the second quarter.    Tian Chengping, Wang Hanmin, Ma Yuanbiao, Bai Ma, and the  principal officials in charge of all the commissions,  committees, offices, departments, and bureaus of the provincial  government attended the meeting.    The leading officials of the provincial planning commission,  the financial and economic commission, the financial department,  the commercial department, the economic and trade department,  the statistical bureau, the agricultural and animal husbandry  office, and the provincial People's Bank briefed the meeting  participants on the conditions in industry, agriculture, capital  construction, foreign trade, and implementation of the financial  budget in the first quarter of this year.    Statistics show that the province's GDP for the first  quarter  this year totaled more than 1,722 million yuan, which means a  5.7 percent increase over the same period last year in terms of  comparable prices. Industry has maintained a 5.6 percent growth  rate, and agriculture and animal husbandry have exhibited  satisfactory performance. Foreign trade has been developing  steadily and the banking sector has been operating smoothly.  The economic operation as a whole remained basically stable in  the first quarter, but some fairly serious problems have yet to  be resolved. The main problems are as follows: with regard to  agriculture, slow progress has been made in spring sowing; the  peasants' investment in agricultural production has decreased;  and, with regard to industry, production has been affected by  various factors and has dropped by 10.9 percentage points as  compared with the same period last year; a larger portion of  enterprises have suffered losses, with an increasing amount of  losses set against decreasing economic returns.    To cope with the existing problems and difficulties,  Governor  Tian Chengping urged the departments in charge of comprehensive  economic management, competent departments, and banking and  taxation sectors to work together more closely to ensure steady  economic growth this year. [passage omitted]    Tian Chengping said: Deepening reform is an effective  approach to invigorating the economy, especially large- and  medium-sized enterprises. Enterprises must devote efforts to  transform the enterprise operational mechanism, while government  agencies, in the process of functional transformation, must not  slacken their guidance and assistance to enterprises, but must  instead strive to solve more practical problems and serve the  enterprises.

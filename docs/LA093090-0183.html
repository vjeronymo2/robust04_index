			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAUDIS A FADING TARGET FOR BRAZIL ARMS INDUSTRY;  </P> <P> MILITARY: THE U.S. MOVE TO SELL THE KINGDOM MORE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS REDUCES  THE CHANCES FOR THIRD WORLD SUPPLIERS. SOME ARE IN DEEP FINANCIAL TROUBLE.  </P> <P> Brazil's arms industry, once the biggest in the Third World but now in deep  financial trouble, desperately needs new business. So as Saudi Arabia stocks up  on military equipment, Brazil is hoping for a share of the sales.  </P> <P> But with the United States dominating the Saudi arms market, Brazilian  prospects there seem uncertain at best.  </P> <P> Engesa, a Brazilian company that builds armored vehicles, has been trying to  close a $2.2-billion deal to provide Saudi Arabia with 318 Osorio battle tanks.  To please the Saudis, Engesa even calls the tank the Al Fahd, as in King Fahd.  </P> <P> Engesa's main competition is General Dynamics of the United States. And a  $7.5-billion list of planned U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia, announced  Thursday by the White House, includes 150 General Dynamics Corp. tanks, the  M1-2A Abrams.  </P> <P> Production recently began on a Saudi order of 315 Abrams tanks approved last  year, and a new list of planned sales to be announced in January is expected to  include more of the tanks.  </P> <P> In the past, Israel has objected to proposals to sell such sophisticated  armaments as Abrams tanks to Arab countries, but the Persian Gulf crisis has  convinced the U.S. government of the need for more. That reduces the chances  for other countries to sell less sophisticated equipment to the Saudis, said  Shelley Stahl, a researcher at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for  International Peace.  </P> <P> "I would guess that a lot of Third World suppliers are going to be sort of  frustrated now that the United States is willing to sell (the Saudis) more  stuff because of the crisis," Stahl said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> Some Brazilian newspapers already have reported that Saudi Arabia has decided  not to buy any Engesa tanks. But Miguel Whitaker Pinto, an Engesa executive,  said the company still has hopes.  </P> <P> "We don't have any news, good or bad," he said. "We don't have any information  from the government of Saudi Arabia."  </P> <P> Engesa sold thousands of troop carriers and other armored vehicles to Iraq  during the Iraq-Iran War. Those sales stopped in 1987, Pinto said, because Iraq  stopped paying.  </P> <P> Iraq reportedly owes Engesa $80 million, one reason the company is in financial  trouble; another is the reported expenditure of $100 million to develop the  Osorio tank. Pinto said he could not confirm either figure.  </P> <P> He did confirm reports that Engesa owes its creditors about $200 million and,  under a legal agreement with them, must pay 40% by March to avoid bankruptcy.  </P> <P> Another major Brazilian arms builder is in similar trouble. Avibras, which  makes rockets and missiles, also owes about $200 million and must pay 40% --  $80 million -- in January.  </P> <P> Avibras recently sold Saudi Arabia a shipment of short-range, ground-to-ground  rockets. The rockets, made for truck-mounted Astros-2 multiple-rocket-launchers  previously sold to the Saudis by Avibras, were worth up to $70 million,  industry sources said.  </P> <P> The company is said to be hoping for more sales to Saudi Arabia worth several  times that amount. But the latest U.S. package for the Saudis also includes  rockets and launchers, an indication that Avibras faces competition.  </P> <P> Industry sources say Avibras' billing dropped from $350 million in 1987 to $10  million last year. As a result, the company has laid off all but 400 of its  6,000 employees.  </P> <P> The Brazilian military is buying few weapons, making things even harder for the  arms industry. Fernando Batista Costa, vice president of the Brazilian Assn. of  Defense Industries, said government austerity measures have cut military  budgets nearly 50% since March.  </P> <P> He said most of that comes out of equipment purchases because "you can't cut  out food for the troops." As a result, some weapons-supply contracts have been  canceled and new orders have nearly dried up.  </P> <P> "We are all at the doors of bankruptcy," said Costa, who operates a company  that supplies naval electronics equipment. "The whole industry is in  difficulty."  </P></p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Letter: Lamenting demise of Business Expansion Scheme Sir, I write to express sadness that the end of the Business Expansion Scheme is in sight. The fact that it has largely degenerated into a rich man's tax dodge on property obscures the fact that it is still available for its original purpose - supporting small wealth-creating businesses. I am currently involved in raising money on the BES for a small electronics company, Ragom Holdings, that already exports to Japan. For us, it is a welcome alternative to venture capital, which is largely a seller's market these days. Most venture capital companies are accountancy driven; they tend to consider medium and large management buy-outs to be low risk because they have a balance sheet. It seems not to matter that some of these companies have little or no intellectual property or management talent. By contrast, venture capitalists tend to frown on business start-ups even where world-beating key patents are involved and the board contains proven achievers. Small growth businesses often have difficulty in raising finance. They are usually asked to pay back much of the money in the first few years  -when they need to invest. Government grants and tax breaks are not available to the same degree as in some other European countries. Doubtless, it will suit some in the venture capital industry to see a potential competitor - the BES - eliminated just as it is emerging from its mad-cap phase and seeing some rational proposals for trading enterprises of potential benefit to our country. But does it suit the rest of us? P J Harrop, chairman, Racom Holdings, 37 Kingfisher Court, Hambridge Road, Newbury, Berks RG14 5SJ</p>

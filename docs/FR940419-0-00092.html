			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Limitation of Future Contracting, Alternate II (TAT) (May 1994)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The parties to this contract agree that the Contractor will be restricted in its future contracting in the manner described below. Except as specifically provided in this clause, the Contractor shall be free to compete for contracts on an equal basis with other companies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If the Contractor, under the terms of this contract, or through the performance of work pursuant to this contract, is required to develop specifications or statements of work and such specifications or statements of work are incorporated into an EPA solicitation, the Contractor shall be ineligible to perform the work described in that solicitation as a prime Contractor or subcontractor under an ensuing EPA contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Unless prior written approval is obtained from the cognizant EPA Contracting Officer, the Contractor, during the life of the technical direction document and for a period of five (5) years after the completion of the technical direction document, agrees not to enter into a contract with or to represent any party, other than EPA, with respect to: (1) Any work relating to CERCLA activities which pertain to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for EPA under this contract; or (2) any work that may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for the EPA under this contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) During the life of this contract, including any options, the Contractor agrees that unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) It will not provide to EPA cleanup services (e.g., Time Critical Rapid Response (TCRR) contracts) within the Contractor's Technical Assistance Team (TAT) assigned geographical area(s), either as a prime Contractor, subcontractor, or consultant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Unless an individual design for the site has been prepared by a third party, it will not provide to EPA as a prime contractor, subcontractor or consultant any remedial construction services at a site where it has performed or plans to perform TAT work. This clause will not preclude TAT contractors from performing construction management services under other EPA contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) It will be ineligible for award of TCRR type activities contracts for sites within its respective TAT assigned geographical area(s) which result from a CERCLA administrative order, a CERCLA or RCRA consent decree or a court order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The Contractor agrees in advance that if any bids/proposals are submitted for any work that would require written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into a contract subject to the restrictions of this clause, then the bids/proposals are submitted at the Contractor's own risk. Therefore, no claim shall be made against the Government to recover bid/proposal costs as a direct cost whether the request for authorization to enter into the contract is denied or approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) To the extent that the work under this contract requires access to proprietary or confidential business or financial data of other companies, and as long as such data remains proprietary or confidential, the Contractor shall protect such data from unauthorized use and disclosure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) The Contractor agrees to insert in each subcontract or consultant agreement placed hereunder, except for subcontracts or consultant agreements for nondiscretionary technical or engineering services, including treatability studies, well drilling, fence erecting, plumbing, utility hookups, security guard services, or electrical services, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph (g) unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor may request in writing that the Contracting Officer exempt from this clause a particular subcontract or consultant agreement for nondiscretionary technical or engineering services not specifically listed above, including laboratory analysis. The Contracting Officer will review and evaluate each request on a case-by-case basis before approving or disapproving the request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

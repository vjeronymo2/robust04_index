			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Arts (Openings): Chicago Even as rumours circulate that the Broadway version of 'Angels in America' won't last out the year, Tony Kushner's Pulitzer, Olivier and Tony Award-winning play enters another chapter as other productions open around the US. The national touring production of Angels' first half, 'Millenium Approaches', opened last night at Chicago's Royal George Theatre, with the second half, 'Perestroika' joining it in repertory from Thursday. Another production of Millenium recently opened at Atlanta's Alliance Theatre; San Francisco's American Conservatory Theatre opens its version of both halves on October 12, while Houston's Alley Theatre launches its Angels next spring.</p>

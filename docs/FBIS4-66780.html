			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, March 23--India today firmly told the  United States that there could be no discussion on the status of  Kashmir, while Washington promised to put pressure on Pakistan  to cease abetting cross-border terrorism and seek a solution to  the Kashmir issue within the framework of the Shimla accord,  report agencies.    The Union home minister, Mr S.B. Chavan, told the U.S.  assistant secretary of state, Ms Robin Raphel, that certain  statements emanating from Washington had "adversely affected the  situation in J and K [Jammu &amp; Kashmir]."    Ms Raphel, whose controversial pronouncements on Kashmir,  earlier, evoked strong criticism in India, said the "primary  objective of her visit was to clear up misunderstandings which  have been created and (she) shared the goal of improving  Indo-U.S. relations."    The home minister also told her that J and K is an integral  part of India and that the people would not "tolerate attempts  to undermine the nation's territorial integrity."    An external affairs ministry spokesman said Ms Raphel  expressed her government's appreciation for India's transparency  and its permission to international human rights organisations  and diplomats to visit J and K.    Ms Raphel, who had questioned Kashmir's accession to India,  emphasised that "Indo-Pak disagreements over J and K should be  solved within the framework of the Shimla agreement."    Besides meeting Mr Chavan, Ms Raphel held discussions with  her counterpart in the foreign office, Mr H.S. Puri, the home  secretary, Mr N.N. Vohra, and some members of the National Human  Rights Commission (NHRC).    Mr Chavan underscored India's renewed offer to Pakistan to  schedule another round of talks at foreign secretary and other  levels to underline its objectives of seeking improvement in all  aspects of Indo-Pak relations, the spokesman said.    During her 90-minute meeting with Mr Puri, strains in  Indo-U.S. relations over contentious issues such as Kashmir,  human rights and nuclear non-proliferation came up for a close  scrutiny.    "We had a very useful exchange of views as we always do," Ms  Raphel said as she left South Block for the home ministry for a  detailed briefing on the situation in Kashmir.    She parried a question whether there had been any narrowing  down of differences between the two sides on these issues.    Official sources said both sides touched upon the whole  gamut  of the Indo-U.S. relations during the meeting.    Her talks here in the foreign office are preparatory to the  scheduled visit here of the U.S. deputy secretary of state, Mr  Strobe Talbott, from April 6 to 8.    American officials said that Mr Talbott would lay special  emphasis on winning support in India and Pakistan for the U.S.  drive to limit the spread of nuclear and chemical weapons.    Mr Talbott will also press New Delhi and Islamabad to enter  into negotiations aimed at resolving the Kashmir issue.    During a 30-minute meeting with officials of the NHRC, Ms  Raphel observed that much importance was attached to the work of  the commission.    She presented a copy of the `Country reports on human rights  for the year 1993' prepared by the U.S. State Department.    Ms Raphel will call on the minister of state for external  affairs, Mr R.L. Bhatia, and the foreign secretary, Mr K.  Srinivasan, tomorrow.    Ms Raphel met the NHRC member, Mr Virendra Dayal and the  commission secretary-general, Mr R.V. Pillai, for a first-hand  knowledge about the functioning of the commission.    Mr Dayal informed her of the main areas of the commission's  work. She was also briefed about the various programmes of  visits which the commission had undertaken to various states and  the contacts made with like-minded commissions established by  other countries.</p>

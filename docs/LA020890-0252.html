			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> SIEBEN RETURNS TO SWIMMING  </P> <P> Swimmer Jon Sieben of Australia, who broke the Olympic and world records for  the 200-meter butterfly at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, announced his  return to the sport less than 12 months after retiring.  </P> <P> Sieben, 22, said his aim was to win the gold medal in the 200-meter butterfly  at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.  </P> <P> Sieben upset favorite Michael Gross of West Germany in setting world and  Olympic records and winning the gold medal in 1984. Gross has since broken  Sieben's record.  </P> <P> "While my world record was broken by Gross in 1986, I firmly believe that I  will have both the physical fitness and mental determination to win it back in  1992," said Sieben, who is studying for a law degree. Sieben said his first  major goal will be to make the Australian team for the 1991 world championships  in Perth, Australia.  </P></p>

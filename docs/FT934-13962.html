			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Macmillan venture charge hits McGraw-Hill profits MCGRAW-HILL, the US publisher and broadcaster, has blamed a extraordinary charge for a third-quarter net loss of Dollars 91.9m, against profits of Dollars 59.3m last time, agencies report from New York. Without the Dollars 160.8m charge, related to the acquisition of partner Macmillan's share of a joint venture, there would have been net profits of Dollars 68.93m, a rise of 16.2 per cent. The company said its Standard &amp; Poor's ratings group, other financial services businesses, international book publishing, and the Macmillan/ McGraw-Hill School Publishing joint venture all performed well in the quarter. The company is buying the half interest in the joint venture owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Sales at the group were up slightly to Dollars 554.9m, compared with Dollars 534m for the same period last year. McGraw-Hill said revenue in its financial services division rose 13.6 per cent, while operating profit was up 18.4 per cent. Information and Publication Services revenue fell 5.1 per cent due to softness in the construction and advertising-based markets, the company said. However, cost-controls and improved results at some of its publications helped produce a 14.6 per cent increase in operating profits in the division. The company said its share of the Macmillan/McGraw-Hill joint venture school publishing company profits rose 10.2 per cent in the quarter. It said it would recognise for the first time all the costs associated with the venture, which normally shows a loss in the fourth quarter.</p>

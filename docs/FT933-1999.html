			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Finmeccanica units to float in US FINMECCANICA, the principal industrial arm of IRI, the Italian state holding company, has decided to float 40 per cent of two of its leading engineering subsidiaries in the New York stock market. The flotations of Elsag Bailey Process Automation and Union Switch and Signal, which await Security and Exchange Commission approval, are due to be completed by the end of the year. s Elsag Bailey Process Automation is a recently created Dutch company that encompasses the international automation process equipment and numerical control activities of Genoa-based Elsag Bailey. These international activities generate an annual turnover of Dollars 600m, equivalent to some 60 percent of the total. Elsa Bailey, the parent, is already quoted in Italy with some 20 per cent in third party hands. Finmeccanica has been concentrating on this group as one of the main sectors generating future earnings, and needs the funds from flotation to finance costly restructuring elsewhere - especially in the defence and aerospace sector. The same considerations lie behind the quotation of 40 percent of Union Switch and Signal, a US-based company controlled by Finmeccanica's engineering and rolling stock group headed by Ansaldo.</p>

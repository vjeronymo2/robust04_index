Samdech Chea Sim and his delegation then left Vientiane by  special plane for Bangkok to pay an official friendship visit to  the Kingdom of Thailand.    On 6 March, Samdech Chea Sim visited many production  establishments; the construction site of the Mekong Friendship  Bridge; and Vientiane Province, where he was welcomed by His  Excellency [H.E.] Governor Mounkeo Olaboun and his staff.  During its visit to Vientiane Province, the delegation also  toured the Nam Ngum Dam hydropower plant.    In the evening, Samdech Chea Sim granted an audience at the  guest house to representatives of the Laos-Cambodia Friendship  Association led by Chairman Son Khamvanvongsa. During their  conversation, the two discussed ways to consolidate and  strengthen the friendly relations between Laos and Cambodia,  both now and in the future.

Khambou Sounisai, chairman and vice  chairman of the LPDR National Assembly, and several high-level  cadres from various relevant services.

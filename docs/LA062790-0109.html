			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE 'ORG BOARD';  </P> <P> HUBBARD'S PLAN FOR IMPROVING ON '80 TRILLION YEARS' OF MANAGEMENT  </P> <P> A key element of the management techniques Scientologists sell to businessmen  is L. Ron Hubbard's "organizational board."  </P> <P> Used also by the Church of Scientology, the "Org Board" divides an organization  into seven divisions -- executive, personnel, sales, finance, training,  marketing and qualifications.  </P> <P> Each division's duties are spelled out, along with the basis for evaluating  employee performance.  </P> <P> In describing the Org Board's virtues, Scientology consultants omit Hubbard's  colorful account of its origins -- an account reminiscent of one of his science  fiction tales.  </P> <P> During a 1965 lecture to Scientologists in England, Hubbard said his board is a  refined version of one that was used for "80 trillion years" by an "old  galactic civilization."  </P> <P> Hubbard said the civilization died (he did not say when) because its  organizational board lacked one division that he incorporated into his  modern-day version.  </P> <P> Declared Hubbard: "We don't want these temporary fly-by-night affairs!"  </P></p>

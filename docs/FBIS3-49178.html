			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Conditions for partially funding the building of the  Mochovce nuclear power station by German capital should be  specified this month.    This was stated yesterday [4 January] by Sergey Kozlik,  deputy Slovak prime minister for the economy, following his  talks with the German Ambassador in Slovakia Heike Zenker.    It is being considered that the overall sum of foreign  credits for Mochovce should represent 1.5 billion German marks.  This financial help is truly inevitable for Mochovce because,  according to our information from this part of Slovakia, if the  minimum funds for suppliers' survival are not safeguarded, they  will have to suspend all work this month and leave the building  site. This stems from the joint statement of two general  suppliers of the Mochovce nuclear power station, Hydrostav  Bratislava and Skoda Praha, addressed to the Slovak Government  at the end of last year.    In this connection, Stanislav Katrinec interviewed Peter  Cuntala, deputy head of the Mochovce nuclear power station, and  Mojmir Seliga, head of the department for international  cooperation.    [Begin recording] [Katrinec] Mr. Cuntala, does the Slovak  Power Enterprise, as an investor, possess the minimum funds for  both the main suppliers, or are they indeed leaving?    [Cuntala] For the time being, we do not possess them.  According to the statement of Director Gejdos, head of Hydrostav  in Mochovce, the decision about whether they will remain at the  building site will be made after 10 January 1994.    [Katrinec] Mr. Seliga, you have about a week to do something  in order to get this money. What are you going to do?    [Seliga] At the beginning I should like to say that the  business intention for Mochovce for 1994 has been prepared, but  it has not been discussed yet. This is what is important for us.  This means that, for the time being, we have no money. To get  it, we must undergo important talks at the level of the Slovak  Ministry of the Economy and the government.    These talks were preceded by important talks at the Ministry  of the Economy before Christmas, which were attended by Mr.  Fauve, the head of foreign investments of Electricite de France,  where the actual speeding up of the entire process was agreed  upon. At the same time, however, I must say that, out of the  original three members of the investors' consortium, only one  remained--namely, Electricite de France.    [Katrinec] This changes the situation. However, it does not  change the basic condition of all of the potential foreign  investors, which is privatization. At what stage is it at the  Mochovce nuclear power station?    [Seliga] The privatization project has been returned by the  government bodies, and one has to wait for its signing so that  we might implement the subsequent privatization steps at  Mochovce. I should also like to say that Electricite de France  remains the only partner to coordinate trade management in  Mochovce. Its employees are now moving to the houses of [name  indistinct] village.    [Katrinec] Is one to understand that Electricite de France  is  serious about the investments in Mochovce?    [Seliga] Yes, it may be understood that way because, in mid  January, the director general of Electricite de France is coming  for crucial talks with the Slovak Government, and our  supervisory board has been preparing for them.

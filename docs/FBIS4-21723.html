			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 26 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- A bomb planted by  unidentified individuals exploded in the car of Luis Garcia,  mayor of the northern city of San Pedro Sula, but there were no  casualties, the Honduran police reported today, 26 March.    According to reports, the explosive device was planted in  the  car driven by the mayor's son, Alexander Garcia, while it was  parked outside the ``Casino Sampedrano,'' a nightclub located in  the city's southeastern area. Garcia was with local politicians  and businessmen.    The police said the bomb exploded at 2255 (0455 GMT), and  the  individuals responsible left a note that read: ``So the rich  can also suffer,'' attributed to the Human Rights Defense  Committee (Codeh].    Mayor Garcia said ``there was no mishap.'' The blast damaged  his car, but nobody was injured, although there were children  nearby washing cars.    He said the individuals responsible for the attack are  trying  to mislead the police by attributing the explosion to Codeh,  because it is absurd to think an organization which defends  human rights is involved in acts of terrorism.    Garcia denied the attack had been aimed at him, and he  expressed regretted that on the threshold of the 21st century  certain groups believe in social violence.    Colonel Jose Martinez, commander of the 105th Infantry  Brigade stationed in San Pedro Sula, said several individuals  who may have been involved in the attack were arrested.    Garcia governs Honduras' second largest city located 242 km  north of the country. [sentence as received] He took office  last January following the Liberal Party's victory in the  general elections of November 1983.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi this  afternoon opened the third session of the Seventh Parliament  with a renewed call on parliamentarians to conduct themselves  honorably both inside and outside Parliament. The president  told parliamentarians to use parliamentary time to promote the  welfare of their constituents, adding that this could only be  done in an atmosphere of tolerance and appreciation of each  other's point of view without resorting to violence. Stressing  that true democracy can only thrive in an environment of give  and take, President Moi urged the members to support each other  for the prosperity of this nation.    The president said he expected Kenya African National Union  MPs to support motions sponsored by the opposition if they are  geared towards the common good of Kenyans. He likewise told the  opposition to support government-sponsored motions rather than  oppose them for the sake of opposing.    President Moi cited the current famine that has hit most  parts of the country as one of the issues that called for a  united approach by both the government and the opposition to  tackle. He said because of the prolonged drought and harsh  economic conditions that have made it difficult for most farmers  to purchase required farm inputs, about 5 million Kenyans need  food assistance. Noting that a hungry Kenyan cares little about  political affiliations, President Moi expressed gratitude to  those parliamentarians who had worked with the government to  reach out to famine-stricken Kenyans. The president at the same  time thanked Kenyans and friendly nations who have responded  positively to his appeal for food assistance.    President Moi further pointed out that many Kenyans were  faced with economic hardship resulting from the current  implementation of the structural adjustment program. He,  however, assured Kenyans that the government had developed a  safety program to alleviate their suffering. The president told  Kenyans that they were free to offer their suggestions aimed at  improving their socio-economic status. [passage omitted]    Earlier, President Moi asked the MP's to stand up and  observe  a minute's silence in memory of the late Oginga Odinga and Dr.  Josephat Karanja. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NUCLEAR DUMP REMAINS HOT TAX ISSUE FOR NEVADA  </P> <P> Bullfrog County, population 0, was born at 3 a.m. on the last day of the 1987  Nevada Legislature and died last year in court.  </P> <P> The legislators' invention, a new locality levying the state's highest taxes on  the proposed site of the nation's first high-level nuclear waste dump, proved  unconstitutional. But the idea of making the federal government pay for  choosing Nevada lives on.  </P> <P> "I don't know of any current proposal out there but I think that if we have to  take the dump we should be compensated for it," Assembly Taxation Committee  Chairman Bob Price said as the 1989 session opened Jan. 16.  </P> <P> Some believe that Nevada could begin collecting tax-like fees from the federal  government as it tests the proposed site, whether the underground repository is  built there or not, Senate Taxation Committee Chairman Charlie Joerg said. "I  think we'd be foolish not to look into the possibility of collecting money from  the government. We should get some benefit from this."  </P> <P> </P> <P> '87 Resolution Resurfaces  </P> <P> A resolution from the 1987 Legislature resurfaced in the Senate on opening day  this year. It would establish a special tax district around the site to let the  state collect $5 per $100 of assessed valuation, as if the repository were a  private project. The rate is the maximum allowed by the Nevada Constitution and  about three times the local levy around the proposed tax district.  </P> <P> Backers of the assessment plan want money in lieu of taxes to offset the impact  on local governments, which would have to provide housing, education, law  enforcement and other services for people working at the $2-billion dump.  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Joe Dini said lawmakers should move cautiously to avoid  sending a signal to Washington that Nevadans are willing to accept the nation's  nuclear garbage. "We've had advice that if we try to get money out of the  federal government it will weaken our position to fight the dump."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It Implies Consent'  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Myrna Williams introduced a resolution with 35 co-sponsors urging  Congress to halt the dump. Williams blasted a measure introduced in the state  Senate to negotiate with the government, saying, "It implies consent."  </P> <P> In 1987, Congress passed legislation directing the Department of Energy to  concentrate on Yucca Mountain as a place to bury spent fuel from nuclear power  plants. The site 110 miles northwest of Las Vegas could be licensed in 1995.  </P> <P> The Legislature responded by carving 144 square miles out of Nye County as a  way to let the state collect the maximum property tax rate. That could have  cost the federal government an estimated $8 million to $25 million a year.  </P> <P> Bullfrog County -- inhabited by rattlesnakes, coyotes, lynx, kangaroo rats and  lizards, but no humans -- was named after a Nye County mining district that  failed in a bid to become a separate county nearly 80 years ago. It was given a  three-member commission and a county seat 250 miles away in Carson City.  </P> <P> Nye County sued the state, challenging Bullfrog's creation on 37 different  legal grounds in a 92-page brief. Its major claim was that because Bullfrog had  no residents it had no representative government and was unconstitutional. It  also contended that it was entitled to any money collected.  </P> <P> "Nye County should be compensated more. We have to recognize mitigating factors  because they would be closest to the dump," said Joerg.  </P> <P> Retired Nevada Supreme Court Justice David Zenoff ruled Feb. 11, 1988, after 30  minutes of oral arguments, that Bullfrog County was unconstitutional. He said  it stretched its legal limits "every which way," and left too many  constitutional issues "hanging in the air."  </P></p>

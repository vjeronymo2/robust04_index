			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 3 Jun (XINHUA) -- Today, State Council  Premier Li Peng presided over the State Council's 20th Executive  Meeting, which discussed and approved in principle the "PRC Law  on the People's Bank of China [PBOC] (Draft)" and the "PRC  Auditing Law (Draft)."    The meeting believed that the "PRC Law on the PBOC (Draft)"  was formulated to define the PBOC's status and functions, ensure  the scientific and authoritative formulation and implementation  of monetary policies, strengthen the banking sector's  supervision and management, and establish and improve the  central bank's macroeconomic regulation and control system. The  draft law contains eight chapters that include 46 articles  covering such areas as the character and status of the PBOC, its  organization, Renminbi, business operations, supervision and  management of the banking sector, and business accounting.    The meeting believed it is very necessary to formulate the  "PRC Auditing Law (Draft)" to improve the auditing and  supervision of state revenues and expenditures and of the  financial revenues and expenditures related to state-owned  assets, increase economic returns, maintain China's financial  and economic order, and guarantee healthy national economic  development. The draft law contains seven chapters that include  47 articles covering such areas as the principles of China's  auditing and supervision system, auditing organs and their  personnel, auditing organs' duties and functions, limits of  their authority, auditing procedures, and legal liabilities.    After further revisions, the State Council will submit the  two draft laws approved in principle by the meeting to the  National People's Congress Standing Committee for deliberation.</p>

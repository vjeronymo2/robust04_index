			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Figures signal better economic outlook A JUMP in US housing starts and better than expected inflation figures were yesterday seen as further evidence that the US economic outlook is gradually improving, writes Michael Prowse. The Commerce Department said housing starts rose 5.5 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.17m. The increase was about twice as large as expected in financial markets and probably reflected the impact of recent cuts in interest rates. Starts last month were running about 38 per cent higher than in January last year when building activity was subdued by the Gulf war. However, last month's better housing figure reflected a possibly erratic surge in building activity in the mid-west, where starts rose by about a third. Starts declined slightly in other regions, including the north-east and the west. The increase in starts was also concentrated in apartment buildings, a volatile sector. Starts for single family homes rose by less than 1 per cent. Figures from the Labour Department showed that consumer prices rose only 0.1 per cent last month, less than expected by analysts. The annual rate of consumer price inflation fell to 2.6 per cent in January, having declined steadily through last year. The low increase in prices reflected falls in the indices for both food and energy. Excluding these elements, the 'core' consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent last month and by 3.9 per cent in the year to January.</p>

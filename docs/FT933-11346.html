			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Reformers step up attack over rouble REFORMERS in the Russian government and their foreign advisers yesterday continued a fierce attack on the decision of the central bank to withdraw from circulation all pre-1993 banknotes. They demanded that the decision be annulled, warning of dire consequences to the international aid package pledged to Russia if not. Professor Anders Aslund, an adviser to the Russian government, forecast increased inflation, a weakening of the rouble, and continued destruction of links between the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Evidence of pressure on the CIS emerged yesterday when a large aluminium smelter in Saratov, Russia, warned that it would have to close because raw materials from Kazakhstan had been cut off as a result of the Russian bank's decision to withdraw the notes. Prof Aslund warned that 'there will be a flight from the rouble' and said the present rise of the rouble against the dollar was a 'temporary phenomenon because of the artificially induced shortage of notes'. Mr Andrei Illiaronov, economic adviser to Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, said the issue had not been tabled at the cabinet meeting yesterday - but would come up at a special cabinet meeting at the end of next week called to discuss 'a whole range of the most important economic questions'. The latest trends in the Russian economy presented yesterday by the government's Centre for Economic Reform show that inflation is rising again, from a level of around 17 per cent in May to around 20 per cent last month. Industrial production is shown as remaining stable, having recovered to the level of July 1992. Privatisation continues to rush ahead, with a record Rbs380bn in revenue from privatised companies in May. Separate figures from the state privatisation committee claim that one-third of all enterprises in Russia - most of which are small - have been privatised. There was 'massive' tax evasion last year, amounting to a sum equivalent to Dollars 8bn-Dollars 10bn, according to Mr Vladimir Gusev, head of Russia's tax collection service. Mr Gusev said yesterday that some 15 per cent of all taxes were not paid for 1992. He said the growth of corporate debt estimated at Rbs6,500bn had delayed payment of taxes. Many companies tried to avoid taxes by dealing in cash and failing to keep accounts. Mr Gusev said that the International Monetary Fund and private German companies were assisting in establishing a computer system for tax collection - while cash registers are to be made mandatory for all sales point.</p>

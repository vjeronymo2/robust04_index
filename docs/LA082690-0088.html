			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAR HITS TRUCK, JUMPS CURB; 1 KILLED, 5 HURT  </P> <P> One transient was killed and five others injured outside a downtown Los Angeles  homeless mission Saturday when they were struck by a hit-and-run driver whose  car collided with a tomato truck and then careened onto the sidewalk,  authorities said.  </P> <P> The accident occurred at about 8:30 a.m. while the transients were either  sleeping or sitting outside the Fred Jordan Mission at 445 Towne Ave., said  Sgt. Jeff Siggers of the Los Angeles Police Department's Central Traffic  Division.  </P> <P> Siggers said the male driver of a white 1975 Chevrolet Monte Carlo tried to  squeeze past the big-rig truck, which was making a right turn from Towne Avenue  to 5th Street.  </P> <P> The car bounced off the truck and jumped the curb, striking the transients as  they sat on the 5th Street side of the Skid Row shelter, Siggers said.  </P> <P> Steven Myers, a shelter worker, said he saw the collision, and ran to the  corner just after the car struck the transients.  </P> <P> "They didn't have time to do nothing," Myers said. "They were just screaming,  just screaming. They were just laying there, in shock."  </P> <P> By the time he reached the car, Myers said, the driver had fled, along with an  unknown number of passengers. Police recovered the car at the scene, and said  there were as many as four people in the car.  </P> <P> Sgt. Tom Hatter of Central Traffic Division said detectives are investigating  the case to determine who was at fault. He said the car's driver faces possible  manslaughter and felony hit-and-run charges.  </P> <P> The names of the three male and two female victims were not released. One man  was pronounced dead at County-USC Medical Center at about noon, Siggers said.  </P> <P> Two of the other victims were seriously injured, one with a crushed pelvis and  the other with a broken leg.  </P></p>

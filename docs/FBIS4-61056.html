			<p>BFN     [(Text] An advisor of the Russian prime-minister Mikhail  Tarasov has told INTERFAX that this year Viktor Chernomyrdin is  to intensively travel abroad. Still visits to Russian regions  and republics to see the situation and problems remain his  priority.    Tarasov said that in mid-May the head of the cabinet is  expected to make a one-day visit to Warsaw to resolve old  problems blocking bilateral economic cooperation, in particular  mutual settlements and the foreign debt of the former Soviet  Union.    A visit to China is planned for the end of May. There  Chernomyrdin should sign an impressive package of agreements,  including documents on the demarcation of the border, shipping  on the Amur river and in international waters, cooperation in  agriculture and related industries as well as in environmental  protection.    In June the prime-minister is expected to take part in the  third session of the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission in the USA.  In the framework of the commission six mixed committees have  planned joint energy, space and nuclear power engineering  projects.    In the second half of July, according to Tarasov, the  Russian  head of government is expected to tour Saudi Arabia, the United  Arab Emirates and Kuwait. There attention will be centered  around military-technical cooperation, the attraction of foreign  investments and cooperation in fuel and power engineering.    The Russian Prime-Minister has been invited to visit the  Czech republic and Slovakia as well as Bulgaria and Rumania.    At the end of the year he is expected to go to London.    During the next few months in Moscow Chernomyrdin is to hold  talks with his counterparts from Austria, Vietnam, Mongolia,  Denmark and other foreign countries.</p>

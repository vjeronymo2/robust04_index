			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [by Gao Xinghua and Li Guoli] </F>   [Text] Hangzhou, December 16 (XINHUA)--By 2020, China  should have a nuclear generating capacity of 20 million  kilowatts, furnishing about five percent of the country's annual  electric power output.    According to a senior official at the China National Nuclear  Corporation (CNNC), nuclear power now accounts for only 0.5  percent of the country's output.    The 300,000 kilowatt Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang  province is celebrating the second anniversary of its trial  operation. The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong, with  two 900,000 kilowatt generating units, is to start commercial  production next year.    ``That means China's nuclear power generating capacity will  be 2.1 million kilowatts,'' said CNNC Deputy General Manager  Zhao Hong.    Work has begun on the second phase of construction at the  Qinshan facility, which involves four 600,000 kilowatt  generating units powered by nuclear reactors, Zhao told XINHUA.    CNNC also plans to continue construction at the Daya Bay  plant, which will install two more generating units, each with a  capacity of 900,000 kilowatts or greater, he said.    Coastal provinces such as Jiangsu, Liaoning, Hainan and  Shandong are ``interested in nuclear power plants,'' and are  making pre- construction preparations or conducting commercial  negotiations.    Nevertheless, Zhao said, the development of nuclear power in  China has to be ``appropriate'' in scope and speed because  nuclear reactors are expensive.    To cope with this problem, he said, CNNC welcomes foreign  investment to supplement domestic funds from the central and  local governments and Chinese bank loans.</p>

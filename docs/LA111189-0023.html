			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH-GORBACHEV SUMMIT IN MALTA  </P> <P> The Bush-Gorbachev meeting presents President Bush an ideal opportunity to  reaffirm America's non-recognition policy concerning the Soviet occupation of  the Baltic states. It is also a chance for America to pursue the corollary of  the non-recognition policy, namely, that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania must  have their independence restored.  </P> <P> The December conference should be used by President Bush to pursue a diplomatic  solution to the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states, patterned on the  Austrian experience, whereby Soviet troops are withdrawn and all of the Baltic  states resume their status as neutral, independent nations.  </P> <P> On Aug. 23, 2 million Balts formed a human chain stretching from Vilnius,  Lithuania, through Riga, Latvia, to Tallinn, Estonia, in order to demonstrate  their desire for independence and their determination to achieve the  fundamental rights which America's Declaration of Independence and Bill of  Rights stand for. It behooves America and President Bush to support their  aspirations.  </P> <P> JAAK TREIMAN, Canoga Park  </P></p>

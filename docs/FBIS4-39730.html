			<p>BFN     [Text] The President of Azerbaijan Geydar Aliyev left for a  brief working visit to Turkey today at the invitation of Turkish  President Suleyman Demirel. The Azerbaijani president gave an  interview to our program before staring his visit.    [Begin recording] [Aliyev] To answer your questions simply,  I  can say that the real purpose of this visit is clear. Turkey  and Azerbaijan are very close to each other, they are friendly  countries. We have a friendship and cooperation agreement with  Turkey, and we are in constant touch. Many agreements were  signed during my official visit to Turkey in February. Both we  and Turkey are working to implement these agreements. On my  return to Baku from Belgium, I stopped over in Ankara for a few  hours and held talks, conversations, and consultations.    Our friendship and fraternal ties with Turkey are developing  under conditions that require meetings, talks, and consultations  from time to time. That is why Turkish President Suleyman  Demirel invited me to Turkey. He requested that I visit him in  Istanbul to examine various issues necessary for the continued  cooperation between us. I accepted this invitation with  pleasure because both Turkey and Azerbaijan need such a meeting  at present. Therefore, I am now going to Istanbul to visit the  Turkish president, my esteemed friend and brother Suleyman  Demirel. I will meet him there and hold talks, and then we will  do some other work as well. Such meetings take place not only  in capital cities but in various cities and foreign countries.    As for the oil issue, the talks between the Western  companies  and the Azerbaijani state oil company have resumed. These talks  are being held in Istanbul at the desired level. There is no  need for me to go into this matter at this moment, because I  already met with and held detailed talks with the delegation of  the Azerbaijani State Oil Company before its departure for  Istanbul, during which Azerbaijan's principal positions on this  issue were established. The delegation is holding talks on the  basis of those positions.    Regarding the NATO meeting, our Foreign Minister Gasan  Gasanov has been invited there. Only foreign ministers are  taking part in that meeting. Gasan Gasanov will represent  Azerbaijan at that meeting, and will convey our view to it.    [Correspondent Seyyat Agababali] Mr. President, I want to  ask  a final question. You will receive Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev Saturday [11 June] morning. In the meantime, the  Russian press has been disseminating certain views on Azerbaijan  for the last two days. Also, in his statement today, Pavel  Grachev said that if the Russian-sponsored plan is not signed  during his meeting with you they will walk away from this issue.    [Aliyev] As you know, Pavel Grachev will arrive in Baku on  11  June. His statements are his own personal affair. However, the  actual aim of his visit to Azerbaijan -- and we have held talks  on this issue, I also held a telephone conversation with Russian  President Boris Yeltsin -- is linked to the huge air-defense  object in Azerbaijan--in Russian they call it radiolocatsyone  stantsia. This is an extremely important facility, which was  built by the Soviet Union to defend against strategic missiles.  This is now enormously important for Russia, and it is in  operation.    However, its status in Azerbaijan has not yet been  clarified.  That is because it is located on Azerbaijani territory, which  means that it belongs to Azerbaijan; it is Azerbaijan's  property. At the same time, Russia is using it. Despite the  fact that the Soviet Union collapsed two and half years ago,  regrettably this matter has not yet been resolved. Although  Russia benefits from it, Azerbaijan's rights to it have not yet  been established. Therefore, I have raised this problem to the  Russian leadership, both to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. Grachev is coming here to  discuss this matter. Undoubtedly, once he is here, many other  problems will also be discussed, but one cannot comment on them  beforehand. [end recording]    The Azerbaijani president was seen off at Bina airport by  Prime Minister Suret Guseynov, Deputy Chairman of the Supreme  Soviet Afiaddin Dzhalilov, deputy prime ministers, ministers,  company presidents, and other officials.</p>

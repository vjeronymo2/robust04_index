			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Institute chief tells accountants to be more open Accountancy firms should provide greater details of their own financial strength, the new president of the UK's largest chartered accountancy body said yesterday. Speaking shortly after his inauguration as president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, Mr Roger Lawson told the Financial Times that the firms should be more open. 'It is entirely appropriate that there should be greater transparency for buyers of services so they can be satisfied of the financial strength or otherwise of the people with whom they are doing business,' he said. 'People really should be in a position to have greater confidence in the direction (of the firms) and not that they are just trading on brand names,' he said, in a reference to the powerful image of the largest accountancy firms. His plea comes at a time when KPMG Peat Marwick, the UK's second largest firm, is considering moves towards incorporation. Mr Lawson argued that there may ultimately be a move towards an independent review of the finances or at least the insurance assets claimed by firms in the light of a growing number of lawsuits against them. 'It might be better if a mechanism could be found for a third party in whom everyone had confidence to examine the figures,' he said, adding that there would need to be safeguards to ensure that competitor information was not passed between the firms. Mr Lawson's remarks partly reflect his experience as an accountant in business, unlike most of his predecessors, who were in public practice. He works for 3i, the venture capital company. The accountancy firms - as partnerships rather than companies - are currently under no obligation to reveal details of their financial performance or strength. They are highly secretive organisations. While often urging greater disclosure from their corporate clients they have always resisted providing such information themselves. Senior partners of the firms have rejected such arguments, claiming that people would not understand the figures for profits allocated to each partner, which include pension costs and dividends as well as salary. Mr Andrew Colquhoun, secretary and chief executive of the institute, said that greater disclosure was the responsibility of the firms and that the institute would only intervene if such a change was proved to be in 'the public interest'.</p>

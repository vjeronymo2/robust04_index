			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Apple-pie curriculum I do not know what you expect of our schools, but I want children to be stretched. They should be taught mathematics. They must know when calculators go awry. In Britain they should become proficient in the native English tongue, which is still a useful dialect of standard American. They should be in touch with western culture, which implies an acquaintance with at least the Bible, Shakespeare and the best of modern literature. A little science, a smidgen of history and a dip into French, German or another European language would all help. It may be too much to hope for, but it is desirable that they also absorb a set of values, a sense of the difference between right and wrong. Ten years ago such a menu of aspirations would have been regarded as eccentric, the product of an incorrigible elitist. Some would have labelled it reactionary, or neo-fascist. Today it is becoming standard pedagogic fare. Only the promotion of religious education and basic values is still seriously disputed. This historic turnabout is the product of a decade of debate that followed a challenging speech by the last Labour prime minister, Mr James Callaghan, in 1976. At that time the avowed purpose of 'child-centred' classroom teaching was to facilitate self-awareness. Today it is to impart knowledge, or to transfer skills. The development of the self may follow. This revolution in what happens in the classroom was made possible by Mr Kenneth Baker's education act of 1988, but the process is incomplete. The new machinery will not settle down until nearly the end of the century. In consequence we are in the midst of a decade of turmoil in education. There is no escape. The alternative was to continue with a system of state schooling that betrayed the children it ought to have served. All political parties are now agreed that that was not acceptable. The pace of change is quickening. Mr Baker was a poor administrator, so the implementation of his act was left to a department that did not believe in telling teachers what to do. Early versions of the national curriculum were unworkable. His successor, Mr John MacGregor, started to tackle this but had little time in the office. It was the next minister, Mr Kenneth Clarke, who packed the statutory advisory bodies invented by Mr Baker with people who believed in the changes the government wanted, rather than good folk the civil servants knew. I recite this history in order to put the recent headlines scored by the new education secretary, Mr John Patten, in their proper place. Fate has indeed smiled on Mr Patten. He may succeed, but it will be at least partly because his predecessors handed him success on a plate. He finally made it to the cabinet on April 10, well-placed to take forward a programme arrived at after 10 years of debate and four years of hesitant starts. He found his new department at a new address, to which Mr Clarke had moved it over Christmas. It was the ideal occasion for a politician's coup. The old-think networks of officials have been swept away. What was called the department of education and science is now the department for education. A white paper - a new mission statement - was published in July. A new high-flying permanent secretary will arrive next January. Previous education ministers were frustrated by the department. Now, Mr Patten believes, the revolution has conquered the apparatchiks themselves. This increases the chances that he will be the author of a huge administrative blunder. His populist plan for most schools to opt out of local authority control has little to do with education. It is pure Tory ideology. Yet enhanced political control over his department also makes it almost too easy to pick up applause for pursuing his job with rigour. He will review the standards of the examining boards. He will send the science curriculum back to be tightened up. He can even be quite daring. Before the April election a plan for all 14-year-olds to display some knowledge of three specified Shakespeare plays, plus a good grasp of grammar and spelling, would have been loudly assailed as narrow and restrictive. This week just such a proposal was put forward. There have been mere squeaks of protest. He is also able to make a bow to moralist Conservatives, the equivalent of 'family values' Republicans in the US. At lunch in Cambridge on Monday Mr Patten asked Sir Hermann Bondi, the president of the British Humanist Association, for advice on teaching values. Sir Hermann, who has founded a group for that purpose, opened the discussion to other guests, including the Catholic Bishop of Leeds. Their apple-pie notions may find their way into the curriculum before long. They seem harmless: do as you would be done by; respect the person and so on. I do not scent incipient authoritarianism here, not yet. But I have to report that Mr Patten has taken to referring to himself, we must hope in jest, as 'the nation's headmaster'.</p>

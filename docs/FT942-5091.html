			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Driving those yellow dog blues out of the Old South: George Graham finds the US Republican party trying to advance on what used to be unpromising ground in the state of Mississippi You have to be at least 74 years old, and white, to have taken part in a congressional election in Mississippi's first district when Congressman Jamie Whitten was not running. The veteran Democrat has represented the district, which stretches across the north of the US state, since 1941, rarely facing any challenge and, even when there was opposition, only once gaining less than 60 per cent of the vote. Mr Whitten's retirement from the House of Representatives, at the age of 84, has brought six Republican and three Democratic candidates to fight primary elections today. They are seeking the right to contest, in November, a seat where the Republican party has high hopes of extending its resurgence in what used to be the solidly Democratic South. Identification of the Republicans with President Abraham Lincoln and the Reconstruction period after the Civil War of the 1860s is no longer a drawback, and the South's social conservatism aligns closely with the Republican party platform. 'It has historically been a yellow dog Democrat area - they'd rather vote for a yellow dog than for a Republican. With Whitten out of the race, I think we've got a better shot,' says Mr Billy Powell, the Republican party's Mississippi state chairman. 'Given how the district is changing, it clearly fits the profile of a Republican congressional district,' says Professor Leslie Burl McLemore, a political scientist at Jackson State University in the state capital. Mr Whitten's birthplace is in the hamlet of Cascilla - two groceries and a petrol pump besieged by kudzu vine on the edge of the Delta, the flatlands between the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers. His district once included a part of the Delta, but reapportionment moved this mainly black area into another constituency. Today, the district's centre is Tupelo, a burgeoning business centre known for its furniture making and as the birthplace of Elvis Presley. It encompasses the university town of Oxford and rapidly growing De Soto County, a dormitory suburb for Memphis, just across the border in Tennessee. Mr Whitten, too, has changed over the years. Once a rabid segregationist, he became, after blacks had started, from the late 1960s, to be allowed to vote in Mississippi, one of the most liberal members of the state's congressional delegation - with the exception of Mr Mike Espy, now President Clinton's agriculture secretary, and Mr Bennie Thompson, who have in turn represented the majority black Delta district. The congressional seniority system gave Mr Whitten great power in Washington. As chairman of the agriculture appropriations sub-committee for more than 40 years, and of the full appropriations committee from 1978-93, he controlled federal government purse strings and made sure that, when they were loosened, his district and his state won their share. No new member of congress is going to be able to match Mr Whitten's ability to bring home the bacon and it is not certain that voters in the 1990s, more attuned to the federal budget deficit, rank this ability at the top of their list. 'I think they have done a little too much for us already,' said Mr Lee Inman, a barber in Calhoun City. The Republicans' task is by no means easy, however. They have won the Mississippi governorship and both its senate seats, but made less headway at the local level. They hold none of the state's five congressional districts. For one thing, in a state where virtually every politician poses as a conservative, it is sometimes hard to distinguish one party from the other. 'It's kind of hard to tell the Democrats from the Republicans in this district,' says Ms Barbara McDonald, a campaign aide to Mr Tim Ford, speaker of the Mississippi legislature and one of the candidates for the Democratic nomination. 'Quite frankly, we only have two Democrats in the Mississippi delegation, Bennie Thompson and Jamie Whitten, and we are about to lose Jamie Whitten. The rest of them are in fact Republicans,' says Prof McLemore. Local penetration for the Republicans is hampered by the Democratic stranglehold on county-level government. 'The real power has been at the county supervisor level, the courthouse crowd. I don't know if there is a single Republican county supervisor in the first district,' says Mr Powell. He believes many local politicians are almost ready to switch parties. In the last year, seven county supervisors and five state legislators have left the Democrats. But although it is possible to run in Mississippi as a Republican and win, it is still a risky choice for local politicians. This has much less to do with 'yellow dog Democrat' resentment of the Republicans, dating back to the Civil War, than it does with the fact that anyone running as a Republican can say goodbye to virtually all black voters - and they make up a third of the state's population. The Republican party's success in state-wide elections has been won, to a great extent, by advertising. But here, too, the district poses problems: much of the most fertile ground for the Republicans is in the Memphis suburbs of De Soto County, whose inhabitants are often recent arrivals in Mississippi and who, in any case, read Tennessee newspapers and watch Tennessee television - whose advertising rates are much higher than for broadcasters in the Tupelo area. Money from the national Republican party could overcome this problem, as it did in the recent by-election in Kentucky, which the Republicans won. At the November election, however, every promising congressional district will have to compete for national funding with all the other Republican prospects. That money might well be forthcoming, even so. The Republican party trails by 42 seats to 59 in the 11 south-eastern states of the US, and this region offers some of the party's best chances of eating into the 256:178 Democratic majority in the House of Representatives.</p>

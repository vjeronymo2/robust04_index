			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GIFT BECOMES SMITHEREENS  </P> <P> The U.S. Navy blew up china, but it wasn't an international incident.  </P> <P> A Christmas gift of fine English china was blasted into small pieces after  officers on this Atlantic Ocean island suspected that the box in which it was  delivered carried a bomb, the base commander said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Security guards became suspicious when Tiller Ming, 70, a delivery man for the  prestigious Bluck's store, sped onto the base Saturday and, they said, threw  the package out.  </P> <P> "We could not identify the box without moving it, so we placed a device next to  it to neutralize it. Unfortunately in doing so we broke the china," said Capt.  Joseph Phelan, commanding officer of the base.  </P> <P> Bluck's spokesman Peter Darling denied that Ming had done anything wrong during  the delivery. "He couldn't get past the sentry because the base was closed," he  said.  </P></p>

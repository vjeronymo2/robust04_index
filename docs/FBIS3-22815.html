Interfax has learnt about the project providing for the test  launching of the missile with a simplified version of a  satellite. The project is to demonstrate real possibility of the  missile for launching commercial loads with the minimal changes  in the docking unit.    Experts believe the missile may put into orbit the load  weighing about 600 kilos and it could be used for implementing  the existing programmes of satellite communication systems on  the basis of low-orbit satellites.    A representative of the Russian Space Agency who has a  direct  involvement to the implementation of the project with the use of  SS-18, has told Interfax that so far the launching of the  missile is in question because the Russian Military Space force,  which control missile systems and space vehicles, has not OKed  the project.    The spokesman did not rule out the possibility that the  problem would be raised at the talks on conditions of leasing  the space center Baykonur and the military cooperation in Almaty  that are to begin in a week (the Russian delegation will leave  for Almaty on March 9)    Missiles SS-18 are to be destroyed in line with the  Russian-U.S. treaty START-2 before the year 2003. Now 104 SS-18  missiles are based in Kazakhstan.</p>

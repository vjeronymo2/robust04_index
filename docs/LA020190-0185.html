			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> MARKET ECONOMY: Orange County used to be a farmer's Garden of Eden, but  nowadays most of the growers at the Fullerton Farmer's Market are from foreign  parts, such as Fresno and San Diego (B1). . . . At their peak in 1947, fields,  orchards and pastures covered a third of the county, but now there are fewer  than 100 commercial growers here. . . . After the Irvine Co., which has 44,000  acres in fields and pastures, few local farmers have plots as large as 100  acres. Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

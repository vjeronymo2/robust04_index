			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian wood industry faces pay strike threat The IWA-Canada union, representing British Columbia's wood workers, has demanded pay increases totalling 18 per cent over the next three years. The employers' group, Forest Industrial Relations, immediately dismissed the demand as 'out of line' and far from reflecting recent pay settlements generally in Canada. The union, which last week won a strike mandate from its members, said the industry was making large profits and could afford a good increase. 'Its a stand-off and we're not sure we'll amend our position,' said Mr Gerry Stoney, IWA-Canada president. No negotiations are scheduled yet.</p>

			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone nears record THE BEST individual perform-ance in the FT-SE 100 Index came from Vodafone, the cellular telephones group, which jumped 25, or 4.5 per cent, to 578p, within a penny of the stock's all-time high. The move followed the announce-ment of the group's highest ever monthly new subscriber figures. Telecoms analysts were not surprised by the new gross subscriber levels, which they said were triggered by the recent burst of aggressive marketing efforts by both of the UK cellular phone groups, Vodafone and BT. One leading telecoms analyst described Vodafone's new numbers as 'extremely pleasing, even more so because two-thirds of the gross increase has come from the more lucrative business subscriber tariff'. Mr Marshall Whiting, telecoms specialist at Swiss Bank Corporation and a long-term bull of Vodafone, said: 'The cellular market remains good value and Vodafone will participate in its growth.' The shares peaked at the end of August when a wave of US money moved into the UK market, focusing on the then current American favourites such as Vodafone and Reuters.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 13 -- Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak  has asked the prime ministers of the countries of the "Twelve"  to support Poland's efforts for a membership of the European  Union [EU]. Pawlak conveyed respective letters to the  ambassadors of the European Union states at a meeting in Warsaw  on Wednesday.    Greek Ambassador Yeoryios Alexandropoulos said that it is  not  for the ambassadors to decide whether to accept Poland as a EU  member but that they will give their full support to Poland's  application for the membership.    Governmental commissioner for the European integration Jacek  Saryusz-Wolski said after the meeting that the foreign ministers  of the "Twelve" are to meet in Luxembourg on April 18 to decide,  among other things, on the sending of the Polish application to  the European Commission for examination. "Such a move will help  begin negotiations on Poland's membership of the union," he  added.    Saryusz-Wolski said he hopes that Poland should become a  full  member of the European Union in 1999.</p>

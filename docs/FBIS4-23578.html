			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Today in the Isare Commune, Nyambuye Zone, of  Bujumbura Rural Province, there was tension throughout the day;  certain armed persons caused the area to be insecure. Some  people who live in the area were about to flee to Bujumbura.  This morning the governor of Bujumbura [not further identified]  spoke about the events, and gave his reaction to them:    [Begin recording] [Governor] A group of soldiers based in  Isare went to Nyambuye this morning to verify information they  had been given by the district commander, concerning an armed  gang there who were about to launch an attack. It became very  tense upon their arrival. Some people shot at the soldiers.  Ordinary people who were on their way to markets and to work  returned home, while others fled the [words indistinct] zones in  particular. In Mugongomanga Commune, at a place called Matara  on Bubaji Hill, there was also a group of armed people, and they  also continue to fire on people. The commander of Bujumbura  Rural District has just informed us that one person has already  died. So, there is insecurity in this area as well. In the  coming days we will decide on what measures we will take to  restore peace. It was reported that in the afternoon the  tension continued, to the extent that a counsellor [not further  identified] from the governor who was in the area, and who was  accompanied by security personnel, had problems. He told us  that those who were shooting had not yet been pacified.    [Counsellor] [passage omitted] I saw three dead people: Two  men and a woman. I saw burning houses, and the zone offices  were on fire, as well as other neighboring houses. While  returning, in the company of the commander of Bujumbura rural  district and some other people, we were shot at, but we  survived. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

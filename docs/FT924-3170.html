			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Deutsche Bank bucks profits trend DEUTSCHE BANK, Germany's largest bank, yesterday reported group operating profits down by 5 per cent in the first 10 months of the year. The fall was worse than analysts' expectations and contrasted sharply with the robust figures of Deutsche's competitors. It prompted Deutsche's share price to fall by DM13.9 to DM653.1, helping to drag the DAX index of 30 leading German shares down by 17.08 to 1,508.24. Total operating profits fell from DM5.20bn to DM4.94bn (Pounds 1.9bn) while partial operating profit, which excludes the bank's own account trading, dropped 3.8 per cent to DM3.96bn. The fall contrasts with reported growth of 16.6 per cent in total operating profits at Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank, of 13.3 per cent at Commerzbank, the third largest bank, 13.2 per cent at the Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel-Bank and more than 20 per cent at Bayerische Vereinsbank. Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive, said net profits for the full year would be at least as good as they were last year. He said Deutsche Bank's profits were bigger than those of the next three competitors put together and insisted the relative strength of the bank would become clear at the full-year stage after provisioning for bad debts. Last year net profits rose from DM1.07bn to DM1.41bn while operating profits rose 16 per cent to a record DM5.97bn. A fall in profits was expected after Deutsche's interim profits fell 3.2 per cent after six months. Mr Kopper said staff numbers would probably drop by 1,000 over the course of the year.

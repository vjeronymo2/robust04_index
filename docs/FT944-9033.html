			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Pollution agency wins approval - Environment The long-awaited Environment Agency to regulate pollution has finally won the go-ahead with the inclusion of the environment agencies bill in the Queen's Speech yesterday. The agency, seen by ministers as a 'one-stop shop' for pollution regulation, will merge Her Majesty's Pollution Inspectorate, the National Rivers Authority and the waste regulation functions of local authorities. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has said the integration will result in a leaner, fitter, 'more together' regulator. The government also made clear yesterday that it was determined to push ahead with controversial schemes to raise the proportion of waste packaging which is recovered or recycled. Further legislation to encourage industry-led recycling programmes could follow, it said. Manufacturers and retailers have been concerned that increasing the amount of recycling, a UK obligation under the European Union packaging directive, could add Pounds 100m to costs at some point along the chain between production and point of sale, and would increase the cost of the weekly shopping basket. The environment agencies bill will also establish a Scottish Environment Protection Agency and include measures to set up new independent authorities for the 10 national parks in England and Wales. Environmental pressure groups yesterday greeted the announcement warily. Many, such as Greenpeace, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Friends of the Earth, have criticised the proposals on the grounds that the new agency would be too soft on industry. Friends of the Earth said yesterday that after the creation of the agency it would be less easy to pursue court cases against the government. At present ministers have a 'duty to further nature conservation', but the draft bill says instead that they must 'have regard to the desirability of conserving and enhancing natural beauty', the group said. Debate on the structure of the bill has also provoked argument between the present pollution regulators. Officials from the pollution inspectorate and local authorities have been concerned that the agency would be dominated by the NRA, which employs thousands of people to monitor the state of rivers, separate from its regulatory role.</p>

			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The Miami Hurricanes are considering a move from independent status to the  Atlantic 10 Conference in basketball, which would take effect when Penn State  joins the Big Ten, a Miami official said.  </P> <P> "We have had some discussions with the Atlantic 10," Miami Associate Athletic  Director Larry Wahl said.  </P> <P> "That's about where it is right now -- discussions. We're looking at anything  that makes sense, whether it's an all-sports conference, or whether it will be  to remain independent in football."  </P> <P> In recent months, West Virginia and other Eastern football independents have  talked about forming an all-sports conference. Those talks took on greater  urgency after Penn State announced that it was leaving the Atlantic 10 for the  Big Ten, a move that will be complete in all sports by the mid-1990s.  </P></p>

He said  that the United States is not worthy of playing any humanitarian  role. At a ceremony held by Hizballah in al-Ghubayrah in  Beirut, he said that the United States shows concern only about  the seven Israeli soldiers, but Shaykh 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ubayd,  hundreds of Lebanese detainees kidnapped from their homes in  organized terrorist operations, and thousands of Palestinians  detained in jails in occupied Palestine do not move the feelings  of the United States or Christopher.</p>

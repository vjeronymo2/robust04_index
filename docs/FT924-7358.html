			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Observer: Family minder Is Sir Christopher Harding, the ex-boss of British Nuclear Fuels, being lined up for the chairmanship of Newarthill, the loss-making family construction business of Lady Thatcher's great buddy, Lord McAlpine? It would make sense. Sir Hedley Greenborough, the current chairman, is over 70, the rest of the McAlpine family is getting on a bit, and Sir Christopher knows more than most about how to preserve family businesses. For nearly 20 years he has kept an eye on Lord Hanson's family transport business. If he can satisfy Lord Hanson he should be able to satisfy 50-year-old Lord McAlpine who, despite the retirement of his heroine, still seems more interested in politics than running the family business. He has just published The Servant, which has been described as a bible for Machiavellian right hand men, and is dedicated to 'the most magnificent Baroness Thatcher . . .from one of her many servants, who believes she could have been better served'. Sir Christopher, who has just joined the Newarthill board, refuses to discuss his future role but his experience will come in handy. No one is suggesting that Newarthill is in dire financial straits. But in the three years since the McAlpine family bought out the minority, at a multiple of 38 times earnings, the company has lost over Pounds 50m. Unlike its quoted brother, Alfred McAlpine, private companies like Newarthill cannot rely on using other people's money, via public rights issues, when they run short of cash.</p>

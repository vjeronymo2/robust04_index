			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Observer: Sheriff Soros hits town Pure coincidence, we assure you, but international financier George Soros just happened to be in Bonn yesterday when the Bundesbank's latest money supply figures sent the financial markets into convulsions. In fact Mr Midas thought silence was golden, at least about his position in the shaky markets: 'There is a lot of instability in the financial markets . . . I would prefer not to reinforce the turmoil.' Gee, thanks George. On threats by central banks to investigate and clip the wings of hedge funds like his own, he was positively angelic: 'It behoves the regulators to regulate . . . we are ready to co-operate with them.' How sweet. Soros was actually in town to finger-wag about instability in eastern Europe and the threat of turmoil on Bosnian lines in neighbouring Macedonia. His Soros Foundations are heavily involved throughout the region, promoting open societies and market economies. Soros describes Macedonia as 'the only multi-ethnic state left in the Balkans'. He has already lent it Dollars 25m. So is he a Robin Hood type, reaping riches from the west in order to feed bankrupt economies in the east? 'I don't think that I am really a Robin Hood . . . my shareholders are not exactly poor people.'</p>

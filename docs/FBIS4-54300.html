			<p>BFN     [Text] The ministries and agencies in Kasumigaseki that  oversee the country's economic activities have begun to examine  their personnel structure in preparation for the coming  reassignment of senior officials which will take place in June.  In the midst of the mounting and pressing issues such as  taxation system reform, repair of the U.S.-Japan economic  relationship, and restoration of better business, the emphasis  of this reshuffle is how it can compensate for the uncertainty  associated with the Hata administration's minority government.  Moreover, in light of the strong American criticism against the  Japanese bureaucracy that charges that the "bureaucrats manage  Japan," personnel affairs this time are receiving international  attention as well. (The year the official discussed joined the  ministry is indicated in parentheses).  <H5>  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] </H5>   The prospect is becoming stronger that Administrative Vice  Minister Hideaki Kumano (1960) is to remain in his position.    In connection with the issue of the de facto dismissal of  Masahisa Naito, former Industrial Policy Bureau director, by  former MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, many former ministry  officials hold the opinion that the "vice minister should be  replaced and there should be a clear cut departure from the past  with new people and a new spirit."    But the expectation is strong in the administration that the  combination of Finance Vice Minister Jiro Saito and Vice  Minister Kumano should steer through the pending issues. Also  within the ministry, the mood is gaining strength that they  should bring the system under control with him [Kumano]  remaining in place. If the vice minister stays on, it is  expected that Sozaburo Okamatsu (1960), MITI deputy vice  minister; Yoshihiro Sakamoto (1962), International Trade Policy  Bureau director; and others will stay on in their respective  positions. It is likely that Wataru Aso (1963), Patent Office  director general, and Hideki Osada (1963), Small and Medium  Enterprise Agency director general, will retire.  <H5>  Finance Ministry </H5>   The continuation in office of Administrative Vice Minister  Saito (1959) is certain. Budget Bureau Director Kyosuke  Shinozawa (1960), Tax Bureau Director Tadasu Ogawa (1962), and  Secretariat Director Takeshi Komura (1963) are also expected to  stay on and to try to realize tax system reform. And the  "international pair," Yukinori Nakahira (1963), deputy vice  minister for financial affairs, and Takatoshi Kato (1964),  International Finance Bureau director, are also highly likely to  remain in office. Eisuke Hamamoto (1961), National Tax  Administration Agency director general, will retire; and the  unofficial designation has been made for Nobuyuki Teramura  (1961), Banking Bureau director, to succeed him. Yoshimasa  Nishimura (1963), Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy  director, is the leading candidate for the position of Banking  Bureau director. Sohei Hidaka (1963), Securities Bureau  director, is expected to retire; and Koji Tanami (1964), deputy  vice minister of Policy Coordination, among others, is rumored  to succeed him.  <H5>  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries </H5>   Deputy Vice Minister Jiro Shiwaku (1959), who had postponed  his retirement, which was quite an unusual case, has now retired  with the April signing of the new multilateral trade negotiation  (Uruguay Round) marking his departure from the stage, and other  senior officials' personnel affairs have nearly been resolved.  The focal points have been the personnel assignments for  directors of the Forestry and Fisheries Agencies. The names of  Hajime Irisawa (1963), Agricultural Structure Improvement Bureau  director, and Michio Shimada (1964), Statistics and Information  Department director, are mentioned.  <H5>  Construction Ministry </H5>   The focal point is the resignation or remaining in office of  Shigeo Mochizuki (1959), administrative vice minister. If he  retires, Haruyoshi Fujii (1962), vice minister of engineering  affairs, will be promoted; and for the new vice minister of  engineering, Takashi Toyoda (1962), River Bureau director, is  the leading candidate. If the Administrative vice minister  remains in place, then Engineering Affairs Vice Minister Fujii  is expected to remain in his current post .  <H5>  Transportation Ministry </H5>   The continuation of Michio Matsuo (1960), administrative  vice  minister is certain; the focal point is the successor for Tsuguo  Iyama (1961), Maritime Safety Agency director general, whose  retirement is expected. The names of Railway Bureau Director Yu  Hatano (1963) and Civil Aviation Bureau Director Yasutoshi  Tsuchisaka (1963) are mentioned, but there is a good possibility  that Mr. Tsuchisaka will remain in his post because the  discussion on Narita Airport expansion is approaching its final  stages.  <H5>  Post and Telecommunications Ministry </H5>   The retirement of Administrative Vice Minister Futoshi  Shirai  (1959) and the promotion of Telecommunications Bureau Director  Haruki Matsuno (1960) to fill the position have become certain.  The leading candidate to become Telecommunications Bureau  director is Communications Policy Bureau Director Mitsuo  Igarashi (1963) and to become Communications Policy Bureau  director is Councilor Koji Tani (1964).  <H5>  Economic Planning Agency </H5>   A partial reshuffle of senior officials was made in January,  so the regular reassignments in the summer will be kept small.  Administrative Vice Minister Tsutomu Tanaka is likely to remain  in post. In that case, Coordination Bureau Director Atsushi  Kobayashi (1961), the leading candidate to be the next  Administrative vice minister, and most other main senior  officials are expected to stay on in their present posts.    The characteristic of this year's personnel moves in the  ministries and agencies overseeing national economic affairs is  the prospect that the current administrative vice ministers in  the major ministries, such as the Finance Ministry, will remain  in their posts. In the background, the bureaucrats' strong  self-conceit is seen, to the effect that the Hata Cabinet's  government foundation is weak, so the bureaucracy has to take  the lead in management of important issues. Both in Japan and  overseas, critical voices against the bureaucrats are getting  stronger, claiming that the existence of the bureaucrats weakens  the government's ability to determine policy. But the  stagnation of personnel affairs, symbolized by the current  [administrative] vice ministers remaining in office, contains  the possibility that it will lead to a strengthened voice for  the bureaucrats.    This time around the only economic-related ministry in which  the prospect of the [administrative] vice minister's retirement  is certain is the Post and Telecommunications Ministry. All of  the ministries and agencies are trying to strengthen the  structure by retaining the status quo for personnel. The reason  the bureaucracy offers for the retention of the current vice  ministers is that the pressing issues can only be steered  forward under a strong line-up.    By last June, the Finance Ministry had already lined-up the  people for reform of the taxation system with Vice Minister  Saito at the center. And this year's decision for the vice  minister to remain in office can be said to be a "done-deal."  Early this year, Vice Minister Saito was the target of  criticism against bureaucrats when he displayed strong-arm  tactics with the national welfare tax concept. But he will try  to achieve reform of the taxation system, while retaining the  existing policy line and structure.    MITI will try to improve the U.S.-Japanese relationship  through the retention of Vice Minister Kumano and other major  directors. But there is a danger that the U.S. might become  suspicious that the Japanese bureaucratic organization has  become tougher. So this could become a main element among the  obstacles in the negotiations.    The politicians receive the baptism of elections. But the  bureaucrats' personnel moves lack such a check. This is all the  more reason that highly transparent personnel moves, which keep  the people's criticism in mind, should be sought. When  personnel affairs are stagnant, there is the danger of the  bureaucrats making their own decisions in the process of  deciding policy and of criticism against bureaucrats in and out  of Japan getting stronger.</p>

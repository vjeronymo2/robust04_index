			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Observer: Monks' outing Watch out for young John Monks, the TUC's new general secretary. The wraps are already being taken off the man who has been given the thankless task of dragging Britain's trade union movement in from the cold. Anna Ford gave Monks a chance to show his paces on BBC breakfast TV yesterday and Observer hears that Monks will give the keynote speech at next month's Trades Union Congress. The TUC has had to bend its hallowed rules since Monks does not take over officially from Norman Willis until the end of Congress on the Friday. Traditionally, the new general secretary has to wait a further year to speak to the delegates. But union leaders have had enough of the barren Willis years and can't wait to hear a new voice at the head of the TUC.</p>

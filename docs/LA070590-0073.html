			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> AMBURGEY A CONVERT ON CONFLICT POLICY  </P> <P> Facing increased criticism and hoping to smooth his campaign for reelection in  November, City Councilman Orville Amburgey surprised his colleagues and voted  in favor of a stricter conflict-of-interest policy this week.  </P> <P> Amburgey repeatedly opposed the measure as it was being drafted, saying it  would deprive residents of full representation on the council. He came under  fire in March by refusing to abstain from a vote granting his son, Ron, a  rezoning of property which Ron Amburgey hoped to develop.  </P> <P> Amburgey claimed that because his son was no longer a dependent, the senior  Amburgey didn't stand to gain financially and therefore had not violated city  code with his vote.  </P> <P> In a statement to the council Monday, Amburgey said his family discussed the  policy and decided that the "election-year political football" was not worth  the fight despite his belief that the policy is too broad and not enforceable.  </P> <P> As a result, Ron Amburgey has chosen to no longer develop in Costa Mesa, his  father said.  </P> <P> "We feel it's important to avoid any further potential for smearing our family  name," Amburgey told the council members.  </P> <P> The new policy, which will be formally adopted at the council's next meeting  July 16, redefines the "financial interest" of a public official to include  indirect investments or interests owned by an official's immediate family,  including independent children, or a business interest in which any of them  owns at least a 10% interest.  </P> <P> City Atty. Thomas Kathe researched court challenges to conflict-of-interest  rules and determined that the council members could pass an ordinance simply to  ensure the public's confidence in them.  </P> <P> The courts seem to hold the public's right to a fair and honest government  above the rights of an individual to receive equal treatment from his elected  officials, Kathe told the council.  </P> <P> "The key finding is that such family relationships create an appearance of bias  of a conflict of interest," Kathe told the council.  </P> <P> The council decision cuts short an effort by Costa Mesa resident Roger  Blanchard to have a similar policy placed on the November ballot. Blanchard's  house is on Sea Bluff Drive, near the younger Amburgey's project.  </P> <P> However, Blanchard said his initiative wasn't directed only at Orville  Amburgey, and would have cleared up a lot of questions that have come before  the council and will inevitably continue.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle tried to take attention away from Amburgey's claim  that the move was a "political gimmick for ambitious politicians." Although the  policy was drafted because of Amburgey's vote, she said, the stricter policy is  better for the city at large. MARY ANNE PEREZ  </P></p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: 3i's net assets improve 39% to Pounds 1.85bn 3i's results, issued with the pathfinder prospectus yesterday, revealed a 39 per cent increase in net assets to Pounds 1.85bn. The figure demonstrated the improvement in the health of the unquoted companies in 3i's portfolio, said Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive. The results for the year to end-March 1994 were flattered by the release of a Pounds 152m provision for deferred tax on unrealised appreciation, which will no longer be needed because 3i will have exemption from capital gains tax once it floats as an investment trust. Without this write-back, net assets increased by 27.7 per cent and a 30.3 per cent return on shareholders' funds. 3i's total return - from all forms of interest fees and capital gains - was Pounds 555m, compared with Pounds 88m the previous year. By far the largest element of this increase came from the Pounds 210m increase in the unrealised value of the portfolio. 3i said the growth in value of the portfolio resulted from an 'improvement in the profitability of underlying investee businesses, certain investments being valued in excess of their costs for the first time and higher price earnings multiples of comparable listed companies'. Of this, about Pounds 100m referred to investments being valued in excess of cost for the first time. Another Pounds 101m of the increase in total return was the result of a sharp decrease in provisions - from Pounds 170.9m to Pounds 38.8m - and an increase in profits on investments realised during the year. Revenue profits before tax increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 65.4m. The group is paying the seven banks and the Bank of England, which together own 3i, a dividend of Pounds 37.6m, up from Pounds 26.8m. As part of the flotation, 3i is restructuring via a tax-efficient rights issue and special dividend to existing shareholders. The group will pay a special Pounds 290m dividend which will be funded from a rights issue to the existing shareholders that will raise exactly the same amount.</p>

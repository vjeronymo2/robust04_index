			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Quebec language law may be eased THE government of Quebec appears to be inching towards a partial relaxation of its highly contentious French-only language law. The conseil de la langue francaise, a government advisory body, has recommended that small businesses in the province be allowed to put up bilingual signs outside their premises. But the conseil rejected other concessions, such as relaxing the requirement that children of immigrants attend French-language schools. Arcane though it may seem to outsiders, the language law, known as Bill 101, is among the most divisive political issues in Quebec. About 83 per cent of the province's population is French-speaking, and the position of French culture has seldom been more secure. Recent opinion polls indicate that a majority of Quebecois are now willing to accept some dilution of the strict French-only requirements of Bill 101. Many nationalists are concerned, however, by the longer-term pressures to anglicise coming from the rest of North America and the rising tide of non-French speaking immigrants to the province. The government must set a new language policy before the end of this year.</p>

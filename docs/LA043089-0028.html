			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SINGING FOR ADULTS LONELY  </P> <P> BONNIE RAITT "Nick of Time." Capitol. ***  </P> <P> The adult world Bonnie Raitt sings about is lightyears away from the  black-and-white pains and pleasures of teen rock. It's where people run out of  time, out of patience, out of love and out of luck, but never out of hope and  compassion. In an album that's as eclectic emotionally as musically, Raitt  moves gracefully from the silky R&amp;B of the poignant title tune to the wise  and sassy rock of John Hiatt's "Thing Called Love" to the heartbreakingly  elegant balladry of "I Ain't Gonna Let You Break My Heart Again" to the  Fabulous Thunderbirds-backed roadhouse blues of "The Road's My Middle Name."  The LP could have done with a sharper focus, and without a couple of the songs.  Even so, there's nary a trace of calculation or false emotion. RANDY LEWIS  </P></p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Rebels join Smith in attack over Europe TORY backbenchers opposed to the bill ratifying the Maastricht treaty were given a blunt reminder of their party's electoral commitments by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the Commons yesterday. Under a barrage of hostile questions about the futility of last week's European Community summit in Birmingham he rejected demands that the government should not seek to make any further progress with the remaining stages of the bill until after the next meeting of EC heads of government in Edinburgh in mid December. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, scoffed at the prime minister's inability to secure a discussion at Birmingham about the 'fault lines' he had identified in the EC's exchange rate mechanism. Mr Smith also condemned the government's failure to use the British presidency of the EC to produce 'one single initiative' to tackle rising unemployment, falling investment and low growth. Mr Major expressed astonishment that Mr Smith, a former shadow chancellor, had not realised that for 'market reasons' discussions about the ERM had to be conducted in private. Dealing with the economic convergence provisions in the Maastricht treaty, he said it was becoming increasingly unlikely that the proposed timetable would be achieved. With the treaty subjected to renewed attack from both sides of the House, Mr Tony Marlow, MP for Northampton North and a prominent Euro-sceptic, pointedly underlined the 'present circumstances' confronting the prime minister. Mr Marlow asked: 'What is more important to you - the good will of a couple of elderly European politicians intent on imposing their blueprint on an increasingly reluctant Europe, or the good will of Conservative MPs?' He suggested that if it was the latter it would be the 'height of political wisdom' to delay the bill's return to the Commons until such time as it had been ratified by the Danes. Mr Marlow added: 'God willing, they may never do so'. To ironic laughter from the Labour benches, the prime minister suggested that he had no reason to doubt Mr Marlow's good will. He emphasised: 'I look for your support now and in the future on the programme on which we both jointly contested the general election.' The prime minister said the government was putting Britain's interests first, including the need to ensure that it had a 'central say' in the decisions taken in the EC that affected jobs and industry. Backed by cheers from Tory loyalists, he said: 'It may be the ambition of some to see this country isolated as a sour little outpost of western Europe, but it is not my ambition.' He believed the way was open for debate on the further stages of the bill to be resumed at a time convenient to the House, emphasising that he had signed the Maastricht treaty on behalf of Britain and with the consent of the Commons.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Bear Stearns posts record year BEAR STEARNS, the Wall Street securities house, yesterday announced a 58 per cent increase in fiscal fourth-quarter profits to Dollars 124.8m, or Dollars 1.07 a share. The strong final quarter took the firm's full-year earnings to a record Dollars 362.4m, well up on the Dollars 294.6m reported for the previous 12 months. Bear Stearns' revenues in the fourth quarter, excluding interest expense, were Dollars 681.7m, and for the year Dollars 2.1bn. Bear Stearns said its record quarter and year reflected significant increases in revenues in most of its main business lines, echoing the performance of other Wall Street firms. It also reaped record profits in the wake of strong investor demand for equities and a booming stock and bond underwriting business. Revenues from principal transactions - the trading of securities for the firm's own account - rocketed to Dollars 362m in the quarter, from Dollars 248m a year ago. The large increase was primarily derived from high levels of activity in the trading of fixed-income instruments. Investment banking, Bear Stearns' second-largest revenue-earner behind interest and dividend income, brought in Dollars 136m between April and June, well ahead of the Dollars 90m a year ago. Commission revenues, meanwhile, advanced 31 per cent to Dollars 118m, due partly to a strong performance from the firm's correspondent clearing and private client services divisions. Total non-interest expenses were also up sharply, rising 38 per cent to Dollars 470m, an increase that was in line with the growth in business activity. News of the record quarter and year failed to lift the share price, which edged Dollars  5/8 lower to Dollars 24 3/4 before at the close in New York. The stock had opened close to its all-time high, and the modest decline was attributable to profit-taking, rather than disappointment in the firm's earnings.</p>

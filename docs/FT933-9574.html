			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Fund managers go for European shares EUROPEAN equities, and French shares in particular, have seen a surge in popularity among UK fund managers, according to the latest Smith New Court/Gallup Survey of fund managers released today. A balance of 37 per cent of fund managers questioned in themonthly survey said they planned to increase their holdings in continental European equities, compared with only 13 per cent in the July survey. The balance of fund managers refers to the difference between institutions who are bullish and those who are bearish about a market. The sharp rise in the popularity of European equities probably stems from the recent shake-up of the European exchange rate mechanism, seen as paving the way for official interest rates to tumble across continental Europe, which investors hope will stimulate economic recovery. On the European front, 87 per cent of fund managers said they preferred French equities to German ones as an investment. Meanwhile, a balance of 33 per cent of managers said they intended to raise their weightings in UK shares, up from 12 per cent in July. A much higher proportion of fund managers now think that the outlook for the UK economy over the next 12 months is brightening: 34 per cent said it would 'get a lot better', compared with 17 per cent. Expected earnings per share growth for 1994 has jumped from 14.4 per cent to 15.7 per cent. Institutional investors have lowered their inflation forecasts, predicting that the Retail Price Index will be 2.7 per cent by the end of 1993 and 3.7 per cent by the end of 1994. On the fixed income side, a balance of 11 per cent of fund managers said they would decrease their holdings in gilts, compared with 1 per cent the previous month, and a balance of 7 per cent said they would decrease their holdings in overseas bonds and deposits, whereas a balance of 3 per cent planned to increase exposure last month. According to the survey, pension fund assets are allocated as follows: UK equities, 58 per cent; US equities, 6 per cent; European equities, 8 per cent; Japanese equities, 5 per cent; other equities, 5 per cent; UK gilts, 6 per cent; UK property, 4 per cent; UK cash, 3 per cent; overseas bonds and deposits, 3 per cent; index-linked gilts, 2 per cent.</p>

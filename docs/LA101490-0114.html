			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TURNOVERS COST VERDUGO HILLS IN 7-6 DEFEAT  </P> <P> Verdugo Hills High Coach Charley Mack watched the Dons fumble away his chance  to come out on top against his alma mater Marshall and mentor Ken Gerard on  Saturday.  </P> <P> Verdugo Hills committed five turnovers -- three of them fumbles -- as the  Barristers prevailed, 7-6, in a Northern Conference game at Marshall.  </P> <P> Quarterback Richard Gomez's one-yard touchdown run and Mauricio Pena's extra  point in the third quarter helped Marshall beat Mack in his second year as  Verdugo Hills' head coach. The Barristers improved to 2-3, 1-1 in conference  play.  </P> <P> "I thought we had them. . . . but we made a couple mistakes," said Mack, who  played nose guard and was an assistant coach for Gerard at Marshall. "We  fumbled on the second drive and again in the second half. If we get those back,  who knows. We could have had a 21-0 lead."  </P> <P> Scoring has been a problem for Verdugo Hills (0-5, 0-2), which has been shut  out three times and scored only 13 points before Saturday's game.  </P> <P> Verdugo Hills moved into scoring position on its second drive, but quarterback  Noel Alvarado fumbled at Marshall's 10-yard line.  </P> <P> Alvarado redeemed himself by scoring on a one-yard sneak late in the second  quarter to complete a 14-play, 74-yard drive. Alvarado had 123 yards in total  offense (98 passing, 25 rushing). Robert Servellon's kick for the extra point,  however, hit the left upright.  </P> <P> Alvarado threw interceptions on Verdugo Hills' final two possessions, including  a long pass that would have given the Dons a first down on Marshall's one with  3 minutes 52 seconds left.  </P> <P> "We ran (a crossing pattern) out of a slot (formation) and we hoped to sucker  them with it," said Dons' offensive coordinator Rob Huffman, a former Cal State  Northridge quarterback. "If (Alvarado) had thrown it a little farther, we might  have had a touchdown. But they stayed back pretty well." SEAN WATERS  </P></p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / International Company News: Endesa plans share offer to raise further Pta200bn Endesa, Spain's partially -privatised state-controlled electricity distributor and generator, is to put 10 per cent of its equity on the market in the first half of this year in an international public offering worth an estimated Pta200bn (Dollars 1.43bn). The offering, which will be managed by Goldman Sachs of the US, and Argentaria, the government-controlled domestic banking group, will have a domestic retail tranche and one aimed at international institutions. It is understood that a separate tranche, representing just over half the total equity offered, could be placed with National Power of the UK and with Germany's RWE. INI, the public sector conglomerate which owns Endesa, placed 23 per cent of the utility on the market in 1988 and a further 10 per cent two years ago on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of ADRs. Endesa's group 1993 net profit was Pta116.8bn, up 9.9 per cent from the previous year. Earnings per share rose to Pta449.3 from Pta408. A further partial privatisation by Endesa had been expected this year to offset an escalating general government deficit that threatens to rise to 8.5 per cent of GDP against an official 6.4 per cent target. Other offerings of government-controlled equity to raise revenue this year could include Telefonica Internacional, the international unit of the domestic telecommunications group, and Tabacalera, the tobacco group. Last year, as recession began to make strong inroads on the budget, the government's energy conglomerate Repsol, again advised by Goldman Sachs, realised Pta110bn when it placed 13 per cent of its equity on the market, and Argentaria, using Morgan Stanley as its global co-ordinator, realised Pta290bn in two public share offerings that brought public ownership of the banking group down to 50 per cent.</p>

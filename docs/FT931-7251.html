			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / BA likely to pay Virgin Pounds 10m-Pounds 15m BRITISH AIRWAYS is today expected to agree to pay Virgin Atlantic Pounds 10m-Pounds 15m in compensation for the commercial damage inflicted on its business by BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign. The payment, which is likely to include Pounds 3m in settlement of a five-year-old aircraft maintenance dispute, forms part of a proposed agreement which both sides hope will end a period of open warfare and begin a new relationship. The deal should be finalised today against the background of threats by Virgin to pursue its case against BA through the US and European courts. Virgin, which would drop the threats if a deal is concluded, claims that anti-trust action launched against BA in the US could net as much as Dollars 100m in compensation. BA's covert campaign to undermine Virgin has already cost Britain's national carrier Pounds 610,000 in libel fees and several million pounds in legal costs. In the aftermath of the out-of-court settlement of the libel case last month, Lord King departed six months early as BA chairman, the board was reshuffled and the company introduced a new code of conduct to ensure similar malpractices were not repeated. It had been hoped that a deal would be agreed yesterday but last night lawyers were still discussing new ground rules for competition between the airlines. It is understood agreement had been reached on the use of computer-based airline information but that difficulties remained over BA's claimed right to win away Virgin's passengers.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Everything you need to know about Alsace - Although fewer wine books than usual were published this year, Edmund Penning-Rowsell recommends several that he feels merit bookshelf space The crop of new wine books this year is smaller than usual. Perhaps this reflects the fact that wine bookshelves are over-crowded already. Perhaps, too, publishers have realised that even many frequent drinkers of fine wines are less interested in exploring their background than might be expected, even though this would add to their appreciation. In The Wines of Alsace (Pounds 14.99, Faber), Tom Stevenson has compiled, rather than written, an encyclopaedic tome on this leading French wine region. Although imports to the UK have more than doubled in the past 10 years, they account for only 5 per cent of Alsace's total exports. The book is constructed on a large scale. After the usual chapters on terroir, grape varieties and vinification, there are descriptions of each of the 118 wine villages, followed by detailed accounts, with maps, of the 51 grands crus. The appellation adoption that began in 1983 remains a source of controversy. There are substantial chapters on named sites and varying styles of wine and the people concerned. The author discusses the wines of each grower. (He regards Trimbach's Clos St Hune as not only the outstanding Alsace Riesling but also one of the world's greatest white wines.) So many individual properties in the area make more than one type of wine that the number assessed is very large. If the reader's thirst for information has not been slaked, there are assessments of vintages back to the Dark Ages, charts, tables and statistics  -such as the number in the population speaking the local patois (75 per cent). But the visitor to one of the most attractive of France's wine regions can select the relevant information without difficulty. Beaujolais vies with Alsace as France's most pleasant wine region; it is more rural and its lower mountains are more accessible. Beaujolais, by Michael Bullet (Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 24.99), is essentially a picture book by the region's highly professional photographer, Pierre Cottin. The author's text is supplemented by a former grower, Louis Brechard, and by Comte Henri de Rambuteau, the owner of Chateau des Granges who died before the book was published. It provides compelling reasons for visiting Beaujolais and trying its early-maturing, easy-to-drink wines. With walking holidays in France increasingly popular, it is appropriate to associate them with wine. Nigel Buxton's Walking in Wine Country France (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson, Pounds 20) covers the eight main wine areas, from Alsace to the Languedoc. Full-page maps are accompanied by the relevant IGN map numbers for the walks themselves. Each has an introductory section, followed by the author's own experiences on his walking tours, with a closing section on the region's wines. It is well-produced but essentially for advance planning, as its large format and weight would make it unsuitable for the rucksack. Jane MacQuitty's Champagne and Sparkling Wines (Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 8.99) and Roger Voss's Port and Sherry and Other Fortified Wines (Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 8.99) both derive from the publisher's pocket wine series and have been expanded and updated into comprehensive, critical guides. Indeed, their range, particularly MacQuitty's, describe world production of wines once associated with a single area. Only a a third of her book is about champagne, and more than 50 Italian wines are listed, while many fortified wines are now made in the New World. For champagne alone, Don Philpot's The Champagne Almanac (Eric Dobby Publishing, Pounds 7.99) provides a compact alphabetical guide to every champagne house, with statistics, its label illustrated and notes on the varieties each markets. Bob Thompson is a respected senior writer on US West Coast wines and his Wine Atlas of California with Oregon and Washington (Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 25) is a useful addition to this publisher's series of wine atlases. In addition to 36 district maps, the history and details of grape varieties and climatic variations are given for a series of wine-growing districts. All the vineyards of any significance are described under the controlled appellation, American Viticultural Area (AVA), with notes on the quality of each. The section on Oregon and Washington is no less detailed. Washington produced its first wine, a Gewurtraminer, in 1967 and Oregon the first Pinot Noir in 1972. Travel information is provided throughout and every opening has an illustration. Grapevine, by two well-known wine writers, Anthony Rose and Tim Atkin (Headline, Pounds 5.99) is a compendium of more than 2,000 mostly recommended wines in one or other of 24 supermarket and off-licence chains, arranged alphabetically, quality marked out of 20 and with value marked by pound signs. The wines were tested between last May and September, so a proportion is likely to go out of stock as 1994, which it covers, progresses. Nevertheless the breadth of selection is impressive and the comments on each wine succinct. But its claim to be 'the complete wine buyer's handbook' for next year cannot entirely be maintained, as the independent private merchants' wines are not included. Moreover, although some Bordeaux and Burgundy wines are listed (mostly the less expensive), it is not quite fair to write that they have 'rested on their laurels for so long that they've forgotten what their customers want to drink.' In both regions, and particularly Bordeaux, very large investments and technical advances have been made in recent years, accounting partly for their cash-flow problems - and, after all, they produce some of the world's finest wine. Robert Parker needs no introduction and the third edition of his The Wine Buyer's Guide (Dorling Kindersley, Pounds 30) first published in 1989, has now increased the number of wines assessed to more than 7,500 in a tome weighing more than 4lb. His notes on estates, smaller growers' wines and vintage assessments are highly apposite but his ratings are regarded widely - at least on the eastern side of the Atlantic - as over-precise, for the development of the finer wines may be irregular.</p>

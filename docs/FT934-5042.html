			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Move to close PAYE and NIC loopholes Employers will no longer be able to avoid accounting for PAYE by paying their staff in assets such as gold bars and coffee beans, the chancellor announced. He said the secretary of state for social security is tabling similar measures to counter avoidance of National Insurance contributions (NIC). The intention is to prevent the use of artificial schemes designed to avoid PAYE and NIC obligations. The change will yield Pounds 200m in 1994-95. The new PAYE rules will come into effect following Royal assent to the finance bill. The rules applying to National Insurance contributions came into effect at midnight. The most common schemes to get round the existing regulations involve paying employees in gold or commodities, which the employee is then able to sell. The proposal is to make employers account for PAYE when they pay their staff: in marketable assets; or with assets which are not immediately marketable, but where the employer arranges for the employee to convert them into cash. PAYE will also be applied to vouchers and credit tokens which are used to provide such assets. Changes will also be made to ensure that vouchers and credit tokens are valued for tax purposes according to the expense to the person at whose cost they are provided. The measures will also deal with other devices where the employer channels payments to employees through a third party outside the UK, such as a trust, in order to avoid his or her PAYE obligations.</p>

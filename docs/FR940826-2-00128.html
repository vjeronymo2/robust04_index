			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange proposes to trade cash-settled, European-style Index options ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , exercises are permitted at expiration only). The Exchange also proposes that Israeli Index options will have trading hours from 9:30 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. EST. As with other index options traded on the Amex, the options on the Index will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration Friday''). The last trading day in an option series will normally be the second to last business day preceding the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month (normally a Thursday). Trading in expiring options will cease at the close of trading on the last trading day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Index value for purposes of settling a specific Israeli Index option will be calculated based upon the primary exchange regular way opening sale prices for the component securities. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  In the case of NM securities, the first reported sale price will be used. As trading begins in each of the Index's component securities, its opening sale price is used in the calculation. Once all of the component stocks have opened, the value of the Index is determined and that value is used as the settlement value of the option. If any of the component stocks do not open for trading on the last trading day before expiration, then the prior day's last sale price is used in the calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In the case of ADRs, the primary exchange refers to the primary exchange for the ADR and not the underlying security. Telephone conversation between Claire McGrath, Special Counsel, Derivative Securities, Amex, and Stephen Youhn, Derivative Products Regulation, SEC, on Aug. 19, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange plans to list options series with expirations in the three near-term calendar months and in the two additional calendar months in the March cycle. In addition, longer term option series having up to thirty-six months to expiration may be trade. In lieu of such long-term options on a full-value Index level, the Exchange may instead list long-term, reduced-value put and call options based on one-tenth (1/10th) the Index's full-value. In either event, the interval between expiration months for either a full-value or reduced-value long-term option will not be less than six months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility Standards for Index Components  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Index's component securities all have major business interests in Israel, and have been selected on the basis of their market capitalization, trading liquidity, and representation of Israeli business industries. The Amex believes the components represent the largest and most liquid of all Israeli securities trading in the U.S., and that the Index tracks closely the performance of larger broad market Israeli indexes, such as the Oscar Gruss Israel Index, which contains all of the more than 50 Israeli securities currently traded in the U.S. This index is carried in the Israeli press as well as by Bloomberg L.P., a major U.S. data vendor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In choosing among Israeli stocks that meet the minimum criteria set forth in Exchange Rule 901C, the Exchange will select stocks that: (1) have a minimum market value in U.S. dollars of at least $75 million, except that for each of the lowest weighted component securities in the Index that in the aggregate account for no more than 10% of the weight of the Index, the market value may be at least $50 million; (2) have an average monthly trading volume in the U.S. markets over the previous six month period of not less than 500,000 shares (or ADRs); (3) have at least 85% of the numerical Index value and at least 80% of the total number of component securities meeting the current criteria for standardized option trading set forth in Exchange Rule 915; and (4) are reported securities that trade on either the NYSE, Amex (subject to the limitations of Rule 901C), or are NM securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amex will ensure that no more than 20% of the weight of the Index is represented by ADRs overlying foreign securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  Currently, no Index components have the majority of their trading volume occurring on an exchange with which the Amex does not currently have in place an effective surveillance sharing agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment No. 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Exchange Rules Applicable to Stock Index Options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Amex Rules 900C through 980C will apply to the trading of regular and long-term contracts based on the Index. These Rules cover issues such as surveillance, exercise prices, and position limits. Surveillance procedures currently used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options will also be used to monitor trading in options on the Index. The Index is deemed to be a Stock Index option under Rule 901C(a) and a Stock Index Industry Group under Rule 900C(b)(1). With respect to Rule 903C(b), the Exchange proposes to list near-the-money ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , within ten points above or below the current index value) options series on the Index at 21/2 point strike (exercise) price intervals when the value of the Index is below 200 points. In addition, the Exchange proposes to establish, pursuant to Rule 904C(c), a position limit of 7,500 contracts on the same side of the market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

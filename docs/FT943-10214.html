			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: CGT exemption would encourage savings on rights issue underwriting Sir, When companies issue new equity, the size of the discount to market price is not important to them or their existing shareholders, provided the equity is offered to the existing shareholders first. In effect, those shareholders can capture the discount, either by subscribing for the new shares or by selling their rights to do so. Pre-emption rights are thus an important protection for all shareholders, not just the 'big City battalions' (Lex: 'Underwriting fees', August 1). It may well be, however, that underwriting fees are, at least on the basis of any technical analysis, too high for an issue at a substantial discount, where the existing shareholders effectively guarantee the company receives its money in order to avoid dilution. If so, it is a puzzle that, in the UK market, companies rarely issue equity at very deep discounts and dispense entirely with underwriting costs. The reasons for this are not totally clear and may primarily be a question of market practice and investor perception. There is also the difficult choice which faces small shareholders between writing a cheque to subscribe for new equity or having to pay capital gains tax on the sale of their rights. Perhaps the Treasury and the Office of Fair Trading should consider the possibility of exempting the sale of rights from CGT and encouraging some large companies to make modest issues of non-underwritten equity at a deep discount. This might establish such a method of raising new equity as an acceptable alternative and would ensure that companies only paid underwriting fees if they felt they were obtaining good value.

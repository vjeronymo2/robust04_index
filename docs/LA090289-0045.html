			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LA JOLLA WRITER HAL G. EVARTS JR., 74, DIES  </P> <P> Hal G. Evarts Jr., a 49-year resident of La Jolla whose literary career spanned  more than 50 years and included stints as a free-lance writer, journalist and  novelist, died Sunday after a fall at home. He was 74.  </P> <P> The Kansas native collected two Edgar Allan Poe Awards from the Mystery Writers  of America for his novels "Treasure River" in 1964 and "Smugglers' Road" in  1968.  </P> <P> In the early 1960s, he started writing adventure and mystery stories for young  readers, including the popular "Big Foot."  </P> <P> The American West was the theme of many of Evarts' earlier novels, including  "Colorado Crossing," "Man Without a Gun" and "The Sundown Kid."  </P> <P> After graduating in 1936 from Stanford University, where he earned a bachelor's  degree in English, Evarts traveled around the world. He incorporated his  experiences in such remote areas as Tibet and western China into magazine  articles, short stories and novels.  </P> <P> He wrote 28 novels and more than 100 short stories.  </P> <P> Evarts' writing career began in 1935 as a reporter with the San Diego Evening  Tribune. In 1939, he signed on with the European edition of the New York Herald  Tribune in Paris. After only a few months as a foreign correspondent, he was  out of a job when the impending German occupation forced the office to suspend  operations in 1940.  </P> <P> He returned to Europe in 1945 as a combat historian before settling in La Jolla  the same year and resuming his career as a free-lance writer.  </P> <P> Evarts is survived by his wife, Dorothea Abbot Evarts; a daughter, Ginger  Wadsworth of Orinda; sons John of Santa Ynez and Bill of San Diego and five  grandchildren.  </P> <P> The family requests that friends remember him with gifts to the Anza-Borrego  Desert Natural History Assn., Hal G. Evarts Memorial Library Fund, P.O. Box  311, Borrego Springs, CA 92004.  </P></p>

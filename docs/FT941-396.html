			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Norwich Union Norwich Union's move to retrain and prune its sales force is an especially radical version of action being taken elsewhere. Prudential's sales are suffering as its direct sales force is overhauled, Legal &amp; General is engaged in a similar process. That a blue-chip company like Norwich Union has been compelled to take such draconian steps hints at the true extent of the problem. Shedding 300 salesmen may have as much to do with economics as compliance, but the two issues are closely linked. It will prove far more difficult to sell life insurance contracts and personal pensions in great volume under a regulatory regime which demands commission disclosure and sound selling practice.</p>

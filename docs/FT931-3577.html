			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Spate of accidents at Hoechst leads to safety concerns ONE person died and another suffered third degree burns yesterday after an explosion and fire at Hoechst's main plant near Frankfurt. This is the sixth accident that Hoechst has suffered in less than a month - the first involving the loss of life - and it immediately prompted calls from regional and national politicians for tougher safety controls on the entire German chemicals sector. The explosion took place at 7.44 am when two men were preparing a section of plant used in manufacturing polyvinylalcohol, or Mowiol, for repair works. Hoechst said the cause of the accident was as yet unknown. The accident comes less than a month after Hoechst accidentally released 10 tonnes of chemicals - some potentially toxic - from its Griesheim plant. The chemicals descended on the Frankfurt suburb of Schwanheim. Although no-one was hurt, dozens of residents visited doctors after the leak and there was an expensive and high-profile clean-up campaign. Since the incident in late February, the company has been plagued with a series of accidents. Only last Friday, Hoechst inadvertently discharged 100 litres of a poisonous solution into the Rhine from a plant in Wiesbaden. Hoechst said yesterday it regretted the loss of life in the latest accident and would co-operate with investigations launched yesterday by the local police and legal officials from the state of Hesse. Mrs Ursula Tober, a Hoechst press officer, said that the company was saddened and bewildered by the series of accidents. 'We simply cannot explain it to ourselves why all this has happened all at once.' Mr Klaus Topfer, Germany's federal minister for the environment, yesterday vowed to intensify pressure on the chemicals industry to improve safety standards. Hoechst had already begun an examination of its safety and other procedures in the wake of the first accident last month. Troublesome brew, page 29</p>

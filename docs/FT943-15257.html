			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Israeli settlers yield to army Leaders of militant Jewish settlers yesterday agreed to a compromise aimed at averting a showdown with Israeli soldiers over protesters occupying flats in the West Bank. Their conciliatory move came soon after the government sent in hundreds of troops ready to evict the protesters with force. The Israeli government meanwhile ordered the Gaza Strip - now under Palestinian administration - to be sealed off from early today. The order, depriving thousands of Palestinian labourers entry into Israel for at least 24 hours, follows clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinians at a border checkpoint. Both moves came as Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, made further preparations for his permanent homecoming. He is due to attend a formal farewell ceremony in Tunis today. Faced with an imminent clash with troops, radical leaders of Jewish settlers promised to try to persuade protesters to move out today from the government-built flats they have been occupying since Friday near the Kiryat Arba Jewish settlement. But they said it would take all their powers of persuasion to influence the protesters, demonstrating against Israel's peace moves and the killing of a Jewish girl by an Arab gunman. The settlers, including women and children, have taken over vacant flats in a street peopled by Palestinians. The despatch of soldiers to the settlement raised the prospect of the first armed showdown with extremist Jewish settlers. If the troops force evictions, this would signal to Jewish settlers and the PLO that the government is prepared to take on settlers in a struggle which both sides say is a potential 'time-bomb' in the peace process. Mr David Libai, justice minister, said after a cabinet meeting yesterday that the 15 families who had occupied the buildings would have to leave or be forcibly removed. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said the settlers were a danger to democracy. Kiryat Arba settler leaders at first warned that any use of force could end in bloodshed. Later they agreed to talks with President Ezer Weizman to try to avert a clash. The Israelis said Gaza was being sealed off so that the army could re-organise procedures for Palestinians to cross into Israel at the Erez checkpoint. They said two Israeli officers and a soldier were injured when several thousand Palestinians trying to enter Israel stormed the checkpoint.</p>

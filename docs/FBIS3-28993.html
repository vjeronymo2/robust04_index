Japanese officials said Hata left Blair House shortly before  1 A.M. for his third encounter with Kantor since Thursday  morning.    "There is always room for mutual concessions," Hata told  reporters as he showed up at Kantor's office for the meeting.    The sticking point centers on a dispute over how to set  "objective criteria" to measure imports into Japan.    Japanese officials say the United States insists on  interpreting "objective criteria" as numerical yardsticks.    "Without objective criteria, we can't have a good  agreement,"  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was quoted as telling  Hata in a meeting Thursday evening.    Senior administration officials have warned that President  Clinton has made it clear he would rather have no agreement than  "a bad agreement" by papering over differences.    Officials from Japan and the United States have only until  11:30 A.M. to close an agreement. Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa is scheduled to meet with Clinton at that hour.</p>

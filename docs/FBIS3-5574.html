			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The following is an excerpt of His Majesty King  Norodom Sihanouk's statement [date not given] concerning the big  danger arising from the war between the Khmer Royal Armed Forces  [KRAF] and the forces of Democratic Kampuchea [DK]:    The war between the KRAF and the DK forces called the Khmer  Rouge has, from the beginning to the present day, brought  nothing good nor any profit to our nation and motherland. On  the contrary, it has brought about only destruction, rift,  suffering, hardship, misery, disgrace, and despair to our  Cambodia, our nation, and especially our poor and innocent  people.    In my capacity as the father of the nation and the Prince  Father of all Cambodians, male and female alike and from all  political parties and factions, I appeal to the Royal Government  on the one side and the PDK [Party of Democratic Kampuchea] and  DK national forces on the other to immediately and urgently  cease fire on all battlefields in the entire Cambodia. I appeal  to all of you to agree to reconcile fully without any  preconditions. I appeal to all children to build peace and live  peacefully together eternally now and in the future.    Peace in Cambodia is the life, the happiness, the  prosperity,  and the glory of our nation and motherland. War is the death of  our Cambodia and our race. The one and only way to settle all  the problems remaining between the Royal Government and the PDK  is through peaceful means. I appeal to the Royal Government and  the PDK to please bring full peace to our motherland, because  only with full peace will our motherland have the capability  (?to carry out reconstruction for) our people; and only when  this is achieved can our people live in peace, happily with  honor and freedom, and relieved from their misery and hardship.    [Dated] The General Hospital in Beijing, 8 March 1994</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Three draft laws -- on  the People's Bank of China, on auditing and on arbitration --  were submitted today to the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress for deliberation.    Qiao Shi, its chairman, presided over the opening ceremony  of  the eight-day session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee.    The Draft Law on the People's Bank of China (PBC) specifies  the authority and responsibilities of the PBC as the country's  central bank, to pave the way for China's current financial  reform, Zhou Zhengqing, a PBC deputy governor, said at the  meeting.    The draft auditing law is intended to maintain the soundness  of the government budget and protect the value of state  property, said the auditor-general, Guo Zhenqian.    The Draft Arbitration Law provides an arbitration system, in  line with international practice, to solve economic disputes  better and to promote the country's economic and trade  cooperation with other countries, said Gu Angran, director of  the Legislative Affairs Committee of the NPC Standing Committee.    A deputy director of the NPC Law Committee, Li Yining, also  submitted the revised version of the Draft Securities Law to the  legislators for further deliberation today.    There were 220 items in the current draft, 50 items more  than  in the previous one, Li said. The "major changes" were based on  the previous review by the lawmakers and opinion from relevant  government agencies, localities, legal and financial experts, he  said.    Three reports on the review results of the Draft Labor Law,  the Draft Law on Urban Real Estate and the Draft Regulation on  Punishing Copyright Violators were given to the meeting by Cai  Cheng, Xiang Chunyi and Wang Shuwen respectively, each a deputy  director of the NPC Law Committee.    The current Draft Labor Law puts more emphasis on protecting  the legal rights of workers, according to Cai.    The current Draft Regulation on Punishing Copyright  Violators  raises the maximum penalty for them from five years in prison to  seven years, Wang said.    Vice-Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu submitted a border treaty  with Laos to the legislature for approval.</p>

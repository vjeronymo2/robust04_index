			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bristol &amp; West equity bond Bristol &amp; West Building Society has launched a guaranteed equity bond, which offers investors the chance to match the rise in the FT-SE 100 index over three or five years, with a guaranteed base return. The minimum return over three years is 9 per cent gross, and 25 per cent gross over five years. The disadvantages are that the investor does not receive any income, and that any gain on the bond is subject to income, not capital gains tax.</p>

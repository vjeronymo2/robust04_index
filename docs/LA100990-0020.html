			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLEWATCH  </P> <P> Artwork Nets Nickels Galore: There is an art lover out there who thinks more of  a watercolor by Katharine Hepburn than the actress does herself.  </P> <P> Hepburn painted a scene of the Pacific Ocean in the 1960s while staying at John  Barrymore's house and donated it to the North American Wildlife Assn. for its  benefit auction Saturday night. When she gave the association the painting, she  said, "I do hope it will bring a price, although I wouldn't give you a nickel  for it." It brought a little more than that -- $5,000.

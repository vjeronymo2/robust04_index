Following arrangements made by an old  friend, Ting Chung-chiang [0002 0022 3068], he had a private  interview with General Hsu Li-nung on 27 November in which  Taiwan events were fully explored, including some  behind-the-scenes political activities.    Question: Your announcement that you were leaving the  Kuomintang to enter the New Party caused a stir both in Taiwan  and abroad. I would like for you to talk about the thought  process you used to make this decision.    This year marks my fifty-fourth year in the Kuomintang.  [passage omitted]. I was a follower of the director general  (meaning Chiang Kai-shek) and of Chairman Chiang (meaning Chiang  Ching-kuo). I took part in the War of Resistance to Japan,  resistance to Russia, and these campaigns in Taiwan. In all the  Kuomintang's travails, I gave my all without rancor or regret.  With such profound feelings, for me to leave all of a sudden was  naturally a very painful decision.    Why did I want to leave the Kuomintang? Because I could not  subscribe to citizen direct elections or anonymous entry into  the United Nations. The recent proposal for two Chinas, in  particular, was going too far. It ran counter to the precepts  that the Kuomintang party president [Dr. Sun Yat-sen], the party  director general [Chiang Kai-shek], and the party chairman, Mr.  Chiang Ching-kuo always upheld.    Talking about deterioration, he (meaning President Li  Teng-hui) has virtually become a follower of the Democratic  Progressive Party. He implements the Democratic Progressive  Party's policies. All of his important decisions echo the  Democratic Progressive Party. Take citizen direct elections. I  am not opposed to them, but I am opposed to direct citizen  elections at the present stage. If the president is elected by  20 million Taiwanese, is he the president of Taiwan or the  president of the Republic of China? Furthermore, if the  president is elected by an opposition party that does not  identify with the country, is he president of the Republic or  China, or president of the Republic of China in Taiwan? If the  president is elected by the Democratic Progressive Party, he  becomes the president of the Republic of Taiwan.    I had a talk with Mr. Li Teng-hui. Also present at the time  was former Examination Yuan president, Huang Tsun-ch'iu, and two  others. He said that "the reason some people are opposed to  direct citizen elections is they fear that a candidate from a  province other than Taiwan will never be elected president." The  other three said nothing, so I said, "So far as I know, no one  from any other province is thinking of becoming president at the  present time, and no person from another province can become  president. What worries me is that if you lose out to the  Democratic Progressive Party in an election, that will be the  end of the Republic of China."    He looked very displeased. Of course, many things I have  done  offended him, and this was one of them.    Why did he (meaning Li Teng-hui) speak so bluntly? My guess  is that he could not be idiotic enough to really believe what he  said. Since there were three other Taiwanese present at the  time, I assume he purposely stirred up provincial feelings to  pursue and consolidate his own political interests.    Citizen direct elections is the Democratic Progressive  Party's policy. I can speak with knowledge about this matter. Li  Yuan-ts'u, Chiang Yen-shih, and Sung Ch'u-yu did not know about  it at the time. It was announced on Friday; as of Wednesday, no  one knew about it. Early that day, a meeting was called to study  this problem. At the time I was a member of the Standing  Committee. I went to the meeting a little early. Li, Chiang, and  several others were already there. In the car I heard on the  radio that more and more high ranking people in the Central  Committee were for direct citizen elections. After arriving at  the meeting, I passed on to everyone what I had heard on the  radio. I asked, "What is the meaning of this? Chiang Yen-shih  said, "I heard it too," but Li Yuan-ts'u expressed great  surprise. This showed that this main player still did not know.    Question: What did you think about this?    Answer: I felt it was the Democratic Progressive Party's  idea. Mr. Lu, do you know that Chang Jung-fa has a fund? A  national policy study center is under this fund. [passage  omitted] The National Policy Center is run by Mr. T'ien Hung-mao  [3944 1738 5399]. The National Policy Center puts out a  bi-weekly magazine, which is the voice of Taiwan independence.    People say that at first this idea (meaning direct citizen  elections) was proposed by four people: Kao Ying-mao, T'ien  Hung-mao, Ch'eng Chung-mo, and Huang Shih-ch'eng. Later on,  someone gave me proof. I won't mention this person's name now.  He said that he had dined with T'ien Hung-mao and Ch'eng  Chung-mo, and that they said that committee member direct  elections would be soon changed.    Question: What other examples show that Mr. Li Teng-hui is  carrying out the policy of the Democratic Progressive Party?    Answer: Hsu Hsin-liang's remarks serve as an example too.  Once a media correspondent told Hsu Hsin-liang that the  Democratic Progressive Party is in cahoots with Li Teng-hui. Hsu  Hsin-liang said, "It is not the Democratic Progressive Party  that is in cahoots with Li Teng-hui, but Li Teng-hui who is in  cahoots with the Democratic Progressive Party." The Democratic  Progressive Party wants direct citizen elections, so Li Teng-hui  calls for direct citizen elections. The Democratic Progressive  Party wants Hao Po-ts'un to step down, so Li Teng-hui calls for  Hao Po-ts'un to step down. The Democratic Progressive Party  wants to get into the United Nations, so Li Teng-hui tries to  get into the United Nations. When it was in Hao's cabinet, the  Democratic Progressive Party wanted to enter the United Nations  anonymously, but Hao Po-ts'un flatly refused.    Question: Let us go back now to talk about what you are so  opposed to "two China's," all right?    Answer: All right! I'll talk first about how things will  end.  He is now proposing "two China's." Next, he will talk about "one  China and one Taiwan," and then it will be the "Republic of  Taiwan." What am I so strongly opposed to this? I remember  something that happened a year ago. When Kuomintang legislator  Ch'en Che-nan ran for election, he used "one China, one Taiwan"  as a political appeal. At that time, neither government agencies  nor the party headquarters said anything, but in the Central  Committee Standing Committee, we asked how a Kuomintang member  running for election could use "one China, one Taiwan" as an  appeal? President Li's answer was: Let us first define the  meaning of "one China." As a Chinese on the soil of the Republic  of China and in the Kuomintang headquarters, he still had doubts  about "one China." I connected these two things together. It  made me realize that this had been going on for a long time; it  positively was not sudden.    Chiang Ping-k'un says he proposed a "two Chinas" on the  basis  of Ministry of Foreign Affairs materials, but Ch'ien Fu says he  never saw them. Let me ask, just where did this "two China's"  come from?    I personally feel that as a Chinese Kuomintang member, I  should adhere to the precepts of the party president, the party  director general, and Chairman Chiang. If everything you do  today runs contrary to the abiding precepts, and I continue to  remain inside echoing what others say and going along with the  crowd, I am a traitor to the party and not upholding integrity  in my later years.    Today, some people say I am a traitor to the party. They say  that I do not uphold integrity in my later years. Chang  Hsiao-yen even criticized me saying "a loyal minister does not  serve two sovereigns, and a chaste woman does not serve two  husbands." I believe that the "sovereign" we are talking about  today is not an emperor but a concept. If I have one point of  view today for one master, and I adopt another point of view  tomorrow if the master changes, only then does the issue of  "serving two sovereigns" exist. It is because I want to maintain  integrity in my late years that I have now left the Kuomintang.  Chang Hsiao-yen's mentioning of loyal ministers and chaste women  is very ridiculous.    Question: Please discuss what will be the consequences if  the  Taipei authorities abandon "one China." One important reason why  the Chinese Communists had a positive view of old Mr. Chiang  was, as they said, "Mr. Chiang stood by one China. He displayed  ethnic righteousness."    Answer: In my view, abandonment of "one China" is to take  the  Taiwan independence road. Internally, people like me cannot sit  by and watch the demise of the Republic of China, and I am  certainly not the only one who has this attitude. Some people  cannot say so since they have not yet retired. When I was on the  Standing Committee and was one of the heads of a department or  committee, I held this attitude. I said, I am holding my badge  of office in my hand ready to put it aside at any time. Some  people cannot avoid having this or that apprehension, but when  they come to life or death, survival or demise of the Republic  of China, they can still step forward bravely.    Secondly, the Chinese Communists cannot sit by and look on  at  Taiwan independence. They have declared many times that if  Taiwan becomes independent, they will go to war. In the Central  Standing Committee, I analyzed this matter with Li Teng-hui. I  asked if Taiwan becomes independent, what alternatives might the  Chinese Communists take. First is going to war and what the  consequences might be. Second is not going to war, but  instituting a blockade and what might ensue. Third is announcing  a blockade, for example, announce a blockade in November to go  into effect on 1 March of the following year and see what  happens. When this happens, very likely foreign capital will  flee, and people having money will flee. At the time, Li  Teng-hui said that you are using the Chinese Communists to scare  the Taiwan public. The newspaper has printed his remarks. But I  absolutely was not scaring anybody.    I told them solemnly that Taiwan independence should cause a  serious catastrophe for Taiwan at once.    They said that every year we draw up such a large national  defense budget. We have three powerful military services. Why  should we fear the Communists? I said I admit that our three  services are strong, but if the Chinese armed forces invade can  we wipe them all out? What will happen to Taiwan? In warfare  nowadays -- like in Kuwait, for example -- when the American  army went into Kuwait, it lost seven men. This kind of warfare  is called "advance warfare," but it employs airplanes, missiles,  and all kinds of heavy weapons to disintegrate the enemy,  including the enemy's government, economy, and especially his  armed forces. When that happens, how many families will be  broken up and scattered, how many fathers and mothers will lose  their sons and daughters, and how many sons and daughters will  lose their fathers and mothers. Or how many widows and orphans  will be made? In other matters I may be a greenhorn, but I have  been a military many for many years. At least I am no greenhorn  about that.    Question: In view of present relations between both sides of  the Strait, if you were in charge, what do you think would be  the best course?    Answer: Given the present circumstances, the best course is  to adopt a positive attitude about promoting mainland reform,  realizing free, democratic, and equally wealthy unification at  the proper time. In advance of the Fourteenth Plenary Session,  the Kuomintang Central Committee invited a number of scholars,  and experts to discuss a political program draft with some  members of the Central Committee. I presented two ideas at this  meeting: One was to remove restrictions on non-political direct  shipping. Today, large amounts of exports from Taiwan reach the  mainland, but they are transshipped through a third location.  This increases the waste of manpower, material, and financial  resources. Second is to remove restrictions on mainland labor  coming to Taiwan. Restrictions have been removed on foreign  laborers, why not for our fellow countrymen? Mainland workers  have the same language, customs and habits, so why persist in  getting people who have a different language, customs, and  habits, rejecting what is close at hand while going after what  is far away?

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Arts: Faust in grand opera style - Records Gounod: Faust. Studer, Leech, Hampson, van Dam/Plasson/French Army Choir/chor. and orch. Capitole, Toulouse. EMI 7 54228 2 (3 CDs). Verdi orch. Berio. 8 Romances. Falla orch. Berio 7 Spanish Folksongs. English Chamber Orchestra/Berio. Philips 432 889-2. 'Rossini Heroines'. Bartoli/chor. and orch. Teatro la Fenice, Venice/Marin. Decca 436075-2. A COMPOSER of genius in limited fields, Gounod was a most unsatisfactory person - flawed in character as in much of his music, but not in the lyrical style and polished craftmanship in which he excelled. After a period of scorn and neglect his best music, or such of it as is nowadays performed, shows every sign of survival. Faust, his most popular work, whose prolonged and apparently unshakable success at the Paris Opera and elsewhere infuriated younger composers like Debussy and led Bernard Shaw to complain that 'the professional critic in London has to spend about ten years out of every twelve of his life listening to Faust' may never regain the position of almost everyone's favourite opera. But, seen now in a different light, it is back in the repertory. The new EMI recording made under Michel Plasson with the chorus and orchestra of the Capitole at Toulouse and an exciting cast, comfortably sums up and fills out the Faust we used to know rather than the one that has recently come out of wraps. Three young Americans of great talent sing Marguerite, Faust and Valentine. The ever-improving Cheryl Studer has the brilliance and agility (and the trill) for the jewel song as well as the strength to sail out in the final trio - the oboe-like timbre excludes over-sweetness. Richard Leech, recently admired as Raoul in Les Huguenots, even if he doesn't sound much like a philosopher old or young (few tenors do), sings the title-role with supple grace and an engaging candour. Thomas Hampson is Valentine, successfully conveying that the gallant soldier is also an unpleasant bigot. The Siebel of Martine Mahe and Dame Marthe of Nadine Denize could hardly be bettered. The dominating figure, and rightly so, is the Mephistopheles of Jose van Dam, filled with a kind of bitter grandeur, even contriving to suggest something of the missing serious background. Why, then, since the orchestral playing and ensemble work are very good, is there a slight tinge of disappointment? Gounod carved, not in marble, but in alabaster. Even so, the continuous smoothness and some rather ponderous tempi make for airlessness. This is a studio production - if the Corn Exchange at Toulouse may be called a 'studio'  - perhaps what one misses is the tension, with the risk of occasional untidiness, of live recordings. The feeling is partly due to the expected but unadventurous decision to use the established grand opera version with recitatives and not the original opera-comique Faust with spoken dialogues (Theatre Lyrique, 1859). As we know from the ENO staging this reduces the upholstery, lets in the air and works against Gounod's constant tendency to veer towards the grandiose. The issue is not cut-and-dried. In his valuable study The Operas of Charles Gounod, Steven Huebner of McGill University Montreal explains that Gounod would have liked both spoken and recitative versions of Faust and of Romeo et Juliette to co-exist, for opera companies to choose whichever suited them best. Oddly enough Huebner, who inclines towards the grand opera Faust, does not mention the ENO production. EMI score in completeness. Marguerite's spinning song is in, also what remains of the Walpurgisnacht. An appendix includes various things dropped by Gounod but worth having on record. The most interesting is the predecessor of Mephisto's 'Calf of gold', a sinister 'Scarab song' from the world of The Tales of Hoffmann. A tiny fragment for Siebel is surely worth restoring. It was a mistake to relegate the ballet music from the correct place in the limping Walpurgis scene to the appendix. The dances are enjoyable as well as typical examples of the style, and they are the only surviving evidence of the 'orgy of queens and courtesans' promised by Mephisto. Faust's feeble 'couplets bacchiques' are no compensation. A shame that Marguerite's mad scene in prison has not survived. If you prefer the church scene (excellently done by Studer and van Dam) after Valentine's death, you can play them in that order. It is musically insensitive to follow the church scene with the soldiers' chorus. That old favourite is rousingly sung by the presumably specially imported French Army Choir, without a trace of the lately fashionable alienation. A boy at school used to sing the tune to alternative words - 'My Aunt-ie swallered a penny bal-loon'. Unfortunately, except that 'the bloody thing bust', I can't remember the rest. Can any reader oblige? The Carreras single of eight romances by Verdi and Falla's Seven Spanish Folksongs in orchestral transcriptions by Luciano Berio show a degree of enterprise and discrimination rare in star tenors. The Verdi songs, dating from the ten years after 1835, are studded with hints of the early and middle-period operas including a phrase from Il Trovatore. Berio plays wittily, affectionately, sometimes violently with these references, adding instrumental links to bind the songs into a chain. An unexpected glance forward to Samson et Dalila allows him to pay a swift, graceful tribute to Saint-Saens. The Falla transcriptions are remarkable. Berio does not imitate the suggestive quality of Falla's masterly piano writing. He separates and heightens colours; they are stronger, but still restrained. I have never heard these songs sung by a man. They don't lie very well for a tenor voice. Carreras, musical and responsive as he is, has some difficulty with the soft, sustained lines of 'Nana', an unmasculine lullaby, and with the beautiful, mournful 'Asturiana'. Worth hearing all the same. As conductor Berio skilfully allows the instruments their head without covering the voice. The year Rossini 200 makes a blazing start with the mezzo Cecilia Bartoli's 'Rossini heroines', eight numbers taken from operas and a royal wedding cantata, written for Rossini's favourite singer and future wife, Isabella Colbran. All of them except the Venetian Semiramide come from his Neapolitan period. All bar one have chorus, three of them are rondo-finales of the Cenerentola type. Monotony is kept at bay by careful choice and contrast. The copper burnish on Bartoli's gleaming tone is perhaps too unvarying and she raps out all her flourishes in much the same semi-staccato. Yet how lucky we are to have at this juncture an artist who sings with such youthful vigour, warmth and confidence - and dead in tune.</p>

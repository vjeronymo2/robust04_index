			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Actuaries attack plan on pension solvency standards Government efforts to win employers' backing for pension reforms have been set back by the refusal of actuaries to endorse proposed minimum solvency standards for pension schemes. Members of the actuaries' professional body say the latest proposals are so weak that it would be better to have no minimum requirement at all. The government had hoped to give greater security to pension scheme members while not raising employers' costs significantly. Wide-ranging proposals, including a minimum solvency standard, were put forward by the Goode Committee, the government's advisory panel, in September last year. But in recent months there has been pressure from employers to water down an earlier minimum solvency proposal on the grounds that it would increase pension costs sharply. Actuaries, who assess the probability that pension funds will be able to meet their obligations, say that if the current proposals are enacted, they will lull scheme members into a false sense of security over whether promised pensions will be paid. 'This would defeat the purpose of what the solvency standard is trying to achieve,' said Mr Nigel O'Sullivan, partner at consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow. 'Minimum solvency would be illusory.' Following an acrimonious meeting last week of the pensions board of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, which sets professional standards, Mr Paul Thornton, its chairman, wrote to the Department of Social Security to express unhappiness with the proposals. Mr Thornton said in his letter that the profession would use the proposed standard only if ordered to do so by the government. He said yesterday that while the government proposal was considered by many to be too weak to really guarantee solvency, 'the political requirement is to deliver a solvency standard'. Some actuaries say the proposed minimum solvency standard would force them to issue a qualified opinion for every pension scheme they certified as solvent, a move akin to accountants qualifying corporate accounts. Specifically, schemes will be able to meet the solvency standard by applying their holdings in equities against their liabilities for pensioners who are expected to live at least 10 years. Schemes at present count only gilt holdings against liabilities to current pensioners because only these securities ensure certainty of income in the short run.

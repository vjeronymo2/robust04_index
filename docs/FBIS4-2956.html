			<p>BFN     [Text] When inspecting work in Baodi County on 29 March,  Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, pointed  out: We should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the  central rural work conference, further enhance the understanding  of the important position and role of the suburban-type  agriculture, stabilize the areas sown to grain, cotton, and  oil-bearing crops, increase their per-unit yields, achieve  success in the "vegetable basket" project, develop diverse  production and township enterprises, optimize the structure,  improve efficiency, develop the rural economy in all sectors,  and then ensure the efficient supply of farm and sideline  products and substantially increase peasants' income. The  present is the crucial period for spring farming. We should be  mobilized and seize the opportunity to combat drought to ensure  wheat field management and spring sowing, ensure that this  year's summer grain output is not lower than last year's, and  reap a bumper harvest in the whole year.    Gao Dezhan arrived in Baodi County without fanfare early in  the morning. He inspected the antidrought work and spring  plowing and conducted investigation and study on implementation  of the guidelines of the central rural work conference. He  first came to the wheat field along the Jinwei Highway in  Dakoutun Town to inspect how wheat seedlings were growing. Gao  Dezhan greeted Yang Zizhong, a peasant who was working,  cordially talked with them, asked him in detail about  irrigation, fertilizer application, and wheat field management,  and also asked whether he had difficulties. He said to the  rural cadres beside him: We should mobilize town, township, and  village cadres and every peasant household and adopt every  possible means to strengthen wheat field management, do a good  job in spring farming, and reap a good harvest of summer grain.  Gao Dezhan then visited the farmland in Xiliuzhuang Village of  Haohezhuang Township. He asked Wang Ruihai, secretary of the  township party committee, and Li Fa, secretary of the village  party branch, about rural work. He urged all townships to  attach importance to application of science and technology to  agricultural development, make agricultural scientific and  technical service organizations successful, and serve  agricultural production well. When he saw the newly planted  poplar trees along the roads, he said happily: Tree planting  not only can improve the natural environment and promote  agricultural development but also is a way to achieve affluence.  We should mobilize the masses to plant trees, green and enliven  the land, and make the masses prosper. When inspecting spring  plowing in Chenjiaan Village of Shiqiao Township, Gao Dezhan  said to rural cadres: You have worked hard at the grass-roots  levels. It is hoped that you will do a better job in the mass  work and promote agricultural production and rural economy.  Please convey my regards to the people. Gao Dezhan also came  to the Huanqiu Enterprise Group, Haitai Industrial Co. Ltd., and  Meizhong Wood Product Co. Ltd. to inspect their production,  management, and construction.    After this, Gao Dezhan listened to the work reports of the  Baodi County party committee and government and held a  discussion. Gao Deshan said: The Baodi County party committee  and government have paid close attention to their work, and  their work ideas are also very good. It is hoped that they will  do a still better job and open up a new situation in rural work.  The central authorities have held the rural work conference.  We should make earnest efforts to do practical work and rapidly  implement the guidelines of the conference to the letter. He  emphasized: Districts and counties engaged in agriculture  should mobilize the people, seize the opportunity, race against  time, and combat drought to ensure wheat field management and  spring plowing in the right season. This is a task of prime  importance in the current rural work. We should exert great  efforts to stabilize the areas sown to grain, cotton, and  oil-bearing crops and increase their per-unit yields, pay  attention to the key links, and adopt comprehensive measures to  win a bumper harvest in summer grain. The summer grain output  and the whole year's production of this year should not be lower  than last year's. To carry out the "vegetable basket" project  and develop forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production,  fisheries, and township enterprises, we should take the road of  optimizing the structure and improving efficiency. In short, we  should ensure the efficient supplies of farm and sideline  products and substantially increase peasants' income.    Speaking on how to mobilize people to successfully carry out  current agricultural production and rural work, Gao Dezhan  pointed out: Rural cadres at all levels should be mobilized  first. They should enhance the sense of urgency and  responsibility toward spring plowing and wheat field management,  strengthen ideological and political work as well as  organization work, invest more labor forces and money, and carry  out meticulous management to make up for the unfavorable  conditions we encountered in winter and ensure the stable  increase of summer grain. We should also mobilize the entire  society. All relevant departments and cadres at all levels  should make spring plowing a success in order to reap a bumper  summer grain harvest, go deep into rural areas and grass-roots  levels, do practical work, give the green light, and provide  good service. All trades and professions in Tianjin should  support agriculture, the antidrought work, and spring farming  and truly resolve difficulties and problems for the endeavors to  combat drought and ensure wheat production and spring plowing.    Gao Dezhan emphasized: We should further enhance the  understanding of the important position and role of Tianjin's  suburban-type agriculture. We should truly understand that  agriculture is the foundation for the national economy and for  reform, development, and stability. Greater importance should  be attached to the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing  crops when developing the suburban-type agriculture. We should  also understand that achieving success in the production for the  vegetable basket is a task of prime importance in developing  Tianjin's suburban-type agriculture. We should develop the  high-yielding, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture on  the premise that the production of grain, cotton, and  oil-bearing crops is stabilized. We should coordinate the  development of township enterprises and diverse production with  the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops. The  characteristics of Tianjin's suburban-type agriculture should be  reflected in the high level of development, high science and  technology content, high per-unit yields, and high economic  efficiency. Supporting and developing agriculture with  industry, we should continuously increase agricultural  investment, strive for high efficiency in industry and high  output in agriculture, continuously increase peasants' income,  and develop the rural economy in all sectors.</p>

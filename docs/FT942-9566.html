			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Negotiating the soft way - Computing Negotiating is a task we do every day. What do you offer children to make them behave? What extra service can you offer to win the multi-million pound contract for your company? Negotiating is a way of life, but few of us have had the formal training to hone our skills. Without training and planning the outcome depends as much on the respective personalities of the negotiators as it does on the items under discussion. There is a way around this in two computer programs I have seen recently. The Art of Negotiating runs under MS-Dos and has been available for several years in the US. It is based on Gerard Nierenberg's book of the same name. Nierenberg suggested that the only successful deal is the one where everybody wins. Accompanying the software is his second book, The Complete Negotiator. The program is easy to use. It takes you through personality profiling of yourself and the opposing negotiator. This is followed by trying to express your requirements from your opponent's point of view. The more aware you are of the opponent's position the more you can develop a creative and effective solution. Negotiator Pro is a more recent program. It runs under Windows. It is a lot more detailed than The Art of Negotiation. There are three main parts to the program; again the personality profiling based on Jung's four principles (intro- vert / extrovert / neurotic / stable), the plan, and the glossary. The plan comprises a choice of 10 or 35 questions depending on how deeply you want to analyse the situation. You can diagnose the opportunities and obstacles. The glossary is extensive. It has the equivalent information of a reasonable-sized book but is more accessible: it is in the form of Windows help screens. These include some excellent profiles of negotiating styles tied to nationality. Though they can be little more than cursory, they do help when dealing with people of different cultural backgrounds. The program is an import from the US. I was interested in what it said about the English. Under 'Cultural mannerisms and body language' it said: 'The English have refined body language and expressions that indicate if they are ill-disposed to a position. This includes a slight cocking of the head with a narrowing of the eyes. According to Luigi Barzini in The Europeans, the English are supremely imperturbable. They are convinced of their superiority and that of their nation. They believe excitability is a sign of mental instability.' There are also a number of sample files to help you get started. I began with the one on negotiating a deal on a new car, and continued with the sample of getting a better position in the company. Negotiator Pro provides a catalyst for you to focus your thinking. It brings the issues together and prevents issues getting lost. You can create your own database of personality profiles and past plans. The traditional market for these programs is the sales and purchasing departments of large companies, lawyers and barristers - but they can be used by anyone. Which is the better software? The Art of Negotiating is more focused; it makes you more aware of the strategies likely to be used by the opposition. Negotiator Pro, on the other hand, allows you to develop your plan more fully. The Art of Negotiating software is Pounds 125, plus VAT Negotiator Pro is Pounds 265, plus VAT. Both are available from CABC: 0635-255300 Fax: 0635-255148</p>

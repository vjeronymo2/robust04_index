			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Machine tools measure up A control system taking into account factors influencing machine tool performance to achieve optimum cutting conditions has been developed by Omat of Jerusalem, Anna Kochan reports. Tests with prototypes show savings of up to 40 per cent can be achieved on machining times and costs, with tool breakage almost eliminated. Designed to work with any type of numerical controller, the Opti-Mil system for milling applications includes software that determines the best cutting conditions from data about the machine, its operational cost, the cutting tool and its material cost, tool changeover time and machine tool depreciation. Sensors measure the load on the tool and modify the speed and rate of work. Omat will develop systems for turning and drilling, as well as for wood and plastics. Omat: Israel, 9722 438111.</p>

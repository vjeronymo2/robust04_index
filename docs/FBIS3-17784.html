"Despite everything, Russia condemns the Molotov-Ribbentrop  pact and the Stalinist oppression," Kozyrev said in the  interview.    The Russian foreign minister met today with the Conference  on  Security and Cooperation in Europe High Commissioner for  National Minorities Max van der Stoel to discuss the problems of  ethnic minorities in Estonia and Latvia.    Stoel voiced the opinion that there are many problems in the  framework of the ethnic issue which are waiting to be solved.  "On the one hand, the preservation of those states' national  character needs to be safeguarded; on the other, the future of  the Russians living there must be secured on an equal footing,"  the CSCE high commissioner maintained.    Speaking about the alleged human rights violations in  Estonia  and Latvia, Stoel admitted that "neither torturing nor  deportation of members of ethnic minorities occurs there."    Yet, he said, both countries have serious problems  pertaining  to the legal status of the Russian-speaking population. "I  drafted numerous recommendations to remedy the matter and I hope  they will be accepted," Stoel said.    Kozyrev said Russia expects the Baltic Sea countries to  establish the post of a regional national minorities  commissioner.    The Russian foreign minister said that the troop withdrawal  negotiations with Estonia and Latvia have reached the final  stage. All issues, including that of social protection for  Russian military pensioners, have been resolved, he claimed.  "The package of agreements will be signed after discussion in  the Estonian and the Latvian parliaments and approval by those  countries' heads of state," was Kozyrev's opinion.    Kozyrev emphasized that Russia managed to coordinate the  troop withdrawal with Lithuania and Latvia "in a civilized  manner, on a contractual basis." The signing of a similar  agreement with Estonia now depends on that Baltic nation, he  said. In Kozyrev's view, this will help "Russia's friends in  the West" to focus attention on the protection of human rights  in Estonia and Latvia.    Russia withdrew its troops from Lithuania by September 1993.  To date, also a troop pullout agreement with Latvia has been  initialed. The problem of the status of Russian military  pensioners remains the stumbling-block at the Estonian-Russian  talks.</p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Halkin sells brewery to management Halkin Holdings, the branded products group headed by Mr Howard Hodgson, the former funerals entrepreneur, is selling T Hoskins, its brewery operation, to its management. The business, described by Mr Hodgson as 'non-core' is being sold for about Pounds 1.7m  - Pounds 500,000 above book value  - to Tom Hoskins Brewery, a company formed by existing management with the backing of a group of private investors. The deal, conditional on shareholders' approval, comprises Pounds 1.21m cash, payable on completion; Halkin will also subscribe for 500,000 50p convertible preference shares in Tom Hoskins at a premium of 50p. Mr Hodgson said the disposal should have a minimal impact on the group's trading performance. 'I intend to recommend a dividend in respect of the full year,' he added.</p>

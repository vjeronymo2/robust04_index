			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: VME back in the black with Dollars 30m VME Group, the Brussels-based construction equipment producer, came back into the black last year with net income of Dollars 30m, compared with a net loss of Dollars 93.6m in 1992. The company, jointly owned by Volvo of Sweden and Clark Equipment of the US, said the turnround reflected a group-wide restructuring programme, together with the effects of the floating of the Swedish krone. Net income last year included Dollars 9.3m of gains from accounting changes relating to tax and pension benefits, while 1992 included a restructuring charge of Dollars 18.7m. The recovery came in spite of a 9 per cent decline in sales from Dollars 1.36bn in 1992 to Dollars 1.23bn last year. VME said demand for construction equipment remained weak in most European countries, but there were signs of recovery in the UK. The important German market declined significantly from its exceptionally strong performance in 1992. Markets in North America, Latin America and the Far East, excluding Japan, also showed signs of recovery. Clark Equipment this week reported fourth-quarter net profits of Dollars 18.4m, or Dollars 1.06 a share, against a loss of Dollars 2.78m, or 16 cents, a year earlier.</p>

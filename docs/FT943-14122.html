			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Pensions (25): Family affairs - The choice for small businesses / Flexibility, cost and the nature of your firm will be the deciding factors, but advice is needed Small businesses have several pension options, and the final choice will depend on the required level of investment control, flexibility and cost. Independent advice on a fee basis is essential for this market. Small self-administered schemes The most popular pension arrangement for family businesses is the small self-administered scheme (SSAS). These are classed as occupational pension schemes, and are extremely tax-efficient but can be expensive to run. Membership, which is restricted to a maximum of 12, tends to be limited to directors of the company. The trustees are chosen by the directors, but the scheme also has to appoint a 'pensioner' trustee, approved by the Inland Revenue, to provide advice on technical aspects and to ensure that, if the scheme is wound up, the process meets with the Revenue's approval. SSASs offer members a maximum pension of two-thirds of final salary (restricted for some higher earners), which is secured through the purchase of an annuity at retirement. The purchase can be made at any time up to age 75. There is also a substantial tax-free cash lump sum at retirement, death-in-service and death-in-retirement benefits. Spouse and dependants' benefits are automatically included. Permitted investments include quoted stocks and shares, pooled investments such as unit and investment trusts, cash funds, and commercial property. Property is of particular interest to small companies, many of which use their SSAS fund to purchase new business premises. However, this must be done on an arms-length basis and a commercial rent must be charged. The fund can be used to provide a loan to the company, again on arms-length terms, and to purchase shares in the company. SSAS funds normally are exempt from Department of Social Security rules that restrict self-investment to 5 per cent. Although employees can pay up to 15 per cent of salary into the scheme, most SSASs are funded purely by company contributions, since this reduces the overall National Insurance bill. These contributions are tax-deductible and, since they are based on the projected final salary at retirement, they are virtually unlimited, although restrictions may apply in future. Under Revenue rules, you can run only one SSAS at a time, which makes the choice of provider extremely important. There are two main options: fully self-administered, and 'hybrid' schemes. The former allow the administration and investment to be run separately, whereas the two functions are combined under a hybrid. Hybrid providers - the life offices - require a minimum investment of about Pounds 5,000 a year in their own funds, although contributions in excess of this can be invested by the client or his stockbroker. As a rule of thumb, the hybrid SSAS, which charges on a percentage basis, is thought to be more cost-effective for annual premiums of less than Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 12,000. Where contributions exceed this amount, the flat-rate fees charged on the fully self-administered SSAS start to look attractive. Advisers may also recommend executive pension plans (EPPs). These are similar to SSASs, but the entire fund is run by the life office, and on retirement the annuity has to be purchased immediately. Also, from September this year, the Inland Revenue will impose restrictions on the maximum contributions that can be paid into an EPP. Personal pension options If you are interested in a simpler and cheaper alternative to the SSAS, it is worth considering a group personal pension (GPP) or self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs). GPPs are a collection of individual personal pensions. Maximum annual employee and employer contributions are limited to 17.5 per cent of earnings (more for employees over 35) and the proceeds are used to buy an annuity at retirement, which can be at any time between age 50 and 75. Normally, under the providers' contract conditions, the annuity has to be purchased immediately the selected retirement age is reached, although the recent White Paper on pension reform indicated that there would be greater flexibility for annuities from April 1997. Most providers combine the administration and investment functions, and insist that contributions are invested in their own funds. Self-invested personal pensions allow you to manage your own investments. They can be used by individuals, groups of employees and Schedule-D taxpayers such as partnerships. The main attraction of the SIPP is its ability to unbundle the investment and administration, to provide a clearer charging structure and greater investment flexibility. With an SIPP, you can either run the investment portfolio yourself or appoint your own stockbroker. This makes it possible to change the investment manager while leaving the underlying administration and legal structure in place - an option not possible under most conventional personal pensions. SIPPs follow the basic contribution and benefit rules for personal pensions and, as with all plans, there is a monetary cap on the total earnings to which contributions relate. This is Pounds 76,800 for the 1994-95 tax year. SIPP funds can invest in UK and overseas stocks and shares, unit trusts and investment trusts, insurance company managed funds and unit-linked funds, deposit accounts and commercial property. The last includes new offices for the business, provided the property is leased back on a commercial basis. It is possible for the SIPP to borrow on the strength of the pension fund to help with property purchase. SIPPs are normally run on an individual basis, but if the funds are grouped together it can result in greater investment scope and economies of scale. Inevitably the SIPP v SSAS argument comes down to a matter of horses for courses. Andrew Hague, manager of the SSAS department at consulting actuaries Barnett Waddingham, said: 'At present, we believe SSASs offer greater flexibility, particularly on the investment scope, the higher contribution rates and the timing of the annuity purchase.' But John Moret, pensions manager at Provident Life, said that SIPPs had other attractions: 'SIPPs offer greater simplicity, lower costs and, probably most important of all, individual hands-on control of the fund. In addition, while there are contribution limits on SIPPs, there are no limits on benefits, as is the case with SSASs.'</p>

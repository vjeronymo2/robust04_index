			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Japan's unemployment rate in  April stood at a seasonally adjusted 2.8 percent, down 0.1  percentage point from March, the Management and Coordination  Agency said Tuesday [31 May].    An agency official, however, remained cautious in predicting  whether the situation will show a clear pickup sign in the near  future.    Since the collapse of the so-called "bubble" economy in the  late 1980s, the employment situation has steadily deteriorated.    In a separate report, the Labor Ministry said the ratio of  job offers to seekers in April was unchanged from March's  seasonally adjusted 0.66.    That means there were only 66 jobs offered for every 100 job  seekers in the month. The ratio, an indicator of labor demand,  has hovered between 0.65 and 0.69 for the past eight months, a  ministry official noted.    In April, job offers dropped a seasonally adjusted 0.6  percent from the previous month, while the number of job seekers  increased 0.5 percent.    Job offers increased 1.3 percent in the construction  industry  from a year earlier, but declined in other sectors. Job offers  in the manufacturing sector showed a 21.6 percent fall as a  whole.    The number of unemployed people totaled 1.94 million in  April, up 23.6 percent from a year earlier but better than the  2.08 million people reported in March.    By industry, the number of jobholders in the construction  industry rose 3.2 percent from a year earlier, but those in  manufacturing sectors fell 1.1 percent, marking the sixth  straight month of declines since last November.    The Management and Coordination Agency, meanwhile, reported  the economic slump pushed the numbers of unemployed new college  graduates up to their highest level for the month -- 150,000 --  since the survey was begun in 1984.    Though the figure of 240,000 for March was the highest  monthly figure recorded in the history of the survey, the agency  said the April figures are a more reliable indicator since many  graduates undergo a transition in March.    Comparing the April figures for each year, the agency said  the number of unemployed college graduates had peaked at 130,000  in 1986 before gradually declining to 60,000 in 1991.    It added that the number of students who were finishing  school in March and were still without prospective jobs as of  February, reached 1.06 million this year, 110,000 less than the  number a year earlier.    Jobs for male graduates were down by 40,000, while those for  female counterparts were cut by 60,000, the agency also said.  Jobs for female graduates of four-year colleges or postgraduate  education were particularly down this year, it added.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 10 (AFP)--China's paramount leader  Deng Xiaoping, who turns 90 in August, is "in good health," a  foreign ministry spokesman said Friday.    Rumors running through the Hong Kong stock market Friday  said  the patriarch had died or was critically ill, sparking a  2.37-percent drop in stock prices on strong selling in the  morning session to 8,972.59 points -- its lowest level in a  month.    The market recovered to a provisional 9,108.61 points at the  close of trading Friday.    Deng has not been seen in public since February when he was  shown on television during the Chinese New Year accompanied by  two of his daughters. Since then, rumors about his health have  persisted and are consistently denied by the government and his  entourage.    On Wednesday, his daughter Deng Rong said her father "is not  suffering any illness and is in good health."</p>

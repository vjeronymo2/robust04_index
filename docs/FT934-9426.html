			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (16): The men who would be president - A look at the strengths and weaknesses of the likely foursome awaiting the final word from President Carlos Salinas IN THE next two months Mexico's ruling party will unveil the candidate to succeed President Carlos Salinas. The chosen man will, in all likelihood, win next August's presidential election. If the past is any guide, he will rule Mexico with unfettered power for the next six years. While the decision is nominally that of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Mr Salinas is expected to anoint his own successor, just as all his predecessors have done. The PRI will then formally nominate the chosen candidate. So far President Salinas has allowed three candidates to emerge as front-runners; Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the social development minister, and the favourite; Mr Manuel Camacho, the mayor of Mexico City; Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister. Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the education minister, a fourth candidate, is considered the dark horse, but with an outside chance. The candidates share much in common: they are all in their 40s, were educated at US graduate schools in economics or public administration, worked under Mr Salinas in the budget ministry in the mid-1980s, and played an important part in the reforms of the past five years. Whoever wins is likely to appoint a cabinet reasonably similar to the present one. On the economic front, all candidates will offer some continuity with the Salinas policies. As Manuel Camacho, perhaps the candidate least identified with Mr Salinas's economic reforms, says: 'The economic changes are here to stay. No-one would overturn them.' Since candidates publicly support everything the president does, no-one can be sure how they will behave if elected to the top office - and in the past most predictions of presidential performance have been far from accurate. Nevertheless supporters of each candidate have been busy defining the differences between their boss and the rivals, in an effort to sway political opinion behind their preferred choice. Mr Aspe is seen alternatively as a powerful advocate of economic reform with an ability to make tough decisions, and as politically inexperienced and out of touch with Mexico. Mr Camacho is viewed by supporters as the candidate of democracy, the man who can bring legitimacy to the political system, and by rivals as a dangerous populist with no experience in economic administration. Mr Colosio is the self-styled candidate of continuity and decentralisation. But opponents question his achievements to date, and ask if he is clever enough to run the country. The public defining of candidates is considered important, because each has to be seen to be credible before becoming eligible for the presidency. He has to enjoy some support within the PRI or political classes - especially after 1987, when the ruling party split over Mr Salinas's candidacy. The views of the business and labour sectors, foreign investors and the US, even perhaps the army, have to be taken into account. More so than in the past, the candidate's public appeal needs to be considered. A convincing, legitimate victory next August would help erase the memory of 1988's fraud-tainted result, and give Mexico's political system some much needed legitimacy. However, the final word in the past has been the president's. His power is such that he can always rescue a candidate who is in trouble, by praising him in public, inviting him on a trip, or, as happened to Mr Camacho recently, to lunch in a public canteen. Conversely, a candidate that falls out of presidential favour, often finds himself losing support with one group or another, and being considered unsuitable. Even a candidate with little rapport with the public would still be favoured to win next August's election. After 64 continuous years in power, the PRI enjoys huge advantages relative to other parties in terms of resources and control over the media. The president of the PRI has said that the nomination will be made in January, but Mr Salinas may not be able to wait that long. The uncertainty is already driving many members of the government frantic, and the in-fighting between rivals is hurting the administration. There are widely assumed to be three possible scenarios for the date. The most likely is between November 17, the date of the vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement, and December 12, when President Salinas goes off on a 10-day trip to Asia. It is thought unlikely the president would leave the country for 10 days without having cleared uncertainties over the succession. The losing candidates could be invited with the president on the Asian visit, keeping them from stirring up trouble. The president could decide to choose the candidate before the vote on Nafta, although this is considered unlikely. While this would have the attraction of reducing uncertainty associated with the Nafta vote, an unveiling before Nafta would take power from the president when he may need it most. Finally, the president could stick to the original programme, and wait until after his Asian visit, or even after the New Year. This would break with past practice of selecting a candidate at least nine months before the election. Pedro Aspe Mr Aspe's claims lie in the economic realm largely because as finance minister he is given credit for economic stability, and Mexico's return to favour in international capital markets. He is likely to be supported by businessmen, foreign investors, some old-style politicians in the PRI that approve of his strong hand in implementing policies, and members of the centre-right Party of National Action estranged from their candidate. As president, Mr Aspe is expected to press ahead with structural economic reform. Colleagues say he would be likely to overhaul the social security system, change labour laws to make them more flexible, and instigate a thorough shake-up of the legal system. The Salinas-inspired reforms in education, agriculture and commercial de-regulation would be deepened. His supporters say he would guarantee macro-economic stability and offer the most attractive economic environment for foreign investors. Says a colleague of the finance minister: 'Mexico will need a huge amount of foreign resources to grow by 5-6 per cent a year - around Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn a year . . . We will only get that with a 100 per cent record in macroeconomic performance . . . We cannot deviate one single inch from macroeconomic orthodoxy - if we (deviate) the money will not be there.' Mr Aspe in recent speeches has been emphasising the social aspects of economic reform. His newly published book, Economic transformation: the Mexican Way, makes the case over and over again that economic liberalisation releases money for anti-poverty programmes, and increases opportunities for people from all backgrounds. Mr Aspe's perceived weakness is lack of political experience, a certain patrician air borne from his aristocratic background, and identification for austere economic policies that have left many Mexicans worse off. He is seen by some as too pro-American, too unwilling to make concessions to politically important interest groups. He is not personally close to Mr Salinas's circle of friends, who may not fully trust him. In a difficult economic situation this could spell trouble. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is likely to focus the electoral campaign around the costs of economic stabilisation, the concentration of wealth under the Salinas administration, and the sacrifice of sovereignty in the process of negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. As the architect of economic policy, Mr Aspe is identified with all these policies. Manuel Camacho Mr Camacho, the son of an army general, an old university friend of Mr Salinas, and former political science professor, is at the other end of the spectrum. He has a keen sense of Mexico's national identity, as mayor of Mexico City is not associated with Nafta, and has good relations with the Mexican left. He would try to strike some kind of pact with Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the candidate of the left, that could ensure a fair and transparent election. Mr Camacho clearly sees this as the issue of the day. He stresses that 'legitimacy is something very important in the consolidation of our changes'. He is widely reported to have pushed for more far-reaching political reforms than those passed by the PRI, in the hope of winning approval for them from Mr Cardenas. He says recent moves to censor Mr Cardenas from radio stations 'were political errors' and that it is essential the elections next year are peaceful and calm. But even his own team is nervous over how financial markets would react to his candidacy. His economic policy would look after those who have not done so well under the Salinas presidency. He refers to an 'industrial and agricultural policy that would protect employment'. He is said to find economics boring. Mr Camacho also has important enemies. He is not close to Mr Jose Cordoba, the president's powerful chief of staff, to the old-style politicians who distrust his conciliatory approach to the opposition, nor to the technocrats in the finance ministry, and other government departments. Mr Camacho's colleagues are aware of these weaknesses. They talk about an (improbable) alliance with Mr Aspe - just as some in the Aspe team talk about an alliance with Mr Camacho. They say that an independent central bank, and Nafta, make his economic inexperience less important. They go to great pains to stress aspects of his economic record while mayor of Mexico City - Mr Camacho has balanced the budget, privatised urban services such as water, and presided over a property surge. Mr Camacho himself says: 'Investors will come to a country with peace and tranquility' and with a 'policy of national development'. In his view economic and political reforms of the Salinas presidency will make the job of governing Mexico much more difficult in the future. 'Politics in Mexico is going to demand more abilities and democratic skills,' he says, hinting that he is the person to manage such a process. Luis Donaldo Colosio Mr Colosio is seen as offering a bit of Mr Camacho and Mr Aspe, and perhaps for this reason is viewed as the favourite. While his friendship with Mr Salinas is relatively new, he is believed to be totally loyal to the president. He is the only candidate to have held elective office, as a deputy and then senator. As head of the PRI for three years, it is assumed he would carry the party without difficulty. His two years in the social development ministry, which runs the president's anti-poverty programme, Solidarity, has given him an opportunity to travel around the country, and enabled him to build up friends and allies. Mr Colosio talks about the need for greater decentralisation in Mexico, and giving more power to the states. He says municipalities have to modernise their source of income, and points out that property tax is just 0.002 per cent of GDP, 'which has to be raised'. He believes that reforms of the past 10 years have to be continued at a state level, with each state pursuing deregulation in the way the federal government has. The theme of regionalisation goes down well with Mexico's governors and local politicians, and is consistent with Mr Colosio's roots. He only arrived in Mexico City from a cattle ranch in Magdelena, Sonora, in his mid-20s (after passing through the University of Pennsylvania and Vienna, Austria), and so his view of Mexico may not quite as fixed on the capital as are the viewpoints of the other candidates. Mr Colosio's team says he would 'guarantee absolute continuity' in economic reforms. He would delegate to cabinet colleagues such as Jaime Serra Puche, the trade minister, and Mr Zedillo. He is expected to protect Mr Cordoba. He has good relations with influential businessmen who have done well during the Salinas presidency. Mr Colosio says economic orthodoxy is vital. 'In the decade of the 1990s there will be a great competition for capital. We cannot forget that.' He adds: 'You have to know what are Mexico's advantages to investors . . . You cannot have a man on the side managing the economy.' But rivals say his views are vague, his accomplishments as minister unimpressive, and they do not regard him as articulate or intellectually able. They say he hardly ever speaks in economic cabinet, and conclude he has no opinions worth mentioning. While Mr Camacho and Mr Aspe have published articles on Mexico's economic or political situation, Mr Colosio has never written anything memorable. 'Mr Colosio may be smart, but it is a huge mystery what he believes in,' says one government minister. 'Isn't it worrying that he has no enemies? At his level you should be taking difficult decisions that cost you support.' His main enemies are in Mr Cardenas's party, who suspect him of hard-line political instincts, and of having opposed more fundamental political reforms. The Colosio supporters flatly deny this. They said their candidate was not involved in negotiations over political reform, and would favour an electoral pact with Mr Cardenas in the right circumstances, and television debates. They say their candidate would promote further reform of the PRI were he president. Ernesto Zedillo Mr Zedillo's chances are considered low, but he has the right economic credentials for the job, and presumed support of Mr Cordoba. A former central banker, with an economics PhD from Yale, he is seen as dry and cautious. Last year's storm over new history textbooks revealed his political inexperience, and perhaps more importantly, a lack of friends to come to his rescue. The books were widely criticised for being overly partial to Mr Salinas and betraying the spirit of Mexico's revolution, and finally had to be withdrawn. The final choice of candidate will depend in part on what Mr Salinas believes are Mexico's most urgent problems. Mr Aspe could be favoured if further economic reform and macroeconomic stability were considered essential; Mr Camacho, if a legitimate and convincing electoral defeat of the left and further democratic reforms were deemed necessary; Mr Colosio, if, as many believe, the president is looking for personal loyalty, pragmatism and continuity with present policies of steady economic reform and cautious political changes. The vote on Nafta could affect the decision, but in no obvious way. On the one hand, Nafta's rejection makes a candidate's economic abilities more important, since future economic policy is no longer guaranteed by the treaty. On the other hand Nafta's rejection would make the economic situation difficult, the electoral campaign closer, and put a premium on a candidate with good political skills. Mr Salinas could still spring a surprise, and name one of the dark horses, or throw up the selection to the PRI. Some members of the PRI might even refuse to support the chosen candidate. But the overwhelming likelihood is that the party will rally around the chosen candidate, who will bring into his fold some of the erstwhile rivals.</p>

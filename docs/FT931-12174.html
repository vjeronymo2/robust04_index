			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): London puts optimism on hold ALTHOUGH ECONOMIC recession still hung over the Christmas festivities, equity market indices stood at record levels on New Year's Eve, with UK stocks having outperformed against both the rest of Europe and the rest of the world. Share prices rose sharply in significantly increased trading volume as fund managers took in the full implications of sterling's somewhat hasty departure from the ERM network in mid-September. By the end of the year, the pound had been devalued by nearly 5 per cent on the sterling exchange rate index, offering a powerful boost to export sales prospects. In November, the autumn economic statement from Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, put some teeth into the government's stated policy of re-stimulating economic growth. Domestic interest rates were cut by one point to 7 per cent, and there were measures to help car sales and the battered homebuilding sector. Investors responded readily, setting aside doubts about sterling's prospects outside the ERM or, indeed, the wider question of whether either the UK or other leading world economies could be rescued from recession so easily. All equity sectors showed positive returns over the final quarter, noted NatWest Securities - even the badly-battered building sectors, which brushed aside their setbacks in the previous quarter. Investors hastened to switch portfolios into the cyclical stocks likely to lead the way into recovery (motors, hotels and leisure, and food manufacturers), and out of the defensive stocks into which they had flocked in the third quarter (pharmaceuticals, utilities, and selected financials). Faith in a consumer-led recovery revived, and store and other retail issues began to anticipate a good Christmas trade. Even the sorely-hurt property sector turned in a return of 19.3 per cent, against minus 12.9 in the preceding three months. Investors in the UK market also took a benign view of developments elsewhere. Signs of recovery in the US economy were eagerly received in London. From their new position outside the ERM, UK investors saw pressures on other member currencies - in particular, the French franc  - as a further indication that Britain had merely anticipated moves to lower interest rates across Europe. By the year-end, London was convinced that a cut in German rates was not far away. A final flourish of optimism in December took market indices to new peaks, leaving the FT-SE All-Share Index with a total return of 14 per cent on the quarter. This outstripped the 12.7 per cent return on the narrower FT-SE 100 Share Index, as investors moved towards the second-tier issues where potential gains are greater when the economy recovers. The move towards smaller stocks remained a feature as the market moved into the new year, when the FT-SE Mid 250 Index reached new peaks, although the FT-SE 100 was slipping back. These trends must be measured against a substantial increase in retail trading in equities - retail business is the genuine outside customer interest. Retail business averaged more than Pounds 1bn daily during the final quarter, indicating a return to profitable trading levels for the London securities industry as well as a convincing level of investment in equities. Confidence remained high as the final quarter of 1992 passed into history, although many strategists warned that the market had run too far in December, and that equity valuations of around 17 times historic earnings were probably too high. In the short term, equities can expect a further one-point cut in UK base rates, but this will probably be the last rate cut in this cycle. Economic recovery could still prove elusive, and inflation the more likely reality. Equities face pressure both from government funding and from looming rights issues. And there are already fears that Mr Lamont's budget, due in March, may bring higher taxes.</p>

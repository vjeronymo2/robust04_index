			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Letter: Back to the basics on education Sir, Andrew Adonis notes in 'Busier groves of academe' (August 28) that by the year 2000 it is anticipated that one in three 18-year-olds will enter higher education, as against one in seven in the 1980s. Perhaps we might go back to basics and ask the following questions: 1) What evidence is there that a shortage of graduates does and will exist in specific areas of the UK labour market? 2) Is the expansion of higher education an appropriate response to the existing skills problem in British industry, identified by the recent research carried out at the National Institute? 3) What are the assumptions concerning the necessary alterations in existing patterns of household savings, investment and consumption that will fund students through the system in the later 1990s? What will be the eventual impact of current readjustments in the housing market? Keith Tribe, Keele University, Staffordshire ST5 5BG</p>

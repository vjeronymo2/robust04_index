			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Hotbed of high-tech Migdal Ha'Emek, just off the main road from Nazareth to Haifa in northern Israel, is typical of many towns that have grown up over the past 25 years: a spider's web of unmemorable housing sandwiched between two industrial parks. Dull though it seems, Migdal Ha'Emek turns out to be a hotbed of technological innovation and entrepreneurship. Encouraged by government incentives in what is a development zone, a clutch of small, fast-growing companies is developing new products in a bewildering array of technologies. Some, such as RSL Electronics and CI Systems, started as suppliers to the Israeli military sector, while Optomic, another local company, was formed in the mid-1980s by ex-military officers and defence industry executives, who felt that the defence boom was ending. Their new products typically draw on know-how gained in defence contracting but, according to Mr Oched Amichai, Optomic's chief executive, they are developed in response to market needs. Hence Optomic is completing development of an industrial laser which, it claims, is a quarter the size of competitive products. CI Systems has developed a spectral imaging device for remote sensing, which it says will harness space technology for use in cell biology, medicine and pollution monitoring. RSL, whose staple business is still defence and includes night vision systems for the Israeli Defence Forces and an advanced brake control system for F16 combat aircraft, is developing an electronic diamond colour grading instrument and a semen quality analyser. Other companies, notably LanOptics in Migdal Ha'Emek and Gambit Computer Communications in nearby Yokneam, are seeking to exploit niche markets in computer communications. Both supply corporate networking equipment enabling computers in large organisations to communicate with each other. The Migdal Ha'Emek high-tech companies are typical of many up and down Israel. They were founded, or started to develop rapidly, in the mid to late 1980s, have annual sales of Dollars 10m to Dollars 14m, employ about 85 people, spend up to 25 per cent of revenues on R&amp;D and cultivate close ties with the scientific and technical academic communities in the US and Israel. All the companies are putting more effort into marketing (traditionally a weak spot in Israel's corporate culture) and exporting: for instance, Gambit's marketing director, Mr Dave Green, spent 145 days outside Israel last year. Until recently, the companies had little difficulty raising capital through private placements, venture capital funds, or via the Tel Aviv stock exchange or the Nasdaq over-the-counter market in New York. But some analysts wonder whether the future will be so golden. Some high-tech high-flyers - such as LanOptics and Yokneam-based Intelligent Information Systems, another data communications and network equipment company - have seen their share prices plummet recently after they disappointed investors' expectations. But such doubts are not articulated in Migdal Ha'Emek, where the town's entrepreneurs, such as Mr Bob Buckwald, the president of CI Systems, aim high. His company has annual sales of just Dollars 9m, but he forecasts a Dollars 400m market for its spectroscopic diagnostic equipment.</p>

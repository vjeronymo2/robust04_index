			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, April 2 (MTI) -- The Social Democratic  Party of Hungary (MSZDP) will win seats in Hungarian Parliament  in the course of the elections in May, party chairman Zoltan  Kiraly said at the MSZDP's press conference on Saturday [2  April].    The party's National Board discussed the results achieved so  far in the election campaign. It approved the national list,  which so far has 15 candidates. The list is headed by party  chairman Zoltan Kiraly, followed by academician Laszlo Kapolyi,  third is MSZDP Secretary General Istvan Podkoniczky.    It was reported that the MSZDP was able to put up  territorial  lists in 11 counties by Saturday, and 46 of the 170 candidates  have already collected more than the necessary 750  recommendation slips.    In answer to a question, Kiraly said that even if the party  does not attain the 5 per cent limit needed to enter parliament,  he is confident that an MSZDP group can be created with 10  individual MPs.    Kiraly said a social-liberal coalition of the Hungarian  Socialist Party (MSZP) and the Alliance of Free Democrats  (SZDSZ) has chances for victory at the elections.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Social Movement Secretary Gianfranco </F> Fini by Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "Fini: `We  Are Free-Marketeers And Democrats'"]    [Text] Rome -- They asked him to break with the past and he  replied that fascism was an experiment "definitively consigned  to history." Now, however, Gianfranco Fini, secretary and the  "ferryman" of the MSI [Italian Social Movement] toward the  National Alliance, is taking another step. On the very eve of  the two assizes that, just a few days apart, will lead to the  birth of the "Alliance" and will restore the MSI, Fini disclosed  to IL GIORNALE: "The National Alliance will be the  confederation of several players and not just an electoral  cartel. What must unite the MSI and the Alliance is a strong  awareness of values. Let me explain: The full acceptance of  democracy as a system as well as a method, faith in the free  market, labor as a player in the economy, and the nation as a  focus for synthesis and solidarity. The aim is clear: We must  avoid Italy falling into the clutches of [Democratic Party of  the Left, PDS, Secretary] Achille Occhetto."    [Guiglia] Is the "democratic" turnaround a strategic move or  is it merely propaganda to be able to participate in the  "moderate pole?"    [Fini] There is an electoral and political bargaining table  on the Left where Communist Renaissance Chairman Cossutta and  Republican La Malfa are about to sit down with Occhetto from the  PDS. On the other hand, the Italian people must know that we  are now back to square one, since a similar and opposing  alignment is needed -- but there is none. Italians must also  know that it is not the fault of the Right if the moderates are  split. The person responsible for that is called Mario Segni,  the leader of the national rebirth "hesitaters," and the one  who deceives the electorate by maintaining that he wants to be  different from Occhetto but refusing to have anything to do with  us. PDS man D'Alema is right -- deals are done with those who  have the votes: the MSI in the center and south and in the  border regions, and the League in the north. Segni is not an  alternative to the PDS but is the whitewashed savior of  [Christian Democratic Party, DC, Secretary Mino] Martinazzoli  and Rosy Bindi of the new People's Party that is not yet born  but which is already suffering from its fatal attraction to the  PDS.    [Guiglia] How can you speak of the "free market" when you  are  accused of representing a "statist" party?    [Fini] Here there are at least two major misunderstandings  to  clear up. The National Alliance will not be statist, just as  the MSI does not want to be statist. Believing in the state  means caring for its weakest members and giving those regions in  difficulty the conditions enabling them to develop themselves.  National solidarity -- and even the pope has said this -- is  exactly the opposite of patron-and-client welfarism and of the  choices of real socialism implemented by those who have been in  power for many years. The other major deception is called  federalism. In Italy we need strong decentralization which does  not, however, distance citizens but brings them closer to their  -- today inefficient -- state. Presidentialism is the freeway  of the Second Republic.    [Guiglia] Do you accept the definition of you as a  "liberal-democrat?"    [Fini] Labels do not make any difference. Now even  Zhirinovskiy considers himself to be a liberal-democrat, only to  ally himself with the neo-Nazis in half of Europe. I simply  feel myself to be a nationalist in the modern and Western sense  of the word. I reject any kind of chauvinism or imperialism. I  love my country as much as I love freedom.    [Guiglia] Be honest: Do you really think that with the PDS  in the government we will see Cossacks coming to drink at the  fountains of Saint Peter's?    [Fini] There will, of course, be no return to the events of  1948. However, that is not a good reason to accept that the  legitimate heirs of communism should take control thanks to a  new electoral system that may give them the majority of seats in  Parliament, even though they will certainly not win the majority  of the Italian people's vote. To carry out the operation we  need to find someone like Segni, ready to gather the consensus  of the moderates and then become prime minister and head of a  coalition of the People's Party, the PDS, and the Democratic  Alliance. Naturally this would be under the banner of a  precondition -- the requirement of nonetheless having to form a  government of guarantee because of a uninominal electoral model  that did not include the direct election of the prime minister  or of the president of the republic which we repeatedly urged.    [Guiglia] To be together, everyone must give something up.  The League no longer speaks of federalism. What will be the  National Alliance's "step back?"    [Fini] Certain hypocritical moderates have applauded [League  Secretary Umberto] Bossi who was one day waving the flag of  federalism and the next day was happy with regionalism. They  are the same people who now are trying to say no to the National  Alliance, even knowing full well that if we won tomorrow we  would not be forcing anyone to put on the black shirts again.  The reality is that Bossi is just putting on a show, whereas  the National Alliance is a true change of direction. Give  something up? We will give up the presumption that Segni has  not given up: believing that we can win on our own.    [Guiglia] Who should be the moderates' candidate for the  Palazzo Chigi [government seat]?    [Fini] Certainly not Bossi, who is not at all popular in the  center and south and seriously losing his popularity in the  north.    [Guiglia] Is [Fininvest chairman Silvio] Berlusconi a  colleague or an opponent to be fought?    [Fini] Berlusconi is an important interlocutor who, unlike  Segni, is clear and straightforward. The one we have to beat is  Occhetto.</p>

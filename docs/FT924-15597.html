			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Fashion: Hemlines, it's a long story - Lucia van der Post discovers how to wear this season's hot new skirt the ERM, mortgage rates, unemployment . . . you know the sort of thing - what is really creasing the fashionable woman's brow this autumn is: will she or won't she take to the longer skirt? On catwalks, in store windows, in glossy magazines and snazzy boutiques the long skirt reigns (nearly) supreme. But wander round the stores, go to a chic little gathering or to a private dinner party and what is everybody wearing? Curvy little suits with snappy short skirts, that's what. And if they are not wearing curvy little suits they are more than likely wearing trousers. Part of the problem seems to be that few people are sure how to wear long skirts. After the sassy, sexy short skirt which we had all learned how to wear (opaque tights and pumps were all it really needed) the long skirt seems fraught with perils. It can so easily look dowdy and frumpy. Suzie Faux, who runs the tres tres chic Wardrobe boutiques and is a dab hand at transforming the most frumpish of customers, believes that almost everybody can wear the new long look. 'It just needs careful attention to the legs - the skirt should never stop where the leg is at its fattest. On some people the best length will be near the ankle, on others a little below the knee. There is no substitute for trying them on and experimenting with lengths and with jackets. I have found that most of my customers look best with a belted jacket that covers the bottom. It must on no account be skimpy. It also needs the right shoe - Robert Clergerie does a wonderful shoe, Samba, which has a platform heel so tiny that it is more like a double sole. It looks perfect.' This year's long skirt should be soft, flowing and very feminine. Many of the best come tied sarong-style at the side or with slits, allowing - but decorously - quite a lot of leg to show. After all, nobody wants to waste the effects of all those aerobics classes. This week the fashion page talks to some women about town who have already decided that they won't be without a long skirt this autumn . . . DONNING a long skirt means more than just a change of hemline - it means a complete change of mood. If it is not to look dowdy or ageing then a real touch of glamour is required. Think of all those goddesses of the silver screen and you will get the drift. The no-make-up face has gone, the bare nails, the cropped hair - in their place are defined eyebrows, deep-set eyes, full lips, painted nails, full hair. It is good news for the make-up houses which have cashed in on the mood and brought out strong new ranges to help customers create the right look. In cosmetic-house-speak the look for the winter requires 'smokey, smouldering eyes' and 'very coloured lips.' You can't go wrong if you remember to think glamour, glamour, glamour.                          *      *      * JENNY HALPERN, above, who runs the fashion public relations for Joseph is photographed here in her favourite long skirt - a side split suede version - but already she feels that somehow 'it does not seem fashionable to wear a short skirt.' She finds the new length not so practical for work and worries that the sexy split on the side might be thought provocative, so she still tends to stick to leggings for every day. However, whenever she feels the need to dress up a little she dons one or other of her clutch of long skirts - either the suede one or a tiger print version with a side split or a long knitted Tricot skirt which has a slit up the back. For the evening Jenny puts the split in the middle and during the day she wears it at the side. She wears the skirt very simply with an Equipment shirt or a long top. On her feet she wears Sartore low-heeled knee-high boots and if she were to wear shoes they would have to be high with a chunky heel. Jenny is not throwing away her short skirts but she has definitely set them aside for the moment. 'It is time for a different philosophy of dressing, for thinking about fashion in a new way.'                          *      *      * LADY DAVINA ALEXANDER, who runs her own business as a special events consultant to a number of upper-crust companies such as Chaumet, the jewellers, and Charles Heidsieck, needs to have clothes to dress the part. 'I used to have to look smart just occasionally during the day and in the evenings when we were going out, but now I'm in a business where I need to look fashionable almost all the time. I suddenly felt that all my existing clothes were obsolete so I thought I ought to try the new longer look. I was worried that I wasn't tall enough but I started trying things on and experimenting with jacket shapes and I think that it can be made to work. 'I have to say I'm still experimenting with it - I am not entirely convinced yet. One of the problems is that it needs a whole new wardrobe of shoes. It needs a thicker, chunkier heel and I am just going to have to go out and buy them.'                          *      *      * JINNI Featherstone-Witty, left, works for Kleinwort Benson in the treasury division and spends most of her day in a world of men. She hates shopping and finds that trying to look appropriately dressed in a business sense and to be fashionable at the same time is a challenge. She likes Laura Benjamin's shop off Walton Street because 'I am not a standard shape and Laura will take that into account. 'I am keener on the new long look this time round - it is more feminine and more flexible and though I am worried about covering up one of my assets - my legs - I still think they can be made to look very attractive. I notice in the City that women are beginning to wear them and I think as soon as the weather gets colder we will see many more. I travel a lot and need clothes that pack and can look good. I always kept some skirts that were on the knee rather than above it as they were so much easier for travelling. I think the new look is very helpful for people like me who need a look that is both fashionable and suitable for office life.'                          *      *      * EDWINA WILLIS-FLEMING is manageress of the Loewe shop and being nearly 6 ft tall with the kind of figure that would look good in a potato sack she has been able to don the new long length without any of her shorter sisters' qualms. She is wearing long skirts partly because they are in fashion, partly because they make a change from short and partly because she finds them very elegant and easy to wear. She thinks it 'has brought a much-needed breath of fresh air to the fashion business. Depending on how they are worn, they can have huge sex appeal. So much more is left to the imagination, which is always more beguiling.' She finds them very versatile. By day she wears them with a ribbed polo neck, a pair of ankle boots and opaque tights. At night she would choose something with a slit at the front with high heels, perhaps with slight platforms, and sheer tights. She also thinks it needs careful accessorising and she chose pieces, like the choker, which work with what she calls 'the modern, classic forties look.'</p>

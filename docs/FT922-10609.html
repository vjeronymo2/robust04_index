			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: New market in Ecu-denominated equities considered THE outline of a possible new market in Ecu-denominated equities was sketched yesterday by a senior figure from the London Stock Exchange, the first time such a possibility has been raised publicly by the exchange which already dominates cross-border share dealing in Europe. The market would involve the creation of 'European Depositary Receipts,' similar in many ways to American Depository Receipts. Shares in leading European companies would be placed with depository banks and reissued in Ecu form. Speaking at a conference in London on the implications of a single European currency, Mr Martin Hall, who is head of public policy at the exchange, said that the advantages of such a market would be considerable. These included 'seamless trading in all the major European stocks; easy 'basket trading', on the basis of a single 'basket EDR' enabling Japanese or US investors to 'buy Europe' in a single transaction; (and) the creation of readily workable European indices and derivative products'. Novelty, and the difficulty of attracting enough investors to the market, were the main obstacles to the idea, said Mr Hall, adding that the development of such a market was unlikely until the outcome of planned monetary union in the EC became clearer. Investors generally react positively in principle to the idea of a single, Ecu-denominated share market. Mr Mike Payne, head of international equity investment at Legal &amp; General, the UK insurance company, said yesterday: 'What's annoying about European investment is that you have to deal with so many currencies.' However, the Ecu has yet to develop a strong enough backing to make it an attractive currency for investors.</p>

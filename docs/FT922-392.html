			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / Threat to timeshare credit licences THE Office of Fair Trading threatened yesterday to revoke the consumer-credit licences of six companies associated with Club Riviera, Britain's largest holiday timeshare group. This is the first time the OFT has threatened such action against a timeshare company. Its action follows complaints about advertising, marketing and sales practices. Loss of consumer-credit licences would deprive the companies of the right to arrange financing for buyers of their properties. Three of the companies, Club Riviera (UK), Club Tenerife Sales and Regency Palms Sales, are subsidiaries of the Manchester-based Riviera group. The group has management contracts with the three other companies, Ryefix, Canary Islands Holiday Club and Marbella Beach Club, which are registered in the Isle of Man. The OFT has given the companies, which specialise in selling timeshare properties in Spain and the Canary Islands, three weeks to argue against the proposed revocation. Mr Simon Clarke, Riviera group's sales and marketing director, said yesterday that he did not know why the OFT was threatening action but would seek further information. He said he would seek to retain the companies' licences. Last September, Club Riviera and Club Tenerife were convicted by Staffordshire magistrates on charges of making false advertising statements. In 1989 Club Riviera was fined by the Timeshare Developers' Association after allegations that the company was selling flats on the Costa del Sol that were being built without planning permission. About 90 people complained to the association and the OFT that they paid deposits for flats that were never completed.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S., EGYPT SHARE GOALS FOR MIDEAST, BUSH SAYS;  </P> <P> PRESIDENT MEETS MUBARAK, SUPPORTS 'PROPERLY STRUCTURED' TALKS, ASKS ARABS,  ISRAEL TO YIELD  </P> <P> President Bush, opening a week of intense Middle East diplomacy, renewed  American support Monday for "a properly structured" international conference to  begin a new round of Arab-Israeli negotiations on ending the Israeli occupation  of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> With Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak standing at his side in the White House  Rose Garden, Bush said that both Israel and the Palestinians must be prepared  to yield some of their long-held positions in the dispute. But his remarks  seemed certain to put far more pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak  Shamir, who confers with Bush later this week, than on the Palestinians.  </P> <P> "Egypt and the United States share the goals of security for Israel, the end of  the occupation and achievement of Palestinian political rights," Bush said.  "These are the promises held out by a sustained commitment to a negotiated  settlement, toward which a properly structured international conference could  play a useful role at an appropriate time."  </P> <P> The President's carefully qualified endorsement of an international conference  was virtually identical to the position staked out by the Reagan  Administration. But it marked an abrupt change in emphasis for the Bush  Administration after weeks in which Secretary of State James A. Baker III had  said that it was far too early to consider a high-profile international  meeting.  </P> <P> The meetings with Mubarak and Shamir represent the new Administration's first  major venture into Middle East diplomacy.  </P> <P> Bush did not spell out the sort of conference he would consider "properly  structured." The Reagan Administration used the same phrase to provide room for  diplomatic maneuvering, especially on the issue of Palestinian representation.  U.S. officials refused to be more specific, although they said a conference  attended by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council would  surely win approval if other conditions were acceptable.  </P> <P> Shamir adamantly opposes any sort of international conference, insisting  instead on direct negotiations between Israel and the neighboring Arab states.  During his Washington visit, Shamir is expected to offer elections in the West  Bank and Gaza Strip to pick Palestinian leaders who might be brought into peace  talks with Israel. But Shamir insists that Israel will never negotiate with the  Palestine Liberation Organization, which many Arab residents of the occupied  territories see as their representative.  </P> <P> A senior U.S. official said Mubarak told Bush that Shamir's election plan would  never get off the ground because Palestinians never would recognize elections  supervised by the Israeli military government. Asked to characterize Bush's  response, the official said that the President asked Mubarak if there were any  conditions under which Palestinians would accept the balloting. The official  refused to provide additional information, although PLO spokesmen have said  that the organization would not object to an election organized by the United  Nations.  </P> <P> In their comments to reporters, Bush and Mubarak used very similar language in  calling for renewed peace talks. The Egyptian president wants a settlement  "achieved through direct negotiations between Israel and all Arab partners,  within the framework of the international conference."  </P> <P> Bush urged a settlement that would achieve the "legitimate political rights" of  Palestinians, and Mubarak said that the settlement should recognize the  "legitimate national rights" of the Palestinians. Both phrases are  intentionally ambiguous, covering anything from an independent Palestinian  state to some form of limited self-rule. But both presidents emphasized that  the Israeli occupation must be brought to an end.  </P> <P> In an apparent concession to the Israelis, Mubarak said that his government  opposes "irredentist claims," a reference to Palestinian demands to return to  cities and towns in Israel from which they or their ancestors fled during  Israel's 1948 war of independence. In effect, Mubarak said that, although Egypt  supports a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, it does not support  Palestinian claims to Israel proper.  </P> <P> The senior U.S. official said that the United States and Egypt remain far apart  on the timing of an international conference. He said Mubarak wants the meeting  to take place by early next year at the latest while "we believe that there's a  lot of ground that has to be covered before there could be a possibly useful  role for an international conference."  </P> <P> Egyptian sources hailed Bush's endorsement of the concept of an international  conference despite the conditions he attached to it.  </P> <P> "There is now a better indication of where the peace process is going," one  source said. "Everything else that will be taking place will be taking place en  route to the conference."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Mubarak clearly objected to Bush's deliberate pace.  </P> <P> "We believe that the area stands at a historic crossroads certain to affect the  future of many generations," he said. "The situation is ripe for an active  effort."  </P> <P> Bush and Mubarak met for a little more than an hour at the White House. Then  Mubarak accompanied Bush to Baltimore to attend the Orioles-Red Sox  season-opening game, although baseball is virtually unknown in Egypt. Mubarak  said it was the first game he had ever attended.  </P></p>

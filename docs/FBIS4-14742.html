			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Lev Ryabchikov for TASS] </F>   [Text] Simferopol April 1 TASS -- Bread prices have gone up  by 2.5 times in the Crimea, many enterprises are idle as they  have supported the lock-out announced by the Crimean Union of  Businessmen to the Crimean parliament due to its unwillingness  to lower production taxes.    "The Crimea duplicates the situation that has been  characteristic of Ukraine for several years. The Ukrainian  leadership fears unpopular reforms," Crimean Vice-Premier  Yevgeniy Saburov told a news conference here today.    "The Crimean Supreme Soviet had kept the bread prices low  for  a long time on political reasons. The prices are no longer  real, and their support has been stopped. Thus, prices went up  on April 1," he said.    In the opinion of Saburov, food prices should not be curbed  down but they should not jump either.    The bread price increase may influence the results of the  second round of parliamentary elections, and the government  hopes to ease the situation with reduced taxes on enterprises  and business structures and improved banking activities and  currency regulation. These measures have been coordinated with  the Ukrainian president and do not run counter to the  legislation, said the vice-premier.    Decrees to the effect have been prepared to be signed by  President Yuriy Meshkov upon his return from Cyprus, where he  left today.    Bearing in mind Saburov's statements, Chairman of the  Crimean  Union of Businessmen Aleksandr Dudko told the news conference  the union will suspend the lock-put for two-weeks in order to  enable the government to settle the taxation issue.</p>

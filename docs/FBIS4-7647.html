			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens, 1 April (MTI) -- "Hungary has never strived  to get into the European Union [EU] to the detriment of others,"  Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said in Athens on Friday [1  April]. He had never seen EU entry as a kind of competition  between the region's countries. Hungary has an interest in its  neighbors, facing similar economic problems, joining the EU at  about the same time, he added.    He said Hungary could well become a full EU member by the  end  of the century. All political groups contesting May's elections  support entry and the mood of country is unlikely to change  considerably on this at the 1994 election, the Foreign Minister  claimed.    "Among Visegrad countries, EU membership coordination talks  were most successful with Poland. The Polish bid, even if  submitted a few days later than Hungary's application, will be  discussed at the ministerial conference on April 18. We proceed  together, but may not necessarily reach the goal at the same  time," Jeszenszky said.</p>

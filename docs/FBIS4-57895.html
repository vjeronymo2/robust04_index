			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Gregorio Salazar] </F>   [Text] Judging from unofficial yet reliable information  circulating yesterday among journalists at Miraflores Palace,  Cesar Quintini Rosales, transportation and communications  minister, will not be the only one to leave President Rafael  Caldera's executive team.    Quintini will reportedly be joined by Development Minister  Luis Carlos Palacios; Ciro Anez Fonseca, agriculture and  livestock minister; and Roberto Perez Lecuna, environment and  natural renewable resources minister    Development Minister Palacios has apparently followed the  government's general guidelines in the commerce and industries  sector, and certain people say the tendency will be to fall back  and return to subsidies. Labor unions have criticized the  minister, and it is believed that he is trying to absorb  organizations like the Institute for Consumer Education and  Protection (IDEC) and the Institute for Business Competition.    No one knows if the minister's problems stem from actions  taken by his brother. Rumor has it that the minister's brother  went to the Institute for Business Competition and demanded that  the organization change its decision to prevent the merger of  Heinz and Yukery "because he is the minister's brother."  Environment Minister Perez Lecuna has been forced to face the  critical problem created by the water shortage. The extended  drought has spread a desperation among the people that has not  been seen in many years. Nevertheless, there is no information  on any errors or omissions on the minister's part that could  serve as the basis for his removal.    As for the agriculture and livestock minister, organizations  like Fedeagro [National Federation of Agricultural-Livestock  Producers], Fedenaga [Venezuelan Cattlemen's Federation], and  Fedenaca [Peasant Union] have demanded Ciro Anez Fonseca's  removal, bitterly complaining about the minister's inability to  act as a mediator to renegotiate the 143 billion bolivar debt in  the agriculture sector and obtain a higher preferential rate to  finance this year's harvest.    Cesar Quintini Rosales' problems in the Transportation and  Communications Ministry are well known. They began with the  resignation of deputy minister Rafael Iribarren, who reported  the existence of corrupt groups supported by high-ranking  officials. Quintini is not alone. Rumor has it that he is  supported by Hugo Perez La Salvia, a member of the commission  conducting the investigation of Iribarren's charges, the results  of which remain unknown. Journalists report that he was fired,  but yesterday Quintini denied dismissing him.</p>

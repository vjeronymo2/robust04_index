			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de Las Casas, 13 Feb (AFP) -- The Red  Cross has had contact with retired General Absalon Castellanos,  the former governor of the Mexican State of Chiapas, who has  been a hostage of the rebels since 2 January. It is also  believed that Castellanos will be released quite soon.    In a communique, the organization stated that, "following  Red  Cross International (IRC) criterion, IRC delegates were allowed  to see the hostage, who sent a memento to his relatives."    Castellanos was abducted from his ranch by members of the  Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN). The rebels "tried"  him and sentenced him life in prison. That decision was later  overturned.    The organization's communique added that "if an agreement  regarding any hostage release can be reached, the IRC is ready  to meet its commitment as a neutral intermediary."    A majority of people in San Cristobal believe that  Castellanos will be released very soon. Some reports say that  the event may even take place this very Sunday.    Other sources, however, say Castellanos will be freed after  the first round of talks between the EZLN and the government.  The place and date for the talks is still unknown, although it  is believed that they may begin in the next few days.</p>

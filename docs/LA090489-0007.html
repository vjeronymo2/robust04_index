			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFINITELY WORTH A TOAST!  </P> <P> State lawmakers and Gov. George Deukmejian can give recycling a boost,  discourage litterbugs and take some pressure off clogged landfills by raising  the redemption rate on empty soda bottles and beer cans. The current payoff of  a penny is too small to persuade consumers to hoard empty containers for the  recycler rather than toss them in the trash. A nickel reward -- the standard in  states where bottle laws work best -- would provide a stronger incentive.  </P> <P> A bill, sponsored by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), would increase the  redemption rate to two-for-a-nickel on bottles and cans that contain fewer than  24 ounces. The measure, SB 1221, would boost the rate to a full 5 cents on  larger beverage containers, including the popular and cumbersome 2-liter  bottles. The measure is expected to come up before the Assembly this week. It  merits swift passage.  </P> <P> Passage followed by the governor's approval would guarantee the higher rate as  of Jan. 1. The new law would also boost the pay-offs to a full nickel per small  can or bottle and a dime per larger bottle as of Jan. 1, 1993 -- but only if  the return rates fail to reach the mandatory 65% for aluminum, glass and  plastic containers, the standard set two years ago by the original bottle  legislation.  </P> <P> Summer return rates -- when beverage consumption is at its highest -- are due  from the state Conservation Department on Friday. Although a high rate is  expected for aluminum cans, the containers with the highest scrap value, the  level is not expected to approach the mark for glass or plastic containers.  State return rates were 57% for cans, 33% for glass bottles and 5% for plastic  containers during the last reporting period ending Dec. 31. That is a mediocre  showing when compared to the 90% return rates in states that have established a  nickel refund.  </P> <P> Californians drink 12 billion beers and soft drinks in a typical year. How many  of those empty bottles and cans wind up as litter on our parks, beaches and  roads or in municipal landfills that are running out of room? Recycling every  empty container would dramatically reduce litter and energy consumption.  </P> <P> Consumers who are willing to return a six-pack of empties to a recycling depot  deserve more than a fistful of pennies for their effort. The California  Assembly and the governor should approve the nickel reward.  </P></p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: General Dynamics profits at Dollars 65m GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence contractor which is selling off peripheral businesses, yesterday reported second-quarter earnings of Dollars 65m from continuing operations, up from Dollars 33m in the same period of last year. The 1991 figure excluded a Dollars 140m gain from a tax adjustment, which pushed last year's income figure up to Dollars 173m. The company sold its Cessna business aircraft operations in the first quarter of this year, and is in the process of selling other businesses with combined turnover of some Dollars 2bn. It recently completed a tender offer in which it will spend Dollars 957m to buy back shares from investors. The plan involves returning to shareholders the excess cash being generated by the disposal programme. The company's results from continuing operations worked through to earnings of Dollars 1.48 a share, compared with 77 cents in 1991 without the tax gain, and Dollars 4.06 with the gain. Sales in both periods totalled Dollars 1.6bn. Earnings from the businesses up for sale, which are not included in continuing operations, totalled Dollars 21m, compared with Dollars 38m a year ago. However, the 1991 total included Dollars 17m from the now-sold Cessna. The company's tactical military aircraft operations recorded operating earnings of Dollars 49m, up from Dollars 45m, while nuclear submarines made Dollars 21m, compared with Dollars 20m; armoured vehicles Dollars 28m, against Dollars 25m; and space launch systems made a reduced loss of Dollars 7m, compared with Dollars 25m. The figures were also helped by the first-quarter retirement of Dollars 350m in debt, with net interest outgoings of Dollars 12m last year becoming a Dollars 7m inflow this quarter.</p>

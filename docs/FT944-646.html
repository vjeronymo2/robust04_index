			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Rally holds fire but hope lingers - London / David Wighton finds a dash of seasonal spirit Like Billy Bunter's postal order, the oft-predicted year-end share rally failed to materialise. But there was at least a dash of seasonal spirit this week. There were Christmas presents for investors in Northern Electric and Portals as the promised bids duly arrived, and the good cheer spread as the City predicted a New Year full of take-over promise. Apart from the actual bids from Trafalgar House and De La Rue, there were potential offers for Pict Petroleum, Wills Group and Jupiter Tyndall. The FT-SE 100 index rose steadily until yesterday when, with dealers deserting their desks, it slipped back a shade to end at 3083.4, up 69.8 on the week. Adding to the Christmas cheer was the announcement of the UK's first surplus on the current account of the balance of payments in nearly eight years. The Pounds 846m third-quarter surplus was much bigger than the City had forecast and was seized on by the government as further conclusive evidence that the UK is making a textbook economic recovery. Unfortunately for the government, the voters are finding it far from enjoyable. Besides, most observers believe the surplus is likely to be short-lived because it is the result not just of strong exports but also of weak imports. These have been subdued, partly because UK industry has not been investing in capital goods - which tend to come from abroad. Those who see resurgent inflation at every turn take little comfort from the surplus. They maintain that unless industry starts investing, rising demand will lead merely to inflation. The determinedly gloomy add that if industry does start investing it will hit the trade figures, weaken the pound and fuel inflation. Back in the stock market, the electrical excitement spilled over into the water sector. Despite the dangers of mixing the two, the suggestion re-surfaced that electricity and water companies might combine to make themselves less attractive to predators. Hanson was mentioned as a potential bidder for both - and many others besides. Property shares also were enlivened by bid hopes. The FT revealed that a Pounds 1.5bn offer to buy the St Martins Property group, owned by the Kuwaiti government, had been made by an investment consortium headed by Barings, a merchant bank. The offer is thought to have been rebuffed, but the news provided a shot in the arm for the sector. Among this year's worst performers, property shares have been hit by the rise in bond yields and the lack of the predicted rise in rents. But the St Martins offer follows other recent signs of renewed activity. Land Securities shares ended the week up 18p at 604p, while MEPC added 17p to 395p. It all appears to have come too late, however, to save Stanhope Properties, half-owner of the City's Broadgate development. Stanhope's shares were suspended this week after negotiations with its bankers broke down. Retail shares, which have fared scarcely better than property, also perked up a bit. After quick trips to count the heads in Oxford Street, analysts decided Christmas trading might not be as bad as feared. Kingfisher, this year's Footsie's back-marker, recovered 19p to 414p over the week. BAT Industries, another of the year's laggards, ended on a better note, too, after winning US government approval for its planned Dollars 1bn takeover of American Tobacco. Two more of the UK's biggest concerns also had a good week, with British Petroleum regaining its place as the most valuable UK company (overtaking British Telecom) while Glaxo, which once held the title, surged by 7.5 per cent. This followed the news that, because of a provision in the Gatt trade agreement, the US patent on Zantac, Glaxo's anti-ulcer treatment, could be extended by 19 months. Analysts estimate that this could provide Glaxo with extra revenue of between Pounds 500m and Pounds 900m - which, although very welcome, hardly justifies a Pounds 1.5bn increase in the company's market value. Insurance shares were left out of the party after the Halifax announced it was cutting an average of 20 per cent off building cover from next year. Sun Alliance closed at 295p, down 6 per cent on the week. The week also brought a clutch of profit warnings from smaller companies. Canadian Pizza, the pizza-base supplier, had offended once already since it came to the stock market last November and its shares crumbled to 73p compared with 200p at flotation. New issues apart, there have been fewer disappointments than might have been expected this year, with overall profits growing more strongly than most observers predicted. Some are expecting even faster growth this year. Merrill Lynch forecasts total market profits up 24 per cent - almost twice the consensus - driven by rapid economic recovery in continental Europe and good growth in domestic demand. Yet, the firm's Footsie prediction for the end of next year is only 3,250, in line with its contention that earnings multiples are due to fall more sharply than believed generally. In part, this reflects the increased number of quoted utilities, shares of which command a lower than average earnings multiple and higher yield. Because of this change, it could be argued that the UK market is not quite as cheap as it looks by historic standards, or relative to other European markets. Even so, UK shares do look attractive compared with the US and most continental markets. Following London's sharp underperformance in the first half of 1994, the optimists argue that the more recent recovery looks set to continue. The City's Billy Bunters insist that the year-end rally is still in the post.</p>

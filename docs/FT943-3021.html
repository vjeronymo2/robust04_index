			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / US exits Somalia The American flag was lowered over the US liaison office in lawless Somalia and the last marine guards left yesterday in a low-key final act to 21 months of American intervention, Reuter reports from Mogadishu. An estimated 55 US marines flew by helicopter from the US liaison office in the UN compound in Mogadishu where they left aboard a white UN plane for Mombasa, Kenya. The subdued departure contrasted with the troops high profile landing on the beaches of Mogadishu in December 1992. As the US prepares for a possible Haiti invasion Somalia remains in chaos under clan warlords. US intervention came unstuck in an undeclared war last year against militias loyal to Mohamed Farah Aideed which prompted President Clinton to order the pullout.</p>

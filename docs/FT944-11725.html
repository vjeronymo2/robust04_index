			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Euromoney at Pounds 24m and still on the acquisition trail Pre-tax profits at Euromoney Publications, the acquisitive information group 70 per cent owned by the Daily Mail and General Trust, advanced 36 per cent to Pounds 24m in the year to September 30. The rise from Pounds 17.7m was struck on turnover up 67 per cent at Pounds 89.9m (Pounds 53.7m), to which acquisitions contributed Pounds 5m (Pounds 4.05m). Mr Richard Ensor, managing director, said that as well as launching its own magazines Euromoney acquired them where possible. Euromoney magazine itself, he said, had its best year ever, with higher revenue from both subscriptions and advertisements. He attributed this result to a redesign, new writers and increased pagination, as well as to 'commercial banks having a better time'. However, the group also acquired companies by degrees, Mr Ensor said. This involved buying a 20 to 25 per cent stake then gradually adding to that holding. He said he hoped the flow of acquisitions would 'continue at a reasonable rate', adding that the group was particularly interested in acquiring events and database businesses and cross-border business-to-business publishing. The core international financial publishing side lifted profits to Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 9.54m), while the training arm saw an advance to Pounds 4.83m (Pounds 2.71m). This was helped by the merger of DC Gardner's banking and management training operations with Euromoney's own. Profits from seminars and conferences jumped to Pounds 2.75m (Pounds 662,000), although Mr Ensor warned that the rise was largely due to the elevation of AIC, the seminars business based in Australia, from an associate to a subsidiary. Euromoney now holds 75 per cent of AIC. In May the group raised some Pounds 23m from the placing of 1.25m shares. Under stock exchange rules DMGT was prevented from any take-up and its stake was reduced from 74 to 70 per cent. Earnings per share grew to 69.38p (56.84p) and a final dividend of 29.5p lifts the total to 42.5p (38p).</p>

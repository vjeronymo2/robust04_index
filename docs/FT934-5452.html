			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Twelve acorns for a hair cut - Local Exchange Trading Systems are taking off in nearly 200 communities across the UK What do you do when you have a product or a service to sell, but your customers have no money to buy? The answer is you shun sterling and accept 'bobbins', 'acorns', or 'beaks' instead. Recession has worked wonders for home-grown local currencies. Two years ago there were five. Now, nearly 200 towns and cities in the UK are busily buying and selling in their own units. Businesses including dentists, solicitors, shops and cafes are finding that receiving payment in local barter currencies is a lot better than not trading at all. The networks, known as Local Exchange Trading Systems, started as a way of helping the unemployed use their skills. Members open an account in the local currency with a central administrator and are issued with a cheque book. When one member buys something from another, the cheque is sent on to the central administrator who acts as banker, debiting one account and crediting the other. No physical tokens are involved. Members enter their products or skills for sale in a local directory, with many members offering a range of services. Paul Johnson of Tradelink in Wiltshire is fairly typical: he will program your computer or decorate your house. The founders of the scheme view money with strong suspicion and have a moral repugnance for the payment of interest. But Lets are now moving away from their hippy roots and businesses are beginning to accept payment in Lets units as part of a hard-nosed business strategy. A solicitor in Stroud who accepts Lets payments does so because he recognises that it brings in customers who otherwise might not use a solicitor. Moreover, customers acquired in that way may be more likely to stay loyal. 'Initially we joined the scheme because we were new in the area and because we felt we couldn't say no,' says Carolyn Whitwell of the Bishopston Trading company which runs five ethical clothing stores in the west country. 'But now we do it out of pure self interest. Recession has hit us very badly and this is a way of creating a market for people who have no money.' The shop accepts 25 per cent of the value of its goods in Lets units, but when it increased the proportion to 50 per cent during a recent sale, it was surprised at how sharply its turnover increased. While businesses are finding no shortage of customers willing to buy through Lets, some are struggling to spend the currency they have accumulated. In Stroud, which has one of the oldest and biggest schemes with about 300 members, there are plans to employ a Lets councillor to show businesses how to meet many of their needs - decorating, electrical work, accountancy and so on - locally and pay for them through Lets. Some enterprising companies have started paying their staff through Lets. At the Bishopston Trading Company, local residents are being paid in Lets units to make clothes, thus not only meeting a genuine need, but easing the company's cash flow. At Mills cafe in Stroud, meals and drinks can be bought via Lets and with the proceeds the proprietor is paying workers to till a nearby plot of land for her. Meanwhile, the owner of a market stall has earned enough Lets units to hire an architect to redesign his home. As the idea of the schemes is to keep business within a community, they tend to work best in places where the spirit of the community is strong. Many of the people who are the keenest users like them because, unlike money, they make trading less impersonal. 'The years of Thatcherism have taken the humanity out of doing business,' says Harry Turner of Letslink UK, the national co-ordinating body. 'There are lots of people who prefer a more human way of doing things.' He describes his first Lets transaction when he had just moved to the town and was in need of a haircut. 'I rang up someone in the directory to sort out a haircut and I took some of the cards I had made over. I ended up having a meal there and now we are friends.' Some larger towns have more than one network. In Bristol there are two, each with a different ethos. One prides itself on its equality: all members must charge a standard rate for their services per hour, regardless of whether they are accountants or cleaners. The other, like most Lets, allows members to charge whatever they like. The second scheme, complains Carolyn Whitwell, is rather too heavy on people offering alternative healing or aromatherapy at fancy prices. Lets keep tabs on how much each member of the scheme is trading and sends them regular statements. There are no credit limits: most feel that the local nature of the schemes as well as the types of products on offer will prevent people from spending a million bobbins and then doing a runner. The Inland Revenue is watching the growth of Lets with interest. A spokeswoman said that if local currencies were used for occasional babysitting or gardening, the revenue would turn a blind eye. But if businesses were using them, all amounts should be declared in the usual way. 'And we want tax paid in sterling. The chancellor will not appreciate having his lawn mowed,' she said.

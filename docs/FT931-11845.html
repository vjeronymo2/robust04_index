			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Letter: A very useful catalogue Sir, The publicity given to the financial problems of Sears Roebuck (January 26) reminds me of the story of the US midwest farmer who wrote to the company for the price of its toilet rolls. It wrote back referring him to page 447 of its mail order catalogue, whereupon the farmer replied saying that if he had its catalogue, he wouldn't need the toilet rolls. Arnold Taylor, Avondale Lodge, Pynnacles Close, Stanmore, Middx HA7 4AF</p>

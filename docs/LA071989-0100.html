			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'EVERYONE WANTS TO BE A MEGA-CARRIER';  </P> <P> AIRLINES LOOK FOR PARTNERS IN EUROPE FOR EXPANSIONS  </P> <P> U.S. airlines are joining forces with well-heeled airlines in Europe to extend  their reach around the globe.  </P> <P> The corporate parents of expansion-minded Continental Airlines, Northwest  Airlines and Delta Air Lines have joined forces in recent weeks with smaller,  cash-rich European airlines anxious for more American customers. The trend is  expected to continue as airlines on both continents look for ways to grow.  </P> <P> "Nowadays, everyone wants to be a mega-carrier," said Frank Spencer, professor  emeritus at Northwestern University's Transportation Center, in an interview.  "The fancy word is global."  </P> <P> The new transatlantic alliances differ from the frequent-flier partnerships  familiar to American air travelers. The new arrangements are more complex  because European airlines are buying ownership stakes in U.S. air carriers, and  in some cases, becoming increasingly involved in their management. The chairman  of Scandinavian Airline Systems now sits on the board of Texas Air Corp., the  parent of Continental and Eastern Airlines.  </P> <P> The airlines say the new alliances provide significant benefits. The U.S.  airlines, frequently rumored to be takeover targets, get a friendly investor  and, in some cases, European know-how. For example, SAS, a premium airline, is  helping to improve the poor image of its U.S. partner by teaching Continental's  flight crews good customer service.  </P> <P> In exchange for their money and assistance, European airlines get a valuable  foothold in the all-important U.S. travel market, now all but closed to them.  "The bottom-line objective is to feed passengers to each other," said Thomas  McKenna, Swissair's newly appointed manager of airline cooperation, whose sole  task is to nurture his employer's coveted relationship with Delta.  </P> <P> Because the partnerships between U.S. and European airlines are so new, the  impact on air travelers is not yet clear. John R. Meyer, a Harvard University  aviation expert, said consumers should benefit, at least for now. He said the  relationships should improve connections with overseas flights and support  domestic competition, since investments from rich foreign carriers should help  weak U.S. airlines survive.  </P> <P> But some experts warn that consumers may suffer as more airlines form  partnerships, especially if two strong air carriers team up. The trend "over  time will tend to support higher fares because competition will be reduced,"  said Paul Turk, an airline industry consultant with Avmark Inc. in Washington.  </P> <P> Foreign investment in U.S. airlines has raised protectionist concerns. Right  now, federal rules prohibit foreigners from owning more than one-quarter of a  U.S. airline, making takeovers by foreign carriers impossible. But the new  alliances are viewed as a first step toward breaking down the government  barriers and opening the U.S. travel market to foreign airlines.  </P> <P> Aviation consultant Morton Beyer, president of Avmark, said as barriers are  lowered, the U.S airline industry could one day go the way of the American  maritime industry, with airlines flying under the flags of Panama, Liberia or  Greece.  </P> <P> "The American airline market is the plum of the world, and if we don't watch  it, foreign investors are going to be eating our lunch," said Sen. Wendell H.  Ford (D-Ky.). Ford, chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation  Committee's aviation subcommittee, has sponsored legislation with Sen. John  McCain (R-Ariz.) that would give the Transportation Department greater  authority to reject airline deals involving foreign investors. European  airlines are not alone in making U.S. airline investments. An Australian  airline and a Japanese airline own stakes in two U.S. air carriers, but those  relationships have produced few cooperative ventures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strictly an Investment  </P> <P> Ansett Airlines of Australia has a 20% stake in America West Airlines and  leases 10 airliners to the Phoenix-based air carrier. Since both airlines  operate only within their own countries, there is no opportunity to coordinate  flights. America West says it might work more closely with Ansett if it gets  federal permission to fly to Australia, but that is not considered likely.  </P> <P> Similarly, a Japan Air Lines hotel subsidiary controls 20% of troubled Hawaiian  Airlines, but a JAL spokesman said its holdings are strictly an investment.  "They needed capital, and we operate hotels in the region. We had an interest  in helping them," JAL spokesman Morris Simoncelli said.  </P> <P> The cultural gap between the United States and Asia is expected to limit the  number of transpacific relationships, at least for now. But many aviation  experts think that similar cultures and the pressures of deregulation in Europe  will lead to more alliances between airlines on both sides of the Atlantic.  </P> <P> Access to the giant U.S. market is becoming increasingly important for European  airlines, as the European Community prepares to deregulate the marketplace in  1992. When the economic barriers now separating the EC's nine member-nations  are dropped, small airlines there will lose their protected home markets.  </P> <P> By developing a strong U.S. business, smaller European airlines -- such as SAS,  Swissair and KLM Royal Dutch Airways -- hope to better withstand competitive  assaults in their home countries from large European airlines, such as British  Airways or Lufthansa.  </P> <P> Foreign airlines need American partners to gain access to the U.S. market  because federal rules greatly restrict their ability to do business here.  Foreign airlines are permitted to fly passengers out of this country but are  prohibited from hauling passengers between U.S. cities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Alternative for Carriers  </P> <P> By closely matching flight schedules, European airlines hope that their  American partners will collect Europe-bound travelers for them. SAS, for  example, has moved its U.S. gateway from New York's John F. Kennedy  International Airport to Newark International Airport in New Jersey, an  important hub for Continental. If the agreement works as SAS hopes, Continental  will pick up Scandinavia-bound passengers from around the United States and  deliver them to SAS in Newark.  </P> <P> "Since they (foreign airlines) can't enter the market directly, an alternative  is for them to buy a piece of an American airline," said Alfred E. Kahn,  chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board in 1977-78 and now a professor of  political economy at Cornell University.  </P> <P> Kahn favors alliances that tend to support small or weak air carriers. He says  the SAS investment in Texas Air, for example, should help that debt-laden  company remain competitive. Similarly, he approves Delta's partnership because  it helps support Swissair -- "a smaller carrier whose competitive ability to  survive in the long run isn't clear."  </P> <P> However, Kahn called "troublesome" possible alliances between two larger  airlines with overlapping markets, such as United Airlines and British Airways.  Those two air carriers have a marketing partnership but no direct financial  involvement in each other. A closer relationship between the two, Kahn said,  "would eliminate competition."  </P> <P> The future of foreign investment is likely to be shaped by the government's  decision on the proposed transaction between KLM and NWA Inc., the parent of  Northwest Airlines. KLM is a partner with Los Angeles investor Alfred A.  Checchi in his winning $4.05-billion bid for NWA. Checchi is borrowing more  than $3 billion of the total.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another Foreign Investor  </P> <P> KLM is putting up $400 million -- 60% of the equity -- to help buy the airline,  but in order to comply with federal rules, KLM is getting just less than 5% of  the voting stock. KLM will also hold one seat on NWA's proposed seven-member  board.  </P> <P> That transaction is complicated by the involvement of another foreign investor,  the Australian brewing conglomerate Elders IXL. Elders is investing  significantly less than KLM -- $80 million in equity -- but will receive just  under 15% of the voting stock. Like KLM, Elders will have one board seat.  </P> <P> The Transportation Department must decide whether the transaction gives foreign  interests "control" of Northwest Airlines. If it is approved, it will clear the  way for more similarly structured deals between airlines in the United States  and Europe, observers say.  </P> <P> "The entire industry is watching that case," said consultant Beyer, "the way a  mongoose watches a cobra."  </P> <P> </P> <P> AIRLINES' TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCES  </P> <P> Continental - SAS  </P> <P> Scandinavian Airline Systems acquired 9% of stock of Texas Air, Continental's  parent, and has a seat on its board. Continental and SAS are linking hubs at  Newark. SAS employees are teaching Continental flight crews good  customer-service practices.  </P> <P> Northwest - KLM  </P> <P> KLM Royal Dutch Airways is putting up $400 million to help Alfred Checchi buy  NWA, parent of Northwest. KLM and Northwest expect to work together on  marketing, scheduling and other activities. KLM will get a seat on NWA's board.  </P> <P> Delta - Swissair  </P> <P> The airlines agreed last week to buy a 5% stake in each other. They are working  together on design for McDonnell Douglas MD-11s that the airlines ordered  separately. Trying to coordinate flight schedules to simplify connections on  international flights.  </P> <P> Other connections:  </P> <P> Ansett Airlines of Australia owns a 20% stake in America West, and leases 10  airliners to the Phoenix-based carrier. Pan Pacific Hotels, a hotel subsidiary  of Japan Air Lines, owns 20% of Hawaiian Airlines as an investment.  </P></p>

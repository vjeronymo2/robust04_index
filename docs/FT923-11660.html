			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / NHS costs exceed inflation NATIONAL Health Service inflation is running at about 5.7 per cent, according to the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts' annual financial survey. That is 1.2 per cent above the inflation estimates used by the government in the Autumn Statement. Health-sector inflation regularly runs ahead of price increases in the overall economy, and has been a frequent source of financial pressures on the NHS in the past. The association says, however, that the 5.7 per cent inflation estimate would still leave 'real growth in finances of around 3.8 per cent this year' if financial allocations to GP fund-holders were included in the calculation. If the budgets of GP fund-holders - who shop around for hospital care on behalf of their patients - were excluded, district health authorities faced a 'zero or slightly negative real change in their spending power this year'. The survey confirms that there was a sharp increase in hospital activity between 1990-91 and 1991-92. Day cases - patients treated without being admitted to hospital beds - rose by nearly a third. In-patients increased by 3.5 per cent and total out-patient attendances by 3.2 per cent. A drive by the government to ensure that no one waited more than two years for an operation had led to a 97 per cent reduction in people waiting more than two years.</p>

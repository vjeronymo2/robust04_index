			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Ban on use of BT lines for TV to continue The government has ruled out any early lifting of the ban on British Telecommunications using its network to carry television broadcasts, despite BT claims that Britain risks losing out to international competitors in the information revolution. Mr Patrick McLoughlin, the telecommunications minister, has written to the Cable Television Association, which represents the cable companies building combined phone and television networks in urban areas, to reaffirm the government's commitment to maintaining the restrictions on BT. He said the government would stick to the terms of the 1991 telecommunications white paper, which imposed a ban on BT carrying entertainment services in order to foster greater competition in telecommunications. The most significant part of the ban is the block on BT offering additional TV over its network. It appears not to extend to video on demand. The government's determination to curb BT emerged as Sir Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, warned MPs that Britain would lose its leading telecoms position in Europe unless BT went ahead soon with the construction of a national fibre network. Sir Iain told the House of Commons trade and industry committee, which is studying options for such a network, that uncertainty over the future of the enter-tainment ban was hampering BT in its investment planning. 'BT has a leading position in the UK in fibre technology,' Sir Iain said. But its lead was 'partial and tenuous' and without a lifting of the ban it was 'difficult' to see how BT could justify the Pounds 15bn investment necessary to extend fibre to most of the country over the next decade. The fibre would replace copper wires in the local networks, giving flexibility and capacity for a range of new interactive services. Sir Iain likened the possible consequences of failing to upgrade local networks to the decline of the UK's manufacturing industry in the 1980s, against competition from the Far East. According to a senior Whitehall official ministers believe BT is engaged in an elaborate bluff to secure an early lifting of the ban. Under the 1991 white paper, BT is banned from carrying entertainment services over its network until 2001, although Oftel, telecoms regulator, can recommend lifting the ban from 1998. BT is about to start a pilot project at Kesgrave, Suffolk, taking fibre technology into 70 homes, providing services such as video on demand down upgraded lines. Sir Iain agreed that a lifting of the ban in 1998 would not significantly hamper BT. Mercury to spend Pounds 200m, Page 7</p>

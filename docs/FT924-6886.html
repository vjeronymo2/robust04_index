			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Barclays cuts card rate to 22.9% BARCLAYCARD is to cut interest charged on card loans by two percentage points from January 1. The company said the cut will reduce its annualised rate of interest to 22.9 per cent, the lowest since July 1978, John Gapper writes. Mr Richard Reay-Smith, Barclaycard chief executive, said the cut was a planned move to keep interest rates in line with the base rate, rather than a response to recent criticism of charges on credit cards. The cut had to be delayed until January 1 because a cut of one percentage point had been introduced from the start of this month, and Barclaycard technology could not cope with another change so soon. Nationwide Building Society is cutting its basic mortgage rate by 0.74 percentage points to 8.55 per cent. The cut will apply from yesterday for new borrowers, and January 1 for existing borrowers. Midland Bank is cutting its mortgage rate for new borrowers from 9.25 per cent to 8.55 per cent. The rate for first-time buyers is being cut to 7.55 per cent. Existing borrowers' rates will fall on December 21.</p>

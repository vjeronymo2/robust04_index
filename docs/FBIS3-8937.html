			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, March 11--A several dozen strong group of  Solidarity trade union members left the Labour Ministry building  on Friday at about 2100 hrs after waiting in vain 10 hours for  Labour Minister Leszek Miller. Representatives of five  Solidarity regions have come to Labour Ministry to fix the date  for talks between the government and the Solidarity national  commission.    According to the unionists their arrival to the Labour  Ministry resulted from Thursday's televised speech of Minister  Miller in which he invited Solidarity for talks.    In an adopted statement, the unionists said that the fact  that Minister Miller failed to show up means that the  "government's declaration concerning its readiness to dialogue  with Solidarity is simply a sheer lie. That is why the  government side is taking on responsibility for what would  happen in the country," the statement reads.    When the unionists were about to leave, Solidarity leader  Marian Krzaklewski appeared and said that the government's  actual readiness to negotiate had been checked.    He added that the protest action headquarters is to meet in  Katowice on March 13 to discuss possible changes to the protest  action schedule for next week. He announced that the protest  action can escalate if the government does not start talks with  the union.    The unionists were received by Deputy Labour Minister  Andrzej  Baczkowski who said that the government does not see any  justification for conducting separate talks only with  Solidarity. He explained that Minister Miller invited Solidarity  leader Marian Krzaklewski to talks on social guarantees and work  within the tri- partite commission for socio-economic issues.    On Friday minister Miller was paying a visit to Slupsk where  he met with representatives of local governments and the  unemployed.    The unionists represented extracting, metallurgy, power and  arms industries.</p>

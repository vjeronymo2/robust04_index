			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Markets: ISIS: a trust with a novel twist - Serious Money NEW INVESTMENT trusts may be regular occurrences these days, but when one comes along with a different twist and an aggressive marketing campaign, it is worth a closer look. Such is the ISIS trust from Ivory &amp; Sime. Its central plank is exploiting the Pounds 5,800 capital gains tax allowance which many investors leave unused. The sale of shares is taxed under the CGT regime and not as income tax. Under the ISIS scheme, the trust automatically will sell 7 per cent of an investor's holding in order to generate a monthly income plan. The first Pounds 5,800 of income from these sales would be tax-free. For basic-rate taxpayers, a 7 per cent tax-free income would be the equivalent of a 9.33 per cent gross return from a building society. The danger with this route, of course, is that investors could simply be returning their capital to themselves in the form of income. The trust needs to grow at a rate of at least 7 per cent annually for the scheme to work. One important wrinkle in this structure is that the trust is selling all its dividend income to institutions upfront in the form of convertible annuity shares. This has its good and bad sides. The good is that selling the shares (which have virtually no repayment value) boosts the asset value of the ordinary shares by 10 per cent; so, ordinary share investors are buying at a discount to asset value - an unusual position for a new issue. The bad news is that dividend income is an important part of equity return. It will be more difficult for the trust to achieve 7 per cent growth without the help of the market yield. ISIS, however, will be concentrating its portfolio in low-yielding equities where growth prospects should be greater. And the trust says that, since 1945, the market has achieved an annual capital return of 7.8 per cent per annum. Of course, this might not be repeated in the 1990s. There is a further hurdle. Those who want income will be regular sellers; the trust needs a source of buyers to ensure a balance, and to prevent the shares slumping to a discount. Accordingly, it will offer a regular savings plan with the attraction of bonus warrants. These warrants offer the prospect for additional capital gain. For those who are likely to pay CGT, there is a personal equity plan available. The plan certainly is ingenious. Some might argue that there is nothing brilliant about converting capital gain into income and that investors could do it for themselves by selling 7 per cent of their own share portfolios every year. But this would involve substantial costs (especially for small investors); the ISIS method is very cheap. Things could go wrong. A bear market might eat up investors' capital very quickly, and the trust could find that the demands of the income shareholders and the savings scheme do not balance. Philip Middleton, of Smith New Court, says investors should realise that ISIS is not a straight swap for a building society; there is no guarantee of capital. Only those investors comfortable with equity risk should apply. But, he adds, it offers a tax-efficient way of getting income. Another trust trying to raise new money is Fleming Claverhouse, the UK blue-chip fund. Its problem has been success, with demand for shares so swamping supply that the price occasionally has reached a premium of 9 per cent above asset value. The answer is an issue of new shares, available to existing investors and others. Although, because of issue costs, these shares also will be at a premium to asset value, the premium will be smaller  -around 3.6 per cent. The issue looks complicated. 'Conversion' shares are being offered, which are expected to convert into ordinary shares in June. The reason for the complexity is the need to be fair to all shareholders. Immediately after the offer, Fleming Claverhouse will have a pot of new money, ranging from Pounds 100m (the maximum possible) to a more likely Pounds 25m-Pounds 35m. It would not be prudent or wise to invest this money straight away. But if the market rises sharply, the trust's large cash holding would cause it to underperform the index. That would be unfair to existing shareholders. So, the two pools of assets will be kept separate and the two classes of shares combined only when the new money has been invested in the market. It is encouraging to see that good, solid, conventional investment trusts are able to raise new money and Fleming Claverhouse's record certainly makes it a trust worth watching (see Page VI). Meanwhile, three cheers for TR City Of London, which has cut the annual management charge on its personal equity plan. As I reported after the Budget, the change in the tax credit on dividends had made the Pep unattractive for basic-rate taxpayers, since the charge was higher than the tax benefit. Now, TR has cut the charge from 1 per cent to 0.75 per cent annually plus VAT. On a yield of 4.4 per cent, the annual dividend on Pounds 6,000 would be Pounds 264, and the basic rate-payer would save Pounds 52.80 in tax. The annual charge on Pounds 6,000 works out at around Pounds 52.87 per year, so the basic rate-payer will break even. But there is the CGT exemption as well and, once the investment grows to more than Pounds 6,000, the annual charge falls to 0.5 per cent, so the Pep-holder should move into profit.</p>

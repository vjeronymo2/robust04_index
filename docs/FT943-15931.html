			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Major to urge debt relief Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, will press for full implementation of the Trinidad Terms which provide relief of debt owed to western governments by the poorest developing nations when he meets fellow leaders at the Naples economic summit later this week, writes Peter Norman, Economics Editor. UK officials said the prime minister wanted all Group of Seven countries to agree to write off at least 50 per cent of debtor countries' official debts and apply the terms to the whole stock of debt rather than selected maturities under the present workings of the Paris Club of industrialised creditor countries. Mr Major devised the Trinidad Terms in 1990 when chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

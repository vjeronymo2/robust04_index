			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Book Review: Bitter Australian whine, uncorked THE HAWKE MEMOIRS By Bob Hawke William Heinemann Australia ADollars 49.95 or Pounds 15.99, 640 pages Hell may have no fury like a woman scorned, but a rejected politician can make the cauldrons bubble even more furiously. Quite simply, the reminiscences of Mr Bob Hawke - the Rhodes scholar and former union leader who became Australia's prime minister in 1983 and held the job for eight years - are mistitled. Instead of being called The Hawke Memoirs, which gives an impression of gravitas, something with a vaudeville flavour, such as Me and My Enemies, would have been more fitting. For much of the book's 560-odd pages, the butt of its outpourings is Mr Paul Keating, Australia's current prime minister. Mr Keating finally snatched the top job from Mr Hawke in late-1991, after having served as treasurer (finance minister) for most of the Hawke years and following a bruising battle within the Australian Labor party. This leadership struggle was brutal even by the standards of Australian politics, and has been well-documented both on television and in print. But Mr Hawke clearly felt the true tale had not been told. 'I knew this book would cause some unhappiness,' he remarked testily when the book had been panned by almost all Australian commentators last week. 'But the facts have to be told.' Well, yes - but not necessarily with such bitterness and nastiness. As his account rambles through the domestic and international developments his government confronted in the mid-1980s, Mr Hawke rarely misses an opportunity to take a swipe at his successor. Touching, for example, on whether Australia should have allowed the US to conduct missile tests in the Tasman Sea in 1985 - an issue which had become more sensitive because of neighbouring New Zealand's brushes with the US over defence policy - he suddenly sidetracks. Mr Hawke recalls that while he was taking calls from other prominent Labor parliamentarians, including the then foreign minister, Bill Hayden, and defence minister Kim Beazley, Mr Keating telephoned. 'As distinct from those cooler heads, who shared my view (that agreeing to the US request would put at risk the broad defence agreement between the two countries), Paul was gung-ho. He recommended a 'take 'em on, we'll beat 'em, don't back down' approach. Understandably, I took no notice because he was not expert in foreign affairs and he had no understanding of the (missile) issue within the broader framework of maintaining party support for the Australia-US alliance.' Other attacks are more personal. Mr Keating is enthusiastic about European antique clocks - a fact often raised by opposition politicians when they want to play to Australians' dislike of poseurs. But this does not stop Mr Hawke from weighing in, too: 'French Empire clocks were his fascination; he had an absolute passion for them, perhaps not unrelated to visceral republicanism and his tardiness at keeping appointments. 'On a couple of occasions he had me over to his house to explain in loving detail the esoterics of his numerous clocks. They were handsome objects to be sure, but I must say I could think of better ways of filling in my time than polishing them and taking them to pieces and putting them together again.' The shame is that, in pursuit of this vendetta, Mr Hawke misses an opportunity to shed insights into a fascinating period of transformation for Australia. Only briefly does he comment on the thesis that his Labor party was lucky to be in office when social democratic thinking was changing across the western world, and die-hard socialists began to see the virtue of market mechanisms. 'The necessary changes . . . we had to make in party thinking were made when we were an effective government. Had we not been in power there is little doubt that we would have been doomed to a continued irrelevance,' he suggests. But rather than exploring this argument, Mr Hawke reverts to personal aggrandisement. He reduces Australia's reform process to one decision - his, of course. 'There is one simple and indisputable fact . . . and it is, arguably, the single most important fact in the history of Australian politics in the last two decades of this century. If I had not dumped Option C (the potential introduction of a consumption tax) in 1985, Labor would have lost the 1987 election. Labor would not have been continuously in power for 13 years by 1996, and there would have been no prime ministerial mantle for Paul Keating to seize in 1991.' Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the book is its stilted language, and sugary sentimentality. Summing up one early trade union acquaintance, for example, Mr Hawke writes: 'The private man was one who had a profound knowledge and love of classical music and a dedication to gardening.' Another individual's cynicism is described as being 'leavened, however, by a witty ebullience and an enjoyment in interacting with those around him'. Time and again, Mr Hawke claims a personal empathy with the Australian electorate. 'In 1983, as I travelled the length and breadth of the continent calling for an end to division and a fresh start, I was aware of an enormous reservoir of goodwill towards me. One of my many public psychoanalysts has said that I walk everywhere in a warm tropical breeze, as if this was somehow a bad thing. In fact, I do.' Judging by local reaction to the book last week, the winds have changed. Still, the initial print run is one of the largest planned in Australia, so Mr Hawke should end up a richer man. By all accounts, his next literary offering will be a form guide to Australian racing - a penchant of Mr Hawke's which rivals Mr Keating's enthusiasm for clocks. One can only tremble for the horses that have let him down.</p>

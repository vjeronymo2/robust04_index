			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Student total in England increases 9% The total number of students in English higher education rose by 9 per cent to 1.177m last year, according to statistics released by the Department for Education. New entrants rose by 5 per cent to 580,000. A majority were 'mature students', aged 21 or over. Since 1989, students enrolled for full-time courses have risen by 55 per cent. Mrs Gillian Shephard, education secretary, said: 'The university world no longer caters for the privileged few. Five years ago, only one in six young people entered higher education - today the figure is almost one in three. Universities today cater for a greater variety, with more than a third entering higher education to study part-time.' She described higher education as an 'unsung success story', but added that universities would continue evolving to offer 'more diversity and choice'. The numbers entering for a first degree at or after the age of 25 have increased by 146 per cent since 1989, from 14,500 to 35,800, while mature students now account for 52.3 per cent of all new entrants below postgraduate level - up from 49.2 per cent in 1989. Women studying part-time appear to have accounted for the bulk of the increase in mature students, with numbers doubling from 15,600 in 1989 to 31,800 last year. A total of 47,200 students started on full-time postgraduate courses, a 65 per cent increase on 1989, while there was a 74 per cent increase in part-time postgraduate courses over the same period. Expansion was helped by foreign students. At postgraduate level new students from other European Union countries rose 20 per cent, from 6,100 to 7,300, while other foreign recruitment rose 14 per cent to 18,400. At first-degree level, recruitment from the EU, which has been made easier by the single-market regulations, rose 19 per cent to 7,500. Mr Jim Murphy, president of the National Union of Students, said reductions in funding per student were weakening academic quality. 'This is not a success story . . . it is a sign of failure,' he said. The government has announced a three-year period of 'consolidation'. Student numbers will be capped at their present level and higher education institutions will be penalised financially if they exceed their target numbers for admissions. They are expected to achieve budget cuts of 10 per cent during this period.</p>

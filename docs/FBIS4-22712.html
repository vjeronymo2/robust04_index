			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, head of Maritime Kray </F> Administration, by VLADIVOSTOK correspondent Vladimir Oshchenko;  place and date not given: "Yevgeniy Nazdratenko: I Defend the  Interests of the State and Maritime Kray"]    [Text] Head of the Maritime Kray Administration  Yevgeniy Nazdratenko spent 11 days in April outside the  territory entrusted to him. He was in Seoul--the capital of  South Korea--for a day, and then without a stopover in  Vladivostok flew to another capital--Moscow, where he  participated in the work of the supreme legislative chamber of  the Russian parliament--the Federation Council.    Immediately on his return from this long trip, Yevgeniy  Nazdratenko met with our VLADIVOSTOK correspondent.    [Oshchenko] You have emphasized many times that you select  your foreign travel priorities in such a way as to avoid places  where the Maritime Kray governor is invited mainly for  representation. In other words, you go abroad only when there is  an opportunity to solve some of the kray's problems with the  help of foreign states or companies. What prompted you to go to  Seoul?    [Nazdratenko] Seoul was the site of the third annual joint  conference of the Committee for Cooperation Between the Russian  Far East and Siberia and the Republic of Korea and the  Association for Cooperation Between the Republic of Korea and  the Russian Far East and Siberia. I was invited as a chairman  for the Russian side. Heads of administrations of practically  all Siberian and Far Eastern territories, including ethnic  entities, also participated in the conference.    This conference was conducted on a very representative  level;  in essence, its task was to prepare Russian-South Korean  economic projects, which will be discussed during the upcoming  visit of South Korean President Kim Yong-sam to Moscow. Among  the conference participants were the ministers of the most  important ministries of South Korea--foreign affairs, labor, and  industry.    As the association's chairman from the Russian side, I  delivered an extensive report. I will be honest--I did not write  it myself, but specialists from the Maritime Kray  administration's foreign economic services did a very  professional job, and the report did not have even a hint of  overstressing the special role of Maritime Kray. Although one  has to admit the simple truth that today the Maritime Kray  population, counting the military, numerically exceeds the  population of Khabarovsk Kray, Kamchatka, Sakhalin, and Magadan  Oblast taken together.    Unfortunately, local interests were brought up at the  meeting  in Seoul, in particular, by Vladimir Saganov, chairman of the  Republic of Buryatia's Council of Ministers, who announced the  intention to conduct separate negotiations and sign separate  agreements. I was compelled to remind all Russian participants  of the conference in Seoul that there is one single Russian  Federation, which has one president--Boris Yeltsin. And that  agreements may be signed either with the president of Russia, or  with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Not with a chairman of  the Buryat council of ministers or a Maritime Kray governor...    Of course, South Korea continues very active cooperation  with  Russia, despite the fact that foreign investment in our country  is hampered by the existing imbalance between political,  economic, and legal relations. Recall for instance the  Hende-Svetlaya [as transliterated] company, and the 22-story  South Korean business center currently under construction in the  center of Vladivostok... These are concrete contributions to our  economy.    I hope that the meetings in Seoul and the work of our  foreign  economic relations specialists will allow us to expand this work  with South Korean companies. First and foremost in the direction  where Maritime Kray has the worst bottleneck: I mean, of course,  power generation. For us, freight rates turn coal from other  regions of Russia into gold. If we continue bringing coal from  the outside, in the winter of 1994-95 a kilowatt-hour of  electric power will cost 270 rubles [R]; this winter, which was  very hard for industry, a kilowatt cost R40. Therefore, in  searching for a solution we decided to open work on several coal  deposits on kray territory. The idea is simple, although this  is, of course, an emergency program: to strip open before winter  several coal deposits--where stripping is about 2-4 meters. It  would be good to get several Korean companies involved in  construction of these strip mines. Although we do have a problem  with respect to payment: The Koreans would like to get this coal  as payment in kind, but we desperately need it ourselves. Still,  I sensed that the Korean side is showing interest in working in  Maritime Kray.    Perhaps rich Maritime Kray companies can join this  project--those that already have began to invest money in the  kray economy, such as for instance AKFES (Mikhail Dalman) or  Roliz (Sergey Darkin). They are building, and we are very  grateful to them...    [Oshchenko] What happened during your trip to Moscow?    [Nazdratenko] I took part in the work of the Federation  Council. Unfortunately, this work did not produce a lot of  results. The Federation Council accomplished only one concrete  thing: It accepted the budget message for the second quarter.  Although the budget has some shortcomings, the main one being  that the money does not get to the territories, it has good  figures built into it. At the same time, we have to acknowledge  that this is an interim document.    Otherwise, the Federation Council got bogged down in a  boring  politicized intrigue, and this is very disappointing. The  incident with the firing and resignation of General Procurator  Kazannik is nothing more than the desire of the anti-president  opposition to look for any pretext to hit Yeltsin. I was among  those 68 deputies who voted for Kazannik's resignation; 74 voted  against it. I said at the Federation Council that if the general  procurator had read the Russian Constitution, he should know  that it is the Federation Council that relieves him from the  job. Why then did he write his resignation letter to the  president and then disappear in Tomsk for a month and a half?  Anybody who does not show up for work for a month and a half  should be fired for absenteeism...    The Federation Council spent two days discussing the problem  of crime and its suppression, but did not adopt any real  decisions.    [Oshchenko] I assume that you certainly had some official  meetings in Moscow on the subject of the situation with liquid  radioactive waste storage in Bolshoy Kamen. Were you able to  resolve anything?    [Nazdratenko] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the  Ministry of Ecology of the Russian Federation have prepared a  document stating that dumping from the tanker cannot be done  without the government's consent. Meanwhile, the tanker with  liquid radioactive waste [LRW] may simply burst without asking  permission from the government and Nazdratenko. I met with  Minister of Foreign Affairs Kozyrev, and our positions on this  matter are close: The money (whether from the Russian government  or Japan, if the latter decides to help us) for LRW utilization  must be used in Maritime Kray--not by some firm in Moscow which  for some reason will solve our problems better than we can  ourselves. I also met with Japan's ambassador extraordinary and  plenipotentiary in Moscow, and during this meeting emphasized  once again the kray administration's extreme concern at the  situation with tankers and our desire to quickly and safely  resolve this problem--preferably with the participation of  Japanese companies, which have already developed effective  methods. We could solve this problem in 20 days, were it not for  all these diplomatic games. The Japanese ambassador also told me  that if his government does decide to allocate money, it will be  only on the condition that the money goes to Maritime Kray.    [Oshchenko] Recently rumors started spreading in Vladivostok  that your lengthy trips to Moscow are not accidental and very  soon you will leave "our city" with a promotion. Rumor has it  that some government bulletin published a list of members of the  future government, where you are listed as the minister of  industry...    [Nazdratenko] I am not going anywhere. This is what  happened.  PRAVITELSTVENNYY VESTNIK magazine published a preliminary list  of members of the government, and my name was listed as one of  the candidates. I talked to both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin and  told them that I am not going anywhere. I have made a promise to  work in Maritime Kray (for better or for worse is for the people  to decide)...    [Oshchenko] And you cannot be tempted by any job whatsoever?    [Nazdratenko] No... I love Maritime Kray so much, and it is  so important to make life better here that a bureaucratic career  is not for me. I also want very much to remind kray residents:  At the kray soviet session in May 1993 I told the deputies that  for two more years we will retreat and move backwards under the  pressure of crisis and ruin. At what speed is another  question... We have not yet left the crisis behind us, and I  simply cannot in clear conscience abandon Maritime Kray for  Moscow high offices.</p>

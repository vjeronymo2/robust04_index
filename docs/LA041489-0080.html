			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2,550 EVACUATED AS YOUNG PLAYERS FALL ILL AT CONCERT  </P> <P> Some 2,550 persons were evacuated from Santa Monica Civic Auditorium Thursday  night after performers in a student concert started fainting or complaining of  illness, but Santa Monica firefighters said they were unable to find any trace  of toxic fumes.  </P> <P> Eighteen students, most of them girls, were taken to five area hospitals where  doctors said none appeared to be in serious condition, doctors said.  </P> <P> It was the 40th annual Stairway of The Stars, produced by the Santa  Monica-Malibu Unified School District. The concert featured 1,100 members of  the district's bands, choruses and orchestras from the 4th through 12th grades.  Another 1,450 spectators were in the audience, district president Bob Holbrook  said.  </P> <P> "Everyone left in an orderly manner," Holbrook said, "but some of the children  were pretty frightened."  </P> <P> A spokesperson for the fire department, Cathy Weinstein, said, "Firefighters  made two sweeeps of the auditorium with meters to measure toxic substances and  found no evidence of physical cause."  </P> <P> Earlier in the day at rehearsals,"about 12 girls fainted, but we just thought  it was stress and hunger although some students complained of dizziness or  nausea" and the students were released to go home until the performance, an  unidentified school official said.  </P> <P> Some students complained that there had just "been a bad odor," others  complained of paint odors and other compared it with the smell of pesticides on  the outside lawn. Some students complained of nausea, lightheadness or upset  stomachs, paramedics said.  </P> <P> "Some of those who fainted were out cold," Holbrook said.  </P> <P> Lee McNett, chief fire department paramedic, said, "There are several things  that could have caused it. One of the things we have speculated on is mass  hysteria."  </P> <P> Rich Farmer, a photographer at the scene, said, "When I got there, there were  just rows and rows of kids lying on stretchers. Some of them had their  instruments beside them, but everyone seemed pretty calm. There were little  girls in formals crying."  </P></p>

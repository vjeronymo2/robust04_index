			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE COMMERCIAL ROCKET LAUNCH CANCELED BY WEATHER  </P> <P> American Rocket Co. of Camarillo hoped to take a giant leap into the commercial  race to space Thursday. Instead, it took a small step backward when bad weather  and a mechanical problem scrubbed the company's first rocket launch.  </P> <P> The rocket was to have carried two payloads on a 15-minute unmanned suborbital  flight. One was a Defense Department chemical experiment and the other was a  capsule designed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  </P> <P> But about 20 minutes before the 1:13 p.m. scheduled liftoff, there was  lightning offshore, and the Air Force, which was supervising the launch, called  it off. There was also a mechanical problem with the rocket's roll thrusters,  devices that help guide the rocket.  </P> <P> "It's not a critical (mechanical) failure," said George Whittinghill, American  Rocket's director of marketing. "The rocket could have flown without" the  thrusters, he said. "The key problem was the weather."  </P> <P> The company hopes to launch the rocket soon, possibly on Monday.  </P> <P> American Rocket is one of about half a dozen fledgling companies trying to make  a go of it in the space industry. The companies eventually hope to launch  low-cost payloads into Earth orbit, including medical and scientific  experiments.  </P></p>

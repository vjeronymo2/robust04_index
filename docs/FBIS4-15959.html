A large scale demobilization of officers  is said to be currently under way on the Latvian territory; many  of the officers of liquidated units are being transferred to  regular posts in other units stationed in Latvia; warrants for  permanent residence are being requested from the Immigration and  Citizenship Department in districts where there are no Army  units officially stationing in Latvia; military servicemen of  the Russian Army are illegally obtaining passports with Latvian  residence registration, in order to infiltrate later among the  Latvian population; military pensioners engage in commercial  ventures, establishing their own companies and creating security  brigades for their protection, which can be later used in armed  actions against Latvia.</p>

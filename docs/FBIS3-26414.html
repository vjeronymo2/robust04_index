The venture will produce 300,000 such controllers a year and  the output could hit 600,000 when the market demand increases.    The new engine controlling system cuts fuel consumption by 5  to 10 percent while decreasing waste gas by 60 to 90 percent,  compared with the old system.    China has listed the system as a key national project in the  Eighth Five-Year Plan period and the Ninth Five-Year Plan.    The two Chinese corporations are the Beijing Wanyuan  Industrial Corporation and the Beijing Economic Investment and  Development Corporation.    The new venture, Beijing Wanyuan-General Motor  Electronic-Control Co. Ltd., will start with a 30 million U.S.  dollar investment, to be followed by another 120 million U.S.  dollars.    The new venture will use the technology of the American  vehicle manufacturing giant.</p>

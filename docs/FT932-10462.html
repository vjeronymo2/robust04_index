			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / International Company News: GM to invest Dollars 100m in Argentine vehicle plant GENERAL Motors plans to invest Dollars 100m in Argentina to set up a utility vehicle plant producing 25,000 units a year beginning in 1994. The government said GM, acting through its Brazilian subsidiary, would join forces with CIADEA, a local car company, which will hold an undisclosed minority stake in the venture. GM quit Argentina 15 years ago as political unrest engulfed the country and the economy began declining. Its return is being hailed as an indication of increasing international confidence in Argentina's economic reforms and proof that badly-needed investments in industry are beginning to appear. The announcement comes as car companies in Brazil and Argentina are increasing integration and co-operation. However, of the region's six volume car makers, only Brazil-based GM and Argentina's CIADEA, which builds Renault cars under licence, had failed to build a cross-border relationship. The new GM-CIADEA trucks will be sold on the local market and exported to Brazil. In addition to the GM investment, CIADEA said it would invest a further Dollars 20m to expand its plant in the city of Cordoba and begin building other GM vehicles under licence for sale in both markets.</p>

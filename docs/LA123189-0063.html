			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: MIKI HOWARD "MIKI HOWARD." ATLANTIC ** 1/2: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A  SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Like Regina Belle, Howard is a new-generation R&amp;B singer who emerged in the  mid-'80s. Both like to dabble with jazz, but each sounds best when opting for  the unburnished soul route. Like Belle, Howard (who headlines the Roxy tonight  and Monday) is a stylish vocalist who is frequently at the mercy of her  producers and material. When they're not in peak form, she can't always rise  above them. The producer who serves Howard best on this project is Nick  Martinelli. The sure touch he supplies on "Love Under New Management" is superb  and he gets a rich, gospel-fueled performance out of the Chicago-born singer.  The rest of the album is spotty, going from excellent on the funky little  exercise "Ain't Nuthin' in the World," to lackluster on a version of Aretha  Franklin's "Until You Come Back," a track that flounders because it's too tame  and faithful to the original.

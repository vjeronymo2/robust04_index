			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 14 (CNA) -- Taiwan's booming export  years are fading.    As exports continue to slide, Taiwan's trade surplus this  year is expected to drop to a 13-year low of U.S.$2 billion,  compared to U.S.$18.7 billion in 1987, the Board of Foreign  Trade (BOFT) reported Friday [13 May].    Taiwan's trade surplus continued to fall in the first four  months of this year, even after the island recorded its lowest  trade surplus in nine years in 1993, BOFT Deputy  Director-General Lin Yi-fu said.    If the trend persists, he said, Taiwan is doomed to become  an  import-oriented country rather than an export-oriented one.    Lin said the development may serve as an important early  warning signal for Taiwan, an economy heavily dependent on  manufacturing industries and exports.    As exports are becoming less vital, domestic demand will  become the prime mover behind the country's economic growth in  the future, Lin maintained.    Lin hoped that Taiwan would follow in the footsteps of  Singapore in keeping a surplus in its international balance of  payments despite running a deficit in foreign trade.    Singapore has witnessed deficits in foreign trade during the  last five years. It, however, maintained a comfortable  international balance of payments surplus of U.S.$3 billion in  1992, with its two-way trade deficit exceeding U.S.$8.7 billion,  Lin said.    Meanwhile, Lin hoped that Taiwan would not turn out to be  the  second South Korea, which was ousted from the informal "Asian's  four little dragons" grouping last year because of its  relatively poor economic performance.    South Korea has suffered a continued decline in exports  during the last few years due to sluggish industrial  development. Its economy failed to pick up because other  domestic industries, including the service industry, didn't rise  to fill the vacancies left by departing manufacturing  industries, Lin said.    According to customs tallies, Taiwan exported U.S.$27.58  billion worth of goods and services in the January-April period  of this year, up 2.3 percent over the similar period last year,  with metal, electrical machinery, and textile products  dominating the export list.    Imports during the four-month period totaled U.S.$26.98  billion, up 7.2 percent over a year-earlier, with capital  equipment, industrial and farm raw materials, metals, and  chemicals leading the trade.    During the four months, exports to the United States, Japan  and Europe all declined while Taiwan's deficit with Japan  increased, Lin said.</p>

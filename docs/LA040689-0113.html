			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> VICTIM WAS BACKING AWAY, WITNESS SAYS  </P> <P> Malik Smith, son of actress Beverly Todd and television director Kris Kaiser,  was backing away from an argument at a Salt Lake City disco when accused  assailant John Leota threw the punch that killed him, a prosecution witness  testified Wednesday.  </P> <P> Smith, 18, who lived in Los Angeles and was on a ski vacation, died two days  after the encounter. Preliminary hearings are being held to decide whether  Leota, who is charged with second-degree murder, should stand trial.  </P> <P> Chris Foote said he was at Club 35, a West Valley disco, the night of March 18  and saw Leota, also 18, strike Smith.  </P> <P> Foote said that when Leota hit Smith, the punch "lifted him six inches off the  floor."  </P> <P> Before he was hit, it appeared Smith was stepping backward away from an  argument with Leota, Foote added.  </P></p>

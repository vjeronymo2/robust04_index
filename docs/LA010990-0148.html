			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BAKER'S HOPES FADE FOR TALKS BETWEEN ISRAELIS, PALESTINIANS  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III has told a visiting foreign minister he  is losing hope of achieving a breakthrough that would lead to  Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and said he may soon drop his initiative,  diplomatic sources said today.  </P> <P> The sources said Baker sounded very pessimistic on the Middle East in a private  meeting with Norwegian Foreign Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik at the State  Department Monday.  </P> <P> "It was very surprising and worrying," said one source present at the meeting.  </P> <P> "Bondevik urged Baker to persevere and said his initiative represents the only  hope of progress but Baker said that with so many other things happening in the  world, he might soon decide to devote all his time to areas where there was  some hope of getting things done," the source said.  </P></p>

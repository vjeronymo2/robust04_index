			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Appointments: BPB arranges succession Alan Turner, chief executive of BPB INDUSTRIES since 1978, yesterday signalled his intention of standing down from the top job at Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer. John Maxwell, formerly chief executive of financial services company Provincial Group, joins as finance director, and chief executive designate. Current finance director Brian Hogben, 63, retires after 18 years in that job. Turner, who is 60 next year, said that after an introductory period, 'probably months', he would step down as chief executive but would remain as chairman. Maxwell, 47, previously worked for Grand Metropolitan and Rank Xerox. Peter Sydney-Smith, 39, finance director of British Gypsum, a subsidiary, will be deputy group finance director, and is expected to take over as finance director when Maxwell becomes chief executive. 'In some ways it is the end of an era' Turner commented yesterday. ' Brian Hogben and I have been with the group for more than 30 years. 'But this is not a sudden move, although it might appear so. It is important for companies to arrange succession properly and we have been considering this move for some time.' BPB has recently been fighting a fierce price war with Lafarge Coppee of France and Knauf of Germany, and has also suffered with the severe downturn in UK construction.</p>

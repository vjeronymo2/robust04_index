			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUOTES FROM COUSINS  </P> <P> Norman Cousins was disturbed that his use of laughter as a metaphor for  positive emotions might be oversimplified.  </P> <P> "I don't want people to think they can make any problem disappear just by  ha-ha-ha-ing it away."  </P> <P>  He emphasized that a good attitude could improve the life of someone coping  with disease, even if it couldn't cure disease.  </P> <P>  "The important thing is what we do while we're alive. The great tragedy of  life is not death, but what dies inside us while we live."  </P> <P>  Cousins implored physicians to consider the patient's emotional state and  promote an optimistic outlook.  </P> <P>  "If you treat just the disease without treating the emotional devastation  caused by the disease, you're only treating half a patient."  </P> <P>  Cousins chided Americans for being overly concerned with their weaknesses and  downplaying their strengths.  </P> <P>  "We are becoming a nation of sissies and hypochondriacs, a self-medicating  society easily intimidated by pain and prone to panic. We understand almost  nothing about the essential robustness of the human body or its ability to meet  the challenge of illness."  </P> <P> </P></p>

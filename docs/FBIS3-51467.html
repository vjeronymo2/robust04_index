			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Roberto Morejon commentary from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] Nova Scotia Prime Minister John Savage said upon  arriving in Havana last Monday that he was heading a delegation  of representatives from 17 firms for the basic purpose of  discussing trade. Upon ending the visit, however, Savage said  it had met and surpassed his goals.    Savage and his entourage were received by Cuban President  Fidel Castro, and Savage showed his great sensibility as a  person and a doctor. He was impressed with the Cuban people's  determination to move ahead and overcome the current economic  crisis. Savage, who won the post of prime minister for the  Liberal Party last May, presides over the government of a  province of the Canadian Atlantic Coast, 80 percent of which is  forest land. The province has great hydroelectric potential and  is noted for its fishing.    The experience of visitors in this area will serve to  promote  the recently signed fishing accord with Cuba as well as to  analyze additional operations. Not only did both parties sign  accords on fishing, but Canadians and Cubans established a  passenger cruise service for tourists. They also decided to  create a mixed enterprise to produce soap, and Cuba agreed to  purchase Canadian wood while Nova Scotia will receive Cuban  citrus.    In addition, Savage and his delegation showed interest in  the  current transformation process of Cuban agriculture, evaluated  the prospects for greater Canadian participation in mining, and  drafted other mixed enterprise projects with Cuba.    Savage termed the visit by he and his entourage as  advantageous and very fruitful. For Cuba, it represents an  opportunity to expand ties following the loss of its traditional  commercial partners.    This visit, the first to Cuba by a Canadian provincial prime  minister in 17 years, also contributed to coordinating future  cooperation in developing ecological tourism, one of the basic  objectives of tourism in Cuba, which has been given priority by  the authorities.    The contacts proved that the relations initiated have  potential to expand to such areas as culture as well as to  increase in the areas of economic associations and investments.  The businessmen from Nova Scotia and other Canadian regions are  not prepared to lose the commercial opportunities offered by  Cuba, which represent mutual benefits, at the hands of increased  U.S. pressure to frustrate any commercial negotiations to which  Cuba is a partner.    We cannot forget that the Canadian Government maintains a  respectful attitude toward Cuba, that the island represents its  fourth largest trading partner in America, and that 22 of the  112 commercial associations operating in Cuba with foreign  capital are Canadian.</p>

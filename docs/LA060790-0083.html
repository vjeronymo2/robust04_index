			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CITY CLERK NULLIFIES RECALL EFFORT IN INGLEWOOD  </P> <P> A recall effort launched last month against Inglewood City Councilman Garland  Hardeman has been declared void because the petitioners failed to meet their  first deadline, city officials said this week.  </P> <P> City Clerk Hermanita Harris said supporters did not meet the May 18 deadline  for submitting a sample petition to her office and showing proof that the  recall was advertised in a local newspaper.  </P> <P> Hardeman, elected last October to represent the 4th District, called the recall  effort "a frustrated attempt to try to embarrass me" organized by a small group  of political opponents.  </P> <P> Notice of intent to recall was filed in early May by Richard Kaufman.  Proponents were listed as Mamie Moore, Charles Moore, Viola Grahame, Donald  Robinson and Peggy Robinson. None of the petitioners could be reached for  comment Wednesday.  </P></p>

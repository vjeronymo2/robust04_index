			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / World Trade News: UK rejects trade ban on Cuba by US BRITAIN yesterday acted to circumvent US attempts to reinforce a trade embargo on Cuba, saying that Downing Street and not Capitol Hill would determine British trade policy with the Caribbean island. The government invoked an existing law - the Protection of Trading Interests Act - to prohibit UK companies owned by US interests from complying with proposed US legislation banning them from trading with Cuba. The law is designed to enable the government to provide a legal response to extraterritorial measures such as the offending Cuban Democracy Act, which is waiting to be approved by President George Bush. The British move follows an angry reaction from the European Commission which said earlier this month that the proposed extension of the US embargo had 'the potential to cause grave damage to the transatlantic relationship'. In a strongly worded statement, Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, said he would not accept any attempt to 'superimpose US law on UK companies'. 'The British government, not the US Congress, will determine the UK's policy on trade with Cuba,' he said. British policy is to encourage companies to exploit civil market opportunities in Cuba. British exports to the island were worth Pounds 28.4m in 1991.</p>

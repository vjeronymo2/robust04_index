			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Office Automation (23): Happy birthday, Liz - Electronic messaging / Public bulletin board systems are now finding wide use in business Bulletin board systems are no longer the exclusive preserve of young PC enthusiasts who swap virus programs and broadcast 'Happy Birthday Liz' or other, less flattering, messages to each other. Indeed, Mr Reg Scaife and his colleagues in the UK Industrial Sugar Users Group confess to being middle-aged or older and in many cases completely new to information technology. Yet they now regularly dial into the CIX public bulletin board system to share the latest news from Brussels and electronically discuss topics planned for their next meeting, writes John Kavanagh. The Industrial Sugar Users Group consists of 55 companies such as Cadbury, Mars and Nestle, plus five trade associations, including the British Soft Drinks Association and the Ice Cream Federation. These organisations account for well over half the UK's sugar consumption. Reg Scaife is the group's secretary. He is a keen PC user and got hooked on CIX in 1991 when he discovered it was a good source of advice on office systems. He often leaves queries and finds that suppliers and other users key in their suggestions. Mr Scaife saw that a bulletin board system could benefit the Industrial Sugar Users Group. With members' agreement he created a private conference on CIX, open only to group members. 'We felt that things needed to be done more quickly but at the same time dragging everyone to London for emergency meetings was not ideal,' he says. 'Even using the telephone and fax is time-consuming and frustrating and you're never certain if someone has received a message. 'We can now cope with emergencies. For example if a Brussels announcement demands a quick response or a statement to the press, we can clear it with the group's officers very quickly. 'In addition, we have more productive meetings. A bulletin board system can't replace face-to-face meetings but our three or four meetings a year are now better prepared. We discuss issues beforehand through CIX, so our meetings concentrate on the topics which have emerged as most important,' he adds. Minutes are available through CIX almost immediately afterwards. In addition, when Mr Scaife attends an EC meeting in Brussels he prepares a report on his PC and transmits it to CIX before going to bed - 'one of our members starts work at 7am, so he can see a report on yesterday's Brussels meeting as soon as he gets in,' Mr Scaife says. The system depends to an extent on people disciplining themselves to dial in regularly - 'one benefit is that you can choose to look at your messages when it fits in with what you're doing, whereas the phone forces you to stop and deal with the call,' Reg Scaife says. 'However, this does mean that if things go quiet for a fortnight, people slacken off logging in. I try to keep them in the habit by putting in news relating to the industry.' Connection charges have been cut dramatically by the use of a software product known as an off-line reader. Without such products, users have to key in text and read messages while on-line, incurring hefty connection charges and telephone costs. An off-line reader enables a user to prepare text beforehand and send it in one burst; the reader also retrieves messages and stores them on the user's own computer disc. The off-line readers used as standard by the sugar users group are from Ashmount Research: Telepathy for those using the DOS operating system and Wigwam for those with Microsoft Windows. These products also organise incoming messages into a database for easier reference. Reg Scaife says using Wigwam has cut his CIX and associated telephone charges from Pounds 60 to Pounds 17 a month, even though his use of the system has increased. Despite the amount of text he sends and receives, he is rarely on-line for more than two minutes. Compulink Information Exchange This product, CIX, is a public bulletin board, conference system and electronic mail service. Private conferences can also be set up. CIX enables users to send faxes from their personal computers. It also provides a link to the world-wide Internet service. Supplier: Compulink Information Exchange, a UK company formed in 1987 with the sole business of running the service. Number of users: CIX says 'tens of thousands.' Price: Pounds 25 registration fee, then connection charges of 6p per minute at peak rate and 4p off peak, plus VAT. There are also the standard telephone charges. Contacts: CIX is on (0492) 641961 and 081-390 8446. Its main competitor is Compuserve, on 0800 289458, which offers access to a wide range of information databases. Ashmount Research, supplier of Wigwam for both CIX and Compuserve, is on 071-935 7712.</p>

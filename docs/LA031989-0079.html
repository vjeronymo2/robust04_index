			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> W. HOLLYWOOD CHAMBER WON'T BACK BOND ISSUE  </P> <P> Opponents of a $7.6-million bond issue to build a new library and fire station  in West Hollywood last week gained an ally in the West Hollywood Chamber of  Commerce, which announced it will not support the proposal.  </P> <P> Calling the measure burdensome, chamber President Mark Lehman said the group is  concerned "with the prospect of having tax proposals presented in a piecemeal  fashion without adequate consideration of the cumulative impact" on businesses.  </P> <P> But he and other officials were careful to point out that the chamber's  opposition is unrelated to the city's plans to build a civic center in West  Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Civic center opponents have sought to make the bond measure -- to be decided by  voters on April 11 -- a referendum on the center. They view the measure as a  backhanded attempt to squeeze more money for the center, since both the library  and fire station were originally part of the center's design.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chamber's Stand  </P> <P> In an interview, Lehman said that the chamber "isn't coming out against the  bond measure. . . . All we're saying is that we aren't going to support it.  We're not going to get involved."  </P> <P> However, in a message mailed to 450 chamber members outlining the position of  the group's six-member executive committee, Lehman sounded a negative note.  </P> <P> "We must address and develop compensating strategies to improve parking and  other business concerns before we burden our city businesses that are already  suffering from increasing competition from neighboring communities," the  message said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a leading opponent of the civic center whose group is campaigning  against the bond measure said he was pleased with the announcement.  </P> <P> "They (chamber officials) don't want to rattle cages any more than they have  to, because they don't want to lose any friends on the City Council, but their  position is favorable to us, so we've got to be happy," said Tom Larkin,  chairman of the Save Our Parks Alliance.  </P> <P> Four of the five City Council members are on record as supporting the project,  with Councilman Steve Schulte opposed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reserve Fund  </P> <P> Angered by plans to use scarce park space for the civic center, opponents have  argued that the city should dip into its $14-million reserve fund to pay for  the fire station and library and then let voters decide whether the center  should be built.  </P> <P> Larkin's group hopes to place an initiative on the April, 1990, ballot aimed at  preventing the civic center from being built in the park.  </P> <P> The group last week submitted 3,358 signatures to the city clerk's office. Only  2,182 valid signatures are needed to qualify the measure for the 1990 ballot.  The validation process is expected to take a month.  </P> <P> However, city officials have hinted they may try to challenge the legality of  the initiative, should it qualify for the ballot.  </P> <P> City Manager Paul Brotzman said there was some question as to whether such an  initiative could be used to restrict the City Council's powers in deciding how  park space is used.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two-Thirds Vote  </P> <P> He and other officials have insisted that the prospect of a ballot initiative  would not interfere with West Hollywood's ability to finance the project.  </P> <P> City officials have budgeted $1.5 million for civic center planning for the  current fiscal year, which ends June 30. In addition to the architects, a  project engineer has been on the job for several months, and preliminary design  work and site surveying continues.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the center's opponents have focused their attention on defeating the  bond measure, which requires a two-thirds vote for passage.  </P> <P> The 61-member West Hollywood Community Alliance, which consists mostly of  owners of small businesses on the city's east side, is expected to make known  its position on the bond issue this week.  </P> <P> The group has scheduled a community forum on Wednesday featuring Schulte, who  has been prominent in opposing the bond issue along with the civic center, and  Councilman John Heilman, an outspoken supporter of placing the center in the  park.  </P> <P> If approved, the bond issue would increase property taxes by up to $33.47 per  $100,000 of assessed valuation over the next 20 years to pay for the new fire  station and quadruple the size of the county branch library that serves West  Hollywood.  </P> <P> "I haven't met a business person yet who supports the bond issue, and my  feeling is that most of the people in the business community don't favor the  park being used for the civic center," said Mike Radcliffe, who is on the West  Hollywood Community Alliance board of directors.  </P> <P> However, Lehman offered a different view.  </P> <P> "My understanding is that the bulk of chamber members are supportive of the  civic center. I think the perception is that we've been through a long haul,  it's an expensive process, and we ought to go forward with it."  </P></p>

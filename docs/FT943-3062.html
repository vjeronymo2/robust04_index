			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures took a beating yesterday, hit first by the release of disappointing UK inflation data and tumbling further in mid-afternoon when the cash market came under heavy selling pressure, writes Jeffrey Brown. The September contract on the FT-SE 100 got under way at 3,120 but deteriorated almost from the opening. It closed at 3,064, with the discount to the cash market standing at 16 and a fair value premium of slightly under one point. The retreat was mostly led by independent traders - locals - who continued to dominate business, but at least one leading institutional marketmaker was said to be active on a day when volume was broadly in line with the previous day. Trading volume totalled 21,874 lots, with up to 8,000 of this reflecting roll-over into the December contract, where turnover was just short of 10,000. The September contract expires tomorrow morning. Activity in traded options tailed off, falling slightly below 40,000, against 56,282 on Tuesday. FT-SE option volume just topped 20,000, making 24,948 with the inclusion of the Euro FT-SE option trade. Barclays (2,082 lots) and Glaxo (1,704) were the most actively traded individual stock options, with British Petroleum and HSBC Holdings not far behind.</p>

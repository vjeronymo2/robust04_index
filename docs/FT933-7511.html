			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADING volumes remained high in the London derivatives markets yesterday but they drifted lower in the absence of the overseas demand seen in the previous session, writes Terry Byland. In stock index futures, the September Footsie contract broke through 3,100, moving to a new trading peak of 3,201 in early trading, but this level was lost as it became clear that there was no follow-through to what had clearly been the buying orders in the overnight postbag. A disappointing interim report from Hang Seng Bank, the Hong Kong subsidiary of HSBC, and then a substantial, and unexpected, rise in the US trade deficit, undermined both stock index futures and the underlying share prices. The September contract fell to 3,065 before steadying to close at 3,073, virtually in line with the fair value premium estimated at 4 points against the cash market. Turnover reached 12,374 contracts. Volume in traded options dipped to 46,299 contracts from Wednesday's 74,157 as traders braced themselves for expiry today of the Footsie Index options. The Footsie Option traded 15,523 contracts and the Euro Footsie 5,549 yesterday. Among individual stock options, British Gas stood out with 3,553 contracts as investors continued to weigh the import of the report from the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</p>

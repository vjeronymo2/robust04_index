			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KARCHER, FAMILY TO PAY $664,000 TO SETTLE INSIDER TRADING LAWSUIT  </P> <P> Carl N. Karcher, founder of the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain, and six of his  relatives agreed Monday to settle civil charges of insider trading by paying a  total of $664,000.  </P> <P> "The case is settled. Carl just wanted to get it behind him for the benefit of  his family and children," said Thomas Holliday, Karcher's attorney.  </P> <P> Under the consent agreement, Karcher and his family members neither admitted  nor denied the charges made against them. Combined with a proposed pact with  company accounting director Alvin DeShano, the settlement ends a civil lawsuit  filed 15 months ago by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC had  alleged that Karcher and others supplied insider information to help his  relatives avoid stock market losses of at least $310,000 in 1984.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Founder to Pay $332,000  </P> <P> An attempt last May to settle the SEC suit fell apart when federal prosecutors  refused to rule out the possibility of criminal prosecution. Attorneys close to  the case said the family received that guarantee in the settlement announced  Monday.  </P> <P> The settlement requires Karcher, 72-year-old founder and chief executive of  Anaheim-based Carl Karcher Enterprises, to pay a fine of $332,000, the amount  his relatives saved by selling company stock after he allegedly told them that  the firm was about to report a dramatic drop in earnings. The accord also  requires the six relatives to pay, overall, another $332,000 to the federal  government.  </P> <P> DeShano, accounting director of Karcher Enterprises, has also tentatively  agreed to pay $12,396, the amount he saved by selling his company stock, plus a  penalty of $12,396. Unlike the Karcher family agreement, the DeShano pact has  not been approved by the SEC in Washington, but such approval is expected soon,  sources close to the case said. Under the agreement, DeShano would not admit or  deny wrongdoing but would agree not to violate securities laws.  </P> <P> Of the 16 defendants sued last year for insider trading, only DeShano was  criminally charged. After a five-day trial, a Los Angeles jury in June found  that DeShano was not guilty of a single count of securities fraud.  </P> <P> Although all the defendants agreed to settle the SEC action without admitting  or denying the accusations, all agreed to court orders forbidding them from  violating insider trading laws.  </P> <P> General terms of the settlement with the Karcher family were approved several  weeks ago by the SEC in Washington, SEC trial counsel John Koutsos said. Final  details were completed Monday when attorneys met for an hourlong, closed-door  session with U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> By settling the case, Karcher chose to avoid both the emotional and financial  costs of a trial, his lawyer said. "We had a winnable case," Holliday said.  "But the monetary cost, in terms of lawyers and personal impact on the family,  far outweighed the desire to win" at trial.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Legal Costs Cited  </P> <P> Holliday estimated that legal costs could have approached $1 million for all  seven Karcher family defendants. In addition to Carl Karcher they are: his  daughter Catherine Karcher Everly and her husband, Daniel Everly; daughter  Margaret J. LaVecke; daughter Barbara Karcher Wall; son Jerome Karcher, and a  son-in-law, Donald E. Fergus Jr.  </P> <P> The settlement hands the government "as much relief as we would have gotten had  we won the entire case after a trial," Koutsos said.  </P> <P> Charges against the other defendants named in the SEC complaint were resolved  earlier.  </P> <P> Last fall, Judge Rafeedie decided that Karcher's son, Carl Leo Karcher, had  illegally traded his stock and fined him $10,500. In April, the judge dropped  Margaret Karcher, the company founder's wife, from the lawsuit.  </P> <P> Six other family members, including company President Donald Karcher, settled  with the SEC in February by agreeing to pay $187,560. That settlement included  an agreement from the U.S. Attorney's Office that criminal charges would not be  brought against those who settled, according to lawyers involved in the case.  </P></p>

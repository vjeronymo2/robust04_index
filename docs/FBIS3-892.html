About 200 Kisiis arrived in the town on Monday [14 March] night  and told a tale of a night of terror by a group which killed  some people and forced the rest out of their houses at Mau  Summit, Molo Division.    A frail-looking middle-aged woman narrated to THE STANDARD  how her three children were hacked to death by the attackers  armed with arrows and swords. She claimed that the incident  occurred last Friday at Kamara Centre, Mau Summit, within Molo  Division. [passage omitted] The woman also said that her three  neighbours, whom she identified as Atuti Amenya, Thomas Ariga  and Joash Omariba, were also killed together with three other  children.    The other fleeing victims claimed that they had been beaten  up and forced out of their houses in two consecutive nights by  the raiders. They claimed that they had travelled to Molo  police station where transport was arranged for and Nyayo buses  hired to transport them to Kisii.    Mrs. Ong'era said that her dead children together with the  other victims had their bodies taken to Molo Hospital mortuary  by police. Contacted, the officer commanding police division  Molo, Simon Kipkania, said he was not aware of the incident, but  said he would investigate the claims. When THE STANDARD tried  to reach him later, his family said he had travelled to Rongai.  [passage omitted].</p>

Nazarbayev  received a group of economic consultants from South Korea. The  group consisted of leading economic scientists from the Korean  government's economic planning office, the government's  institute for development, and the institute for economic  research.    The activities of the group were led by Korea's former  deputy  prime minister, Dr Kim Mahn Je.    Agreement on the group's work in our republic was reached  during a meeting on 13 May of this year between N. Nazarbayev  and Kim Shin Yong, chairman of the South Korean group of the  Khankhva [transliteration] company.    In the course of two months the experts from Korea worked in  Almaty, where they studied the details of the financial and  banking systems, foreign exchange relations and privatization  policy.    A report was written on the basis of the collected and  generalized data characterizing the current situation. In this  case the South Korean experts made specific proposals regarding  the matters they studied.    The report was presented together with the proposals to N.  Nazarbayev at a meeting attended by Prime Minister S.  Tereshchenko and other leaders of interested departments.    Kim Mahn Je briefly described the project offered for study,  which consists of four parts, and suggested that Kazakhstan take  South Korea's road to establishing market relations. The third  and fourth parts of the project presented in the report pertain  to analysis of the problems of privatizing and reorganizing the  banking system.    In the opinion of the leader of the group of experts,  privatization is being held back in Kazakhstan because little  capital has yet been accumulated in private hands.    A proposal was made to create 20 holding companies that  could  help more than 200 large enterprises to travel the road linking  denationalization to full market relations. Rather than the  planned 3-year period of mass privatization, the Koreans propose  a more gradual road over a period of 5 years in order to avoid  major upheavals. They advise beginning mass privatization with  competitive, strong enterprises.    The experts believe that the existing banking system is the  largest problem on the road to reform. Presence of a large  number of small banks is an obstacle to a clear financial policy.    In the opinion of Kim Mahn Je capital needs to be  concentrated in Kazakhstan in one or two large banks. For  example a large bank for Kazakhstan's reconstruction and  development possessing authority abroad could be established by  merging the capital of the Turanbank and Kredsotsbank  [transliterations] with the National Bank. The capital of the  Alembank and Kazsberbank [transliterations] could be merged into  a second bank.    A proposal was also made for reorganizing small banks and  establishing a minimum amount of authorized capital. It was  revealed in the course of discussion that many of the proposals  enjoy support among members of the Kazakhstan government.    Besides this, N. Nazarbayev said that the republic will have  to abandon subsidies to unprofitable enterprises. But this  should not proceed as it did in Russia, the president stressed.  There, around 10,000 enterprises may go bankrupt in the course  of such an approach, which is 30 percent of their number. Russia  is huge, and it can endure, but Kazakhstan couldn't. Some  enterprises, in the president's words, will receive support from  the state. Included among them are the giants of  metallurgy--Karmetkombinat, Balkhashmed, and chromium producers.    N. Nazarbayev thanked the group of Korean scientists for the  work they did, and recommended inviting them to act as experts  and specialists in banking affairs. They are to provide  assistance in drafting documents on reforming the banking system.    Following the meeting with the South Korean group N.  Nazarbayev met with 30 directors of the largest enterprises of  the former defense complex. The hope is that they will lead the  Kazakh economy out of its stagnation. A huge engineering and  technical potential capable of solving the most serious problems  is concentrated at these enterprises. A specific task was posed  to each director.</p>

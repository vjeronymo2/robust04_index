			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speakers identified by screen captions] </F>   [Text] Two sailors from a Cuban ship anchored in Lirquen,  in the Eighth Region, have requested political asylum in Chile.    The ship, carrying a Cuban flag and named Primer Congreso  del  Partido, arrived in Chile on 26 April from Chimbote, Peru, with  a 29-member crew. This ship anchored in Lirquen to load 3,000  tons of fishmeal.    [Begin Lirquen Customs Official Rene Lobos recording] The  ship left at 0130 and is now sailing around Lirquen Bay. [end  recording]    The two sailors who defected have been identified as Orlando  Mayo Lopez, physician, and Wilfredo Falaro Escandon, cook. They  both come from Havana and arrived last night, at approximately  2200, at the Investigative Police station in Concepcion.    [Begin Concepcion Investigative Police Official Oscar Barra  recording] What they want is for Chilean authorities to help  them travel to Miami, where they have some relatives and job  opportunities.    [Unidentified reporter] Are they asking for political  asylum?    [Barra] That is more or less what they want, but they do not  know the legal term. [end recording]    The two Cubans remain at the Investigative Police station as  guests and have refused, so far, to meet with the media. They  are awaiting the decision of administrative authorities.    [Begin Regional Ministry Secretariat General of the  Government Ariel Duffan recording] According to preliminary  investigations and to what they are requesting, they are not  entitled to political asylum because they are not being  persecuted for political reasons, and they have not committed  any crime that would entitle them to be granted political  asylum. [end recording]    The captain of the Cuban ship Primer Congreso del Partido  has  been identified as Manuel Fuentes Sainz.    It is uncertain, however, when the Cuban ship will leave the  port of Lirquen, because in addition to the two sailors that  have defected, it has engine problems.    A third Cuban citizen also defected from his ship anchored  in  Iquique. The sailor from the Cuban ship Olguin, who has been  identified as Alay Gimenez, escaped in Iquique and requested  asylum.    Interior Under Secretary Belisario Velasco said that the  situation of the three Cubans who have requested political  asylum in Chile is being assessed. Velasco said that Interpol  would be consulted before any decision is made.</p>

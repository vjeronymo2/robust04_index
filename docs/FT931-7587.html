			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Japan Responds to Downturn: Nissan takes a sharp turn to stay on the road - Emergency directors' meeting orders radical restructuring of the company in the face of losses NISSAN HAS been shifting the bullet around its mouth since last summer. Yesterday it finally bit it. Early in the morning an emergency meeting of its directors agreed a radical restructuring plan to stem the car manufacturer's mounting losses. By the afternoon the details were echoing from factory public address systems as managers outlined the plan to the company's 53,000-strong workforce. As one executive put it: 'This re-structuring is deeper and more comprehensive than any previous measures we have taken. We have cut costs before; this time we are trying to change the company's structure.' The plan involves the closure in 1995 of the 29-year-old Zama vehicle assembly plant near Tokyo, a 9.4 per cent reduction in the workforce by March 1996, and a sharp cut in the variety of models Nissan will make and the components it uses. The financial imperatives have become inescapable. Nissan said it expected to make a pre-tax loss of Y29bn (Pounds 170m) in the year to the end of March, almost double its November estimate of Y15bn. The previous year it made a Y87bn pre-tax profit. The reasons for an operating loss which is expected to reach Y39bn are not hard to find. Sales will fall from 1,318,000 units last year to 1,180,000. At the same time Nissan's costs are rising, largely to pay for its heavy investment in the late 1980s.  Depreciation will rise from Y96.9bn in the 1990 financial year to Y160bn in 1994. Nissan hopes the restructuring plan will return it to profit next year, allow it to resume cash dividends in the following one, and secure a 'reasonable level of profit' in 1996. But the plan to save Y200bn a year by the spring of 1996 is not just a response to the sharp fall in demand from the boom years of the late 1980s. It is designed to cope with very slow growth in the 1990s. 'Nissan is committed to slim down its operational structure so that it will be able to secure a reasonable level of profits even under no growth in production volumes,' the plan says. The ageing Zama production plant, which is in an expensive area close to Tokyo and employs about 4,000 workers, will be closed in the spring of 1995. Production of the Sunny model will be shifted to Kyushu, where the world's newest car plant opened last year at a cost of Y100bn. The Kyushu plant has been producing at an annual rate of only 423,000 cars, well below its 600,000 capacity. The transfer from Zama will take it to full capacity. The other car made at Zama, the low-volume Presea, will be transferred to the Maruyama plant which is making about 325,000 cars a year compared with a capacity of 480,000. Zama's workers will be transferred to other jobs. But the Nissan workforce will be reduced by 5,000 to 48,000 by March 1996 mainly through restricting recruitment and natural wastage. More than 3,000 people leave Nissan's employment each year. Most significantly, 80 per cent of the reduction will be in white collar jobs, the first time restructuring has touched the highly protected salaried workers. About 32,000 of Nissan's workforce are office and administrative staff. During the recession of the mid-1980s Nissan reduced its workforce by 6,000, but mainly by not renewing contracts for temporary workers. Now full-time jobs will be cut. The number of model variations which Nissan offers will be cut by 35 per cent in 1996, compared with June 1992, while the variety of parts will be reduced by 40 per cent. This should produce almost half the overall cost savings. A string of smaller changes, including giving manufacturing staff much more influence over how cars are designed to make sure they can be made efficiently, are the main ingredients of a plan to increase factory floor productivity by 10 per cent a year. Nissan said its international operations would be fully involved in the cost-reduction programme, which would include moves fully to integrate international research, development and design.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Miguel Angel de la Guardia; from the "Evening </F> Information Review" newscast]    [Text] In the 35 years that have elapsed since the triumph  of the Cuban revolution, the perimeter of the U.S. Naval Base on  the Cuban bay of Guantanamo has been as a high tension cordon of  fire. On numerous occasions, the U.S. troops deployed inside the  base have staged serious acts of provocations aimed at creating  a conflict that could justify a large-scale military attack  against Cuba. On some of those incidents, U.S. soldiers, in an  evident state of drunkenness or perhaps under the influence of  hallucinogenic drugs, have hurled objects at Cuban soldiers  deployed along that dangerous border, uttered vulgar insults, or  staged pornographic scenes with prostitutes from the base  brothels.    On other occasions, during times of crisis, they have fired  at the Cuban side, once killing two young border soldiers, whom  General Raul Castro remembered in his speech on 16 April. More  recently, other incidents have been reported, with people trying  to leave the country by crossing the mine fields located along  both sides of the dividing line or by swimming across Guantanamo  Bay in shark-infested waters mined by both sides.    During those incidents, some of those escaping have  perished,  giving the opportunity to news media which are enemies of Cuba  to weave dark yarns that sparked irresponsible protests from the  U.S. State Department, something which Cuba rejected, as it  convincingly denied those false accusations.    In his 16 April speech, Raul Castro admitted that since  President Bill Clinton has been in office there have not been  the serious provocations that took place during the years of  greatest tension. He affirmed that should there be at any time a  military clash with the United States which did not begin at the  Guantanamo base, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba would  expedite evacuation of the families of the soldiers of that  enclave.    He also assured that Cuba will do everything within its  power  to preserve the climate of calm on both sides of the dividing  line, which has prevailed in recent years. Raul Castro warned  the Cuban security corps will try at all cost to keep citizens  who want to migrate to the United States from using that venue.    The U.S. Government has been asked to take measures to  discourage these actions. If the U.S. Government is truly  interested in maintaining peace at Guantanamo Naval Base, which  it is occupying against the Cuban people's will, it has the  power to do so. Despite having suffered painful casualties due  to the acts of provocation along the border, Cuban troops have  never given any cause for concern to U.S. authorities or  dishonored their discipline, which under such circumstances  requires an extremely courageous and calm conduct. The  responsibility to guarantee peace around the Guantanamo base  falls, therefore, on the U.S. side, until that base is returned  to the sovereign authority of the Republic of Cuba.</p>

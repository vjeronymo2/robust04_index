[passage omitted]    Commenting on [Kalmyk President] Ilyumzhinov's statement in  an ITAR-TASS interview, David Kugultinov, a popular Kalmyk poet  and chairman of the Council of Elders at the president,  described it as an "ill-considered step." "One should at least  consult the people and find out their opinion, before taking  such an important decision. By all appearances, the suggestion  of our leader came as a result of instability in Russia, as well  as in its leadership. I do not think that Kalmykia will turn  into an out-of-the-way place, if it loses its status of a  republic and its Constitution. But it will lose the energy of  statehood, which has been and continues to be a source of hope  for all those who live on its territory. Haste has never done  any good to anybody, and I am sure the Kalmyk people will  realise it and will not support their president," Kugultinov  said.</p>

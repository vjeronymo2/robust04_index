			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Adverts fall closes engineering journal Engineering, a magazine founded in 1866, is closing because of continuing losses. The Design Council, which owns and publishes the magazine, said yesterday that the February issue would be the last. The publication, which had a circulation of 23,000 in 1992, was sent mainly to those involved in engineering design and senior management in relatively smaller companies. The magazine has found it difficult to win enough advertising.</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Navistar in tentative deal with union over health care NAVISTAR International, the Chicago-based truck and engine manufacturer, last night Wednesday announced it had reached a tentative agreement with the UAW, the auto workers' union, to trim retiree healthcare costs. The agreement is expected to reduce Navistar's liability for retiree health care and insurance benefits to Dollars 1bn from Dollars 2.6bn. The company said it would resume negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with its unions on January 8 which was aimed at changing post-retirement healthcare benefits for active employees. The UAW has been leading negotiations with Navistar since mid-October, when the union and the company agreed to set aside an Ohio lawsuit. The company had contended that its retiree benefits put it at a Dollars 200m annual cost disadvantage to its competitors, and that it would enter bankruptcy if the cost burden were not reduced. A 1985 restructuring left the company with three retirees for each active employee. The deal with the union requires Navistar to issue 255m new shares of common stock to a trust fund for current and future retirees. A new profit-sharing programme will make payments into the same fund. The company has 251m shares outstanding, and last quarter its sales translated into little more than 3.5 cents per share. In turn, retirees will be required to share in the costs of their medical benefits by paying premiums and deductibles. Navistar said it was suspending the quarterly dividend on its series G preferred stock until the legal process involving the benefits restructuring was complete, and the new healthcare programme was implemented.</p>

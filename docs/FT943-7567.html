			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Johnson &amp; Johnson in bid for grown-up market Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US healthcare company famous for its baby products, yesterday made a grab for the more mature end of the sensitive skin products market with an agreed bid worth Dollars 905.9m (Pounds 584.4m) for Neutrogena, the US soap and shampoo company. Mr Lloyd Cotsen, Neutrogena's chairman and chief executive, has agreed to sell his 38 per cent stake for Dollars 35.25 a share. Johnson &amp; Johnson is offering the same price in cash for the remaining shares. Neutrogena's shares, quoted on the Nasdaq screen-based market, rose Dollars 6 to Dollars 34 3/4 . Neutrogena makes and sells premium-priced soaps, shampoos and skin care items that appeal particularly to people with sensitive skins. Its best-known products are a clear glycerine soap and a clear shampoo, but it has also introduced a dandruff shampoo, a suntan lotion and a product called HeatSafe that protects hair from being damaged by curling irons and blow dryers. Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of the world's biggest manufacturers of healthcare products. If the bid is successfully completed, it will add Neutrogena to its consumer products division, whose products include Johnson's Baby Oil and Band-Aid sticking plasters. Johnson &amp; Johnson's other divisions make drugs and surgical products. Johnson &amp; Johnson's baby care products are widely used by adults. But recently the company has been trying to build up a share of the market for speciality soaps, skin creams and shampoos aimed specifically at teenagers and adults. In 1991 it bought the Clean and Clear line of skin care products from Revlon, the US cosmetics company, and last year, it bought the RoC beauty products company from LVMH, the French luxury goods group. One factor that all the brands have in common is that they are sold mainly through pharmacies, drug stores and other outlets for healthcare products. Johnson &amp; Johnson will hope to increase sales of Neutrogena soaps and shampoos by feeding them through the same world-wide distribution channels as its other consumer products. Based in Los Angeles, Neutrogena sells its products in 72 countries and has subsidiaries in Germany, France and the UK. Recently, however, growth has been lacklustre. In 1993, net profits rose by less than 4 per cent to Dollars 24.9m. Turnover was up by 5 per cent at Dollars 281.7m, partly because of weak economic conditions in Europe. Last year the consumer products division at Johnson &amp; Johnson also put in a relatively poor performance. International sales were hit by adverse shifts in exchange rates, and growth in the US market was hit by intense competition in the over-the-counter market for vaginal yeast infection remedies. Sales rose only 0.9 per cent to Dollars 4.8bn. Better growth came from pharmaceutical sales, up 3.5 per cent at Dollars 4.5bn, and from the professional division, which increased turnover by 4.1 per cent to Dollars 4.8bn. Consolidated net earnings rose 10 per cent to Dollars 1.79bn.</p>

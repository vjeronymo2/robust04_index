			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] As part of celebrations marking media day,  President Husni Mubarak will inaugurate Channel Three of the  central delta on Monday. The channel will begin experimental  transmission for four hours per day, gradually increasing to  eight hours per day in June, until it finally reaches full  transmission in October.    Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif has stated that  Channel  Seven will begin transmission in al-Minya in President Mubarak's  presence. The president inaugurated the first stage of that  project last October.    As for the Egyptian international channel, Nile TV, the  information minister said that it transmits two hours daily at  present. This will be increased to six hours, using the  European satellite [not further specified]. He added that  preparations are underway to expand this channel to African  areas via Arabsat by the end of 1994. [passage omitted]    Al-Sharif added that a strategic project will be submitted  to  President Mubarak. This project is the Egyptian satellite, for  which studies have been completed by French and U.S. firms. The  satellite will have between 12 and 56 channels. Al-Sharif hopes  that work on the project will start before the end of this year  so that the satellite can be launched by the end of 1996.  [passage omitted]</p>

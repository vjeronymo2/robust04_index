It has given priority to explore local natural resources,  helping local people develop agriculture and forestry.    The regional government has taken measures to support  development of Xihaigu instead of purely relying on government  relief, according to Guo Zhanyuan, head of the regional  Agricultural Development Committee.    Last year, the region used a quarter of its aid-the-poor  funds to create a number of production centers for grain, edible  oil, animal husbandry, fruit, medicinal herbs and minerals, Guo  said.    A total of 8.7 million yuan (1 million U.S. dollars) was  used  last year.    Yanchi County, near a desert, has concentrated on developing  animal husbandry and planting medicinal herbs. Last year, the  total number of sheep raised in the county reached over 700,000.  A licorice root production center has been created.    Thanks to the efforts, the county is among the first eight  counties in the prefecture to end poverty.    Xiji County has given priority to potato and pea planting to  make dry noodles made from bean or potato starch. Its products  are exported to ten Chinese provinces and regions, as well as  Russia and Hong Kong.    Last year, the eight counties' per capita income was about  370 yuan and grain 275 kilograms. China's poverty line is set  at an income below 200 yuan a year.</p>

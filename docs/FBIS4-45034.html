			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Algeria-Portugal Gas Sales Accord Signed"] </F>   [Text] The general manager of Sonatrach [National Company  for the Transport and Marketing of Hydrocarbons], Mr. Abdelhak  Bouhafs, has every reason to feel satisfied. Yesterday morning,  when he joined his Portuguese counterpart, Mr. Elia da Costa,  president of Portugal's Transgas consortium, in signing the  contract to sell Algerian natural gas to Portugal, he "clinched"  two of Sonatrach's major objectives.    The contract signed yesterday provides for delivery of 2.5  billion cubic meters [m[.sup]3[/]] of natural gas to Portugal  over a 24-year period beginning third quarter 1996. The accord  is a follow-on to the draft accord signed by Sonatrach and the  Portuguese Government on 1 July 1993. With this accord,  Sonatrach will have found buyers for all the natural gas it can  produce, thus meeting its goal of doubling natural gas exports  by 1996. Sonatrach now has firm contracts with commercial  partners to sell 58 billion m[.sup]3[/] of gas beginning in  1996, compared to current sales of 30 billion.    Yesterday's accord was the final document to be initialed  before moving ahead with construction of the great  Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline project (GME), which will transport  Algerian natural gas to Morocco, Spain, and Portugal starting  sometime in the second half of 1996. With the signing last  Thursday of two $200-million agreements between Sonatrach and  two U.S. banks, Eximbank and City Bank, to finance the Algerian  segment of the GME, the last hurdle standing in the way of the  project has been overcome.    The satisfaction of Sonatrach executives was clearly visible  yesterday at the Djenane El-Mithak residence where the contract  was signed, all the more since they had been subjected to  violent media attacks, in several European (and even American)  publications, aimed at discrediting Sonatrach and obstructing  realization of the project. The general idea propagated in this  denigration campaign was that in the current political and  security environment, there is no guarantee Algeria will be a  safe and reliable supplier for its clients, or that adequate  security be provided for foreign technicians coming to Algeria  for the construction phase of the pipeline project.    The strong commitments made by the Algerian Government  finally won over the Bechtel company (United States)--which is  supposed to build the Algerian segment of the GME--Eximbank,  City Bank, and ultimately the Portuguese buyer.    Sonatrach executives also have every reason to be pleased  with the Portuguese Government's decision to allow Sonatrach to  acquire a partnership interest in Transgas, the consortium that  will operate the Portuguese natural gas distribution system. In  brief remarks to journalists yesterday after the signing  ceremony, Mr. da Costa confirmed Sonatrach's capital  participation in Transgas, predicting the consortium will  benefit from Sonatrach's know-how in the natural gas domain.    The fact that negotiations between Sonatrach and the  Portuguese authorities unfolded "in an almost unprecedented  spirit of cooperation and dialogue," as Mr. da Costa termed it  yesterday, was doubtless partly responsible for Sonatrach being  the first foreign partner chosen to participate in the capital  of the Portuguese consortium. Portuguese interests control 51  percent of Transgas's capital, which is also open to other  foreign companies.</p>

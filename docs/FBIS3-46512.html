They protested  against the accident involving U.S. military aircraft and called  for suspension of flights over residential areas.    It was an emergency rally designed to protest against an  accident involving two FA-18 Hornets from Kadena Air Base [KAB]  which flew into each other in a training area over the Pacific  southeast of Okinawa on 17 December. About 60 people, including  members of the labor union, attended the rally. They expressed  their feelings by raising their fists at the KAB.    At the rally, Yoshimasa Karimata, vice chairman of the Peace  Center; Kazuo Senaga, vice chairman of the Central Region Labor  Union; and Seiyu Nakamura, representative of the Joint Struggle  Council Against Noise, made speeches at the rally. They  stressed the need to promote daily struggle [nichijoteki na  tatakai], saying: "We cannot sleep at night because a similar  accident could happen over land. Danger is always involved in  the military trainings."    Moreover, after Akira Nakane, member of the prefectural  assembly, and other representatives expressed their resolve, the  rally adopted a "protest resolution to denounce the FA-18  aircraft accident and to call for immediate suspension of  flights by U.S. military aircraft over residential areas."  Copies of the resolution will be forwarded to the director of  the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, the U.S.  ambassador to Japan, and other officials.</p>

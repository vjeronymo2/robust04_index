			<p>BFN     [Text] Local elections will be regarded as having taken  place when at least one-fourth of the electors participate.    The Seimas did not pass today the whole law on local  elections, but established during the voting on individual  articles of the law that the elections will be valid when 25  percent of the electors participate.    Local elections should take place this autumn or winter. The  candidates for the elections may be nominated by political  parties and political organizations. This rule is opposed by  the Union of Lithuanian Poles, which organized a picket at the  Seimas building today. The picketers demanded that public  organizations of the national minorities be allowed to take part  in the Seimas and local elections. They said in a statement  that no national minority in Lithuania has its political party  but takes part in political life through its public organization.</p>

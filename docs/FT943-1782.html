			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Barratt advances 72% to Pounds 35.2m Barratt Developments yesterday underlined the strength of the recovery in the group's fortunes and the UK housing market with a 72 per cent rise from Pounds 20.4m to Pounds 35.2m in full-year profits to June 30. Sir Lawrie Barratt, chairman, said the pace of recovery in the south-east was one of the most significant factors in the continuing recovery. 'After substantial losses over the previous four years, the return to profitable trading of our southern region subsidiaries is a major achievement,' he said. Turnover increased 23 per cent to Pounds 498.9m (Pounds 405.3m). Earnings per share rose 39 per cent to 12.9p (9.3p). The final dividend is 4p (3p) for a total for the year of 6p (4p). Sir Lawrie, 66, who came out of retirement three years ago after the group began to incur heavy losses, took the opportunity yesterday to scotch press speculation that he was about to step down. 'Rumours of my resignation have been greatly exaggerated,' he said, adding that he intended to see out the remaining two years of his agreed tenure. Mr Frank Eaton, chief executive, said price rises nationwide for new houses were ahead of inflation and running between 5 and 10 per cent ahead of a year ago in the south-east. However, older Barratt properties were proving harder to make price rises stick and overall prices were stagnant. Mr Eaton forecast similar price rises for the following 12 months, with volumes likely to be ahead 10 per cent. The average price of a Barratt house last year was Pounds 74,900 against Pounds 74,800 the previous year. Operating margins improved from 8 per cent to 10.4 per cent, which the company put down to a general improvement in the housing market. Mr Eaton said that the company had withstood pressure from suppliers to pass cost increases on. COMMENT The miserly rise in Barratt's share price yesterday showed less attention to the group's seemingly good results and more to the issue currently occupying investors minds: interest rates. Profit forecasts have been raised some 8 per cent for next year to around the Pounds 50m mark. This would give 18.6p of earnings and a prospective p/e of 9.6 - undemanding, particularly when compared with the likes of Bryant and the construction sector as a whole. But while expectations of interest rates remain upward, and given the caution of some investors towards volume housebuilders after the severity of the recession, the shares are unlikely to show any great improvement.</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PERILS OF CENSORSHIP AND PORNOGRAPHY  </P> <P> Re the "Stanton Anti-Porn" editorial of Feb. 5: I am in complete disagreement  with the implication that pornography is more desirable than "misguided efforts  to restrict it through censorship." And that the "biggest threat to the  community is the city's attempt at censorship."  </P> <P> A far greater threat to the city of Stanton, and every other city in our  nation, is the threat of the crime, disease and human degradation that  pornographic "sex shops" contribute to the community. Even the most casual  observer in any city that is tolerant of pornography stores can see clearly  evidence of the drugs, prostitution (both heterosexual and homosexual) and  blatant crime that occurs in the regions in which the stores are located.  </P> <P> If the city is intolerant to the first business that wishes to profit off this  perversion of marital sexual intimacy, then there is no encouragement to other  businesses to follow suit and set up their establishments. It was a travesty of  justice that took away the right of the city of Stanton to preserve itself as a  city of decency.  </P> <P> Whether or not the material a store sells is pornographic is the question and  the danger. To demonstrate the truth of this, simply tour any city's "combat  zone," the porn retailers. Ask the city's police department if it feels there  is no danger.  </P> <P> ERIC R. SNYDER  </P> <P> Westminster  </P></p>

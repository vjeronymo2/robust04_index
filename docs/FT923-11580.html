			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Brussels aid for customs agents The European Commission announced plans yesterday to provide Ecu30m (Pounds 21.2m) in emergency aid for customs agents whose jobs will disappear when EC border controls are removed, Reuter reports from Brussels. The money, which must be approved by EC governments, would help create new jobs and business opportunities in 1993 in the worst-hit border areas. More than 60,000 private customs agents stand to lose their jobs when all formalities on intra-EC trade are wiped out next January 1. They have staged a series strikes and other protests this year to demand compensation. The Commission announced in May that it hoped to provide up to Ecu400m to retrain or re-employ customs agents, most of it coming from existing EC funds earmarked for regional development.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Clive Govender] </F>   [Text] Durban March 15 SAPA--The African National Congress  [ANC] on Tuesday demanded the immediate expulsion of the  Internal Stability Division [ISD] and the kwaZulu Police [KZP]  from Umlazi, south of Durban. The demand came during a march by  thousands of ANC supporters to call for free political activity  in the township. The marchers had handed over the memorandum at  the Umlazi magistrate's court when they were fired upon by  another group, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation]  radio reported.    Police used teargas and fired shots to separate the two  groups as the ANC marchers made their way home.    The protest followed the weekend occupation of Umlazi's King  Goodwill Zwelithini Stadium by hostel dwellers ahead of an ANC  election rally there. ANC leaders, including Chairman Thabo  Mbeki and Transkei military ruler Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa, were  incensed when police failed to move the crowd from the stadium,  forcing them to address their supporters on Umlazi's Mangosuthu  highway.    On Tuesday, several thousand ANC supporters delivered a  memorandum to Chief Magistrate Louis Radyn, calling for the ISD  and KZP's immediate withdrawal from Umlazi. Mr Radyn said the  memo would be forwarded to the government and the Transitional  Executive Council [TEC]. The memorandum called for the  deployment of the National Peacekeeping Force or forces under  TEC control in Umlazi, and for the Independent Electoral  Commission to act against those who organised Sunday's  occupation of the stadium. "The ISD had no legal right to  prevent us from using the stadium...and attack us with teargas  and live ammunition," it read.    KZP district commissioner Brig Alwyn Burger confirmed one  woman was shot dead in the township early on Tuesday. Residents  claimed the KZP shot her, but Brig Burger said there was no  evidence to that effect and that the claim would be investigated.    At the magistrate's court a potentially ugly situation was  averted when about 300 Inkatha Freedom Party supporters massed  several hundred metres away. Police kept them at bay, and they  dispersed soon afterwards.    The mood was jubilant and festive, with a sea of people  dancing to the song "now is the time, the time is now" blaring  from loudspeakers. Not long after the crowd arrived, the South  African flag was pulled down by frenzied supporters, ripped and  replaced by two fluttering ANC flags. Burning tyres and stone  barricades erected to enforce a stayaway impeded progress  through the sprawling township and thousands of workers failed  to arrive at work in the city.    The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] meanwhile claimed a "double  assassination attempt" had been made on Umlazi mayor and IFP  women's Brigade regional secretary Maria Xulu early on Tuesday  and that it was possibly linked to the ANC march. IFP spokesman  Ed Tillett said a group fired on Ms Xulu's home in H section  about 4.20AM, and her bodyguards returned fire. He said the  attackers returned 10 minutes later and again fired a volley of  shots at her home. They were again repelled.</p>

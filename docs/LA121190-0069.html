			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> GE Says PCBs Break Down Naturally: General Electric Co. released a report that  it says shows the natural biodegradation of polychlorinated biphenyls in New  York's Hudson River.  </P> <P> The company had dumped PCBs in the river for about 25 years, when the practice  was legal and before the substances were suspected of harming human health.  Recently, the state has proposed dredging the river to remove the contaminated  material to a landfill. GE said its results match those of a 1984 New York  Department of Environmental Conservation report, but it couldn't say whether  the natural process would rid the river of all PCBs.  </P></p>

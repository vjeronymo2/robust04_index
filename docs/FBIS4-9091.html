			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by TV Polonia network] </F>   [Text] Katarzyna Kolenda will report to us on the latest  events at the Sejm:    [Kolenda] Just after the meeting of the Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD] parliamentary floor group had ended, a totally  unexpected and unplanned meeting took place between SLD leader  Aleksander Kwasniewski and President Lech Walesa. This meeting  was proposed by the president himself, and the coalition had  been knocking in vain at the president's door for this meeting  for several weeks.    Literally a dozen or so seconds ago, Walesa's news  conference  ended at the Sejm. The president did not want to say, however,  what the private talks with Kwasniewski were about. He only  said: We cleared up certain things that should not have  happened in the past. The president did not want to say to what  political facts he was referring.    The president also said that he did not see any need for a  meeting with the entire coalition for the time being. In the  president's view, the leaders of the SLD and the Polish Peasant  Party should first agree on a new candidate for the post of  finance minister and deputy responsible for economic affairs.  Only then, after agreeing on this candidate, can a meeting take  place.    At the news conference, the president said that Dariusz  Rosati will not be his candidate for this post. In other words,  the president upheld his declaration made earlier during the  meeting of the SLD parliamentary floor group that he would not  endorse that candidacy.    Asked whether he thought that today's meeting with the SLD  parliamentary floor group and today's talks with Kwasniewski  marked an end to the conflict of the past several weeks, Walesa  said that this was not the case at all, that these conflicts  will go on, and that he intends to cause them himself. The  president indicated, however, that these conflicts are meant to  help resolve very serious problems.    The president admitted that Kwasniewski's declaration that  there will be no changes to the interim Constitution had upset  his plans a little, because, as announced earlier, the president  is going out into the country on 21 April, where he intends to  convince the people of his arguments.</p>

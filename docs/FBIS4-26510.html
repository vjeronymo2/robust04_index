			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 22 (CNS) -- The Minister of Public  Security, Mr. Tao Siju, said today that resolute measures would  be continuously taken in China's anti-drug trafficking work this  year and in the coming years to prevent drugs from flowing into  China.    Speaking at a meeting held by the state anti-drug  trafficking  committee, Mr. Tao said despite of notable achievements made in  the country's anti-drug trafficking campaign since last year,  situation of drug-related crimes remained serious due to effects  of the worldwide drug-related crimes. The anti-drug trafficking  campaign was arduous with drug trafficking activities rampant in  the frontier area of the southwest China and existence of  illegal planting of opium poppies. Therefore, the campaign  should not slack off.    Mr. Tao said top priority would be given to the frontier  area  of the southwest China such as Yunnan Province and Guangxi  Province in terms of crackdown of border drug trafficking.  These two provinces should intensify their anti-drug  trafficking campaigns in order to prevent drugs made outside  China from passing through the territory of China.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Adare Printing jumps to IPounds 419,000 Adare Printing, the Dublin-based printing group, more than doubled pre-tax profits to IPounds 419,000 (Pounds 407,000) on turnover of IPounds 12.6m in the half year ended October 31. Profits last time amounted to IPounds 175,000 on sales of IPounds 4.58m. The results included a three month contribution from Waddington Business Forms, acquired in July. Mr Denis Bergin, chairman, said the profits growth was held back by initial costs of developing and streamlining the acquisitions. He said further restructuring would take place and the acquisition search would continue. The interim dividend is lifted to 0.945p (0.9p), payable from earnings per share of 5.87p (3.34p).</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FELANDO SHELVES BILL DESIGNED TO HELP CONSUMERS  </P> <P> Faced with opposition from the Deukmejian Administration and food and  agricultural groups, Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) last week  shelved for this year a sweeping consumer protection bill. The measure would  have required grocery stores to post signs disclosing additives and antibiotics  in meat, poultry, commercially raised fish, fruit and vegetables.  </P> <P> After a hearing by the Assembly Health Committee, Felando agreed to delay until  next year a vote on his measure. In exchange, committee members agreed to hold  further hearings on the proposal.  </P> <P> Felando listed the bill among his top priorities two weeks ago when he returned  to full-time legislative duties after radiation treatment for mycosis  fungoides, a form of lymphoma that affects the skin and sometimes spreads to  internal organs.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Felando told the committee: "The public has a right to be informed  about what they are ingesting."  </P> <P> But Don Beaver, president of the California Grocers Assn., labeled the bill  "absolutely ludicrous," because it would be impossible for retailers to  identify all the additives in food. The measure also was opposed by the state  Department of Food and Agriculture.  </P></p>

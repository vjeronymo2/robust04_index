			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Rising indices boost hopes for US recovery THE Bush administration's hopes for an economic recovery later this year were boosted yesterday by a rise in two key indices that track the health of the economy. The composite index of leading indicators - the main guide to future turning points in economic activity - rose 0.5 per cent in March to register its second consecutive monthly increase. The rise in February was revised up from 1.1 per cent to 1.2 per cent. The purchasing managers' index - a widely followed gauge of current industrial conditions - rose to 42.1 per cent in April from 40 per cent in March. This was the third monthly increase from a trough of 37.7 per cent reached in January. On average, the index of leading indicators has started rising three months before the start of an economic recovery. But the lag has fluctuated widely in previous recessions. The index started rising one month before the end of the 1973/75 recession but turned up eight months before the end of the 1981/82 recession. The rise in the composite leading index in March should be viewed with caution because it largely reflected increases in consumer and investor confidence rather than changes in the real economy. The overall increase was more than accounted for by a surge in consumer expectations following the end of the Gulf war. The other positive components were rises in share prices, real money supply and building permits. But seven of the 11 components pointed to continuing recession, including declining orders for consumer and capital goods, rising unemployment insurance claims and a shorter working week. The purchasing managers' index, although up, was still well below the 44 per cent level generally taken to indicate economy-wide recession. It has been below 50 per cent, the level that marks recession in the manufacturing economy, for 11 months. Mr Robert Bretz, a spokesman for the National Association of Purchasing Managers, said the level of the index suggested that the US economy was still declining in April. But the rate of decline lessened for the third consecutive month. The outlook was for a gradual trend towards recovery. The improving tone was particularly evident in the association's new orders index, which rose sharply to 45.9 per cent compared with 41.5 per cent in March. Export orders are more buoyant than domestic orders. Meanwhile, inflation pressures continue to abate. The prices index fell for the fourth consecutive month to the lowest level since April 1982.</p>

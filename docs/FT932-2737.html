			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Hanson acquires waste business from Tarmac  -Further Pounds 44.2m expansion into UK landfill sector ARC, a subsidiary of Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, has paid Pounds 44.2m for the principal assets of Econowaste, the waste disposals business built by Tarmac. The acquisition marks a further move for Hanson into the UK waste sector, making its Greenways Landfill subsidiary the third largest operator of landfill sites in the UK. In March the conglomerate took a 4.9 per cent stake in Shanks &amp; McEwan in return for options in landfill sites which the waste company had exercised. For Tarmac, the UK's biggest building materials and construction group, the sale marks a further stage in its programme to reduce its large borrowings by selling peripheral businesses. 'We want to be out of active waste and into void creation,' said Mr Neville Simms, Tarmac's chief executive. Tarmac decided to sell Econowaste in the third quarter last year when high prices for waste businesses were still expected by some in the industry. It was initially hoping to sell the entire business for Pounds 80m. Mr Simms said yesterday's sale was only marginally below the figure Tarmac expected to achieve. Tarmac has now disposed of more than Pounds 200m of assets in the last 12 months and is believed to have made a Pounds 10m book profit on the Econowaste sale. It plans to raise more than Pounds 300m from asset sales, on which it hopes to break even. Mr Simms said that might prove tough in the current markets. The businesses sold to ARC are understood to account for about two thirds of Econowaste's profits which approached Pounds 3m pre-tax last year. The parts of Econowaste that Tarmac is retaining made Pounds 1m. Mr Martin Taylor, Hanson's chief executive, said it was a good time to buy assets and that 'hopefully' the British recession had bottomed out. 'We think Greenways is a very good business and this is a sensible acquisition at this price at this time.' ARC is buying 18 of Econowaste's sites, 12 of which are active. This will give ARC an additional 54m cu ft of landfill capacity to add to the 42m Greenways operates at 20 sites in England and Wales. In addition ARC is buying the waste haulage business. It also has options to acquire rights over 17 sites for further landfill. The combined business will have an annual turnover of Pounds 35m. 'Tougher environmental legislation will offer increasing opportunities to landfill operators with good access to long term void resources,' said Mr Nigel Sandy, managing director of Greenways. Tarmac's net debt at the end of last year, including the group's share of off-balance sheet finance of Pounds 100m and Pounds 99.3m of auction preferred stock, stood at Pounds 677m. This was equivalent to 73 per cent of shareholders' funds Pounds 942m. Mr Simms has said that he hopes to reduce debt by a further Pounds 200m this year through disposals, savings and by further squeezing working capital including in UK housebuilding. See Lex</p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Little to cheer about as Irish track bonds - The 1994 decline in Dublin equities If fund managers have experienced difficulty in tracking down their usual equity or bond dealer in Dublin in the past week or so, the reason is straightforward. Dozens of dealers from the city's four main broking houses have packed their sunglasses, sports shirts and sunblocks, and headed for the United States. Along with tens of thousands of other Irish football supporters, they have been yelling 'Ole Ole Ole' from the terraces of US sports stadiums, urging on Ireland's team in the World Cup, rather than Irish stocks from their trading desks. They can hardly be blamed, as there has been little to cheer about in the Irish stock market so far this year. Last year's sustained rally, which saw the ISEQ overall index rise 54 per cent to 1,889, peaked in January at 2,082; it is now 9.4 per cent down on the year to date, and 17.8 per cent down from its peak. The index fell another 26.44 to 1,711.99 last night. The cause of this, the slump in bond prices, has been shared with other European markets but the bear market has been particularly hard on Irish gilts, not least because of the widespread perception that the Central Bank is now preferentially tracking sterling rather than the D-Mark in managing the exchange rate. According to Mr Dan McLaughlin, the chief economist at Riada stockbrokers, Irish gilts are now trading at 150 basis points over German bunds, compared to 40 basis points just six months ago. 'There has been a fundamental shift in the Irish market . . . dealing rooms in Dublin are watching the UK now rather than the German market.' The focus on sterling and the slide in the UK equity market has in turn driven the fall in the Irish equity market. Financial and food stocks have suffered the hardest knocks in the Irish league table. The main financials, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life, whose combined market capitalisation comprises 30 per cent of the Dublin market total, have fared worse than average, being more sensitive to the performance of gilts. AIB is almost 20 per cent down from its 1993 high, while Bank of Ireland and Irish Life are down some 12-15 per cent. In foods, which comprise 15 per cent of the market's capitalisation, Avonmore, Waterford Foods and Golden Vale are the companies most exposed to current uncertainties in the dairy industry, further exacerbated by Golden Vale's recent profits warning. Their share prices stand from 20 to 40 per cent lower than their 1993 peaks. Significant exceptions which have bucked the downward trend are Kerry Group, IAWS and Greencore in the food sector, ICG the shipping group, and Waterford Wedgwood. Smurfit is also showing signs of recovery as the market has begun to take a more favourable view of the paper and packaging industry generally. All have made gains on their 1993 highs. But, being June, it is just half-time, and Dublin brokers who have stayed at home are confident that ground lost in the first half will be made up in the second. Mr Robbie Kelleher, head of research at Davy stockbrokers, says: 'It doesn't require a huge rally in bonds, just stabilisation, to get the equity market rallying.' Mr Brendan Lynch, senior economist at BCP brokers, agrees. 'The European bond markets are ready for a turn. They have reached an oversold position. A steadying of the bond market will set the base for the equity market to gain on economic performance and improved earnings.' Encouraging economic forecasts from a range of analysts give cause for optimism for corporate earnings this year. One of the latest, published by Goodbody stockbrokers this week, points to strong export growth and a recovery in domestic demand which will raise real GDP by close to 5 per cent in 1994. 'This year is likely to see the beginning of a boom period of balanced and sustained growth which is set to last for at least five years,' Goodbodys predicts. Inflation is not expected to rise significantly, adding to the good news for the equity market. On similar calculations, Mr Kelleher believes the ISEQ index should advance by some 15 per cent to around 2,100 by the year-end. He says that the market is currently trading on 11 times 1994 earnings, and 'less than 10' on prospective earnings for 1995. 'In relative terms, the Irish market still looks cheap,' he says. While the remainder of 1994 and 1995 may herald a renewed rally, the months ahead will also bring a number of changes in the way the market operates. The separation of the Dublin and London stock exchanges, originally planned for 1993, is now anticipated for the end of 1994. Legislation necessary to bring this into effect is to be presented in the Dail this autumn. Second, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) hopes to have a market-making system for gilts in place by next year, for the first time since the market was established 200 years ago. The aim is to achieve greater liquidity in Irish gilts, and thereby reduce government borrowing costs and yield differentials relative to other European gilts. Insofar as equity prices are currently being driven by gilt prices, smaller gilt price differentials should also mean smaller p/e differentials with other European equity markets.</p>

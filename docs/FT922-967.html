			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: Intervention notice is valid REGINA v LAUTRO EX PARTE ROSS Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Glidewell, Lord Justice Stocker and Lord Justice McCowan): June 11 1992 AN INTERVENTION notice served by a self-regulating organisation on a member is not invalidated by failure to give prejudicially-affected non-members an opportunity to make representations as to why it should not be served. But where such an opportunity is not given the non-member should, and in the case of Lautro now does, have a right to apply to have the decision to serve the notice set aside or to appeal. The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by Mr David Hugh Ross, sole director of the Winchester Group plc, from a judgment of the Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench Division (FT, July 17 1991) refusing his application for judicial review of a decision by the Life Assurance Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation Ltd (Lautro) to issue an intervention notice affecting Winchester. LORD JUSTICE GLIDEWELL said that Lautro was a self-regulating organisation (SRO), recognised under the Financial Services Act 1986. Norwich Union was authorised under the Act to carry on investment business, but was a member of and subject to control under Lautro's rules. Winchester, as an appointed representative of Norwich Union, was exempt from the requirement of authorisation. Lautro's rules, current in October 1990, empowered it to prohibit a member from entering into transactions or from soliciting or carrying on business. That power of intervention was exercisable by notice to the member, stating why intervention appeared desirable to Lautro for the protection of investors. Rule 7.3(12) provided that where the reasons related to matters which referred to a person identified in the notice other than the member, and were in Lautro's opinion prejudicial to that person, Lautro 'shall . . . serve a copy of the notice on that person'. A member of Lautro on whom an intervention notice was served could apply to set it aside or appeal. A person other than a member on whom a copy was served had no prior opportunity of making representations as to why the notice should not be issued, and was given no right under the rules to set it aside or to appeal. In October 1990, Lautro investigated Winchester's business. In its opinion, there was evidence to show there had been serious breaches of the Lautro rules in respect of business conducted for Norwich Union by Winchester. It resolved to exercise its intervention powers. On October 31, an intervention notice was served on Norwich Union and copies were served on Winchester. On November 1, Norwich Union suspended Winchester as its appointed representative. Winchester sought a meeting with Lautro which took place on November 6. It complained it had had no opportunity to make representations, and lacked particulars of the allegations against it. It said the allegations in the intervention notice were unfounded. Lautro later accepted that some of the facts were not correct and that some of the allegations must be qualified, but decided intervention remained necessary and desirable in the interests of investors. On January 11 1991, Norwich gave three months' notice of termination of its agency agreement with Winchester. Winchester was only ent-itled to conduct investment business as Norwich's app-ointed representative. Once that position was suspended, and then terminated, it was unable to conduct any investment business. The Divisional Court refused an application by Winchester for judicial review of the intervention notice. On the appeal, the major issue was whether Lautro's failure to give Winchester an opportunity to make representations before service invalidated the notice. Mr Collins for Winchester submitted first that in exercising its functions as a recognised SRO, Lautro was under a duty to act in accordance with natural justice - to act fairly in the circumstances. There was no doubt that Lautro was obliged to exercise its powers fairly in relation to members, at Common Law and by statute (see Lloyd v McMahon (1987) AC 625,702 and paragraph 2 of Schedule 2 to the 1986 Act). Second, Mr Collins submitted that duty was owed not merely to Lautro members, but also to persons who would be prejudicially affected by its decisions The issue arose because of the self-regulatory structure which had been created under the Act. A recognised SRO controlled those authorised persons who were its members. The authorised persons controlled their appointed representatives. Lautro decisions, particularly in relation to intervention notices, would frequently have a very considerable effect on appointed representatives. When a decision-making body was called on to reach a decision arising out of the relationship between two persons only one of whom was directly under its control, and it was apparent that the decision would be likely to affect the second person adversely, then as a general proposition the decision-making body did owe some duty of fairness to that second person, which in appropriate circumstances might well include a duty to allow him to make representations. That would particularly be the case when the adverse effect was on the second person's livelihood or ability to earn. Rule 7.3(12) defined with some clarity the persons who should be served, and to whom in appropriate circumstances Lautro owed a general duty to act fairly. Third, Mr Collins submitted that fairness required Winchester should be given the opportunity to make representations before the decision to issue the notice was reached. The decision whether to exercise the power of intervention, and to serve a notice before hearing the persons to whom it was directed or whom it would affect, must be balanced against what Lautro regarded as the interests of investors. In that sense it would be moved by considerations similar to those which affected a court deciding whether to grant an injunction ex parte. If a decision-making body was to exercise intervention powers without giving the opportunity to make representations beforehand, its procedures should provide that those who might otherwise expect to have been allowed to make representations should at least be allowed to make immediate application to set the decision aside and appeal. At the relevant time, rule 7.3 gave no such rights to non-members. In February 1992, however, the rules were amended to give non-members served with an intervention notice the right to appeal (see new rules 7.28 and 7.3(12)). When the intervention notice was served, Lautro's rules were defective in not giving a right of appeal. While the power to decide to serve an intervention notice without first hearing representations from persons affected was not in itself so unfair as to invalidate the notice, a lack of any means by which the person could immediately thereafter challenge the notice was a breach of the requirements of fairness which the law should imply. If Lautro did not afford a non-member served in accordance with rule 7.3(12) the opportunity to apply to rescind the notice, and/or to appeal, then the lack of such remedies would be unfair and the procedure unlawful. However, Mr Collins had expressly limited his challenge to Lautro's failure to allow the making of representations before service of the notice. That of itself did not invalidate the notice. Although at the relevant time Lautro's rules, and thus its procedure, were defective in the respects outlined, it was not required by law to afford to Winchester the opportunity to make representations as to why a notice should not be served before deciding whether or not to serve it. The appeal was dismissed. Their Lordships agreed. For Winchester: Andrew Collins QC and Cherie Booth (Manches &amp; Co). For Lautro: Michael Beloff QC and Richard Gordon (Slaughter and May).</p>

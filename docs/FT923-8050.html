			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / UN will send troops to guard food convoys in Somalia THE United Nations yesterday signed a breakthrough agreement with warlords in Somalia for 500 armed UN guards to be deployed within 21 days in the war-shattered capital, Mogadishu. The Blue Berets' mission will be to help protect food distribution to millions of starving people in Somalia, where some 3,000 to 5,000 people are dying each week, says Mr David Andrews, the visiting Irish foreign minister. The agreement, signed after months of tense discussion with the factions in Somalia's 20-month civil war, clears the final obstacle to a massive relief effort in the famine-plagued nation. Troops from Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt and Canada, already on standby, could be sent to Somalia before the end of the month once the UN Security Council gives the final go-ahead. The military force will ensure security for food distribution, which has been hampered by banditry, looting and hijacking of aid convoys by gunmen. The agreement was signed yesterday at Bardere, 200 miles west of Mogadishu, by Mr Mohamed Sahnoun, the UN secretary-general's special representative in Somalia, and General Mohamed Farrar Aideed, leader of the Somali National Alliance, a loose coalition of four clan-based factions. It provides for the 500 troops to secure Mogadishu airport and harbour and to guard the transport of food to warehouses and distribution points within the city. No agreement has yet been reached for the UN guards to escort food convoys outside Mogadishu. Mr Sahnoun said deployment of the troops 'should not take more than two to three weeks maximum and I hope it will take less than that'. He stressed that the UN mission would be purely humanitarian. 'We cannot, as the UN, ensure law and order all over Somalia. To do that we would need thousands of troops,' he said. Gen Aideed has previously been nervous that the presence of foreign troops in the country would undermine his military advantage over rival warlord, Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed, observers say. Mr Sahnoun appealed yesterday for massively increased aid and said UN agencies and non-governmental organisations such as the Red Cross were so far only sending a quarter of the minimum monthly food needs. 'Let us organise a couple of airlift operations as we did for Ethiopia in the 1984-85 famine,' he said. Mr Sahnoun and Mr Andrews praised the efforts of non-governmental organisations and made veiled criticism of the World Food Programme and other UN agencies for continuing to hide behind the danger factor and not acting rapidly enough to deliver food. Mr Andrews said the devastation and dying he saw in Somalia were appalling: 'It was as if somebody dropped an atom bomb, the end of the world, a land that God has forgotten.' He said he would urge on Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign minister, today the need to double European Community food aid to the country.</p>

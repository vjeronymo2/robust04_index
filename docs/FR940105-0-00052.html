In addition, the agency is replacing this revoked regulation with one that was included in a final rule that published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  of December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64123). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> January 5, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Michelle A.

L. 101&hyph;535) became law on November 8, 1990. Section 6 of the 1990 amendments established a procedure under which FDA was given 30 months from the date of their enactment to promulgate final rules implementing that section. Pursuant to that procedure, FDA published a proposal on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2957) (the misleading container proposal), to amend its regulations by implementing new &sect;100.100 (21 CFR 100.100) to define the circumstances in which a food is misbranded under section 403(d) of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(d)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6(b)(3)(D)(ii) of the 1990 amendments provides that, if the final rule to implement section 403(d) of the act is not promulgated within 30 months of the date of passage of the 1990 amendments (November 8, 1990), then the regulation proposed to implement that section is to be considered a final regulation. Further, section 6 provides that States and their political subdivisions shall be preempted with respect to section 403(d) of the act at that time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 30-month period established by the 1990 amendments expired on May 9, 1993. Because FDA was unable to publish a final rule, in the proceeding instituted in January 1993, by May 9, 1993, FDA published a document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of May 12, 1993 (58 FR 27932) (the May 12, 1993, regulation), announcing that the regulation that FDA had proposed in the misleading container proposal was considered to be a final regulation by operation of law, effective May 10, 1993. This document did not conclude the rulemaking begun in January, 1993, however. Rather, the May 12, 1993, regulation was part of a separate proceeding that is compelled under section 6(b)(3)(D)(ii) of the 1990 amendments (see H. Rept. 101&hyph;538, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 18 and 136 Congressional Record 5842 on the effect of this ``hammer'' provision). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64123), FDA published a final rule on the circumstances in which containers are misleading and thus would misbrand the food under section 403(d) of the act. This final rule concluded the proceeding that the agency instituted with the misleading container proposal. In the May 12, 1993, document, FDA stated that when it issued such a final rule, it would act to supersede the regulation that had become final by operation of law. Thus, the agency proposed to withdraw the May 10, 1993, regulation in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64208). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA explained that it was proposing to do so for two reasons. First, the May 10, 1993, regulation did not have the benefit of public comment. Thus, the regulation included in the December 6, 1993, final rule (the December 6, 1993 regulation), which was the product of notice and comment rulemaking, is better able than the May 10, 1993, regulation to ensure adequate implementation of section 403(d) of the act and to facilitate compliance. Second, FDA tentatively found that because of the minor differences between the May 10, 1993, regulation and the December 6, 1993, regulation, replacing the former with the latter will not result in any hardship to manufacturers who have relied on the May 10, 1993, regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA gave interested persons 10 days to comment on its proposal to withdraw the May 10, 1993, regulation. It also proposed to make any final rule that issues in this proceeding effective on the date of its publication in order to ensure that the supersession of the May 10, 1993, regulation proceeded as expeditiously as possible and with a minimum of confusion or ambiguity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment period on the proposal to withdraw the May 10, 1993, regulation closed on December 17, 1993. FDA received no comments on this proposed action. Therefore, FDA advises that the May 10, 1993, regulation, which became final by operation of law, is withdrawn. FDA advises that it is replacing that regulation with the December 6, 1993, regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the December 6, 1993, proposal (58 FR 64208 at 64209), FDA stated that it had determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(ii) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment, and that as a result, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. FDA received no comments on the conclusion; therefore FDA restates it here. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Economic Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the December 6, 1993, proposal (58 FR 64208 at 64209), FDA incorporated the conclusion from the December 6, 1993, final rule on slack-fill that the agency's action in replacing the May 10, 1993, regulation would not have any significant economic effects. The agency received no comments on this conclusion and consequently is restating it here. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subject in 21 CFR Part 100 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Food labeling, Foods. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, 21 CFR part 100 is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 100_GENERAL <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

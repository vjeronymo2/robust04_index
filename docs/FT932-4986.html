			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / France set to accept oilseed pact FRANCE yesterday seemed poised to accept the EC's draft agreement with the US limiting European oilseed output, but its ministers were maintaining anti-American rhetoric to placate French farmers. Mr Nicholas Sarkozy, ministerial spokesman for the government, said yesterday there was no question of 'sacrificing French farmers' interests'. But several ministers have said the oilseed deal, negotiated with more controversial farm export subsidy cuts last November, is not bad for French and EC interests. Limiting oilseed cultivation to 5.12m hectares in the Community would not cramp French farmers, they concede. But France will ask for a review of the restraint on industrial oilseed growth. The main sticking point when EC ministers meet in Luxembourg tomorrow may be France's desire to trade its acceptance of the oilseed deal for a firm EC declaration that the export subsidy curbs be re-negotiated by Washington.</p>

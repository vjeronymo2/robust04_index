			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Small satisfaction for the trade sector - Export financing BRITISH exporters seeking positive government support in the Autumn Statement were left unsated yesterday - pleased to have extra cover available, but still complaining that the cost of export credit insurance remains significantly higher for UK exporters than for most international competitors. The additional Pounds 700m of export credit guarantee cover is to be spread over the present financial year and 1993-94. Just Pounds 200m is to be added to cover this year, with Pounds 500m to be added next year - amounting to about a quarter of the total exports guaranteed by the Export Credit Guarantees Department (ECGD). The extra guarantees are to be focused on 11 markets - all of them countries in which British exporters are heavily involved. These markets are China, Hong Kong, South Africa, India, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Oman, Turkey and Zimbabwe. The first five of these are defined by the ECGD as 'concentrated markets' - meaning that they account for such a large proportion of the ECGD's overall foreign exposure that new cover is unavailable. Exporters have frequently argued that this restraint prevents them from winning orders in some of their biggest markets. So the decision to provide an extra Pounds 500m on an annualised basis - an increase of about 30 per cent on cover presently available - will be welcome. 'It's encouraging to see that the government has taken some note of what industry has been saying,' said Mr Philip Hills, head of export finance at the Midland Bank: 'In some of these eleven markets there has been growing concern that the ECGD was unable to cover British exporters' initiatives.' For example, British Aerospace is negotiating with the Indonesian government to sell Hawk jets worth several hundred million pounds. Until yesterday's provision of extra cover, BAe would have been unlikely to have access to export credit guarantees for the deal. But the availability of extra cover does nothing to resolve the principal complaint of British exporters - that the cost of export credit insurance premiums is so much higher than costs for competitors that they suffer a significant competitive disadvantage. All the ECGD said yesterday is that premium rates were reviewed - and in some cases trimmed - in April this year as part of the annual review process, and they would not be reviewed again until next spring. The government may feel that the competitive advantage won by exporters as a result of the recent devaluation of sterling is sufficient to leave premium rates untouched. This analysis may be simplistic, however, since many of the components going into British exports are imported, and so have become more expensive following devaluation. One trade financier said: 'Devaluation may have helped for exports inside Europe, but has probably made little difference in overseas markets where the cost of export credit insurance is going to bite. The evidence at present is clear - we are still uncompetitive with some of our fiercest competitors because of the cost of insurance.' Since the ECGD introduced in May 1991 its 'portfolio management system' (PMS) - designed to link export premium rates more closely to the existing risks - Britain has become one of the most expensive insurers in the world. The government has nevertheless been unflinching in its commitment to the system, arguing that the new premiums provide an accurate assessment of the risks of non-payment involved in selling goods to developing country markets. It insists that taxpayers should not subsidise insurance premiums when exporters face a very real chance of not being paid for their goods. Some other industrial exporters have recently raised insurance premium rates, but few by enough to reach British levels. Exporters still complain of premiums three and four times higher than those for competitors in risky markets in developing countries.</p>

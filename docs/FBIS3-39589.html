			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ciriaco De Mita, Italian Popular Party </F> member, by Paulo Franchi in Rome; date not given: "It Is Not  Enough To Step Back"]    [Excerpts] "Certainly I would not feel that I had a role to  play in a Popular Party which was to lose its identity in an  indistinct political mass like the Pact for Italy, and I would  take the consequences. But this seems to me obvious, not  sensational." That is it. Ciriaco De Mita is following, from  home, by telephone, the fight for power between [Pact for Italy  leader] Segni and [Italian Popular Party, PRI, Secretary]  Martinazzoli. He knows that there is talk of a statement by the  secretary saying that there is no problem of his standing as a  candidate. But on this matter he does not want to say anything  more. Just as he does not want to comment on the concatenation  of curious coincidences of recent weeks, after announcing in an  interview with LA REPUBBLICA his decision to return to frontline  politics: First of all, the vague announcements from Turin  about his being under investigation, then the chorus of `no's'  against his standing as a candidate, coming also from shores  quite distant from the Popular Party and the Pact.... Nothing.  Who knows whether out of vice or virtue, De Mita is insisting  even in the darkest day. On speaking about politics. Sorry,  talking logically about it.    [Franchi] What, Mr. De Mita? Your constant intellectual  pride?    [De Mita] Certainly not pride. Maybe I have all the limits  and virtues of the self-taught person. I claim to have been one  of the first to point to the profound reasons for the corruption  of the democratic system, and also to have attempted to organize  a response. We have deceived ourselves into thinking that it is  enough to pitch the right against the left with the new  electoral law. Now we are finding out that the problem is  infinitely more complex. They are struggling in each of the  three poles with equally important questions: replacement [of  discredited politicians and parties], new faces. But these are  questions which cannot be answered without a general political  framework of reference.    [Franchi] What does this mean for the Popular Party?    [De Mita] I have shared Martinazzoli's choice of solitude,  in  the conviction that the following legislature needs to be a  constituent legislature,and that the important thing will be to  be there, to put across our ideas. But I fear that the choice  of solitude is transforming itself into a choice of absence  which, you understand, is something else, and that the right is  increasingly taking shape, and in forms not seen before.    [Franchi] Are you talking of [Forza Italia leader]  Berlusconi's party?    [De Mita] I have one question to ask them: How far have they  contributed to convincing people that politics is not a question  of guiding processes, but of offering a product, according to  commercial rules? And why are those who have depicted this idea  as an extraordinary positive novelty then surprised that the  bravest in this domain has entered the field? [passage omitted]    [Franchi] This is how we settled the accounts with the  immediate past? But we are still far from today's crisis.    [De Mita] I confess: In recent weeks I assumed the victory  of the left to be inevitable. Now I am much less convinced.  The Italian left has reasoned for a long time like the high  jumper convinced that it did not have to win because the  adversary was placing the bar far too high: the international  restrictions, the agreement to exclude. Today this has all  gone. The athlete has put on his running shoes, but he no  longer seems to know in which discipline to compete. In  particular when the shattering of politics and institutions has  rendered an authoritarian solution plausible.    [Franchi] You have been very much a member of this country's  ruling classes. Does it seem normal to you to blame others for  our mistakes?    [De Mita] I do not blame anything on anyone, and I believe  that I have enormous responsibilities. I know that pointing out  other people's responsibilities, or taking on one's own, is no  longer enough. The old ruling class can step back, but this is  not enough to resolve the principal problem, which is not yet  that of who should administer power, but of creating the  institutional conditions for exercising it.    [Franchi] And who should take on all this?    [DE Mita] I ought to reply: Everyone and nobody, because it  was given only to the Eternal Father to create the world from  nothing. But I am also convinced that in Italy there is a great  market for democracy and that if people quitting the ranks, it  is because of an absence of supply. And hence the need to  organize this supply. I believe the time has come for the  press, the major newspapers, to discuss what they are doing,  their national role, what it means to form a public opinion in a  civilized country. It is the same crisis as the one which the  parties are facing, that of their ability to organize consensus,  to place the problem on the agenda. A high circulation is not  everything. The parties too, as long as they had votes,  believed that their representativeness and their influence were  intact. And eternal.</p>

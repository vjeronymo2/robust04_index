			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 1 Feb (MTI) -- The director of the  Criminal Justice Department of the National Police, Brigadier  General Antal Kacziba, called for more precise legal definitions  to protect society more effectively from extremist phenomena, at  a news conference in Budapest today. He proposed punishing  extremist conspiracy as well.    Kacziba said that criminal proceedings had been launched  against two members of the World National Popular Rule Party  (WNPRP), suspected of having committed the crime of incitement  against a community. The suspects are Albert Szabo, 29, a dual  Hungarian-Australian citizen who heads the party, and Akos B., a  juvenile activist. They made a confession, but did not plead  guilty.    As previously reported, the complaint lodged by the National  Security Office against the two had some connection with the  WNPRP meeting in Budapest in mid-January, where they denied that  the Holocaust had ever taken place and defined themselves as  successors to the Hungarian fascist arrow-cross party and its  leader, Ferenc Szalasi, who was executed in 1946 for crimes  against humanity.    The police investigated 16 skinhead attacks involving 88  suspects, 22 of whom were taken into custody, Kacziba said.    In the same period, the Budapest court tried three cases on  charges of serious bodily or mental harm caused to people for  their affiliation to an ethnic, racial or religious minority.  The court could not establish proof of this criminal motivation  in any of the cases, but imposed a penalty for grevious bodily  harm with base motives, and hooliganism. Appeals may be filed.    Seven lawsuits involved the use of extremist symbols. Most  recently, the police received a complaint against the Budapest  organization of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, for  displaying a coat-of-arms with a five-pointed red star at their  televised meeting on November 7.    Kacziba stressed that the criminal code uses no terms like  "left wing" and "right wing," and the police are not supposed to  qualify the political views of offenders. It is the duty of the  National Security Office to detect extremist groupings. The  police only conduct criminal proceedings.</p>

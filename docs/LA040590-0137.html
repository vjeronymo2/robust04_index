			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> YOUTH PROGRAMS APPROVED  </P> <P> Mayor William Thomson's youth program proposals, outlined in his State of the  City speech last week, were approved Tuesday by the Board of Directors for  implementation by the city's boards and commissions and for inclusion in next  year's budget.  </P> <P> Thomson proposed expanding the Police Department youth adviser program,  improving after-school programs, hiring a youth program coordinator, putting  the city's seniors to work as volunteers in youth programs and starting a  college-assistance trust fund.  </P> <P> City Manager Donald McIntyre, mindful of a $5-million budget gap that must be  bridged, advised that he would prefer a volunteer youth program coordinator to  save the city money. Overall, McIntyre estimated Thomson's suggestions could  cost the city $50,000 to $100,000 next year.  </P></p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Higher charges and taxes cut Interbrew net profit to BFr1.5bn NET PROFIT at Interbrew, the Belgian brewer which owns the Stella Artois and Jupiler beer brands, slipped to BFr1.54bn (Dollars 45m) from BFr2.14bn in the year to September 30 1992. The family-owned group, Europe's fifth-largest brewer, said yesterday that operating profits had risen by 11.2 per cent from BFr2.1bn to BFr2.43bn in the same period, after depreciation, but increased financial charges and taxes cut into the profit. Interbrew is looking for a permanent successor to Mr Jose Dedeurwaerder, who unexpectedly resigned as managing director last month. Mr Jean-Marie Descarpenteries, who was brought in to maintain continuity, said yesterday he hoped to find a successor 'as soon as possible', probably from within the company. Mr Dedeurwaerder, a US citizen, was given the task of turning the company round and giving it an international dimension when he took over in mid-1988. He resigned 'for personal reasons'. Mr Jacques Thierry, Interbrew's chairman, yesterday denied he had fallen out with the family shareholders or the rest of the board. Mr Descarpenteries paid tribute to Mr Dedeurwaerder's achievements and said he would concentrate on improving profit margins and developing the group's beer and soft drinks business on the European market, including eastern Europe. He pointed out that Interbrew's long-term aim of a stock market flotation would be impossible while the company was less profitable than its principal European competitors.</p>

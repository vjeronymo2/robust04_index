			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Freeze on sale of County Hall THE government said last night that it was freezing the sale of County Hall, former headquarters of the Greater London Council, until the end of this month. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, told the London Residuary Body, which controls the site, to suspend action on sale until July 31 to allow the London School of Economics a fair chance to submit a bid for the premises. The department said it had received assurances from the director of the LSE that the school could submit a bid by that date. Mr Howard said, however, that if no bid was forthcoming by the deadline, the LRB would be free to act as it sees fit in pursuit of its statutory responsibilities.</p>

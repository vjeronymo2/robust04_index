			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAI MAY GET ANOTHER CHANCE  </P> <P> J. H. Whitney &amp; Co., under pressure from its banks, said Thursday that it  had entered negotiations to reduce its $1.2-billion offer for Prime Computer  Inc.  </P> <P> Such a development might open the way for MAI Basic Four Inc. of Tustin to  again enter the bidding for Prime, which it began last November and  subsequently modified greatly.  </P> <P> Whitney said two of its banks asked it to obtain more financing after Prime, a  Natick, Mass.-based minicomputer maker, reported a $19-million quarterly loss  last week. Whitney, a New York-based venture capital firm, indicated that it  has been unable to find that financing at its current offer of $21.50 a share  for Prime.  </P> <P> "Although we are willing to continue to seek financing at the $21.50 level, we  believe, based on our efforts to date, that such financing will probably not be  available from our current financing sources on a basis satisfactory to all  financial participants," said Don E. Ackerman, a Whitney partner.  </P> <P> Prime spokesman Joseph Gavaghan confirmed that the companies are negotiating  possible changes in their June 23 merger agreement but declined to comment on  how much the price might drop.  </P> <P> Prime's directors agreed to the merger with Whitney while fending off MAI's  hostile $970-million bid.  </P> <P> MAI, a computer firm controlled by New York investor Bennett S. LeBow, has  since offered to buy Prime's minicomputer business for $525 million.  </P> <P> Wall Street analysts said if Whitney cuts its offer significantly, LeBow might  be able to launch another bid for all of Prime.  </P> <P> "It's like an ongoing soap opera on TV. It doesn't go away," analyst Jay  Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said of the long takeover battle.  </P> <P> An MAI spokeswoman in New York said it had no immediate comment on Whitney's  announcement.  </P> <P> Prime, which has 11,200 employees worldwide, reported revenue of $1.6 billion  last year, about one-third from minicomputers. The company also produces  computer-aided design and manufacturing systems, a business that was  substantially enlarged when Prime acquired Computervision Inc. for $435 million  last year.  </P> <P> As the minicomputer industry faces a general slump, Whitney's banks apparently  believe that Prime needs more financing to withstand continuing losses and turn  itself around.  </P></p>

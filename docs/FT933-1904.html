			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Russian betrayal leaves Georgia's president adrift - A look at the plight of Eduard Shevardnadze, risking death or capture by secessionists GEORGIA presents the most miserable spectacle of any of the countries which achieved 'independence' since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Economically prostrate, in the process of being dismembered, its head of state now in danger of death or capture by secessionists, it is close to collapse as a functioning state. The present conflict centres on the formerly pleasant resort of Sukhumi, capital of the Abkhazian autonomous republic - where Abkhazian forces, seeking independence for their state, yesterday claimed to have advanced to within 300m of the Georgian government headquarters in the town, having taken the TV tower and a hill overlooking the city administration building. Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of state, is in the city, possibly in that building: with him is Mr Gia Karkarishvili, the defence minister. Both have called on Sukhumi to be defended 'to the last drop of blood'. Mr Shevardnadze, the co-architect with Mr Mikhail Gorbachev of the grand turn in Soviet foreign policy which brought an end to the cold war, may end his days in the hopeless defence of a provincial capital in a small country whose fate he has made his own. Histrionic and impulsive, the Georgian leader also seems to have been betrayed by the Russians. He agreed with foreboding to a Russian-guaranteed ceasefire with Abkhazia. When the Abkhazians broke it with a ferocious attack on Sukhumi last weekend, the Russian Foreign Ministry threatened sanctions against Abkhazia. This was not the position taken by the Defence Ministry, which had the power to enforce the ceasefire by the use of troops. General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, told the Georgians, not the Abkhazians, to withdraw their troops from Abkhazian territory as the only way to get peace. In this, he takes the same position as the Abkhazian negotiators at talks going on in the Russian resort of Sochi. It now appears clear that Russian policy, at least that followed by the Defence Ministry, is solidly pro-Abkhazian. 'It is already too late to help them,' the visiting UK defence secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, was told on Monday. Georgia's humiliation at the hands of Abkhazian formations, armed with modern, sophisticated weapons, is an object lesson in the crudity of Russian pressure. Russia's assistance to the Abkhazians has been matched by its absence of support to Georgia: as in Azerbaijan, where losses to the Armenians forced a change of government and a decision - taken two days ago  -by the parliament to apply for membership of the Russian-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States, so in Georgia the question of mending the fences with Russia has arisen. Mr Vakhtang Goguadze, chairman of Georgia's parliament, told fellow deputies on Monday night that he favoured joining the CIS. Part of the reason, he said, was that Russian generals had told him they could not help Georgia because they had no security treaty with it. The Abkhazian forces seem likely to prevail in Sukhumi, and thus to consolidate control in territory from which the Georgians have largely been expelled - in spite of the fact that they outnumbered the Abkhazians by nearly three to one. Abkhazia has made it clear it wants its autonomous status safeguarded by Russia, not by Georgia. It is not alone. South Ossetia, another autonomous region, was also at war with Georgian forces two years ago. Peace was secured last year by Russian troops. Adjaria, the third autonomous area, where comparative peace has been observed, is also distrustful of Tbilisi, but lacks a common border with Russia. The lesson few Georgian politicians have learnt is that all non-Georgian peoples in the republic appear to prefer Russian to Georgian rule. Further, the man violently displaced to make room for Mr Shevardnadze - former President Zviad Gamsakhurdia - has not given up his ambitions to return. His troops have taken most of the towns in Mingrelia - the region in the centre of Georgia from where Mr Gamsakhurdia originates. They have said that they have suspended hostilities, ostensibly to assist in the government's efforts to hold Sukhumi. Their column, which set out from the town of Ochamchira on Monday to fight its way into Sukhumi, has yet to appear in the Abkhazian capital.</p>

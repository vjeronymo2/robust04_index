			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / A different tune for electronics in Japan: Sony and Matsushita have reported profit falls After years of strong growth, Japan's mighty consumer electronics giants have run up against a wall. Faced with recession in international markets, Matsushita Electric Industrial and Sony, the largest and second largest consumer electronics groups in the world respectively, yesterday reported large profit falls and said they would be scaling back their capital investment programmes. Matsushita reported a fall in operating profit of 18 per cent to Y389bn (Pounds 1.64bn) as it was hit by foreign exchange losses of Y62.1bn. Pre-tax profit fell 39 per cent to Y363.4bn and after-tax profit declined 49 per cent to Y132.9bn. Sony reported a 44.1 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profit to Y166.3bn on a 5.7 per cent increase in sales at Y3,821bn. Net profit rose 2.7 per cent to Y120.1bn, but was boosted by the proceeds of a public offering by Sony Music Entertainment (Japan), which raised Y61.5bn. The extent of Sony's difficulty was highlighted by a fall in the group's parent operating loss to Y20.5bn from a profit of Y72.2bn, and the company's first loss since its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1958. Consumer electronics manufacturers worldwide have been hit by their failure over the past few years to stimulate consumer demand with exciting new products while large markets in industrialised countries are already saturated with colour TVs and audio equipment. Even in Japan, 'the consumer electronics market has been flat for the past five years', says a spokesman for Matsushita. The leading companies in the industry have seen the difficult times coming for some years. Since the mid-1980s there has been growing concern about the lack of new products to stimulate consumer demand. But attempts to introduce model changes and, in the case of Matsushita and Sony, by buying into prominent US entertainment companies, have not been as successful as they would have liked. The results of Matsushita and Sony were affected by their need to digest the acquisitions, of, respectively, MCA and Columbia Pictures, although Matsushita boosted consolidated sales 13 per cent to Y7,449.9bn, thanks to MCA revenues of Y480bn. Meanwhile, efforts to stimulate demand by introducing new product models at the frenetic pace of once every six months have backfired. Japanese consumers are no longer fooled by such gimmicks while the country's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has warned the manufacturers that frequent model changes were an unnecessary waste of resources and labour time. Matsushita said sales of video equipment remained flat at Y1,699.8bn, while audio equipment sales rose 6 per cent to Y631.7bn. Home appliances grew 9 per cent to Y982.2bn, communication and industrial equipment sales advanced 8 per cent to Y1,678.6bn, while electronic components rose 3 per cent to Y862.7bn. Revenue from entertainment, including films and music entertainment, video and audio tapes, totalled Y626.4bn. However, Matsushita said revenues at MCA, which were included into the sales figures starting last fiscal year, fell 4 per cent because of the shortage of box-office hits. Sony reported a 1.3 per cent decline in video equipment sales to Y896.4bn, in spite of a 6.7 per cent fall in the final quarter. For the year, audio equipment sales rose 7.5 per cent, televisions 7.3 per cent and filmed entertainment 27.8 per cent, while music entertainment fell 7.4 per cent. The consumer electronics industry does not expect to see a marked improvement until later in the year while products which they are placing their hopes on, such as digital audio tapes and interactive video systems, are being introduced only this year and will take some time to attract widespread demand. Both companies hope that the release of new products in the domestic market and a recovery in the US and Europe will lift sales during the current year. For the current year to next March, Matsushita expects consolidated pre-tax profits to rise 6 per cent to Y385bn, on a marginal increase in sales of 0.7 per cent to Y7,500bn. Sony expects a 2 per cent increase in sales at the parent company to Y2,020bn and a 45 per cent increase in net profit to rise 45 per cent to Y30bn, while research and development spending is likely to rise from Y240bn to between Y245bn and Y250bn.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The UNSC Should Not Make Hasty Arguments on </F> Sanctions"]    [Text] Just like a stone rolling down a steep hill,  arguments over the DPRK's suspected nuclear development program  are rapidly moving towards the issuing of a warning by the  United Nations Security Council [UNSC] and the imposition of  phased sanctions on North Korea. This is a very serious  situation.    First of all, North Korean leaders should stop using its  "fuel rod card" but should comply with a call by the UNSC, which  in a presidential statement issued at the end of May asked  Pyongyang to remove and store fuel rods in such a way as to  enable the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to  accurately assess them in the future.    Pyongyang has asserted that "we have extracted  experimentally  only a very small amount (about 90 gm) of plutonium from broken  fuel rods." Fuel rods are real evidence that enables the IAEA  to ascertain whether or not Pyongyang's assertion is true.    North Korea is holding up its decision to withdraw from the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Using this "special  position," it has rejected regular inspections of fuel rod  removal. Pyongyang has also asserted that if the nuclear issue  is resolved at a third round of high-level talks with the United  States, it will allow the IAEA to inspect the discharge of fuel  rods.    The IAEA, which does not approve of the DPRK's "special  position," initially called for inspections of the ongoing  discharge of fuel rods. Recently, the agency appears to have  backed down from that position. It now proposes that Pyongyang  should at least promote work to remove fuel rods in accordance  with IAEA standards in the future. It can be said that the  agency has made the proposal in consideration of North Korea's  "special position."    After the UNSC issued a presidential statement in May, a  councilor at the North Korean Embassy in Australia reportedly  told Western correspondents that although Pyongyang could not  stop the work to remove fuel rods, it stored sets of 40  discharged fuel rods in a storage pool after attaching a plate  showing each rod's location inside the reactor and its serial  number. Moreover, he reportedly said that although the IAEA was  demanding the storing of every 10 fuel rods as one set, this was  a technical matter and that there was no big difference in  opinion about it.    If what he has said is true, and if Pyongyang has no  intention of destroying evidence, the DPRK should not be hung up  on the "technical matter."    We hope that the UNSC will exercise prudence. The recent  uproar caused by the discharge of fuel rods has increased  suspicion over the DPRK's nuclear program. But at the present,  it is no more than suspicion. What has been questioned is  whether or not North Korea has extracted weapons-grade plutonium  from spent fuel rods. However, removed fuel rods are put under  IAEA supervision, so they will not be diverted to a military  program.    It is believed that India, Pakistan, and Israel have  promoted  the development of nuclear weapons, or that they already have  them. As such, there are potential nuclear powers in the world.  Unlike the DPRK, these countries are not obliged to accept  nuclear inspections and not subject to sanctions because they  are not NPT members.    If economic sanctions are imposed on an NPT member over  suspicion of its nuclear program, this will discourage other  countries from joining the NPT.    If North Korea withdraws from the NPT as a result of  economic  sanctions, it will become impossible for Pyongyang to realize  its wish to normalize relations with the United States. But at  the same time, the DPRK will be free from the obligation to  submit to nuclear inspections. From the broad view of  maintaining and expanding the NPT system, a hasty decision on  economic sanctions should be avoided. We should not forget that  it is ordinary people who suffer from sanctions.    There is still hope that this nuclear issue will be resolved  peacefully through dialogue. When the UNSC issued a  presidential statement at the end of March to call on North  Korea to accept additional nuclear inspections, Pyongyang  "flatly rejected" it. However, in May, the country expressed a  strong desire to settle the issue at high-level talks with the  United States through the acceptance of additional inspections.  Now is a very critical moment for dialogue diplomacy.</p>

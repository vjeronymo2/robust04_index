			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel intends  to urge the European Union [EU] to reinclude Croatia into  economic and financial cooperation. One day after the Geneva  foreign ministers' conference on a peaceful solution in Bosnia,  Kinkel said in Bonn on Saturday [14 May] that one should think  about whether one should grant funds and resume negotiations on  a cooperation agreement. The parties to the conflict must  realize that the efforts for peace are worthwhile. Yet, the  aggressor cannot expect support for the reconstruction of his  country.    Kinkel noted that, despite all criticism of the  international  peace efforts to date, one must not overlook that in some  spheres, the situation has improved in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In  the past few months, Croatia has made a contribution to a  peaceful development. By pointing to the talks in Geneva, Kinkel  said that the sanctions against the Serbs would have to be  consistently maintained. According to Kinkel, the signal of  Geneva was: "The Bosnian Serbs and the government in Belgrade  must realize that they are facing a joint position of the  countries that participate in the conference, countries they  will need politically, and, later, also for economic  reconstruction."    Kinkel stated that one must not harbor any illusions  regarding the difficulties of the future course of the  negotiations. Too many promises and agreements have been broken  to date, particularly from the Serbian side. "Hence, there is  no reason to be euphoric," Kinkel concluded.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Homes More Affordable Statewide: Statewide housing affordability improved in  September for the second month in a row as buyers increasingly sought homes in  more affordable communities, the California Assn. of Realtors said. Eighteen  percent of households earned the income needed to qualify for a mortgage loan  to purchase the median-priced, existing single-family home, up from 17% in  August but still down from 22% a year ago. In the Los Angeles region, 14% could  qualify to purchase the median-priced home, up from 12%. At the September  median price of $221,954 in Los Angeles, a household here needed an annual  income of $73,118 and faced monthly mortgage payments of $1,828.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHUTTLE SKIPPER HAS CLOSE CALL WHILE FLYING JET  </P> <P> A NASA jet piloted by the commander of the space shuttle Atlantis reportedly  came within 500 feet of a Pan Am wide-bodied jetliner about 30 miles west of  Washington, officials said Tuesday night.  </P> <P> The NASA T-38 training jet piloted by David W. Walker came close to the Pan Am  jet at about 6:35 p.m. Monday about five miles west of Washington Dulles  International Airport in the northern Virginia suburbs, said John Leyden, a  spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration.  </P> <P> Navy Capt. Walker, who was commander of the shuttle that returned May 8 from a  four-day mission, flew to Washington on Monday night in a T-38 to attend a  White House ceremony honoring the shuttle astronauts, NASA spokesman David  Garrett said.  </P> <P> Leyden said the pilot of the T-38 was listed as "David Walker," but he did not  know if it was the same David Walker. However, Garrett said there is no other  NASA pilot by that name.  </P> <P> The shuttle captain, reached at a Washington hotel, declined to confirm if the  incident occurred.  </P> <P> "That's something that I need to probably talk with the FAA about, not with the  news organizations," Walker said. "I'm going to have to get my information from  them before I start talking to you all."  </P> <P> NASA's Garrett said he had heard reports of a possible close call involving  Walker but had been unable to reach the pilot.  </P> <P> Describing the incident, Leyden of the FAA said: "The pilot (of the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration craft) was given an 8,000-foot assigned  altitude. He was descending below his assigned altitude of 8,000 feet to 7,000  feet, and that caused him to come close to a Pan American Airbus 310."  </P> <P> Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon confirmed that the small plane crossed the  path of Flight 140, which was en route to Paris from Dulles.  </P> <P> "It had taken off from Dulles and was at 7,000 feet when it reported a T-38  aircraft came within what the captain believed to be approximately 500 feet of  the Airbus aircraft," Hanlon said. The Pan Am jet was carrying 166 passengers  and a crew of 10, she said.  </P> <P> "The pilot did not take any evasive action," but immediately reported the  incident to the Dulles Airport tower, Hanlon said.  </P></p>

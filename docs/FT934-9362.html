			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Nigeria's government to appeal against court ruling Nigeria's military-backed interim government said last night that it would appeal against a Lagos court ruling that it was illegal, Paul Adams writes from Lagos. In a case brought earlier in the day by Chief Moshood Abiola, winner of last June's annulled presidential poll, the judge ruled that former military ruler Gen Ibrahim Babangida had no authority to appoint the interim government led by Chief Ernest Shonekan to take his place when he stepped down on August 26. Mr Shonekan is due to address the elected national assembly in Abuja today when he is expected to defend this week's unpopular decision to increase petroleum prices.</p>

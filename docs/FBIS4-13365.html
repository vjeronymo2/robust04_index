			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of appeal from Major General Hasan al-Naqib, member </F> of the presidential council of the Unified Iraqi National  Congress, to the Iraqi people and armed forces as published by  the Congress' mouthpiece AL-MU'TAMAR in this week's edition]    [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful.  O ye who believe, if a wicked person comes to you with any  news, ascertain the truth, lest ye harm people unwittingly, and  afterwards become full of repentance for what ye have done.  [Koranic verse]    O patient and struggling Iraqi people. O valiant sons of our  armed forces.    The dictator is daily persisting with his tyranny and the  [words indistinct] with the genocide, robbery, and disregard for  all values. A few days ago, Staff General Iyad Fulayyih, the  Army chief of staff, and some of his field commanders came out  for three days to boast of the greatest victory achieved by the  Iraqi Army in its modern history, in the Mother of Battles war  as Saddam called it during an explanation of [word indistinct].    What drew attention was the state of discomfiture and  anxiety  of the chief of staff, whom we know to be resolute and accurate  when discussing any of his forces' activities in any of the  pages of fighting [word indistinct] the battles of his master's  endless battles. This clearly reflected his fear of digressing  from what his commander in chief has taught him to say. We do  not want to be unfair to the man, for what can a person do when  his neck is under the butcher's knife?    For the sake of truth and history, we are letting the people  and Army hear the voice of fairness. We are confident that they  know more than we the consequences of this war, consequences  that were brought about by this military thinker who is behind  these so-called victories which, according to the chief of  staff, resulted from the accurate planning and follow-up of the  implementation by the Iraqi Armed Forces' commander in chief.    We ask him: What were these victories? What lethal pocket  had the enemy forces been trapped in where he [Saddam] inflicted  heavy losses on them and forced them to halt the war  unilaterally? In which huge tank battle did his armored forces  win? Was it the capture of the commanders of five divisions and  hundreds of commanders or brigades and divisions? Were they the  tank regiments that were taken to the prisoner-of-war camps in  Tabuk and Hafr al-Batin? Or were they the tens of thousands of  officers and other ranks who were taken prisoner? Or were they  the thousands more innocent soldiers who were burned to death by  the missiles and air attacks? Or were they the thousands who  are still missing and whose fate remains unknown? Or were they  the long columns of destroyed and burned-out tanks, equipment,  and artillery all along the battle lines? Or was it the  strategic reserves that were destroyed all along the  communications lines which cost billions of dollars?    O great Iraqi people. O honorable sons of our stricken Army.  A thousand and one questions we ask with pain and bitterness we  feel as a result of the catastrophe that has befallen the Iraqi  people, Army, and [word indistinct] and which was planned and  implemented by Saddam Husayn and his family which is deeply  involved in crime and which harbors latent hatred for this  peaceful and safe country.    We tell the tyrant that the hour of reckoning has come. We  appeal to all the honorable [word indistinct], commanders,  officers, and other ranks and ask them: Until when will the  tyrant continue to butcher your brothers and sons, violate  honor, and trample on values and norms with his [word  indistinct] feet? O zealous sons of al-Rafidayn, since when have  you been the tool of a tyrannic ruler's oppression?    O honorable brothers. The situation has come to a head. The  eyes of widows, mothers who have lost their sons, and [words  indistinct] are looking to you. Your brothers in the Unified  National Iraqi Congress [UNIC] place all their resources at your  disposal and you will see them with you in the trench of  steadfastness. Let us proceed together on the road of  liberation. Do what you have to do and leave the rest to God.  There is no help except from God. [Koranic verse] God's  peace, mercy, and blessings be with you.    [Signed] Staff Major General Hasan Mustafa al-Naqib, member  of the UNIC's presidential council.</p>

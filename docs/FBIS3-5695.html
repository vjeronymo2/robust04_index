Ironically, businesses'  alienation from banks stemmed from bank initiatives to issue  capital stock, creating a boom in the issuance of secondary  offerings. On the other hand, entirely different transactions  from past Japanese-style futures trading systems is causing a  collapse in the stock crossholding ownership system. At this  juncture when we see a structural change in the Japanese  economy, authorities must search for policies that are  applicable to new financial systems.    The economic situation enshrouding Japanese society is  especially serious. It seems that the 1980's when Japan was  referred to as an economic or financial superpower are now in  the distant past.    Even the automobile industry, which once considered itself  the export elite of Japan, has begun to close plants and cut  personnel; department stores and supermarkets continue to record  sales declines from previous year figures, and restaurant rows  with bright neon signs which normally prosper with festive  yearend parties are filled with empty taxicabs waiting for the  now rare rider. Japanese banks, which once monopolized the top  rankings for banks worldwide, see no solution to their  accumulations of nonperforming loans and mention is made of the  risk of a crisis in the financial system. It is time for  economic schools to perform on stage, but we must recognize the  reality that there is no easy cure for the problem.  <H5>  Structural Changes </H5>   The overall economy has changed completely from an  inflationary to a deflationary one. Despite the fact that super  low interest rates prevail, below even those in the latter half  of the 1980's, the money supply fails to grow and stock prices  cannot free themselves from the fear of a free fall because of  the murkiness of the future economy. The approach of cashing in  on unrealized paper profits to offset costs of amortizing  nonperforming loans faces problems and the markets are  enshrouded with a bottomless fear of future uncertainty in all  business categories.    The effects of the changing economy have begun to affect the  general public in the form of layoffs, and if personal as well  as corporate demand should cool, the problem of excess capital  investments of the late 1980's will show up with greater  intensity. When that happens, further production cuts will be  made and, in the worst possible case, we can expect a spiraling  shrinkage of material and monetary supplies. Already, in October  1993, the industrial production index had fallen to 88.0 and the  shipping index to 89.5 from indices of 100 in 1990, the largest  drop since the survey was started in 1978.    Corporate revenue has declined drastically and, in the half  year ending September 1993, recurring profits in the  manufacturing sector declined 31.8 percent, recurring profits of  the 11 automobile firms fell 90 percent, and revenue and profits  declined industrywide to the degree that one out of five firms  suffered losses, as reported by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN on 1  December 1993. The notion that "prices always rise" and "the  economy by its very nature expands" is in the process of  undergoing instantaneous invalidation.    Past episodes of this nature would have called for launching  public works projects, but this time we cannot anticipate much  in the way of relief from that source. Government finances are  not adequate to provide for action in this sector and, although  the Japanese Government compiled a huge supplemental budget of  more than 30 trillion yen for the period 1992 to 1993, the  desired effect was not obtained because of changes taking place  in the economic system. Further, there is very little desire to  borrow funds, despite the super low interest rates. This  situation reflects the severity of the debts accumulated during  the 1980's and has a restrictive effect on any remedy that can  be envisioned in the way of financial policy.    Essentially, the problem is that the economic system itself  is changing. In other words, the system is undergoing a  structural change as opposed to a cyclical change, and the  situation requires an analysis in this respect.    Accordingly, this should not be simply interpreted as a  period in which we witness a "revival of Keynesian theory."  Clearly, the "market worship" ideas of the "Chicago School"  which asserted in the 1980's that Keynesian principles were  relics of the past have lost their appeal, and the collapse of  socialism was accompanied by the disappearance from center stage  of Marxism which gave the impression of attracting the  conscience of all people. One wonders about the potential  effectiveness of any prescription written under a Keynesian  scenario which consists of an amalgamation of market and  programming principles just when both these principles are in  the process of losing social credibility.    The times are not so simple as to allow easy acceptance of a  "revival of Keynesian theory." The reason is that a great  structural change is taking place in the economy to the extent  that Keynesian policy cannot create effective demand, and  economic policy scenarios cannot be written without considering  that fact. This article will not address the issue completely,  but is designed to confirm the spread of the issue presented and  to aid in identifying a solution for the issue.  <H5>  Change From Indirect Financing to Direct Financing </H5>   At one time, the main source of capital for Japanese  business  was bank loans; it was not popular to seek funds via capital  markets by issuing stocks and bonds. The latter method of  capital procurement was limited to some of the firms listed on  the stock exchanges, and high issuing costs associated with a  unique underwriting system (limited to underwriting securities  firms in the Euromarket) favored maintenance of a financial  system centered on banks rather than capital markets.  Underwriting institutions handling corporate bonds are limited  to a segment of influential long-term credit banks, thus  providing for the comparative prevalence of banks in the  Japanese financial system.    Such circumstances enhanced the societal confidence assigned  to the banking industry. Between banks and securities firms,  banks enjoy overwhelming confidence, while the custom of  referring to securities firms in a somewhat deprecatory fashion  as "brokerages" reflects the low social confidence placed in the  stock market.    Preference given to banks in this capital procurement  structure has been extended to banks even in the management of  funds by individuals in that they deposit funds in bank deposits  or postal savings accounts despite low interest rates. Such a  trend was influenced to a degree by the fact that other options  were not necessarily diversified. Accordingly, a low-interest  policy provided the mechanism whereby banks served as  intermediaries in providing low-cost funds. Further, whenever  there was a shortage of funds, postal savings were diverted to  public works projects in a system referred to as the fiscal  investment and loan program. In essence, banks and post offices  served as intermediaries and played a central role under a  structure which supplied low-interest capital to industry.    In contrast to the foregoing situation, both the stock  markets and bond markets were comparatively unpopular for  investment of funds and were considered risky. As a former  employee of a securities firm, I still have strong memories of  an anecdote dating back to the 1970's when a branch manager of  the securities firm returned from a trip to Europe to gleefully  report that "In Europe securities firms are called banks." In  those days, it was the "fervent desire" of securities firms in  Japan to be elevated to the status of banks.    This structure in which banks play a central role in issuing  loans changed considerably during the 1980's. Those changes were  inspired by external pressure. The Bank for International  Settlements (BIS) imposed the principle of maintaining a certain  net worth and an awareness was established among currency  authorities who supervise international financial markets that  increasing net worth was indispensable in coping with  instability in the financial system. In response, Japanese  banks, which had extremely low levels of net worth, zealously  pursued the issuance of capital instruments.    Due to financial liberalization, Eurobond issues overseas  were gradually liberalized, and a wide spectrum of firms issued  bonds in the Eurobond markets.    The reason why Japanese firms zealously engaged in the  procurement of capital in the form of convertible and warrant  bonds in the Euromarkets was the unusually low costs. And, both  the percentage of Japanese business firms' capital procured in  Eurobond markets and the percentage of Japanese corporate issues  on the overall Eurobond market were huge, while many Japanese  firms from the manufacturing and service sectors established  financial subsidiaries in Europe and created a boom in capital  investment and procurement.    Essentially, Japanese domestic bank loans recorded a  relative  decline and securities markets played a central role in raising  capital for the first time. If it were a case that the  initiative of banks in raising capital by issuing stock inspired  corporate alienation from banks, i.e., active raising of capital  via the securities markets, we must label the development as  being ironic. This is because we can say that the extensive  involvement of banks themselves in the stock markets brought  about a decline in the social function of banks.  <H5>  Unprecedented Alchemy </H5>   The foregoing events have led to a substantial change in the  financial structure of Japanese corporations and a conspicuous  rise in their net worth.    A review of changes over a 10-year period shows that net  worth of Japanese corporations which stood at 20.93 percent in  1980 grew to 29.57 percent in 1985 and 36.4 percent in 1990. In  contrast, U.S. corporate net worth over the same period dropped  from 49.63 percent to 45.0 percent to 40.16 percent. The sharp  rise in net worth of Japanese corporations and the contrasting  sharp drop in U.S. corporate net worth are impressive.    On the other hand, a look at the nature of debt shows a  decline in current liabilities, i.e., a major decline in  short-term borrowing. Short-term borrowing as a percentage of  total assets (capital plus debt) during the above-mentioned  10-year period stood at 17.6 percent, 16.3 percent, and 9.9  percent.    On the other hand, U.S. corporate short-term borrowing as a  percentage of total assets during the same 10-year period stood  at a very low 3.8 percent, 3.7 percent, and 4.3 percent and  showed little change.    Rather, U.S. corporate debt structures reflect an increase  in  the ratio of fixed debt in excess of one year known as long-term  debt. Such long-term debt as a ratio of total assets during the  same 10-year period stood at 23.6 percent, 28.1 percent, and  34.1 percent (the data cover the manufacturing sector and were  extracted from the Bank of Japan "International Statistical  Comparisons").    The data give us the opportunity to examine differences in  financial structures of the 1980's whereby Japanese corporations  tended to raise capital by issuing stock, while U.S.  corporations tended to issue bonds for the same purpose. A  similar drop in corporate bank loan ratios has taken place in  both Japan and the United States, but the fact that bank loan  ratios in Japan are still about twice as high as in the United  States demonstrates that corporate dependence on banks is  greater in Japan than in the United States.    Stock markets expanded at an accelerated pace in the 1980's.    Effects of the low-interest policies implemented under a  coordinated international policy resulted in the flow of capital  into stock markets. Capital procured with extremely low interest  rates flowed into stock markets and the alchemy of a flow of  funds from right to left functioned efficiently; even when Black  Monday his the New York Stock Exchange in 1987, the Japanese  markets were enshrouded with the bullish mood that the "Tokyo  Stock Market" was insulated. Stocks continued to rise regardless  of volume issued, giving birth to the "myth of stock prices."    However, we must not forget that the "myth of stock prices"  was the product of a desperate effort to engineer a stable stock  ownership system. If stocks are held on a long-term basis  through cross-shareholding and the stock in question is not  traded in the markets, there would be no reason to sell the  stocks. As long as underlying selling pressure (expansion of  supply) did not manifest itself, equity financing functioned as  an unprecedented form of alchemy.  <H5>  Collapse of the Cross-Shareholding System </H5>   However, such circumstances guarantee reciprocal benefits if  stocks continue to rise in value, but the story changes if they  decline. I would like to verify the role of banks when that  occurs.    Banks not only issued loans to corporations, but also  intervened in a wide range of corporate accounting settlements;  in the international arena, banks offered foreign exchange  services and foreign intelligence as well as serving on  corporate management staffs as they dispatched officers to  provide industrial corporations assistance in the form of human  resources.    However, because banks were most aggressive in the issuance  of capital stock as a special characteristic of the 1980's, a  sharp increase took place in the share of bank stocks issued.  When stock prices peaked in December 1989, financial and  insurance stocks held a 29.7-percent share of the total market  value of all stock issued.    However, transactions in financial and insurance stocks did  not exceed 5.4 percent of total shares and 7.2 percent of total  value traded. Bank stocks enjoyed the structural status of being  issued but rarely traded. The reason for this was the attitude  that nonfinancial corporations should refrain from selling stock  of main banks on which the former were dependent for loans.    However, the foregoing attitude should not be interpreted as  a situation in which holders were unilaterally forced to retain  their bank stocks. Corporate cross-shareholding was created  among companies in the same corporate group with the idea that  when one firm decides to issue new stock, it can depend on other  corporations in the same group to purchase the newly issued  stock, to maintain continuous business relationships, maintain  stable stock prices through the creation of stable shareholders,  and thus create stability in the management of corporations.    However, systems of the foregoing nature are changing as  stock prices fall. A look at data as of April 1992 when bank  stocks were declining shows that financial and insurance stocks,  which represented 25.7 percent of total stock value, had  represented 7.2 percent of total shares traded and 11 percent of  total value traded (data from the "Monthly Statistical Report of  the Tokyo Stock Exchange"). Although the data indicate that  financial stocks represent a large share of the total stock  value and that trade in such stocks represents only a small  share of the total volume traded, the share of both stocks  traded and value traded have risen despite a drop in the current  market value. This reflects a rise in the frequency with which  bank stocks are being sold. Most likely, the fact that bank  stocks played a significant role in the overall market drop at  the end of 1993 can probably be interpreted as a further  acceleration in the selling trend.    The fact that bank stocks--which play a central role in  Japanese-style corporate groupings--lead in sales when overall  stock prices are declining reflects concern for the  nonperforming bond problem as well as concern for bank  operations, but also probably reflects a structural collapse of  the cross-shareholding stock ownership system which is the very  heart of Japanese-style systems to the degree that even bank  stocks are subject to disposal. According to the 15 October 1993  edition of NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, "Cross-sharehold of stock  established by corporations during the bubble period with the  objective of supporting stock prices is estimated to total 20-30  trillion yen and there is a widely held view that this segment  of cross-shareholding is subject to early disposition." It can  be assumed that because of hesitancy on the part of banks to  issue loans and the difficulty to issue new stock, corporations  are selling stock holdings to build up cash on hand and to raise  new capital.  <H5>  Futures Trading as Different Factor in the Market </H5>   What factors caused a manifestation of underlying expansion  in supply, i.e., selling pressure in the markets, through  excessive issuance of stock under equity financing?    Basically, conceivable is the fact that the excessive  issuance of stock in the form of huge, excessive financings in  the latter half of the 1980's created huge selling pressure.  However, as long as cross-shareholding relationships were  maintained and stable stock ownership operations functioned  smoothly, selling pressure did not manifest in the markets.  Stock withheld from the markets despite continued new issuances  caused stocks which should have fallen to continue rising and  equity financing functioned in the form of clever "alchemy."    However, at this point, I would like to draw attention to  the  fact that the arrival of different trading in the form of  futures trading caused a change in the market structure. In the  United States, long- and medium-term government bonds and  currency are the primary objects of futures trading, but in  Japan stock index futures became the major segment of the  futures market.    The main issue presented here is the difference between  futures trading and Japanese systems. In a world of  cross-shareholding, a rise in stock prices is beneficial to all  corporations and a decline in stock prices has a negative  impact. In general, mainstream textbooks in Japan explain (by  using advance mathematical formulas) that futures trading can be  effective in reducing risks. However, in the United States where  futures trading represents a huge market and as an investment  tool encompasses financial instruments such as currency and  bonds and a diversity of commodities such as rice and petroleum,  it may be an effective tool for avoiding risk, but in the case  of Japan where it was first introduced in the latter half of the  1980's and the markets are immature, it is probably very  important to understand how incompatible the basic mechanism of  futures trading and Japanese systems are.    Moreover, as rice futures begin to trade on the Chicago  Mercantile Exchange, as people anticipate a rise in future rice  prices, and futures prices continue to rise, we cannot disregard  the relationship with the price of rice in Japan. Further, in  Japan forward trading is called futures trading and currency  futures tend to be envisioned, but the history of futures is  short.    The foremost characteristic of futures trading involves the  sale of the item purchased by the final settlement date and to  earn the difference in price fluctuations, while that future  which has been sold is repurchased by the final settlement date  and to earn the difference in price fluctuations.    In the case of forward markets, it involves a contract to  trade a specific item at a specified future date and does not  involve a settlement of price differentials. However, futures  trading involves the execution of an opposing transaction by a  specific date and a settlement involving price fluctuations.  Accordingly, even if the price should fall, if the contract  anticipated such an event, the trader realizes a profit, but if  the price rises contrary to anticipation, the trader must settle  and suffer a loss. In other words, the system provides for a  profit whether prices rise or fall and the trader profits if he  anticipates correctly and loses if he anticipates incorrectly.    A mechanism benefiting all parties to a syndicate as long as  stock prices rose served as the basic principle for  Japanese-style cross-shareholding of stocks. However, it should  be obvious that the nature of futures trading is completely  incompatible with that principle. If one realizes that price  rises do not necessarily represent a positive, we must admit  that a major change must be made in Japanese-style systems which  were premised on latent profits.    However, this writer is not saying that futures trading was  responsible for the drop in stock prices. Drops in stock prices  were the logical outcome of the introduction of financial  deregulation. Even if we were to attempt an energetic control  over futures trading, in today's environment where  internationalization of financial markets has progressed, trades  will be relocated to foreign markets and it is doubtful that  price stability can be attained, while any attempt at enforcing  controls would most likely result in financial friction.    Futures can be referred to as a source of profits based on  the instability of spot prices. The reason why rice futures on  the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are soaring is that magnified  expectations are being placed on futures trading based on the  theory that spot prices will continue to rise. That being the  case, we cannot hold futures responsible for price fluctuations.  <H5>  New Financial Systems and Policy </H5>   Huge Japanese international balance of payments surpluses  flowed into overseas areas in the form of real estate and  securities investments. As a result, Japan emerged as the  world's leading creditor nation. However, even such investments  have lost tremendous value because of unfavorable foreign  currency exchange rate changes. Additionally, overseas real  estate investments have suffered price drops or vacancy rates  have risen because of worsening market conditions and underlying  debt instruments have converted into typical nonperforming debt.    Now if we turn our eyes to the domestic scene, we note that  we are unable to stimulate a recovery in lagging manufacturing  activity even if we lower interest rates and increase public  works projects and contrarily it seems that the situation may  deteriorate into a state of employment instability. Further,  money which lacks a productive investment target rotates between  postal savings and short-term securities and there are no signs  that money can be used to stimulate production and assist in the  recovery of the economy. A variety of proposals such as an  income tax cut, infrastructure investments in the area of  consumer requirements, and additional cuts in the official  discount rate are being made, but it is uncertain whether such  measures will have a decisive effect.    In the past, in times such as these when it appeared that  all  avenues of relief were blocked, capital investments in  anticipation of export demand came into play but such an  approach is no longer effective as long as trade friction with  the United States is in the throes of intensifying. It is  difficult to judge whether domestic market expansion measures  will serve to reinvigorate the economy because there is the  possibility that deregulation will destroy weak domestic  industries, but perhaps stimulation for the economy can be  obtained by directing efforts towards trade with Asia to include  China in anticipation of significant growth in those areas.    However, if economic policies of the past have been rendered  ineffective because of significant changes in the Japanese  economic structure as discussed in this article, we must search  for policies which are responsive to the new structure. If we  were to address the issue in terms of the discussion contained  in this article, we may find it effective to maintain interest  rates at a low level to ensure a smooth flow of funds via the  banks, but if corporate funds procurement from banks decrease,  such measures will prove inadequate. I believe it is a case  where we must formulate policies which envision a transition of  financial systems from reliance on banks to the capital markets  as a whole including the stock, bond and futures markets.</p>

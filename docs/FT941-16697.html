			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Yule Catto closes Dutch subsidiary Yule Catto, the speciality chemicals and building products group, is to close Nijs en Vale, its wholly owned Dutch subsidiary, later this year following completion of its existing contracts. Nijs en Vale, which makes architectural facades mainly in the Netherlands, incurred estimated operating losses of Fl 2.7m (Pounds 900,000) and an early return to profitability is not expected. Closure costs are estimated at Fl 6.5m and about 70 jobs will be affected by the decis-ion. Yule Catto's 1993 results will make provision for Nijs en Vale's anticipated losses and will also reflect a Pounds 1.4m charge in respect of goodwill which arose on the acquisition and which had previously been set against reserves.</p>

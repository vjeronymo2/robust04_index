			<p>BFN     [Text] Harare April 22 SAPA -- Forty-five members of the  Azania People's Liberation Army [APLA] and Umkonto we Sizwe [MK,  Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] on Friday [22 April]  graduated at the Zimbabwe Army Staff College in Harare, after a  four-month course in conventional warfare. Zimbabwe Defence  Minister Moven Mahachi said the men were now ready for  integration into South Africa's new national army, ZIANA news  agency reported.    Mr Mahachi told the men to prepare to work alongside their  former foes. "You are obviously aware that you will be  integrated into a new defence force where you will work with  people who were your enemies for a long time.    "It will not be an easy transition but one that will demand  your determination, patience and goodwill in a spirit of  reconciliation," the minister said in a speech read for him by  Deputy Defence Secretary Alexio Guruwo. This, he said, was the  only way to ensure that democracy in South Africa would succeed  and be sustained.    "We in Zimbabwe went through a transition period quite  similar to what you will experience in South Africa in the next  few months. We are more than willing to share our experiences  with you to the best of our ability as we have demonstrated by  accepting to train in our military institutions cadres from MK  and APLA."</p>

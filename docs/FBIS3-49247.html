			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] A Slovak Government delegation led by Minister of  Foreign Affairs Jozef Moravcik left Israel for Cyprus by air  this morning. Here is our special correspondent Agata Stanekova  reporting from Nicosia:    [Stanekova] Let us begin with the delegation's visit to  Israel, which ended today. Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef  Moravcik, speaking to journalists aboard the plane today, said  that pursuing a well-balanced policy in the entire region was an  important issue for Slovakia. The visit was meant to send a  clear signal, saying that the Slovak Republic wants to continue  the process of deepening relations with Israel in every sphere,  and we understood the visit as the first stage in realizing this  fundamental aim, Jozef Moravcik said.    During the flight to Cyprus, I also asked Slovak Minister of  Economy Jan Ducky to assess the visit.    [Begin Ducky recording] I am convinced, and this view was  shared by our Israeli partners, that this was a historic visit  because at long last we were able to normalize relations between  Israel and Slovakia. This fact is of great importance for  entrepreneurs and bankers in both countries because at last we  can start working on the basis of direct contacts without  middlemen and third parties. This should be reflected in both  the extent of our cooperation and its effectiveness.    I think the visit was very useful. Participating were not  only members of the government delegation but also 15  entrepreneurs from almost all spheres of industry and a strong  delegation representing the banking circles, led by National  Bank of Slovakia Governor Masar.

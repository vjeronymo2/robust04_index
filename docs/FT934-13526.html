			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Right lines for rail privatisation THE parliamentary arguments over the privatisation of British Rail look set to run until the very end of the legislative process. Not until the royal assent has been given to the bill can the government be certain of the final shape of its plans. Yet the broad outlines of the strategy for privatising Britain's railways are now clear. At the heart of the approach is the separation of the railway infrastructure from the running of trains. A new company, Railtrack, will own the rail network - track, signalling and most of the stations. Passenger trains will be run by 25 operating companies, each paying charges for using the track. BR's freight operations, to be divided into three companies and privatised, will also pay for track use. A rail regulator will ensure free competition, monitor safety arrangements and preserve network benefits such as through ticketing and railcards. This structure brings many benefits, including the creation of separate businesses focused on particular functions. Railtrack, for example, can concentrate on the rail infrastructure which has so often been neglected under state ownership. BR's maintenance operations are to be privatised as 14 competing companies which will bid for contracts. Significant efficiency savings on the infrastructure operation should follow, as elsewhere in the public sector where contracting-out has been introduced. Attractive investment Sir Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, has already expressed a desire to involve private finance in modernising the network. He is also keen to escape from the public sector, with Treasury restrictions on borrowing becoming ever tighter in the current fiscal climate. Like other regulated utilities, such as the national grid, Railtrack is expected to prove an attractive investment for the market. It should be a candidate for early privatisation. Passenger train operations will gradually be put out to tender, normally for five- or seven-year franchises. Profitable franchises will go to the highest bidder; unprofitable ones to the bidder requiring the lowest subsidy. Here, too, competitive bidding should provide an incentive to reduce costs and make the best use of Treasury subsidies. If there is a criticism to be made about these plans, it is that they are too timid. Rather than privatising BR, the government is contracting out the management of its operations, and for relatively short periods. Most operators will be reluctant to invest in new rolling stock, for example, since its working life is much longer than the planned franchises. The government has created three new leasing companies to own BR's rolling stock and invest in new equipment. But the quickest way to bring new capital investment in rolling stock would be franchises long enough for operators to write off their investment. Longer franchises On balance, however, the gradualist approach is to be welcomed. By phasing in franchising initially for shorter periods, experimentation can take place. Once teething troubles have been dealt with, there is nothing in the structure of BR privatisation to prevent longer franchises. What would not be welcome is the demand of opponents of rail privatisation - including some government backbenchers - to allow BR to compete for franchises. This could lead to BR winning many - if not most - of the franchises, cross-subsidising its bids to fend off competition. It would also deter management buy-outs, since managers would be understandably unwilling to compete with their own employer. If BR is allowed to bid, it will not be the end of privatisation - vigorous regulation could ensure that BR finds it hard to abuse its dominant market position. And the structure is sufficiently robust to allow further legislative change at a later stage when the fears of those who oppose privatisation can be shown to be illusory. But with management teams already planning their bids in the first round of franchises, it would be damaging if the only group of people discouraged from bidding were the managers who have the greatest experience in running the railways.

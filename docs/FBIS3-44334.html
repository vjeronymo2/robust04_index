The five measures are, first, prices of grain and vegetable  oil must be brought down as quickly as possible with state-owned  stores throughout the province being obliged to sell rice at a  fixed price before December 31.    Second, state-owned stores must become the main outlets  guaranteeing the supply of grain and take the lead in  controlling prices.    Third, the transportation of grain sold by the state must be  speeded up.    Fourth, grain purchasing must be well handled to increase  grain reserves.    Fifth, there must be strengthened supervision and management  of the marketing of grain and vegetable oil. Before December  31, all state-owned stores must see that there is sufficient  supply of grain in order to bring down prices and anyone found  raising prices to speculate will be seriously dealt with.</p>

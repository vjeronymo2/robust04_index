			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE WEEK OF DEC. 4.  </P> <P> Judge Rules Committee Can Be Replaced: A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled  Wednesday that the city of Los Angeles has the right to abolish a Hollywood  citizens advisory committee that had sought to continue its role after being  replaced by the Los Angeles City Council in May. Judge Kurt J. Lewin ruled that  the city was only required to consult with the Hollywood Project Area Committee  for three years under state redevelopment law. An attorney for the Hollywood  PAC said the group's members would continue to monitor redevelopment efforts in  their neighborhood. (Filed June 2, 1989, Case No. C726300)  </P></p>

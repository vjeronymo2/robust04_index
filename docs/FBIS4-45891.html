			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article "Ambulance Workers Strike"] </F>   [Text] Fourteen of the capitol's 47 ambulance substations  are out on strike, paralyzing emergency medical services and  leaving corpses lying in the streets.    In an interview with ITAR--TASS, Leon Akopov, chairman of  the  council that represents Moscow's emergency medical technicians,  stated that "the strike committee is not going to back down on  its demands". He was alluding to the Main Medical Authority's  plans to reorganize ambulance services and place them under a  different authority.    As before, ambulance service management and the Main Medical  Authority are not acknowledging the striker's demands and are  preparing to take disciplinary action.    According to a report issued by the council, four of the  striking sub-stations sent a letter today to the mayor of  Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, demanding that the reorganization process  be stopped and that the mayor personally assume supervision of  ambulance services.</p>

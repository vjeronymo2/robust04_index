			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Letter: Heathrow's comforts Sir, I would like to reassure Gideon Nellen (Letters, June 9) that BAA has no intention of increasing retailing at the expense of other passenger services. New retail areas are strategically and sensitively developed to ensure extra passenger space and seating are introduced at the same time. In the last year, Terminal 1's departure lounge at Heathrow has had 350 extra seats introduced in a 10,000 square feet extension, with only 2,000 square feet devoted to retailing. Although customer satisfaction has increased, we are now investing in a Pounds 65m project which will include a large extension to the Terminal 1 international departures area. We are enlarging the security check area, installing a further 550 seats, and creating an eating and shopping complex. Roger Cato, operations director, Heathrow Airport, D'Albiac House, Hounslow, Middlesex TW6 1JH</p>

This meeting is the  continuation of last year's meeting in Bangkok on exploring  joint shipping on the Meikong River. The meeting discussed the  four countries' draft agreement on joint shipping in the upper  reaches of the Meikong River and eight proposals for stepping up  development of international shipping on the two rivers.    Last night Governor He Zhiqiang and Vice Governor Niu  Shaoyao  met representatives of the four countries and invited them to a  banquet.    Governor He Zhiqiang said: Following international economic  development, particularly Southeast Asian economic development,  the four countries' governments have put on their agenda the  issue of navigation on the Lancang and Meikong rivers. These  countries have reached a consensus on jointly developing the two  rivers. Since the first meeting in Bangkok in May last year,  Yunnan has done a great deal of work and fulfilled the duties it  has undertaken. He Zhiqiang added: I am very happy that the  second meeting is held in Kunming, and I believe this meeting  will make a contribution to strengthening the four countries'  cooperation and promoting navigation on the Lancang and Meikong  rivers.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> STRIKE CRIPPLES BBC TV AND RADIO  </P> <P> British Broadcasting Corp. journalists and technicians began a 48-hour strike  today, severely disrupting radio and television programs.  </P> <P> Most live broadcasts were cancelled as senior journalists, talk show hosts and  disc jockeys joined picket lines to demand a 16% wage increase. The  state-funded corporation has refused to increase its offer of 7% despite the  fact that annual inflation has reached 7.9% and is expected to go higher.  </P> <P> The BBC's main television news bulletins continued, but in shortened form.  Anchormen said they would not take pay while colleagues were on strike but  worked because they thought it wrong to stop the news on a public service  channel.  </P></p>

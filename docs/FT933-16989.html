			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Growth seen in industry spending CONFIDENCE about growth prospects in manufacturing has edged up in the past month, a survey published today by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, has found, Peter Marsh writes. The survey of industry purchasing managers spending more than Pounds 250bn a year says companies are increasing their buying of goods and services in anticipation of a steady recovery. The purchasing managers' index, which shows sentiment in industry about an upturn, was calculated at 53.7 last month, up from 53.0 in May, signalling better growth prospects. The survey indicates continuing upward pressure on prices as domestic and export demand rises. The institute says, however that the trend to rising prices of imported goods has eased as pressures from last year's devaluation weaken.</p>

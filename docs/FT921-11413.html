			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Moynihan approves imports of gas BRITAIN opened its borders to gas trade with the rest of Europe yesterday by approving two import deals and announcing the study of a pipeline link to the Continent. Mr Colin Moynihan, junior energy minister, told the Commons: 'A market in which gas moves freely across frontiers and competes its way freely to final consumers provides the best assurance for all . . . of the continued development which will bring the environmental attractions of gas within reach of the widest public.' Mr Moynihan sanctioned an import deal agreed between National Power and Statoil, Norway's state-owned oil and gas company, to buy 2.2bn cu metres of gas a year. Separately, he said Statoil could import a supply of gas to provide power for one independent electricity generation project. The approval leaves Statoil free to contribute the gas - about 1bn cu metres of gas a year - to its agreed joint venture with BP and Norsk Hydro. The three companies plan to set up a company in the UK to sell gas to the industrial market. The financial details of the deal will be finalised in the next month but it is expected to involve Statoil and NH paying Pounds 10m to BP for a half share in BP's existing gas marketing business in the UK. Norwegian imports will go some way towards easing supply constraints in the UK market, particularly in gas for power generation. A gas shortfall forced up prices last year, making many proposed power stations uneconomic. Although the Department of Energy has reversed its position on gas imports since it vetoed British Gas's attempt to import Norwegian gas in 1985, Mr Moynihan said yesterday that the department would still require importers to submit individual deals for approval. The feasibility of building a gas interconnector pipeline between the UK and the Continent will be examined by six companies. Such a project is likely to cost between Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m. British Gas, British Petroleum, Conoco, Elf, Norsk Hydro and Statoil will complete a study late this year. The group will be chaired by Mr Geoffrey Chipperfield, chief executive of the Property Services Agency and former permanent secretary to the Department of Energy. The link is unlikely to be built unless the companies perceive demand for UK gas in Europe at attractive prices. Kinetica, one of the new independent gas companies, yesterday agreed a deal with National Power to transport gas to a new power station on Humberside. The company won the transit contract in competition with British Gas. It will provide a pipeline link between a Conoco gas terminal at Theddlethorpe in Lincolnshire and National Power's plant at Killingholme, Humberside.</p>

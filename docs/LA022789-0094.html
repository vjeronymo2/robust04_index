Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> MISTRIAL POSSIBLE IN NIGHT STALKER CASE OVER ATTORNEY'S EXHAUSTION  </P> <P> The attorney for Night Stalker defendant Richard Ramirez is suffering from  trial-related nervous exhaustion, the judge reported today, prompting the  prosecutor to warn of a possible mistrial.  </P> <P> "Probably the chances of a mistrial are good," Deputy District Atty. P. Philip  Halpin told reporters. "We can't keep this jury hanging around indefinitely."  </P> <P> A doctor's report submitted to the judge said that attorney Daniel Hernandez is  suffering from stress-related nervous exhaustion resulting from his  participation in the long-delayed trial. The doctor recommended psychological  counseling and said recovery could take six weeks.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan said he will hold hearings before he decides  on a remedy for the situation. He ordered Hernandez and his former co-counsel,  Arturo Hernandez, no relation, to be in court Wednesday for an inquiry on the  state of Hernandez's health and the trial's future.  </P></p>

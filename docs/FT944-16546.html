			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / World Trade News: C&amp;W breaches China's telecoms market China took the first significant step in opening its telecommunications industry to foreign companies yesterday when Cable and Wireless of the UK announced agreement in principle for a Dollars 300m investment to build networks. Lord Young, C&amp;W's chairman said Hongkong Telecom, in which it owns a majority stake, would work with Chinese partners to upgrade a cellular telephone network in Beijing. It would also construct a 3,000km optical fibre cable system to connect the city with Hong Kong. The deals, which Lord Young expects to be finalised in the new year, represent China's first concession to a foreign company to play a role in operating telecoms networks. Hongkong Telecom's partners will be China's Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and Beijing's telecommunications authority. The deals heightened interest in the Chinese market among other western telecoms operators, particularly US companies. One senior US executive said yesterday: 'If this is the breach in the wall, we want to be the next in, and fast.' Mr Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong, said the two ventures were a significant breakthrough in China's policy. 'The Chinese authorities realise that they need foreign capital and expertise if they are to develop the country's telecommunications network,' he said. 'It is clear that the Chinese are now prepared to provide equity-type returns on capital for investors.' Other analysts were unsure if Hongkong Telecom's proposed ventures would serve as a precedent for western operators or whether they reflected the company's special position in China. After Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, Hongkong Telecom will be a company incorporated on the Chinese mainland. China International Trust and Investment Corporation, the Chinese government's main investment arm, owns 17 per cent of Hongkong Telecom. Beijing has, until now, maintained a state monopoly in telecoms services, although the market has been open to western equipment suppliers. The opening of the services to joint ventures with foreign operators is driven by China's plans to modernise and expand its networks. Analysts believe a change in market conditions has made it more difficult for China to attract special credit facilities from equipment suppliers, necessitating a faster than expected introduction of foreign participation in building and operating networks. Investors, who bought Hongkong Telecom's stock in anticipation of an announcement, lifted the share price 5.5 per cent yesterday to HKDollars 16.30. Lex, Page 26; C&amp;W priorities, Page 30</p>

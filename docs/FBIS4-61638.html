			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Travkin by correspondent Sergey </F> Medvedev, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia; from the  "Novosti" newscast -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Medvedev] I would like to introduce you to a  new minister of the Russian Federation, you all know him well,  Nikolay Ilyich Travkin, appointed minister without portfolio  only yesterday by a presidential decree.    Nikolay Ilyich, this appointment is quite unusual, at least  it seems so to journalists: a member of the opposition, an  opponent being appointed a member of the government. What will  you be doing in the government without a portfolio?    [Travkin] First, a few words about opposition. We have two  types of opposition in society--the criticizing opposition,  which simply keeps barking and the working opposition. I had  nothing to do with the former. [passage omitted]    The government today has two tasks: to reform Russia's  economy, not just the oil and gas sector or agriculture.  Second, we must build the state, with all its institutions.  [passage omitted]    [Medvedev] Are we to understand that you will take a  decision  in the government, carry it out in your Shakhovskoy rayon, and  then, as leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, criticize it?    [Travkin] No, that is not how it will be.    [Medvedev] In effect, you will be a government  representative  in the Duma?    [Travkin] No. Why? I was a deputy and leader of a faction  in the Duma and remain such. I will represent the interests of  the local economy.    [Medvedev] A representative of the local economy at the top?    [Travkin] This is right. We cannot be apes and set up  everything in the rayons that has been set up at the level of  the federation. [passage omitted]</p>

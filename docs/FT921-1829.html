			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Silent Mudd - Ballot Box David Mudd, whose decision not to seek re-election as Tory MP for Falmouth and Camborne provoked little comment, could have left Westminster with more of a bang. He has revealed that he resigned the Conservative whip in February last year in protest against the government's refusal to help the Cornish tin industry. Mudd did not announce his decision to break away from the parliamentary party and sit as an independent Conservative at the time. A former journalist, Mudd says that he did not wish to rock the boat for Sebastian Coe, the Olympic gold medallist who had already been adopted as the prospective Conservative candidate for the constituency.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["No U.S. Pressure Can Work" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 5 (KCNA) -- We do not want  confrontation. But we do not have the intention to meet an  unjustifiable demand under continued pressure and cannot  tolerate our sovereignty encroached upon, declares NODONG SINMUN  today.    The analyst says:    The United States these days is orchestrating an anti-DPRK  pressure campaign over the core refueling operation at its  experimental atomic power plant, crying for "UN sanctions,"  "multinational sanctions" and "preemptive strike" at its  peaceful nuclear facilities.    This indicates that the United States is opting the strong  arm, throwing away even the veil of DPRK-U.S. talks.    In this connection we declared that our nuclear activities  will go over to the next process and we will have no alternative  but to expand our independent nuclear power industry by the  present method and that, in case the United States says the  foundation of its talks with the DPRK has been destroyed, the  foundation of the temporary suspension of the effectuation of  our declared withdrawal from the [Nuclear] Non-Proliferation  Treaty will also collapse.    When things take this course, neither the United States nor  the International Atomic Energy Agency can blame us. Because  such situation has been caused by them.    The United States is not interested in the solution of the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula but seeks only to stifle  our socialist system.    Our core refueling operation is taking place on condition  that the non-divergence of nuclear fuel to the military purpose  is firmly guaranteed and technical possibility is preserved for  an ad hoc inspection of the fuel rods when the unique status of  the DPRK is removed.    The campaign to stifle the DPRK over its core refueling  cannot be justified in any respect.    Since some quarters of the Secretariat of the agency  "concluded" that the possibility of later measurement of fuel  rods is lost, we do not intend to beg for measurement, if the  Secretariat refuses it.    The United States must stop acting rashly, pondering over  the  grave consequences to be entailed by its policy of stifling the  DPRK.    If "sanctions" are taken against us, not only the parties  participating in them but also those backing them will have to  bear responsibility.</p>

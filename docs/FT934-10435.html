			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Management: A bureaucratic legacy - A lesson for building societies Last week's collapse of plans to merge the Leeds Permanent and the National and Provincial contains management lessons for all UK building societies. The differences - ultimately irreconcilable - between the traditional, hierarchical Leeds and the apparently less bureaucratic National and Provincial - have already been well publicised. But the episode should be set against the background of a wider shift away from centralised society structures. Societies in the 1990s have been encouraged to flatten management hierarchies, decentralise decision-making and reduce the size of their head offices. The pressure for this has come from a more deregulated financial services environment in which societies see the need to improve their responsiveness to customers. Traditional bureaucracies are seen as ill-suited to the new world of multi-product financial institutions, a perception which can only grow as societies seek permission to sell an even wider range of services. In redesigning their management structures, societies have to strike the right balance between centralised direction from head office and delegated responsibility to divisions and branches. It is argued that shifting this balance in favour of flatter structures creates the conditions for new ways of doing things and meeting the customer's needs; but just how quickly the demise of traditional bureaucracy will occur within the sector is another matter. There are interesting paradoxes when the evidence is examined. While efforts have certainly been made to push management responsibility down to branch level, building societies unlike other businesses in the financial services sector have not rationalised their head offices. As the table shows, what has happened is an increase in head office and administrative staff within the larger societies. Ironically this is true of all top eight societies between 1989 and 1992 with the exception of the Leeds, whose head-office headcount was static over the period. Similarly, five of the top eight societies also show an increase in the numbers of branch staff, although five also recorded a decline in branch numbers during the period. One conclusion might well be that bureaucracy is on the increase within the sector. But the real answer is more complicated. While product diversification on the one hand requires a less bureaucratic approach by building societies, it creates its own momentum for increases in staff numbers at the same time. Some societies claim the creation of their new back-office administrative centres is intended to free branch staff to concentrate more on serving customers' needs. The overall rise in staff numbers can therefore be seen as part of a customer-focused equation. Alternatively, these figures may demonstrate there is something inherent in the traditional building society culture that makes staff reductions hard to pursue. Years of monopoly thinking, in a protected business environment, cannot change overnight. When the sector is tested against the organisational imperatives of the 1990s, one must conclude that many societies have a long way to go before they shake off their bureaucratic legacy.

			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAN JUAN HOUSING PLAN TO BE DISCUSSED  </P> <P> A proposal to build 141 houses on 30 acres of bamboo-covered property adjacent  to Trabuco Creek will be discussed at a special Planning Commission workshop at  7 p.m. Wednesday.  </P> <P> Nearby residents have opposed development in the area because it would destroy  part of the thick foliage around Trabuco Creek, which environmentalists say is  an important bird habitat.  </P> <P> The project, known as "Pepperwood Estates," calls for construction of  single-family homes, a departure from earlier plans that included an apartment  building near the north end of Alipaz Street. The developer is J.E. Butler  &amp; Associates of Santa Monica.  </P> <P> The meeting will be in Room 2 of the Lacouague Building at the Old Fire Station  Complex, 31421 La Matanza St.  </P></p>

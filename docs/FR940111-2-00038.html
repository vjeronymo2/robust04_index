			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Endangered Species Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In our August 25, 1993 letter to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), EPA initiated informal consultation under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) on EPA's proposal to authorize the DENR to administer the NPDES Program under section 402 of the Clean Water Act in South Dakota. The FWS responded to EPA on October 20, 1993. EPA responded to that letter with a letter on November 19, 1993 describing permitting and variance procedures and providing a biological assessment of the impact of program authorization on endangered and threatened species in South Dakota delineated in the FWS October 20th letter. The November 19th letter also stated that EPA believed that the delegation would have no effect on the listed species. Responding in its November 30, 1993 letter to the EPA, the FWS indicated that it could concur with our no adverse effect finding if EPA agreed to four conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA and DENR staff met with staff at the FWS South Dakota Field Office in Pierre to discuss the conditions. Based on that meeting, the EPA and DENR agreed to these conditions, as follows. FWS concurred on EPA's Finding of No Adverse Affect on December 15, 1993. The MOA between EPA and South Dakota on the administration of the South Dakota NPDES program addressed these conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. In each individual public notice or variance, the State shall make an initial determination of effect on all federally listed endangered and threatened species that may occur in the project area of influence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;This information will be provided to the Service as well as to the EPA with sufficient time to review and, if necessary, provide comments, as reflected in the Memorandum of Agreement signed between EPA and the State of South Dakota.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The State will communicate with the Service, on a periodic basis, on the permits that it will be issuing. The Service will work with the State to identify those permits for which there are species in the project area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. If it is determined by the State that the individual permit or variance to the permit provided to the Service may adversely affect any federally listed and/or proposed endangered and threatened species, the State will work with the Service to eliminate the adverse affect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. If the Service does not concur with the State's ``no affect'' determination, the State will work with the Service to eliminate the adverse effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. If any adverse effects cannot be eliminated, the permit application or variance will be held in abeyance and the EPA, with their oversight responsibilities, will require consultation with the Service, after EPA has completed the formal objection process and the permit has reverted to EPA for issuance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / World News in Brief: Queen dismisses talk of abdication The Queen dismisses speculation that she may abdicate in favour of the Prince of Wales, saying during a BBC television documentary to mark the 40th anniversary of her accession that hers is 'a job for life'. During the programme, to be transmitted this evening, she speaks about her role as monarch and her strong feeling for tradition, although she adds 'I do rather begrudge some of the hours that I have to do instead of being outdoors'.

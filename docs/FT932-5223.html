			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US threatens to escalate trade dispute over apples JAPAN faced increasing pressure yesterday to lift its 22-year-old ban on US apples as Senator Slade Gorton of Washington state, speaking at a news conference in Tokyo, warned that Japan's refusal to allow imports of the fruit was a potential violation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Japan's apple market was officially liberalised in 1971 but has remained closed through strict quarantine rules over pests and diseases. The Japanese maintain that the matter is purely technical but the US is now poised to treat it as a symbol of unfair trade practices by threatening to escalate the squabble into a political issue. Last month, Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, wrote to Japan's agriculture minister, warning that continuing the ban on US apples would 'exacerbate trade tensions' between the two countries. The US is demanding that the apple market be opened by next January, and wants Japanese inspectors to be dispatched to Washington to confirm fumigation treatments. The US frustration stems from years of trying to meeting Japanese requirements for controlling the codling moth pest and fireblight disease. The Japanese have recently raised concern over another pest, the lesser apple worm. Japan's recent agreement with New Zealand to import apples starting this month has also added to the tension. US trade negotiators point out that New Zealand was given priority treatment because its apple crop was a tenth the size of the US's and its growing season was the opposite of Japan's. In their turn, Japanese agricultural ministry officials have pointed out that citrus-producing states in the US have yet to accept imports of Japanese mandarin oranges. However, Mr Tom Hale, president of the Washington Apple Commission, which represents growers producing 60 per cent of the US apple crop, contended: 'It still means that 75 per cent of America's population can eat Japan's mandarins. We wouldn't complain if 75 per cent of the Japanese apple market was open to us'.</p>

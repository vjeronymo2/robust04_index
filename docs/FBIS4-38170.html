			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 28 Jun (MENA) -- Ambassador Muhammad Subayh,  Palestine's permanent envoy to the Arab League, stated that the  Israeli authorities banned him from entering the Palestinian  self-rule areas because he is the Palestine National Council  [PNC] secretary general.    In statements he made today, he said that the PLO asked that  110 PNC members be allowed to enter the self-rule areas but  Israel agreed to allow only 83 members and refused to let the  others enter these areas.    Commenting on the report issued by the Israeli commission  that investigated the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which laid  the blame fully on the Jewish settler, Subayh said: There is  nothing odd in having such a report that explains the massacre,  which claimed the lives of more than 70 worshipers last Ramadan,  as an individual act. He added that the Palestinian people is  used to such reports and positions on massacres perpetrated by  Israeli soldiers.    Muhammad Subayh went on to say: Israeli soldiers and police  should have been tried and the committee investigating the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque should have recommended the expulsion of  settlers from the Palestinian urban area and the disarmament of  Jewish settlers.    The Palestinian envoy stressed that security during the  transitional period in the Palestinian self-rule areas following  the agreements reached in Oslo and Cairo has become the  responsibility of the Palestinian police. He noted that the  Israeli Government is hesitant and not taking a firm stand  against the extremist elements in the Israeli army.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINAL PERU POLLS SHOW MARKED DECLINE IN FUJIMORI'S SUPPORT  </P> <P> National opinion polls released Friday showed independent Alberto Fujimori's  lead over novelist Mario Vargas Llosa narrowing so steadily that Sunday's  presidential election has become too close to call.  </P> <P> Two of three polls showed Fujimori ahead, while a third showed Vargas Llosa  overtaking his rival and ahead by a tiny margin in the two-man runoff ballot.  </P> <P> The final polls, which by law may not be disclosed in Peru, showed a dramatic  decline in Fujimori's support since the agronomist's stunning surge in the  first round April 8. But it remained unclear whether Vargas Llosa, leading a  right-of-center coalition, is consolidating his momentum.  </P> <P> The CPI polling firm, still compiling precise figures from its survey of 2,000  voters Wednesday, said Fujimori retained a lead of 5-6 percentage points, with  14% still undecided. CPI pollster Manuel Saavedra said Vargas Llosa's  Democratic Front had failed to press its campaign in the interior, where  Fujimori remains strong thanks to a major grass-roots campaign.  </P> <P> The Apoyo polling company, based on a survey of 4,200 voters in 28 provinces,  said Fujimori's edge had slipped to 41% to Vargas Llosa's 39%, from a nearly  20-point lead in the days after the first-round ballot. About 10% were  undecided and another 10% would cast blank ballots, said Apoyo's Alfredo  Torres.  </P> <P> The Datum firm, however, said Vargas Llosa had moved ahead of Fujimori by a  margin of 42.9% to 41.5%, a difference smaller than the margin of error of 2.6  points in the survey of 1,445 voters.  </P> <P> "We have a statistical tie," said Datum's Manuel Torrado. "We don't know who  will win."  </P> <P> The pollsters agreed that Vargas Llosa had taken the lead in Lima, home to a  third of the 9.9 million voters, and in the jungle areas, while Fujimori was  dominating the north, south and central mountain highland districts.  </P></p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: Heathrow Airport project JT DESIGN BUILD has been awarded an Pounds 8.8m contract to design and build a 300 metre long passenger pier and a 300 metre long link bridge at Terminal 4, Heathrow Airport. The structure will connect Terminal 4 with four aircraft stands. The contract also includes a departure lounge, a cafe, toilets, staff accommodation, plantrooms and stores. Both link and pier structures will be a combination of precast concrete and steel frames with precast concrete flooring. The building will be clad internally and externally with profiled steel sheeting with high levels of insulation to achieve both thermal and acoustic insulation. Internally, passenger conveyors will be provided at both arrivals and departures levels. The departures level has a barrel vaulted ceiling through its whole length with a continuous curved bulkhead concealing services. To be completed on a fast-track 48-week programme, the structures will be built alongside a number of passenger facilities that will remain operational.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Lower demand takes its toll on electricity groups Japan's electric power utilities were hit by a fall in demand for air conditioning due to the cold summer and the economic slump. Lower fuel costs, due to the stronger yen and a fall in crude oil prices, could not cover the decline in revenue from lower electricity demand, and eight of the nine electric power companies posted lower interim parent pre-tax profits for the half-year to September. In spite of strong opposition from the utilities, the government has ordered electricity and gas rates to be cut in order to pass on the benefits of the higher yen to consumers. As a result, the electric power companies will lower rates for an 11-month period starting this month, and face a drop in income for the full year. Tokyo Electric Power said total power consumption for the April-September period fell 0.7 per cent from a year earlier, depressing revenue from electricity sales. For the full year, the company expects a 14.8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y135bn, on a 0.2 per cent rise in sales to Y4,710bn. The company expects the rate cuts to reduce its income by Y36bn. Kansai Electric Power said sharp increases in repair-related spending and depreciation costs also squeezed profits. The company expects full year pre-tax profits to fall 19 per cent to Y100bn on a 0.1 per cent rise in sales to Y2,370bn. Chubu Electric Power said its decline in pre-tax profit was due to a heavier interest burden from increased capital investments. For the full year to March, the company expects a 26 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y75bn on a 0.6 per cent fall in sales to Y1,950bn. Kyushu Electric Power saw profits fall for the first time in three years due to typhoons and heavy rains. The company, which spent Y28.4bn on repairs, sees an 8 per cent fall in full year pre-tax profits to Y76bn on a 1.4 per cent rise in sales to Y1,280bn.  ---------------------------------------------------- INTERIM RESULTS 1993-94  ----------------------------------------------------              Sales    Change    Pre-tax    Change              (Ybn)      (%)      profit       (%)  ---------------------------------------------------- Tokyo     2,347.1     -0.1         58.5    -12.0 Kansai    1,205.7     +0.1         49.1     -3.7 Chubu       985.4      0.0         38.6    -15.4 Kyushu      651.9     +1.5         28.1     -6.7 Tohoku      651.2     +2.7         29.8     -0.6 Chugoku     487.4     -0.6         21.3     -4.1 Hokkaido    265.6     +5.6         26.7    +58.1 Shikoku     234.3     +1.3         19.8     -4.2 Hokuriku    225.2     +0.8          9.8    -27.7  ---------------------------------------------------- Source: Company results  ----------------------------------------------------</p>

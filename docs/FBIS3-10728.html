			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carmen Castro at the Foreign Ministry] </F>   [Text] Chilean Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma today  fully justified the Chilean vote condemning human rights  violations in Cuba. The Chilean Government adopted two  positions, probably in an attempt to seek a fair position on the  Cuban situation when this issue was raised again at the annual  session of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva. A  resolution condemning human rights violations in Cuba was issued  during this session. This initiative was approved by 24 votes to  nine, while 20 abstained from voting.    The UN commission pointed out the need to observe freedom of  the press and association in Cuba. The U.S.-sponsored resolution  was supported by the Chilean Government, which stated, however,  that the economic blockade of Cuba should not have been allowed.  In this regard, Silva Cimma said:    [Begin recording] [Silva Cimma] You should not only report  that Chile voted against human rights violations in Cuba, but  that Chile backed the Cuban request to condemn the unilateral  support for the blockade.    [Unidentified reporter] This means that Chile has adopted  different positions on the economic blockade of Cuba and on the  human rights situation.    [Silva Cimma] Merely because... No, not about the human  rights situation, but human rights violations. We believe that  unilateral blockades are very harmful, and that human rights  must be protected worldwide    [Reporter] Minister, does Chile concur with the special  rapporteur's report on systematic human rights violations in  Cuba?    [Silva Cimma] It would be an open lack of respect to  question  a report by a human rights rapporteur. For many years we have  demanded respect and positive votes for the rapporteur's reports  on human rights in Chile. We continue supporting this position.  [end recording]    Silva Cimma said Chile is concerned about any human rights  violations in Cuba. He specifically mentioned the right to life  and to freedom for people. He said the substantial progress that  has been made in Cuba in the social and health areas were  admitted especially in Geneva, and that consequently it was not  appropriate for the Rio Group to support the blockade of Cuba in  that forum.</p>

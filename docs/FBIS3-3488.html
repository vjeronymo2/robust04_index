			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary" by XINHUA reporters Min Fanlu (7036 0416 </F> 6424), Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524), and Ma Kuijun (7456 7608  0689): "The Overall Situation That Pulls People's Hearts  Together -- Commentary Written Before the Closing of the Second  Session of the Eighth National People's Congress"]    [Text] Beijing, 21 March (XINHUA) -- This is a grand  meeting of significant importance since China entered this year,  a crucial year for reform, as well as a grand meeting that  gathers talents from all quarters to set a general policy for  revitalizing the nation. It shows Chinese and foreigners, who  are concerned about the future and destiny of China's reform and  development, that the 56 nationalities around China have  unprecedentedly gathered under the banner of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics in one mind. The overall situation  of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider,  promoting development, and maintaining stability" in the  [party's] work has become the will of the state and the people.  <H5>  A Common Ground Formed at the `Two Sessions' </H5>   This year's "two sessions" were convened at the crucial  moment when we were implementing the guidelines of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress and  accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic  structure. During this unusual half month, over 5,000 deputies  and members have formed a common ground on the 20-character  overall situation for the work of the party and the state.    The common ground was first of all demonstrated in their  understanding of the magnificent cause of reform. Reviewing the  unprecedented achievements in China's history, which were  accomplished in the course of great practice, deputies and  members further realized: It was the great fortune yielded by  the productive forces liberated through reform that made China's  national economy grow at an average annual rate of 9 percent in  the 15 years of reform and opening up, far higher than the  average growth rate during the 26 years from 1953 to 1978, thus  people's lives were remarkably improved with visible and  tangible benefits. Reform should also be regarded as the  tremendous driving force for future development, and reform  measures should be used to promote transfer of the old system to  the new one. Henan Deputy Li Changchun said: The new idea for  development is to seek development through reform. Development  will become empty talk, if we fail to promote the establishment  of a socialist market economic structure by developing the five  links as a whole through reform and if we did not resolve the  difficulties in the microeconomic foundation and macroeconomic  system for the market economy with reform.    The common ground is distinctively illustrated in the  essential criterion of development. Without development, there  would be no better life for the people, political stability, and  China's position in the world. Liaoning Deputy Quan Shuren  maintained: We are really facing a highly favorable opportunity  for development. If we take a giant step in development, our  overall economic and social levels will be greatly promoted.  Deputies and members agreed with such a view of development:  We can by no means merely pursue output value and speed in  economic development and develop a "bubble economy." A  high-efficiency development should be the important thing. Our  development should not only be rapid, but also stable; it should  not only be healthy, but also sustained. Development should  proceed in a down-to-earth and step-by-step manner.    The common ground is also expressed in stability. Without  political stability and unity, without the state's long-term  peace and stability, we could achieve nothing. This point was  hotly discussed at the "two sessions." Guangxi Deputy Zhao  Fulin's remarks have struck a sympathetic chord: Many important  reform measures launched this year have touched on the  transformation in some ideas and concepts, renovation of  systems, and interest readjustment. We should simultaneously  adopt economic and administrative means and conduct ideological  and political work to properly handle new contradictions and  problems arising from the interest readjustment in the course of  reform and eliminate unstable factors. We should take the  overall situation of stability into consideration and  consciously subject local, partial, current, and microinterests  to central, overall, long-term, and macrointerests.    Only when we have this common ground can we unify our action  and have a foundation for forging ahead in unity.  <H5>  It Takes Team Spirit To Overcome Difficulties </H5>   Today, reform has begun to increase in depth; we have  shifted  from advancing in particular areas to taking well-organized and  comprehensive reform measures, and have shifted from setting our  eyes on gaining benefits brought by conflicting reform measures  to setting our eyes on forming new economic relationships in all  sectors. Various contradictions are interwoven in the process  of these changes, and all kinds of advantages and disadvantages  have begun to surface. Therefore, to carry out reform in depth,  we must fight an arduous battle to overcome major difficulties.  Deputies attending the current NPC session and members of the  Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC] attending the current CPPCC  National Committee session have been deeply concerned about the  difficulties and critical issues affecting reform.    We should face up to difficulties, gain a good understanding  of the situation, and fully make ourselves ideologically  prepared. As Shandong deputy Zhao Zhihao said: The depth,  scope, and intensity of reform are unprecedented, all kinds of  interrelated reform measures have been initiated one after  another, and we will deepen reforms and make breakthroughs in  various areas. We should be ideologically prepared for the  difficulties that may come up in carrying out this complicated  and arduous systems project. We must insist on taking a  scientific approach, doing work cautiously, and preventing major  missteps.    It takes team spirit to overcome difficulties. The NPC  deputies are 100 percent in favor of what Comrade Jiang Zemin  pointed out: "Whether it is the revolutionary war in the past or  the current reform, opening up, and modernization drive, we can  succeed only if we closely rely on the vast numbers of cadres  and the masses, fully rally the enthusiasm of people in all  sectors, and pool our wisdom and efforts."    The NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members  offered  from various perspectives their ideas on uniting efforts of the  whole country to overcome difficulties:    -- We should work with one heart and one mind, help each  other, give primary consideration to the overall situation, and  abide by discipline. Since we are on the country's big boat of  reform, we should obey the commanding voice and follow the  drumbeats, as rowers of a boat do, and go forward braving the  wind and waves.    -- We should respect the masses' creative spirit in making  reforms; sum up in a timely manner the experience of practice  accumulated by the masses; and properly guide, protect, and make  use of the masses' enthusiasm. We should show concern for the  masses' hardships, listen to the masses, and help them solve  their problems to enable the work to overcome difficult reform  problems to be established on a broad and solid base of the  masses.    -- We should resolvedly eradicate the practice of taking  countermeasures to deal with the policies adopted by authorities  at a higher level. Even Tai Mountain can be moved if we work  with one heart and one mind. No matter how good the principle  and policies are, they cannot be effective if we do not have a  unified will and action.    -- We should iron out all kinds of contradictions in a  timely manner, give play to all positive factors, concentrate  the efforts of all sectors on the great cause of reform, and do  our best to reduce frictions and shocks resulting from  readjusting the interests of various sectors. In fighting the  war of overcoming difficult reform problems, we should not be  too hasty nor should we miss the opportunity to win.    -- We should not be conceited when we achieve something  and we should not complain when we suffer setbacks. We should  be of one mind and be prudent in beginning the war; we should be  determined to win a total victory ...    These voices from the NPC deputies and CPPCC National  Committee members are loud and eloquent and concern the nation's  overall situation. Our reform is hopeful! Our country is  hopeful!  <H5>  Being Realistic Is the Key to Making Reform Successful </H5>   The NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members are of  the opinion that the two current sessions are democratic  meetings, meetings of seeking truth, meetings of solidarity, and  meetings with a motivational atmosphere. After the two sessions  end, the NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members, who  are shouldering sacred missions, will join people working on all  fronts across the country in carrying out the guidelines of the  two sessions. The most realistic problem lying ahead of us is  how to faithfully carry out these guidelines.    At a time when the NPC session is about to close, deputies  to  the session have stressed that we no longer should engage in  empty talk and hesitate and lack resolve, and must take action.  Guangxi deputy Cheng Kejie said: Currently the party Central  Committee and the State Council are devising the strategies, are  in command of the overall situation, and are guiding the ship.  The policy of reform is clearly defined and is in line with the  reality, and the established policies and guidelines have  enjoyed popular support; so, the only thing we need to do is to  work in a down-to-earth manner. If every unit and locality  takes action in all areas of endeavor, our reform will be  substantiated and full of vigor.    By reviewing the stormy process of reform and opening up  over  the last 15 years, people can see that our reform has yielded  solid results. So long as we sweat and toil, we will reap a  good harvest. Some deputies cited these examples: During the  early years of reform, the contract responsibility system with  output linked to remuneration brought great prosperity to the  rural areas; enterprise reform in the 1980's increased  enterprises' vitality to varying degrees; since the beginning of  1990's, we have quickened the pace of reforming the system of  budgeting resources, enabling the market to become  unprecedentedly brisk, and setting a good beginning to  establishing a socialist market economic system. We should do  things step by step; the difficulties of reform and development  should be overcome one by one. We should stick to it, firm up  our will, keep going, knowing that there are difficulties ahead,  and be determined to win.    After analyzing the general situation of reform in the new  year, the NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members  pointed out that, among the various reform programs, we should  concentrate our efforts on dealing with two difficult tasks:  First, while working to transform the operating mechanisms of  state-owned enterprises, we should make positive efforts to  establish new enterprise systems and seek effective ways to  develop a modern enterprise system. Second, we should quicken  the pace of reforming the financial, taxation, planning, and  investment systems, and take an important step forward in  establishing a macroeconomic regulation and control system that  meets market economic requirements. These are both difficult  tasks and an opportunity. If we can overcome the various  difficulties, we will see a new horizon.    The current situation reflects people's wishes and pulls  people's hearts together. This is a year of great hope for  China's construction and development, and definitely will be one  in which we reap a bumper harvest of reform. This is a message  of spring brought to people across the country by the Second  Session of the Eighth NPC and the Second Session of the Eighth  CPPCC National Committee.</p>

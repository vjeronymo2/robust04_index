			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Company probed on Iraq exports CUSTOMS and Excise officers have visited the premises of a company in Wales in connection with allegations of suspected unlicensed exports to Iraq, Jimmy Burns and Roland Adburgham write. The move represents the first action by a British law enforcement agency since the government two weeks ago confirmed it was revoking all export licences to Iraq. It emerged yesterday that customs officers on Monday entered premises linked to the company, which cannot be named for legal reasons. They seized documents as part of an international investigation into the alleged use of fraudulent United Nations and Department of Trade and Industry documents. The investigation concerns false statements of export volumes on goods classified as humanitarian aid, which may have resulted in some companies breaching UN trade restrictions and British export regulations.</p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Rift over Soviet fleet deepens RUSSIA has stepped up its battle with Ukraine over control of the Black Sea fleet, with a warning that any unilateral takeover of Soviet armed forces could kill the fledgling Commonwealth of Independent States. A group of 15 prominent Russian deputies warned at the weekend that Ukrainian plans to make Soviet military personnel swear allegiance to the Ukrainian state and to raise the Ukrainian flag over the Black Sea fleet violated agreements establishing the commonwealth. Ukraine's introduction on Friday of the oath of allegiance confronted many officers in Ukraine with a harsh choice: to take the oath, or leave the republic, giving up housing and better food supplies than are available elsewhere. Interfax news agency reported that a helicopter regiment stationed in the Ukrainian town of Alexandria had already refused to take the oath until there was an agreement defining the total strength of Ukrainian armed forces. Russia and Ukraine form the backbone of the commonwealth and their falling-out would spell the end of the fledgling organisation. The 11 member states agreed at their meeting in Minsk a week ago to submit all strategic forces to a unified command. But while Russia says the fleet, which has 300 ships, counts as strategic, Ukraine says it does not. In an indication of how deeply Russian feelings run, both vice-president Alexander Rutskoi, an air force general who wants strong rule, and Mr Vladimir Lukin, the liberal who chairs the Russian parliament's foreign affairs committee, backed an appeal to the Ukrainian parliament to clarify the situation. Mr Yevgeny Ambartsumov, deputy head of the foreign affairs committee, warned yesterday: 'This is playing with fire . . . it could also become a weapon in the hands of conservatives.' He said Russia might have to use force if the two sides failed to agree. But he added that a solution was still possible, saying the issue was best tackled at the highest level, by President Boris Yeltsin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Mr Leonid Kravchuk. In Kiev Mr Vasily Durdinets, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament defence committee, said more negotiations were needed because of differences over the size of the fleet to be transferred to Ukraine.

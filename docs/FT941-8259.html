			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / A Prussian in the White House: America Bill Clinton faces a vexing decision. Should he and his general staff (the White House National Economic Council) wear army fatigues? Or would it make more sense to wear tracksuits emblazoned 'Team USA'? Frankly, I don't think it matters a great deal. For trade wars with Japan, I would recommend army uniforms with lashings of gold braid. I would give Robert Rubin, the NEC director, a military rank and award campaign medals to staff who devise particularly ingenious trade sanctions. I would reserve the Team USA tracksuits for more routine tasks, such as presidential lobbying on behalf of corporate America. Last week, Mr Clinton described the Dollars 6bn aircraft deal with Saudi Arabia as a 'gold medal win for America's businesses and workers'. He was too modest. Having bombarded King Fahd with letters and phone calls - and having sent secretary of state Warren Christopher to Riyadh to plead for business - Mr Clinton deserves the medal himself. The US is in its third year of a robust economic recovery. Business investment and productivity are soaring. The US share of foreign markets is up sharply. The budget and trade deficits are much reduced. Unemployment has fallen sharply, to well below 7 per cent. Europe and Japan, by contrast, are floundering in recession. In the circumstances, you might expect the White House to feel relaxed, even magnanimous. Instead, Mr Clinton and his senior advisers are behaving like economic delinquents. In December, Mr Clinton hailed the merits of the Uruguay Round, which promises to deregulate agriculture and financial services, sectors in which the US is highly competitive. As a 'new democrat' he was all for multilateral trade liberalisation under the Gatt. Yet a mere two months later, he solemnly chastises Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's reform-minded prime minister, for refusing to accept numerical targets for import growth in selected industrial sectors. Such targets - essentially a government commitment to reserve a portion of Japan's home market for US and foreign companies - are the very antithesis of the Gatt principles that Mr Clinton was promoting so hard last year. Perhaps Mr Clinton is genuinely incapable of understanding the contradiction. If so, it is lamentable that economically literate senior aides - including Larry Summers at the Treasury - are so eager to play this charade. US officials, of course, sometimes claim they are not demanding numerical targets. All they want are quantitative benchmarks to judge progress in opening Japanese markets. This is spurious talk of medal-winning dimensions. It is not as though Japanese trade figures are a state secret: quantitative measures of progress in opening specific markets have always been readily available. In any case, as a member of a multilateral system, the US simply has no right to act as judge and jury on Japanese trade practices. To put US behaviour in perspective, suppose France analysed US wine consumption and found an unfair bias in favour of inferior Californian brands. Would Mr Clinton be happy if President Mitterrand unilaterally set a numerical target for increased US imports of French Burgundy? Of course not: he would instantly condemn such bully-boy tactics. The obsession with the Japanese bilateral imbalance is even more fatuous. White House talk of impenetrable barriers creates the false impression that Japan buys virtually nothing from the US. In reality, US exports to Japan were Dollars 48bn last year, making it America's second most important market. The bilateral deficit with Japan is declining relative to US national income. But even if it were rising, it would signify nothing. Surely Mr Clinton's high-powered economic advisers have not forgotten the very first lesson of economics: that trade is beneficial because it facilitates specialisation and division of labour. The last thing we should expect or want is balanced trade between every pair of countries. The almost gloating way in which Mr Clinton (with Mr Christopher dutifully in attendance) announced his trade deal with King Fahd is particularly disturbing. Nobody can deny that political leaders in other countries have sought economic favours. But in past years, transgressions by smaller countries were comparatively unimportant because US commitment to market principles guaranteed the survival of a liberal global trading order. When the boundaries between government and business begin to blur in the world's biggest economy, the outlook is indeed grim. European and Japanese leaders are certain to respond by redoubling their efforts on behalf of their national champions. For 200 years two quite distinct capitalist philosophies have vied for supremacy. The first is the English concept (not always respected by British governments) of genuinely liberal competition in which governments keep off the pitch and companies compete solely on the basis on commercial merit. The second is the corporatist state - first perfected by 19th century Prussia - in which government acts as sponsor of domestic business in an 'economic war' against other nations. Sadly, Mr Clinton seems to be leaning in the Prussian direction. No true market liberal would brag about winning contracts for businessmen, or set unilateral targets for another nation's imports, or pour taxpayers' funds into a domestic industrial policy. Yet Mr Clinton is doing all of this - and with relish. He believes the US is in a race with Japan and the European Union for economic supremacy in the 21st century, and he intends to take the gold. We are again seeing the ugly face of economic nationalism.</p>

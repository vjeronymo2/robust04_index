			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- Japan will take  "aggressive" action to stem the yen's rise in cooperation with  the Group of Seven (G-7) nations, Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii told reporters Monday [27 June].    Fujii described the dollar's fall in Tokyo below 100 yen as  "speculative" and said, "rapid movements are undesirable and  this is a consensus among G-7 nations."    Fujii said G-7 partners are communicating on whether to take  joint measures as they did last Friday, when the dollar fell  below 100 yen in New York.    As for Japan, Fujii said, "we will tenaciously take utmost  efforts" to defend the dollar against the yen.    Market sources said the bank of Japan bought billions of  dollars when the Tokyo market opened Monday, after watching the  dollar plunge below 100 yen in earlier trading in Sydney.    Asked if Japan's political turmoil contributed to the yen's  rise, Fujii just repeated the movements are "speculative."    Fujii declined to comment on possible joint G-7 actions on  credit policies, saying, "monetary measures are for the central  bank to decide."    When the dollar tumbled in may on a broad front and nearly  sank below 100 yen, G-7 nations intervened in currency markets  and also took action on credit policies.    The United States raised its key rates, Germany cut its key  rates, other European nations followed suit and Japan maintained  a loose stance on the money market.    Higher U.S. rates and lower rates in other nations will help  the dollar become stronger as dollar assets will become  favorable.</p>

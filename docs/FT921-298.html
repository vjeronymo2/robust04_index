			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Slovenia (9): Harsh realities after euphoria - Judy Dempsey on the political background MOST government coalitions have a honeymoon period. But sooner or later, they file for divorce. Slovenia is no exception. Across the post-communist world of eastern Europe, the young, democratically-elected governments, of which several are coalitions, are struggling to create strong and stable democratic institutions. Most of them have written new constitutions aimed at breaking completely with the communist period. All have had free parliamentary elections. Again, Slovenia is no exception. But this small republic of 2m people is unique among the former communist countries. The six-party Demos coalition which was elected in April 1990, and which is headed by the Christian Democratic Party under Mr Lozje Peterle, prime minister, had to fight for its independence when the Yugoslav federal army attacked Slovenia after it declared its independence on June 25, 1991. Throughout the war, Slovenia was effectively ruled by a triumvirate of ministers consisting of Mr Janez Jansa, defence minister, Mr Igor Bavcar, interior minister, and Mr Jelko Kacin, information minister. None of them belong to the Christian Democratic Party, the dominant party ion the six-party coalition government. At the helm was Mr Milan Kucan, president of Slovenia, who, as a reform-minded leader of the republic's communist party in the mid-1980s, moved Slovenia towards political pluralism and independence. After the European Community-brokered Brioni accord in July 1991, in which the Yugoslav army agreed to withdraw from Slovenia and Slovenia imposed a three-month moratorium on the implementation of its independence, the ruling Demos coalition started fraying at the edges. The euphoria of defeating the Yugoslav army gave way to the harsh realities of trying to set up institutions for independence and the market economy. Introduction of new laws on privatisation, foreign investment and the restructuring of the banking system has proved difficult. They have also led to bitter divisions within the government, for which there are three reasons. First, the government consists of 27 ministries in which there is little or no co-ordination. No one questions the need to reduce the government by half. Nor does anyone doubt the jostling for posts among the coalition partners in any new government. Second, the government has inherited the former communist 'parliamentary' system common to the other republics of the former Yugoslavia. This system is composed of three 80-member chambers: the Chamber of Associated Labour, the Chamber of Communes, and the Socio-Political Chamber. Together these three chambers make up the 240-strong Assembly (or parliament). The Demos coalition holds 55 per cent of the assembly seats, but it has not got a majority in the Chamber of Associated Labour. As a result, pushing draft legislation through the three chambers is politically difficult, as well as time-consuming. For the sake of consensus, bills are often watered down, or else rejected. Moreover, most acts require a two-thirds majority vote from among all three chambers. The government's property and ownership laws, which required a simple majority vote, were faced with 240 amendments from the chambers. All those amendments had to be voted upon in each of the three chambers. On a more optimistic note, the next election should produce a more efficient parliament because the constitution has replaced this cumbersome, bureaucratic system with a smaller bicameral system. Finally, government legislation has been delayed, indeed paralysed, because of internal rivalries and the break-up of the Demos coalition. This occurred in February after a group of independent deputies attempted to make the government leaner and more efficient by calling for a vote of no confidence against the incumbent government. The attempt to unseat Mr Peterle was led by Mr Marko Voljc, who has worked with the World Bank since the 1970s. Mr Peterle, a Roman Catholic who is more interested in opening churches than visiting factories and who has little interest in economic affairs, has lost several ministers because of disagreements over economic policy. The attempt to toppled the government failed. But in the process, the government is now polarised between the conservative Christian Democrats and the Peoples (former Farmers') Party on the one side, and on the other, by the liberals, who are grouped around the Democratic Party, led by Mr Bavcar, and the Liberal Democratic Party. Economists and bankers in Slovenia say that the disagreements and endless quarreling in the government could be resolved by calling fresh elections, which would give the next government a clear mandate for reforms. But no elections can be held until the assembly has agreed an electoral law. On that point, no party can agree on whether it should be proportional representation, first past the post, or a mixture of both systems. 'I would like elections as quickly as possible,' says Mr Kucan. He will run again for president, but is expected to face stiff opposition from Mr Janez Drnovsek, the former Yugoslav federal president. Unless a spectacular wind of goodwill, reason, and consensus prevails over the next few weeks, elections will not be held until the autumn. 'The longer we delay, the more time we will lose in introducing reforms,' added Mr Kucan.</p>

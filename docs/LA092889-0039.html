			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HORSE RACING;  </P> <P> FORMER OWNER SAYS SHE STILL HAS EMOTIONAL TIES TO SECRETARIAT  </P> <P> When Penny Chenery saw Secretariat at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Ky., last  spring, the woman who raced him to the Triple Crown title in 1973 came away  with the impression that he was carrying too much weight.  </P> <P> A couple of weeks ago, Secretariat was diagnosed as having laminitis, a serious  hoof inflammation that causes circulatory problems.  </P> <P> Chenery doesn't have a breeding interest in Secretariat anymore, but she was  associated with the horse for 17 of his 19 years. So, naturally she was happy  to learn that he has recovered.  </P> <P> "Anything like that could be life-threatening, but he's stable now," said  Walter Kaufman, the veterinarian who is treating Secretariat. "He's still on  medication, but he now has about 95% of his normal gait back."  </P> <P> Secretariat was syndicated for breeding after he won the Triple Crown, and  Chenery, after years of getting ordinary horses from mares she sent to the  stallion, sold her lifetime share a couple of years ago.  </P> <P> "I miss the part about breeding to him every year," she said. "It was a  financial move. The business has gotten so expensive."  </P> <P> Long before Secretariat's recent problem, Chenery felt that she made one  mistake in sending him to stud.  </P> <P> "If there was anything I would like to do over, it would have been to insist  that he be exercised regularly with a rider on his back," Chenery said. "But  when we syndicated him, I was new in that phase of the business, and so was  Seth Hancock (who has managed Claiborne since his father, Bull, died).  </P> <P> "Seth just told me that Claiborne never exercised any of it stallions because  his daddy didn't believe in doing it. I found out later that when Seattle Slew  was syndicated, it was a condition of the contract that he be ridden on a  regular basis."  </P> <P> Kaufman doesn't believe that exercising Secretariat would have prevented him  from developing laminitis. Kaufman said that Seattle Slew has been exercised  since his early stud days because in the beginning he had difficulty getting  mares in foal.  </P> <P> "When Sir Gaylord (who was out of Somethingroyal, the same dam as  Secretariat's), first went to stud, he got fat and infertile," Chenery said.  "He was sent to Alec Head, who gave him lots of exercise, and he became one of  the best sires in England."  </P> <P> The last connection for Chenery with Secretariat is Sacred Dance, a 3-year-old  daughter of the 1973 horse of the year who is at a Pennsylvania farm. Sacred  Dance, who is out of Dance With Squall, a minor stake winner, suffered from a  salmonella infection and has never raced.  </P> <P> "She's gray, but she has Secretariat's head," Chenery said. "She may not race  until she's a 5-year-old, but I'll never give her up. For sentimental reasons,  I'm going to keep her the rest of her life."  </P> <P> Present Value was assigned high weight of 123 pounds, one more than Speedratic  and three more than He's a Saros, for the Pomona Handicap. He's a Saros, beaten  earlier at the meet by Conquering Hero, another nominee for Sunday's stake, has  won the handicap two consecutive years. Conquering Hero, assigned 118 pounds  for Sunday, was second in last year's handicap.  </P> <P> First Magical Mile, who could have been California's fastest 2-year-old, was  sent to the sidelines. Then Red Ransom, an undefeated New York 2-year-old,  suffered a leg injury that ended his season.  </P> <P> Summer Squall, winner of the Hopeful at Saratoga, is still in training, but  plans to run him Sunday in the Arlington-Washington Futurity have been scuttled  because of a bruised foot.  </P> <P> After the Arlington race, Summer Squall was scheduled to run in the Champagne  at Belmont Park and then the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Gulfstream Park. But  instead of the Champagne he may run in the Breeders' Futurity Oct. 13 at  Keeneland, where he's currently stabled. The Keeneland race is 1 1/16 miles  around two turns, which might better prepare Summer Squall for the Nov. 4  Breeders' Cup race at the same distance.  </P> <P> Jockey Chris Antley is in limbo in New York because of recurrent  substance-abuse problems, and owner Dan Lasater has been reinstated by  Louisiana racing officials after a prison stretch.  </P> <P> Antley, one of New York's leading riders, surrendered his license to  authorities, admitting that he has drug problems again. Antley, sidelined a  month because of a knee injury, was scheduled to return last weekend, but  didn't ride and was also abandoned by his agent. Antley says he will continue  drug rehabilitation and his program will be monitored by state racing  authorities before they consider giving him another license.  </P> <P> Lasater, whose stable won 494 races in 1974, which is still a record, won three  Eclipse Awards as the country's top owner before he was arrested on charges of  distributing cocaine. He spent 11 months in prison. The commission voted to  reinstate him, 4-3.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> More surprising than Bayakoa's victory over Open Mind in last Sunday's Ruffian  Handicap was that Belmont Park fans made the winner the favorite, even though  Open Mind went into the stake with a 10-race winning streak. There was also no  advantage for Bayakoa in the weights. Despite a last-place finish at Del Mar in  her last start, Bayakoa carried five more pounds than Open Mind, who got a  break in the weights because she is a younger horse. In 14 starts before the  Ruffian, Open Mind was favored in all except the first three races of her  career. Open Mind wound up third in the Ruffian, the first time she has been  worse than second.  </P> <P> According to the linemaker at the Sands in Las Vegas, Bayakoa is the 2-1  favorite and Open Mind is 3-1 for the Breeders' Cup Distaff. After his victory  in the Super Derby, Sunday Silence went to 8-5, behind Easy Goer at 6-5, in the  Breeders' Cup Classic. Other Breeders' Cup favorites are Summer Squall, 3-1 in  the Juvenile; Stella Madrid and Rue de Palm, both 3-1 in the Juvenile Fillies;  On the Line, 2-1 in the Sprint; Polish Precedent, 2-1 in the Mile; and  Cacoethes, 2-1 in the Turf.  </P> <P> Golden Pheasant, the horse that handed Nashwan his first loss by winning a  stake at Longchamps, is owned by Kings' owner Bruce McNall.  </P> <P> Endow, who won his first stake at Fairplex, is scheduled to run there Saturday  in the Pomona Derby. . . . On Saturday night at Los Alamitos, Flomont, Mighty  Easy Pass and Ourautograph are the leading contenders in the $500,000 Dash for  Cash Futurity for quarter horses.  </P> <P> When Pat Day rode eight winners at Arlington recently, widely forgotten was the  fact that Hubert Jones was the first jockey to have an eight-victory day.  Jones, now a local steward, won eight at Caliente in 1944.  </P> <P> Gene Klein has told Keeneland officials that there will be no reserve prices on  the 120 horses to be auctioned at his dispersal sale there on Nov. 6. This  means that the horses will be sold without having to meet minimum prices that  are frequently established privately before a sale.  </P></p>

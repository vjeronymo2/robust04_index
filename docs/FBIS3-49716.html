			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Gyorgy Csoti, deputy chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, and member of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, held a  press briefing this morning. Judit Laszlo reports:    [Laszlo] The Brussels summit and the Partnership for Peace  is  an important milestone in the process that was proclaimed by the  government led by Jozsef Antall in 1990. The point of this was  to do away with eastern ties and to approach western  integration, Gyorgy Csoti said.    The decision on the Partnership for Peace is important from  the point of view of the region's security. The Bundestag  Foreign Affairs Committee is of a similar opinion. It was this  committee that recently invited a Hungarian Foreign Affairs  Committee delegation to visit Germany. Returning form there,  Gyorgy Csoti said the central and eastern European countries, or  rather everybody, even Kazakhstan, has to offer a kind of  partnership to the western integration organizations, for  example, NATO, which, on the one hand is directed toward  membership, and on the other toward cooperation. The latter is  all the more important, for it is not possible for everybody to  become a NATO member, and not everybody wants to. Gyorgy Csoti  here mentioned Russia, which is extended on two continents and  is a match for the Western European region.    Csoti also said that German politicians, contrary to rumors,  particularly supported the integration endeavors of Hungary and  the Visegrad Group countries. Also discussed at the talks in  Germany was Hungary soon receiving a status similar to associate  membership in the West European Union, Csoti said.</p>

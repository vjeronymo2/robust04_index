			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Letter: Gas industry conflicts in prospect Sir, The five-month gestation period of British Gas's agreement to comply with the Office of Fair Trading report has illustrated the complexity of the UK gas industry. It has also demonstrated the conflict between shareholder and consumer interests which may arise following undertakings announced on March 11. For shareholders, there is an explicit threat to their dividend when British Gas divests itself of 55 per cent of a market in which, last year, it made a profit of Pounds 281m at a 12.1 per cent rate of return on assets. The related but implicit threat to consumers is that British Gas will seek to recover profits by raising the price of contract gas to industry and commerce while saving costs in the price regulated domestic market by lowering service standards to householders. The notion that competition alone will keep industrial gas prices down is wrong. While British Gas is compelled to publish a schedule of prices, competitors will be happy to track the price of the dominant supplier and to watch the average price drift upward to the advantage of North Sea producers who have ownership and equity interest in much of the emergent competition. As a first move, British Gas can be expected substantially to reduce the availability of cheap interruptible gas which accounts for 50 per cent of its contract market by volume but yields little profit. It will do this by raising the price in the knowledge that, initially, the interruptible market has little attraction to competitors. It will seek to replace the load-balancing facility of the interruptible market by investment in more storage assets within the 'gas transportation unit'. As the new unit will be subject to a form of rate-of-return regulation, the increased asset base will provide justification for higher transport costs to British Gas and to its competitors. These will in turn feed through to higher prices and even to the abandonment of postalised prices (standard ones, regardless of where users are) in favour of regional differences related to the distance that the gas travels from terminal to factory site. Who will keep an eye on all this is uncertain and seems to depend on whether the government will have time, before the election, to increase Ofgas's powers over British Gas through the Competition and Service (Utilities) Bill. From the consumers' point of view, better one regulator than several; the simultaneous involvement of OFT, Ofgas, Department of Energy and DTI has done little to speed this matter to a tidy conclusion.

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): An election vote for science TWENTY senior scientists have made a valiant effort to make science an issue in the UK general election, by writing to the Times to protest at the damaging impact of Conservative policies on research (though they could not bring themselves to endorse either Labour or the Liberal Democrats instead.) If they are even half right in claiming that the decline in scientific morale is 'one of the principal disasters in Britain in the past 12 years,' then science and technology deserve a far higher profile than they have had in the campaign so far. The party manifestos make only a few glancing references to science. The Conservatives put forward a general statement of their belief in investing in research but no new ideas. The Liberal Democrats have plenty to say about environmental research but little about science, apart from promising an immediate boost in spending on basic research. Labour is not offering scientists more money straightaway but does have a few innovative proposals, including a cabinet-level minister for science and a 25 per cent tax credit to encourage R&amp;D. There are several reasons why science habitually occupies a low place in the hierarchy of electoral issues. One is simply that scientists tend to be less interested in politics than other professional groups. They are too preoccupied with their experiments, and increasingly with writing proposals for research grants, to devote time and energy to lobbying politicians. There are a few exceptions to this general rule - most notably Denis Noble, the Oxford physiology professor who organised the Save British Science campaign. At the same time politicians are uncertain about the real purpose of investing in science. As the Conservative manifesto says, research 'enriches the quality of our lives and provides the feedstock of industrial innovation'. But the view of science as a cultural activity puts it into competition for funds with the arts, which are much less expensive to sustain. And the link between science and industrial success is hard to prove; it operates on a timescale of decades - beyond the horizons of electoral politics. The issue is clouded further by various myths and misconceptions. One is that Japan achieved its triumph in industry without a strong science base and is now investing in basic research as a luxury it can afford. To make matters worse for science, there is a folk memory in British politics about Harold Wilson's 'white heat of technology' campaign in the 1964 election. That was exciting at the time but after it had congealed into a series of technological white elephants, the feeling was that the campaign had made Wilson and the Labour party look slightly ridiculous in the long run. The 'white heat' campaign has made it less likely that British politicians will get really excited about science and technology again. There is certainly no chance of that happening during the current campaign. The politician with the strongest grasp of scientific issues today is Jeremy Bray, Labour's science spokesman since 1983. His patient low-key style has won friends for Labour in university science departments and research institutes but many doubt whether he could bargain forcefully for extra funds as science minister in a cash-strapped Labour government. None of the three party leaders shows much personal interest in science, though Paddy Ashdown is keen on aerospace and information technology. But as the former research chemist Margaret Thatcher showed, a scientific background offers no guarantee that a politician will take a sympathetic attitude to the subject. Many scientists believe that another government headed by John Major would treat research better than the Thatcher governments of the 1980s. Whatever the outcome on April 9, the best way for scientists to ensure better treatment for R&amp;D is to speak out more forcefully in public. Their statement yesterday was a good start.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yakov Goldenberg, deputy chairman of the </F> Liberal-Democratic Party of Ukraine, by Vitaliy Vezhnin; place  and date not given: "Let Us Shake Hands"]    [Text] A formerly unknown Vladimir Volfovich  Zhirinovskiy once invited the Ukrainian liberals to shake hands.  His potential allies responded, "We will go the other way."    [Goldenberg] This is a very interesting situation. I  understand that the Russian media somewhat specifically explain  the results of the elections in their country, and openly  hesitate to speak of the victory of Yeltsin's opponents. About  70 percent of the local press is subordinated to the president  and the government. But what prevents the Ukrainian press from  doing this? No publication has asked the Liberal-Democratic  Party of Ukraine [LDPU] to comment on this issue. KIEVSKIYE  NOVOSTI is a pleasant exception. I will repeat: The situation  is paradoxical. Everybody comments on the victory of the  Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], except LDPU. And we  have a lot to speak about.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and his people were very interested in  Ukraine at one time, which is completely understandable. They  invited the Ukrainian liberals and sought to establish solid  ties. We immediately dissociated ourselves from them. This is  why: Zhirinovskiy's party was not born in a vacuum. A few  people remember its constituent congress. What advertising can  do! I am absolutely convinced that it is an offspring of the  USSR's special services and those who controlled their  activities... It is known that an entire program for  discrediting liberalism was once worked out. Gorbachev's ideas  and his famous slogan about socialism with a human face were  supposed to be more attractive for the people. Then suddenly,  Vladimir Volfovich appears on the political horizon. "There is  such a party!" Simultaneously with discrediting the idea, they  received an argument with opponents of the multiparty system. It  is not enough for you to have one party? You will get one  more... There has been no liberal party in Russia after all.  LDPR cannot be considered one. Zhirinovskiy's adherents,  politely speaking, have nothing to do with democracy or  liberalism.    In Ukraine, the situation is different. Our position is in  many aspects upheld by the Constitutional Democratic Party and  the Party of Free Peasantry. Together, we form the New Ukraine  union. Our ideas are close to the Labor Congress of Ukraine  and...the Party of Beer Lovers. Do not laugh, there is such a  party. There is also the Liberal Party of Ukraine. There is  nothing like that in Russia. LDPR is only a name, nothing more.    [Vezhnin] Nevertheless, in my opinion, Zhirinovskiy  conducted the electoral campaign brilliantly.    [Goldenberg] I would not overestimate the success of  Zhirinovskiy. Initial assessments show that representatives of  the red-browns are in the minority in the Russian parliament.  The voting was not only on party lists. Nevertheless, I agree  that the success of Zhirinovskiy and [Russian communist leader]  Zyuganov should be seriously taken into consideration. There  are no LDPR structures in Ukraine today.    Yet, another threat exists. The term "zhyrynovshchyna" more  and more often can be heard in politicians' lexicon. The  Ukrainian legislature is not an exception. As soon as a deputy  begins to criticize the party of power, he is instantly tagged:  "This is zhyrynovshchyna!" I believe that this card will be  actively played before the elections...    There is appropriate ground in Ukraine for those who would  like to repeat Zhirinovskiy's success. However, I believe that  extremist forces will not prevail.    [Vezhnin] No matter if somebody likes this or not, Vladimir  Volfovich has ridden into the Russian legislature on a white  horse. What chances will the Ukrainian liberals have in the  upcoming elections?    [Goldenberg] Taking into account current realities, I  believe that if 35 percent of democrats enter the new  legislature it will not be a bad result. We hope that  representatives of LDPU will be part of that 35 percent.    [Vezhnin] Do you not think that today's democrats, or more  precisely, people who have proclaimed themselves as such, are  losing their chances day by day? Let us be frank: Many of them  rode into the Supreme Council on the tide of caveman  anticommunism, inspiring us, common mortals, for the battle  against privileges of the party nomenclature... Today, those  democrats enjoy privileges, about which their predecessors could  not even dream during the 70 years of communism, and are quite  pliable in the hands of the old and new nomenclature. Are there  any guarantees that the total disappointment with democrats will  not lead another Zhirinovskiy to the political Olympus?    [Goldenberg] Do you claim that democratic deputies have been  bought? This is very sad, of course. It is a pity that this is  possible. The explanation is very simple -- this is due to our  poverty. However, I would like to say something else. The  people cannot forgive the deputies corps their cars bought at  dumping prices, luxury apartments, and all-mighty privileges...  But, nobody has ever admitted that not only certain deputies  but also parties have sinned.    Analyze activities of our parties over the last two or three  years. Read their various statements. Today, they criticize  the president; tomorrow they will praise him for what he did  yesterday. The people do not have to believe those who will  deceive their expectations tomorrow.    [Vezhnin] If it is not a secret, who does LDPU believe  should become president?    [Goldenberg] I will be frank. We would like [former Deputy  Prime Minister] Volodymyr Lanovyy to become president of  Ukraine. He is a man, to whom, we believe, there is no  alternative in Ukraine today.    [Vezhnin] You must agree, that this sounds somewhat bizarre.  Your party belongs to the New Ukraine union, whose leader is  [former Supreme Council Speaker] Volodymyr Hrynyov. His latest  statement on establishing the Interregional Reform Block with  [former Prime Minister] Leonid Kuchma gives the former speaker  very good chances. Taking into account the fact that Kuchma has  recently been elected chairman of the Ukrainian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, meaning that he has received  unanimous support of this significant force, this team looks  quite promising. Isn't it more logical to bet on a leader?    [Goldenberg] The Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc undoubtedly has a great  chance, and it would be naive to deny this. Still, we are not  going to bet on it. We have never considered the former prime  minister an advocate of market reforms, and we do not approve of  what has recently taken place. This is a mistake. I am talking  about Hrynyov's position. The New Ukraine is on the verge of  collapse today. This is sad and bitter, but real. Hrynyov's  alliance with recent supporters of the nomenclature is a block  of individuals, not parties.    By the way, our party successfully cooperates with Vladimir  Popov [not further identified] on establishing his electoral  bloc. We have been joined by the Union of Private  Entrepreneurs, other serious structures, and, of course, the  Fund for Restoring Ukraine's Economy.    [Vezhnin] Suppose you have managed to achieve your goals.  Who could head the Cabinet of Ministers, given the new  president?    [Goldenberg] It is possible that the president himself. He  is a determined supporter of market reforms in Ukraine. This  would undoubtedly be the most optimal variant.</p>

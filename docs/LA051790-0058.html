			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PIANIST DAVID ANDRUSS IN CONSERVATIVE PROGRAM IN ORANGE  </P> <P> At the St. Joseph Center Auditorium Tuesday night, 20-year-old pianist David  Andruss took a tentative step toward building a career.  </P> <P> The Southern California native, whose USC bachelor of music degree was just 5  days old, had mounted a grass-roots campaign, rallying friends and family, who  had arranged for the hall, orchestrated publicity, ordered printed programs and  sold tickets. Tuesday they were manning the doors, assembling a mailing list  and accepting orders for tapes of the recital.  </P> <P> Andruss himself presented a conservative program -- perhaps (judging from the  four historical periods faithfully represented) a replay of his graduation  recital. Programming familiar works may endear the performer to his audience,  but it also risks comparison to standards already set by great artists.  </P> <P> Andruss is talented and ambitious, but he is not a great artist. His  performance of Chopin's F-minor Ballade was clean, well-controlled and  musically sensitive. But the piece's potential for emotional catharsis remained  hidden.  </P> <P> Other works also unfolded with refinement but with relatively little excitement  and few profundities. The Fourth Partita of J.S. Bach opened with stylish  double-dotting and liberal use of pedal. Andruss sang the Allemande lovingly,  though without exploiting poignant dissonances. He phrased logically and found  a bright, appealing sound in the Gigue. Still, he shunned varied ornamentation  that might have enlivened repeats in slow movements.  </P> <P> Andruss' straightforward attentiveness extended to mastery over dynamic nuance,  especially softer shades. This served well in four quiet miniatures from  Federico Mompou's suite of nine "Impresiones Intimas" and afforded some  atmospheric Impressionism in Ravel's "Le Tombeau de Couperin."  </P> <P> "Le Tombeau," which closed the concert, gave the only hint of a musical  perception and showmanship that might surpass pleasant competence. Throughout  the work, Andruss kept his tempos strict, his tone shimmering but unvaried.  </P> <P> However, in the final movement, the Toccata, he built an exciting momentum and  propelled the music toward an effective climax.  </P></p>

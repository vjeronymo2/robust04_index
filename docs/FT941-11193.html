			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Vaux chief criticises beer taxes 'The government's punitive tax policy is making beer part of the black economy,' said Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman of Vaux, the Sunderland-based brewer and care homes group. At the annual meeting he said that Yorkshire and north east England topped the league for hired commercial vans crossing the Channel. 'And on every housing estate in the north of England there are people knocking on doors offering cheap beer.' On present trading Sir Paul said the beer and public house market remained very competitive while occupancy rates in the hotels division was up 1.8 percentage points. Care homes were on budget but some local authorities were taking a long time to process new admissions. The share closed down 7p at 296p.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Textron shows 5.8% advance TEXTRON, the US aerospace and insurance conglomerate, which last month acquired Cessna Aircraft for Dollars 600m, yesterday announced a 5.8 per cent increase in 1991 after-tax profits to Dollars 299.5m. Higher earnings from the group's financial services side offset a reduction from the commercial products division. Earnings per share rose to Dollars 3.42 from Dollars 3.18 a year earlier. The modest income improvement is scored on slightly lower total sales of Dollars 7.84bn against Dollars 7.92bn in 1990. In the fourth quarter alone, net profits improved from Dollars 78.1m to Dollars 83.3m. Textron acknowledged that its commercial products operations had suffered a 'recessionary decline', principally in the first six months of the year. These businesses range from automotive parts to industrial fasteners. Overall, operating profits from this division fell from Dollars 166.5m to Dollars 137.9m during the year, while sales slipped from Dollars 1.83bn to Dollars 1.77bn. Profits from aerospace operations were flat for the year at Dollars 335.5m, compared with Dollars 331m, but within this division Bell Helicopter advanced to Dollars 112.7m from Dollars 89.5m. The best performance came from the financial services operations, which turned in Dollars 323.7m at the operating level, against Dollars 291.9m. Total operating income reached Dollars 797.1m, compared with Dollars 789.4m. Interest charges eased from Dollars 255.9m to Dollars 226.4m.</p>

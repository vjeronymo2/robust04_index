			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH VISITS U.S. TROOPS  </P> <P> Is this President and his policies for real? Stupid me, I thought our commander  in chief went to Saudi Arabia Thanksgiving Day to cheer up our troops. Now we  find that (Nov. 21) Bush's appearance before handpicked troops against a  custom-painted backdrop -- the whole scenario choreographed by former Las Vegas  advertising exec Sig Rogich no less -- was designed for only one purpose: To  pick up Bush's sagging image and to make him look good for the TV cameras. All  the while, the grunts who stand to die as soon as the shooting starts are  carefully shunted aside.  </P> <P> BILL LEONG  </P> <P> Bakersfield  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Serebryakov: "Russian Military Doctrine: </F> Why Should Our Army Fight in its Own Country?"]    [Text] Life taught us many things over the past few years.  It taught us not to believe in coincidences, not to trust  promises of politicians, edicts of the president or actions of  the government. This is why hasty adoption of Russia's new  military doctrine evoked a large number of questions in the  minds of servicemen, and not only them.    And, although all political analysis best serves its purpose  before the fact, even now it still probably not too late to  analyze the essence and meaning of the document that has become  the basic formula for the country's defense.    Such a document has, of course, been needed for a long time.  This need arises directly from the state's desire to change its  internal structure, ideology, and mutual relations. In addition,  all of Russia's citizens need to finally be given an idea of  what is happening with the military in our country, and of what  the authorities intend to do, and not to do, in shaping our new  military policy. And obviously the process of fundamental  transformations in all spheres of state activity should be  reflected in military doctrine.    Such a document was drafted, according to plan in some  respects, and spontaneously in others. Military doctrine matured  gradually in staff work in the forces, in seminars held by  military VUZ [higher educational insitution] departments, and in  the research programs of scientific centers. Thousands of people  worked on it, and just in 1993 six doctorate and over 20  candidate dissertations were defended, a number of scientific  discoveries were made, and hundreds of interesting proposals  were offered in the course of preparation of the new military  doctrine.    The doctrine's authors had probably been tasked to gather  together and generalize the results of the labor of military  specialists. However, the document accounts for none of the  proposals originating at the local level.    The convictions and interests of the people who are to  implement the doctrine--the military themselves--were left  unaddressed. Which is why it has come to be widely held in  Moscow's academies that the new doctrine was adopted so suddenly  that, by the very fact of its existence, it would keep any other  concept from making an appearance--for example, one proposing a  professional army.    As we know, any army can man itself by two  principles--voluntarily or by compulsion. The Russian Army has  traditionally formed on the basis of the compulsory principle.    Following the lead of journalists and scientists, three  years  ago many generals began boldly saying that it is impossible for  a compulsory army to become a professional one. But now, the  idea of a professional army is brought to mind at the top with  increasing rarity. Cozy offices in the staff buildings of the  old, tested army, which preferred to fight not with ability but  with numbers, have been found for all of the progressive  generals.    The idea of strict selection and high quality training of  servicemen has been reduced to clumsy half-measures, like  service by enlisted men on the basis of contracts. Supported  neither socially nor economically, the contract service program  has transformed into a joke, discrediting the very idea of a  professional army in Russia. Contract service has attracted  chiefly those who are seeking easy money or are at odds with the  law. Both the special and the general educational training of  these soldiers is so low that the textbooks commanders usually  use for training in the troops are over their heads. Pressing  people into contract service, the military commissariats fulfill  the plans dictated to them from above "at any cost," even going  so far as to deceive both the contract soldiers themselves and  the officers under whose leadership these people will have to  serve. Something said by one of the commanders of a battalion  manned by such a "contingent" has now swept through a good half  of the Army: "So what did that military commissar do, make a  deal with a prison camp chief?"    The so-called combined principle of manning the Armed Forces  proclaimed in the new military doctrine enables the military  leadership to enlist the state's human resources without any  sort of quality control, taking its cue not from conscription  needs but from a reluctance to complicate its life    The generals don't understand that signing contracts with  willing persons isn't enough--the entire system of selection and  combat training of soldiers has to be changed fundamentally.  Such a requirement conflicts with the fundamental, historically  evolved method by which our troops have waged war. Russian  generals have never paid attention to losses, generously  fertilizing the future with the bones of their soldiers. And  this "science of winning" is perhaps the only thing in which the  continuity of the generations of Russian generals clearly  expresses itself.    However, there is one other, more important circumstance:  The  subconscious notion that the Army serves as a prison for a part  of our people continues to foil attempts to create professional  armed forces in our country. The isolation potential of the  barracks has been expertly utilized in Russia since day one.  When in past centuries a revolutionary situation evolved in  Finland or Poland, the emperor defused it by mass conscription  of youngsters from the restless regions into the army. But we  went even further: Conscriptions are conducted regularly, from  all regions. It has gotten to the point where all of our men  serve in the army, and all are made equal in the ranks. And it  was only in our country that the word "simple" sounded so much  like praise, while "complex" ("special") was perceived as  something negative. The individual was compelled to conceal his  uniqueness, and was ashamed of his individuality. Keeping his  opinions to himself, gradually he lost his ability to hold an  opinion, he forgot how to think, he ceased thinking. The ideal  warrior! How could you refuse such easy-to-manage soldiers?    But let's return to the military doctrine. First of all,  let's define the location of this document in the coordinates of  the country's sociopolitical life in 1993. Let's consider the  chronology: October--the tragedy at the White House;  November--the presidential edict approving the "Fundamental  Principles of Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation";  December--the national referendum on the new Constitution and  elections to the Russian parliament. Such a sequence of event  makes you wonder. The question that arises right away is this:  What should come first? The fundamental law of the state, or its  military doctrine? The answer is obvious. First we adopt the  constitution, and then the military doctrine. If that were what  happened, we would certainly have heard loud demands to  reconcile the fundamental principles of the military doctrine to  the constitution's postulates. It would not be easy to ignore  such demands at any level of authority. But were the sequence of  adoption of the documents to be changed, as was done in our  case, the military doctrine would become a given, claiming  priority of its principles over constitutional principles.    The hands of politicians in military actions have been  untied  for all time, the Armed Forces turn out to be independent of the  constitution, and military affairs are dependably screened from  public scrutiny.    The inconsistency between the actual tenor of Army life and  constitutional norms is so astounding that it requires separate  discussion. The new Russian Constitution, no matter what  criticism it may endure, nonetheless does devote a sizable  amount of room to the individual, declaring the rights and  liberties of the individual. But real military life is  characterized at the moment objective lawlessness and lack of  freedom. The military doctrine takes no account at all of human  rights in any of its premises. "Labor is free. Each shall have  the right do whatever he wishes with his working abilities, and  to select his nature of activity and occupation.... Compulsory  labor is forbidden," states Article 37 of the Constitution. But,  in the meantime, the Army continues to stand on involuntary  labor, and the military doctrine confirms manning predominantly  on the basis of the compulsory principle for the foreseeable  future.    Or, "...each shall have the right to freedom and  inviolability of the person. Arrest...shall be based only on  court rulings," declares Article 22 of the Constitution. Reading  this, we would have to assume that our Army' disciplinary  regulations have now been rescinded.    And once again, "...the home is sacred. No one shall have  the  right to enter a home against the will of persons residing  therein." This is from Article 25 of the Russian Constitution.  But according to the disciplinary regulations, the barracks  (officers' dormitories) are not homes, and privates and NCOs  (officers) residing therein are not protected by the  Constitution.    There are many examples of this sort. Also among them is a  highly significant one. According to Article 27 of the  Constitution, "...anyone who is lawfully present on territory of  the Russian Federation shall have the right to travel freely."  To people knowing what military service is like, any comment  would be superfluous in this regard.    A strange picture develops. With one hand the state gives  normal rights and liberties to the military as well as the rest  of the citizens of Russia, but with its other hand it confirms a  document in which these rights are not foreseen. Which document  is to be followed by a military chief? And by subordinates?  Perhaps Article 45 of the Constitution, which states that  "...each shall have the right to defend his rights and liberties  by all means not prohibited by law"? Our Army will become a  strange spectacle when some will be lawfully infringing upon the  rights of others, while those others will be lawfully defending  them.    After all of this, I have this great urge to call the  military doctrine a political propaganda document oriented on  objectives far from those of strengthening the country's defense  capabilities. But let's wait a little. Let's think on this a  little more. First let's agree on the basic concepts.    Military doctrine is defined as a system of views, adopted  by  the state for a given period of time (stipulated in the doctrine  itself), upon the essence, nature and goals of possible war, and  upon the program of preparations for it by the state and the  armed forces. The fundamental principles of military doctrine  are based on the society's social and political structure, the  state of its economy, and the geopolitical situation of the  country and its probable adversaries. The military doctrines of  all states have been written on the basis of this matrix, which  is then filled in with the content of the political programs of  the governments and ruling parties of these states.    Military doctrine takes on a meaning of its own only when  the  concept central to it comes into being--a probable adversary.  Then the defense program acquires its special military  orientation. And, developing with regard for the forces and  resources of the potential opponent, it establishes what forces  and resources it needs for war and in preparation for it.  Military doctrine simply has no meaning when a probable  adversary is not defined. You can't prepare for war against an  unknown adversary, without knowing the direction from which the  blow might come. It is impossible to organize military  professional training, carry out defensive measures, select  armament systems, position the forces, determine their combat  readiness, and assign military reconnaissance tasks.    It is impossible to set the upper limit of the material  needs  of the state and the Army for preparing and conducting warfare.  When the probable adversary is left unnamed, claims by the  general officers and leaders of the military-industrial complex  upon any given percentage of the national income would be  justified. But in the new Russian military doctrine the probable  adversary isn't even defined approximately. The authors of this  document believe "...wars and military conflicts to be the main  danger to stability and peace." But almost all officers with  whom I've discussed the doctrine shake their heads at this in  bewilderment: Does this mean that war is what creates the danger  of war?    But looking at things objectively, can we really say that  Russia is threatened by no one? Have absolute tranquility and  international harmony really settled over the world? Are there  really no countries, with interests opposite to those of our  state, making territorial, economic and even political claims  upon us? And where, I'd like to know, are the nuclear missiles  of the USA, France and England still aimed? And what about  China's? Aren't they still aimed at us? Isn't this also true of  conventional missiles as well?    Once upon a time an adversary did attack Russia, catching  our  people and Army by surprise because the political ambitions of  certain individuals precluded the possibility of a professional  military approach to defense. The one true lesson of history is  that no one is learning anything from it.    The Soviet Union's military doctrine believed the developed  capitalist countries, and chiefly the United States, to be the  probable adversary. This provided the possibility for  purposefully developing the economy and military science, and  carrying out political training of the troops. The corresponding  army mentality evolved, and the professional skills of fighting  a specifically indicated adversary were practiced over many long  decades.    By inertia, many commanders continue to develop these same  skills in their subordinates, while realizing deep within their  souls that such independent activity contradicts all of the  state's policy today. But what are commanders to do? Nothing new  has been proposed to them. Nothing different is being taught to  them. Nothing specific is being said.    When asked in a recent training exercise in a certain  Siberian division whom they would most likely go to war with,  one out of every three privates didn't have an answer, while one  out of every five, after some hemming and hawing, finally named  the United States, or Iraq, or Germany, or China, or Georgia, or  Abkhazia. The most interesting thing is that all of them could  be right. After all, in addition to the traditional missions,  the new military doctrine presupposes peacekeeping  operations--stationing the Armed Forces of the Russian  Federation outside the country. Such actions are already a  reality, and there are serious apprehensions that they could  occur with much greater frequency in the future. And then our  youngsters will be going to new Afghanistans, new Angolas, new  Karabakhs. They will go to render international assistance, to  rescue some government, to correct someone's mistakes. They will  go to their deaths, "rectifying death by death."    Why is a probable adversary not indicated in our doctrine?  Could it be that the country's leadership knows who he is, but  is afraid to anger him, while not being afraid to anger its own  army? Or, having accomplished a unique, radical revolution in  all military science, could it be that the president of Russia  and his Ministry of Defense have decided to the keep this  opponent secret from their own army? Or could it be that having  no political course to follow, no ideological values, our  politicians are hoping to be good friends with everyone in the  international arena?    There are many suppositions, but there is still only one  question: Do the authors of the new military doctrine realize  that by not indicating a probable adversary in it, and thus  asking their country and army to prepare for war with any old  state, we are willingly or unwillingly putting the entire world  on our list of potential foes?    Military doctrine has two sides--sociopolitical and  military-technical. The former embraces issues pertaining to the  economic, social, and legal principles of accomplishing the  goals of a future war. This side is determined by the society's  main political objectives. But we didn't have such objectives at  the moment of approval of the doctrine. They were formulated  later on in the Constitution. Therefore, the military doctrine  was unable to express the views of the state on the possible  nature of wars and military conflicts, or define the principles  and directions of development of the Armed Forces. We will find  nothing on the list of measures to be carried out up to the  second millennium that would offer evidence of the seriousness  of plans to reform the Army and "get combat-capable, modern  forces as a result."    The military-technical side of doctrine is a more  utilitarian  concept. It includes questions of the strategy and tactics of  combat activities, the equipment supplied to the Armed Forces,  and their professional training. This side of doctrine legalizes  the complex mutual relations of army structures with the  military-industrial and scientific complexes, and with the  central and local administrations, and in a sense documents  processes that have been taking shape over the course of years  and decades. The military-technical side of doctrine cannot  objectively come into being before all of these relations are  fully evolved and stabilized. Have they already stabilized in  the Russian Army? Are all ties set up and working in exemplary  fashion? Can the quality of the personal and financial support  provided to the Army today be taken as the model?    But the section of the doctrine that expounds the concept of  activity in the military-technical area is especially  surprising. This section is presented in the new military  doctrine as if its authors bear not even a suspicion of the  state economy's devastation, of the extremely deep financial  crisis, or of the social cataclysms. Had economists gone over  this document before it was cast in stone by politicians and the  military? Had they asked their traditional question: "What's the  bottom line?"? What is the bottom line of operational  restoration of the extremely expensive military  infrastructure--the new airfields, the transportation net, the  components of the air defense and missile systems, the military  posts? What will be the cost of withdrawing forces back into  this country and accommodating them, of introducing a new  manning system, of participating in regional military conflicts,  of making personnel changes in the Armed Forces, and of  maintaining retired military personnel, whose numbers are  continually growing with the Army's reduction? And that's far  from everything. Every item, every word of the new military  doctrine means billions upon billions of rubles.    Having lost much of our order of battle with the  disintegration of the USSR, our Army is presently in a woeful  state. There was a time when it was built upon the principles of  integration, of supporting all theaters of military operations  with unified air defense systems and air forces, of conducting  combat operations with regard for the possibilities of the Navy  and Strategic Missile Forces. These principles have now been  violated. Such an army no longer exists. Troops and equipment of  the strongest first-line districts departed together with  Ukraine and Belarus, which totally devastated the complex  structure of the country's entire defense, and laid bare the  Western Sector. The tragic events in the Caucasus, in the Dnestr  region, and in Azerbaijan and Tajikistan severed all lines of  communications almost entirely, thus depriving the dozens of  units stationed in these regions of the possibility of  conducting combat activities. These formations are feeling the  shortage of personnel more and more keenly. In turn, the absence  of resources and of proper personal conditions makes it  impossible for the Ministry of Defense to relocate ground forces  and form some sort of workable system out of them.    The Strategic Missile Forces have found themselves in a  situation in which a significant fraction of their launchers are  on the other side of Russia's borders. Moreover, all such  facilities require the constant attention of specialists, whom  no CIS country but Russia has. Imagine what awaits the launchers  in the absence of constant maintenance. And how is such  maintenance to be carried out abroad? How are these facilities  to be transferred to the other country if they are controlled  from a single center? How much resources will it take to  reorient the flight assignments in order to plug the holes  formed in our country's nuclear missile shield? Still, despite  everything, and owing exclusively to the heroism of their own  officers, the Russian missile forces are maintaining their  combat readiness.    The country's air defense system, which has been ravaged by  numerous reorganizations, is in dire need of radical improvement  of all of its technical resources, and of more effective  coordination of its actions with other armed forces. Strategic  aviation suffers from a shortage of fuel and personnel, and it  chronically lacks the resources for practical training of  specialists. Torn apart by conflicts, the navy is desperately  trying to preserve its unity and fighting capability, and to  reject the old combat equipment others insist it must accept.    The Army has been strangled by housing and personal  problems.  Officers haven't been paid for several months. There are not  enough enlisted men, and "mestnichestvo," "dedovshchina,"  harassment and favoritism flourish in the units. Servicemen  uprooted from Russian soil have lost all hope of returning to  their motherland. The are in despair. The one thing they have  been capable of is armed defense of their children, their wives,  and their families against bands of nationalists.    In these times, having taken upon itself the inordinate  burden of maintaining order along the borders of the former  USSR, Russia is currently maintaining more troops abroad  (including border guards) than any other country in the world.    After the Civil War, at the beginning of the period of the  New Economic Policy, Lenin reduced the Army from 5 million to  550,000. That is, by almost 10 times. But this took more than  just a single year. As of the moment of their establishment by  an edict of the Russian president dated 7 May 1992, the Armed  Forces numbered around 3 million persons. By 1995 their  numerical strength is supposed to be not more than 2 million.  But such a downward progression is not to be observed. On the  contrary the administrative machinery of the Russian Ministry of  Defense seems to have already surpassed that which existed in  the Soviet Army in terms of both number of workers and quantity  of general-grade positions.    The equipment situation is also critical. Of the five and a  half thousand tanks in the Russian Army, around a thousand are  practically unusable. During the next year half of the tanks  will become obsolete from a military standpoint. There is  nothing with which to replace them. Of 7,000 infantry fighting  vehicles and 6,500 artillery systems, over a third require  immediate overhaul. The full thousand of our helicopter gunships  require immediate repairs and maintenance. This list can go on  and on. And even so, these are nothing more than the general  statistics. Behind each one of them stands the tragedy of people  deprived of the possibility of doing their work. In many of the  units, all of this is believed to be the result of intrigues by  our enemies, conspiracies, and betrayal. Here and there, we hear  appeals for action: "...could it be that our commanders have an  aversion to rending foreign uniforms with Russian bayonets?"  Young, hot-blooded lieutenants can't understand why everyone is  calmly watching as things of value that had taken years to  create are being destroyed, turned inside out, and sold for a  pittance in a single moment.    How many packs of chewing gum can you get for a  gyro-stabilized strategic nuclear missile launcher, or for a  mobile army command post? That's not an idle question. Such  deals have been made.    Yes, Russia has always traded in arms. Just in the 1980s for  example, the military-industrial complex sold over 6,000 tanks,  20,000 guns, 17 submarines and thousands of airplanes to foreign  countries. Through its weapon sales the USSR controlled the  geopolitical map of the world, shored up and set up regimes, and  maintained or relieved tension in certain regions. But the  process was kept under meticulous control, and the weapons were  carefully accounted for. Each cartridge was accountable. The  loss of a single pistol was considered to be an incident of the  gravest import, one to be reported to the Main Command.    Following disintegration of the USSR, the Army wrote off  around a third of all of its military equipment and armament  within a year. It was scrapped, hidden, and stolen for  subsequent sale. But in order to sell weapons thoughtlessly, you  first have to sell your conscience. Who knows how many tens of  dollars the conscience of a Russian officer costs today?    Whether the authors of the doctrine like it or not, the  individual, along with his own philosophy and interests, remains  the decisive factor of modern warfare. It is no secret to anyone  that all of the world's large armies invest enormous resources  into shaping a sense of patriotism in their soldiers, a system  of spiritual values and particular political convictions (no  matter what anyone says about depoliticizing the Army). All of  this is accomplished through a system of indoctrination, which  exists in every army of every state. Indoctrination is an  attribute of an army, a means of controlling the armed forces. I  know of very few exceptions to this rule, and when it gets down  to the large armed forces and countries, there is but one  exception--Russia. The destruction of our old system of military  indoctrination is almost complete, and it is continuing. Listen  to what I'm saying--it is not being changed, it is not being  reworked, but it is being destroyed. The former system was of  course oversaturated by ideology, it totally excluded  creativity, and it was built on a purely Talmud-like foundation.  But at least it was well-conceived, and army indoctrination  consistently shaped the army's culture, which was rooted in  Soviet traditions and customs. They were expressed in the form  of numerous military customs and courtesies, from the  simplest--saluting--to the most complex--the military oath taken  in a solemn situation, holiday parades, and so on. Having become  divested of the ideological principles of communism, the once  perfect system of troop indoctrination immediately lost meaning,  and transformed into the tattered clothing of the army. This  process was helped along considerably by organizational measures  directed at the former Main Political Directorate: hatchet-job  reorganizations and personnel changes in the Directorate for  Educational Work With Personnel, persecution of political  workers in the forces, and many other clumsy actions by Armed  Forces reformers. Together with the old system of  indoctrination, the Army reformers did in all of military  culture. No one gave any thought to what was to replace it. The  Russian Army does not have its own internal military culture. It  is attempting to unconditionally inject new political meaning  into old army customs and courtesies, and it is trading Soviet  flags for Russian ones, but all of the customs, all of the  courtesies are rigidly determined by their traditional communist  content, and nothing new is being added. And without internal  army culture, it would be naive to discuss organization and  combat readiness of the armed forces. No one has yet suggested a  system for the army under which people would be brought together  not by a dependence upon an idea, but by the idea itself. And  without unity, without unity of thought, it is impossible to  have a modern army.    Let me also add that all indoctrination is inseparable from  the training process. Because officers and generals didn't know  how to indoctrinate their subordinates, or in what, they have  lost their possibility for teaching them military affairs per se  in organized, high quality fashion.    How did it happen that the undermined socioeconomic and  moral  tenets of the Army went unreflected on the pages of this  important state document? How is the highly important formula of  defense going to work? How about the formula of victory? The  important thing now is, who's victory over whom?    What makes the new military doctrine fundamentally different  is that it gives the president and government the right to use  the Armed Forces to fight not only a foreign but even an  internal foe. To put it simply, this military doctrine gives the  Army permission to shoot at civilians, to use mighty army  weapons against them. It may be possible that they will now  begin giving combat decorations for this.    The unprecedented level of freedom that the authors of the  doctrine give to the military-political leadership (or leader)  in independently choosing the adversary both outside the state  and within it is simply frightening.    The military has been given unlimited possibilities, and it  has been shown unprecedented trust. But thank God, this is no  joy to officers. They have no wish to shoot at civilians, no  matter what their convictions, no matter what their behavior. If  someone violates the law, we have the militia, the OMON [Special  Purpose Militia Detachments], and the security service. Why the  military? The Army is supposed to fight another army, and not  anyone else. This unique feature of the military doctrine  explains to some degree all of its preceding contradictions. If  the Armed Forces are to be used to fight an internal enemy, the  absence of many concepts from the doctrine familiar to military  people is fully natural and justified. A ministry that is bent  on force, and takes aim into its own country, has need of  neither the sociopolitical nor the military-technical side of  policy. A ministry of this kind has other objectives, a  different system of preparation. True, in civilized countries  the army does not perform internal functions. In Czarist Russia  for example, such functions were performed by a gendarmerie. And  it did quite well without military doctrine.    But even in instructions followed by the gendarmerie, the  probable adversary, the potential violator of the peace, was  clearly defined. He was an anarchist or a social-democrat, a  socialist-revolutionary or a Bundist. Do those who wrote this  present doctrine realize that by not indicating any probable  adversary within the country, they have thus wittingly or  unwittingly fingered all political parties, all social groups as  the probable adversaries of the Armed Forces? And doesn't that  mean all of the Russian people?</p>

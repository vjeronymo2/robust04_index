			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Canadian dollar firmer The failure of Quebec separatists to win a convincing mandate in weekend elections helped the Canadian dollar to its highest level in eight months yesterday, writes Philip Gawith. Although the pro-sovereignty Parti Quebecois (PQ) scored a solid victory in the provincial elections, the smaller than expected margin of victory was seen as diminishing the prospect of Quebec seceding. The Canadian dollar closed in London at CDollars 1.3534 against the US dollar, from CDollars 1.3653 on Monday. Currency dealers said the Bank of Canada had intervened and sold Canadian dollars for US dollars when the currency had broken through the CDollars 1.35 level. The US dollar, meanwhile, benefited from firmer bond prices, following a fairly benign consumer prices report. It finished in London at DM1.5493 from DM1.5435 and against the yen at Y99.045 from Y98.985. But it slipped in New York to DM1.5433 and Y98.835. The D-Mark was generally weaker in Europe, with the market realising that the political risk in the October elections is higher than previously anticipated. It finished at FFr3.421 against the franc, from FFr3.425, and L1,013, from L1,017, against the Italian lira. Sterling traded firmly after Monday's 50 basis-point rise in interest rates, although it lost ground in the afternoon against the improved dollar. It ended at Dollars 1.5613 after briefly trading above Dollars 1.57, and at DM2.4189 after moving above DM2.42. Analysts said the strengthening of the Canadian dollar - which looks to be breaking a three-year downtrend against the US dollar - was partly a knee-jerk response to the election result, and partly a case of making up lost ground. Other 'commodity' currencies, such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars, have risen this year on the back of the improved outlook for commodity prices. The Canadian dollar was held back by political uncertainty. Mr Tim Stewart, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in London, said that with the Quebec issue partially resolved - at least in the mind of the market - the currency had made up some of the lost ground. He predicted that it would probably establish a CDollars 1.3450 to CDollars 1.3650 trading range to the US dollar, compared to CDollars 1.3750 to CDollars 1.3950 seen so far this year. Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS in London, said the election result was good for the currency in the short term, but he remained cautious over the longer term. 'Now that you have the PQ in negotiations at the federal level, it may be that much more difficult for the government to achieve the budget cuts it seeks.' Wood Gundy Economics, part of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce group, commented: 'While today's victory for the PQ will provide them with a base from which to build support for sovereignty, we believe that markets will judge referendum prospects as sufficiently distant and uncertain as to not preclude a return to fundamentally driven markets, with narrower Canada-US interest rate spreads and a firming Canadian dollar.' It predicts CDollars 1.3420 at the end of the year. Sterling appeared to be the beneficiary of Monday's rate rise being seen by the market as 'pre-emptive'. Mr Brian Durrant, economist at broker GNI, said it had been 'a rare UK occurrence, a rate hike not provoked by turbulence in the foreign exchanges; the UK authorities appear to have pulled off something the Fed has been trying all year to achieve - namely a pre-emptive rate hike'. One pundit cautioned against the market getting carried away, noting that 'sterling/D-Mark has been trending lower since I was born'. But Mr Chris Turner, currency analyst at BZW, said there were various reasons why sterling should do better than the dollar did, when US rates were first raised in February. These included UK real rates having less to rise before 'neutrality' is achieved; the UK output gap being larger, reducing the chance of the Bank being seen to be 'behind the game' in combatting inflation; and the market also being much less bullish about the pound in the first place. Mr Stewart of Morgan Stanley said he thought sterling could reach DM2.45/2.50 in the next few months, especially if the D-Mark weakened ahead of next month's elections. Short sterling staged a recovery after a bout of pessimism in the immediate aftermath of the rate rise. The September contract rose by seven basis points to 94.14, while the December contract was up by a similar margin to 93.37. The market clearly believes that Monday's increase in rates was only the first of many. It is still discounting short-term rates above 6.6 per cent at the end of the year, and at 8.7 per cent in December 1995. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 329m assistance, at the new established rate of 5 5/8 per cent, after forecasting a Pounds 300m shortage. Overnight money traded between 3 and 5 3/8 per cent. In the cash markets, three-month money LIBOR traded at 5 13/16 per cent, from 5 7/8 per cent.</p>

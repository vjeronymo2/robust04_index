			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Norwegian poll gives Labour a clear lead NORWEGIANS today vote in a general election which is expected to hand victory to the ruling Labour party led by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. Opinion polls have consistently indicated a swing to the left, a trend confirmed by a poll published on Saturday in the Dagbladet newspaper. The poll, the last before the election, showed Labour with 34.8 per cent of the vote, a marked improvement from mid-year polls when support for Labour fell below 30 per cent, its poorest rating since the 1920s. The major issues of the election include unemployment, currently at a post-war record of 8.3 per cent, including those on government training schemes, and Norway's application to join the European Community. Labour's strength in the polls has been boosted by signs of economic recovery, assisted by record North Sea petroleum output which has made Norway Europe's biggest oil producer. Mrs Brundtland has also gained credibility by refusing to debate Europe during the campaign, saying that EC membership will be decided by voters in a referendum by 1995. Analysts say the electorate feels there is no real credible alternative to Labour, with opinion polls showing steadily eroding support for the main opposition Conservative Party. In Saturday's poll, the Conservatives saw support fall to 18.1 per cent from 22.2 per cent of the vote in the 1989 election. The biggest gain today, according to the polls, will be by the anti-EC agrarian Centre party, support for which has soared to 16 per cent from just 6.5 per cent in the last election.

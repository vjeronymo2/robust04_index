			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Drive on benefits 'saved Pounds 558m' MR PETER LILLEY, social security secretary, told the Commons yesterday that record 'fraud savings' of Pounds 558m were made last year. Mr Lilley said the Benefits Agency caught more than 270,000 people 'cheating' the social security system. He suggested that doctors would be likely to welcome new procedures to determine eligibility for invalidity benefit. Replying to protests by Labour MPs, Mr Lilley said he had never criticised doctors for the rapid growth in the numbers being paid invalidity benefit. During the past 15 years the number of claimants had nearly trebled, while the expenditure involved had more than trebled in real terms. Dr Charles Goodson-Wickes, Conservative MP for Wimbledon, said the system was perceived by many to be subject to abuse.</p>

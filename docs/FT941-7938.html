			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Arts: The New Menoza - Theatre Here is a theatrical oddity well worth making the journey to Notting Hill Gate to explore. This translation by Meredith Oakes of Jakob Lenz's The New Menoza was commissioned by the Gate Theatre and first performed last year at the Edinburgh Festival where it received appreciative notices. Now it has been re-staged and inaugurates a season of 18th century comedy at the Gate's newly furbished headquarters. Lenz was a friend of Goethe's whom he met in Strasbourg in 1770 when as a theologian from Livonia (now Latvia) he formed part of a brilliant circle of writers. They largely initiated the Storm and Stress movement. In their case this meant not merely a subversive life-style in reaction to teutonic autocracy but the attempt to vitalise the resources of the German language for literature, especially the theatre. Lenz's plays revealed the strength of German prose as a dramatic medium. Apart from The New Menoza, the other two outstanding ones are The Soldiers and The Tutor (all available in English from Oberon Books, N7 9RH). Based in Strasbourg the group were conscious of French dramatic doctrine as much as they admired Shakespeare. Lenz the playwright derives from both traditions. This play ends with the Mayor of Naumberg denouncing the classical unities - one of three stunning cameo performances given by Tom Chadbon during the evening - to his languidly decadent son (Pearce Quigley), a bored upholder of them. The director/ designer David Fielding might have been tempted to cut this scene. At first it seemed an anti-climax after the high-spots of the masked ball and violent bloodbath, that preceded it, both most ingeniously staged; but on reflection it emerges as the key to the play. Through an absurdly complicated plot centering on the arrival in Naumberg of a mysterious Prince of Arabia (Peter Lindford), Lenz takes up motifs such as mistaken paternity and forced marriage that are the stuff of classical theatre and one after another he deconstructs them. The problem is to prevent the whole thing degenerating into a sorry farce. But, miraculously in this excellent production, it is avoided thanks to the definition given to their roles by the 10-strong company, lifting them right out of the stereotypes. The play explodes like a well-organised display of fireworks through the formidable energy with which the actors attack it in the limited space at their disposal. Tristam Jellinek leads the way as the bumbling pater familias whose nubile daughter (Amanda Royle) the men all covet, and everyone else gloriously follows suit. Not to be missed. At the Gate Theatre until March 19.</p>

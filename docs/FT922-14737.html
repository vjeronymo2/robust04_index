			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Property: Portugal's golf estates drive away recession ALTHOUGH the 550-acre Praia d'el Rey estate, on the coast north of Lisbon, is almost entirely a new development, permission for building there actually was given before Portugal's bloodless revolution in the 1970s. The site is near the old walled village of 0bidos and its lagoon, and the fishing port of Peniche. Initially, a few houses were built by a Belgian company which used to own the land. Then, the project was shelved. But it has been revived by its new owner, Beltico, a consortium which includes Portuguese and British partners. Plans envisage housing, three hotels, a village, and an 18-hole golf course and clubhouse. About 30 villas - many substantial - have been, or are being, built. Roofs are pink-tiled, usually on several levels, and walls are cream or white. Nearly all have swimming pools, some have tennis courts, and most will have views of the sea, golf course or nearby woodland. A few are only 50 yards from the beach, part of Portugal's 'silver coast' where Atlantic waves roll onto the soft sand and send up fountains of spray. Other buyers, preferring larger plots, have chosen sites farther back looking into the woods. Indeed, some have bought two or three. Initial purchasers have come from Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Britain. but a number are Portuguese. This pleases the developers because such owners are likely to make frequent use of the properties. They may even commute to Lisbon, 80 minutes' drive away (although this will be cut to under an hour when new roads are completed). Thus, the estate should have occupants throughout the year. When completed, there will be about 150 villas, 800 town houses and 600 apartments, mostly in the cobbled village which will form a corner of the site. The price for a two-bedroom apartment could be Pounds 50,000, with two or three bedroom town houses from Pounds 80,000. A four-bedroom detached villa, with pool, could cost about Pounds 200,000, depending on site and plot size. Golfers will enjoy what is almost a links course, part of which will run parallel with the sea with the rest spreading back over sand dunes and moorland into pine woods. Work on the course - designed by an American, Cabell Robinson - is just starting and should take 18 months. There is a chance there could be a second course later. For further information in Lisbon, call Beltico (tel. 315 76 07). In London, ring solicitor Swycher &amp; Co. (071-224-3388); its senior partner is a director of the consortium. Praia d'el Rey is just one of several golf schemes in the Iberian peninsula, despite the recession. London &amp; Edinburgh Trust's LET Leisure has acquired the controlling interest in Pinheiros Altos, a 250-acre golf course development adjoining the Quinta do Lago estate in the Algarve of southern Portugal. The first batch of 9l villa plots is being offered there at prices between Pounds 85,000-Pounds 240,000. Buyers can then choose from a selection of house designs or use their own architect. Total cost could average Pounds 350,000-Pounds 400,000. The course - designed by another American, Ronald Fream - will have a computerised booking system and rounds will be limited to four hours. The first nine holes should be ready by June, with the rest playable in the autumn. Plot buyers will have guaranteed membership of the club and priority access to its golf academy. Details from LET Leisure at 071-602-9922. Another development on the Algarve for golfers is Vila Sol at Morgadinhos, near Vilamoura, 20 minutes from Faro airport. This estate is similar to Praia d'el Rey in that earlier work was halted by the revolution. In this case, though, the new owner has built the 18-hole course first. Designed by an Englishman, Donald Steel, and completed last year, it occupies a third of the 367 acres and the Portuguese Open was played on it last month. Vila Sol is thought to be the first course in Portugal built to United States Golf Association standards. The next stage is the housing. The 240 plots, of a quarter or half an acre, encircle the course and the first are now being offered at between Pounds 67,000-Pounds 279,000. Villas will have views of the fairways or distant mountains. The estimated cost of building a suitable three-bedroom design, with pool, on such a plot is about Pounds 150,000. Buyers may choose from various available plans or appoint their own architect, but he must conform to development guidelines. There are to be apartments and a five-star hotel on the northern boundary. A business centre, clinic and leisure area for activities like tennis and riding will come later. The development is a little away from the coast and this, it is claimed, will make it more secluded. But it also has a private beach club, with restaurant and bar, at Ancao beach and a regular shuttle service will link the two. Vila Sol is backed by the Grupo Atlantica, a Portuguese financial institution which, among other interests, is a shareholder in the Banco Totta &amp; Acores. The UK agent is Hamptons (071-493-8222). The recent DRT International survey of European golf facilities shows that Portugal has 20 courses, with 14 more being built and 90 projects under consideration. Sandy Steven, of the Glasgow-based Tourism Resources Company  -which studies the potential market for such facilities on behalf of tourist organisations and developers - says that, despite the recession, the luxury end of the market in Spain and Portugal is holding up, with demand continuing for good-quality, low-density villas around courses.</p>

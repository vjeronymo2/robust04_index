			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / M&amp;S up 21% as price freeze pays ON THE day J Sainsbury said it was reducing prices on key lines, Marks and Spencer claimed success for its own strategy of trimming gross margins and sharpening prices, as it announced a 21 per cent increase in interim profits. Pre-tax profits were a record Pounds 307.8m, about Pounds 10m higher than the most optimistic forecasts. M&amp;S shares improved 7p to 403p - in sharp contrast to shares in the food retailing sector - and several of its suppliers also enjoyed share price gains. Sir Richard Greenbury, M&amp;S chairman, said he believed 'value and quality have never been as important as they are now'. 'Over the last 12 months or so we have reduced margins to sharpen our prices. The result of that has been that as consumers came out of the trenches they started to spend more with us.' The company launched its 'Outstanding Value' campaign a year ago, when it froze the prices of three-quarters of its goods, and cut prices for the remaining 25 per cent. Sir Richard said that while some prices had since increased, others had been reduced, and clothing prices overall remained broadly unchanged since last year. Price increases in the food operation had been held to a little over 1 per cent. He refused to reveal how much gross margins had fallen, or to speculate on how long M&amp;S would hold present prices or continue to reduce gross margins. Such judgments, he said, depended on factors including the Budget and its effect on the UK economy, and on what happened to retail price inflation. He was also sceptical about claims that UK retailing was seeing a fundamental shift away from focusing on margins towards a volume-led approach more akin to that in the US. 'There are an awful lot of retailers, including those who pontificate the most, who keep talking about bringing margins down to drive volumes, but don't actually make any more profit,' he said. Group sales at M&amp;S were up nearly 9 per cent to Pounds 2.87bn. Sales in the UK and Republic of Ireland were up nearly 7 per cent to Pounds 2.40bn, with operating profits 23 per cent ahead at Pounds 295.9m. Turnover in continental Europe increased from Pounds 97m to Pounds 106.5m. But while operating profits rose 42 per cent to Pounds 9.9m, the comparison was flattered by the devaluation of sterling and the inclusion of substantial store opening costs in last year's figures. Sir Richard said the economic outlook remained gloomy. Sales and operating profits increased at both Brooks Bros and Kings Super Markets in the US, but sales fell and losses increased slightly in Canada. A continued strong performance in the Far East contributed to a 29 per cent increase in total turnover for the rest of the world to Pounds 275.6m, with operating profits increasing from Pounds 6.1m to Pounds 8.7m. The interim dividend was lifted from 2.2p to 2.5p, payable from earnings up 20.6 per cent to 7.6p. Lex, Page 20; London SE, Page 42</p>

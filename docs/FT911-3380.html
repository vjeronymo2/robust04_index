			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Toll of cuts in media staff mounts THE TOLL of media job losses is mounting. The BBC yesterday announced 364 redundancies among its national radio staff while News International is to cut 185 jobs from its newspaper printing workforce. The BBC redundancies will affect cleaning, catering and security staff at Broadcasting House in London, where its national radio operation is located. The losses, which involve one in eight employees at Broadcasting House, are the result of the BBC's decision to contract out those services. Yesterday's announcement means the BBC has called for more than 1,000 redundancies this week, after Tuesday's 720 job losses at its network television operation in west London. The BBC is cutting costs across all activities as part of the Funding the Future financial restructuring programme intended to save Pounds 75m a year by 1993. Yesterday's cuts will reduce Broadcasting House overheads by at least Pounds 1m a year. Those redundancies bring the total of jobs lost as a result of Funding the Future to 2,818. The job cuts at Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International are among the printing workers who produce its national newspapers, including The Sun and The Times. Most of the job losses will be at Wapping, its main newspaper production plant in east London. The company also plans to shed 56 staff at its regional printing plants in Glasgow and near Liverpool. The redundancies follow News International's decision to restructure printing operations by changing shift patterns. They also form part of general cost-cutting after the completion of Mr Murdoch's Dollars 7.4bn (Pounds 4.4bn) debt restructuring measures. Century Newspapers of Belfast, publishers of the News Letter, the UK's oldest morning newspaper, is to cut 45 jobs at the end of the month, nearly a fifth of its workforce.</p>

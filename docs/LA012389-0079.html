			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Procter &amp; Gamble Co. announced that it plans to remove palm oil from  Crisco, its vegetable-based shortening product. The National Heart Savers Assn.  of Omaha, Neb., which has been pressuring food manufacturers to alter product  ingredients, applauded Procter &amp; Gamble's announcement. P&amp;G officials  said Crisco is made mainly from soybean oil, with palm oil added for stability  and baking performance. The new palm oil-free version is to be sold later this  year as supplies of the special grade of vegetable oil needed to meet Crisco's  standards become available, company officials said. The new Crisco, like the  current product, will be all-vegetable and contain no cholesterol.  </P></p>

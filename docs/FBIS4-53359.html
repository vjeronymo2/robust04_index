			<p>BFN     [Text] In addition to multifaceted diplomatic efforts for  the resolution of North Korea's nuclear issue, the ROK and the  United States are strengthening their military preparedness by  increasing their combined defense capabilities in preparation  against the possibility of North Korea's armed provocation  against the South. In particular, it has been confirmed that the  armed forces of the ROK and the United States have been able to  pinpoint the location of about 2,300 multiple-barrelled rocket  launchers North Korea has deployed underground along the  ceasefire line, and that they have secured new shells which can  destroy such launchers.    On 17 May one high-level military official in the government  said: "We have stockpiled special shells, including laser-beam  guided missiles, which can neutralize North Korea's underground  gun batteries which pose a big threat to Seoul and its  vicinity." He continued to say that such new shells are capable  of destroying concrete walls that are more than two meters thick.    This official added: "The U.S. Armed Forces are developing  higher accuracy equipment which can destroy such underground  batteries with improved accuracy. Existing equipment is  sufficient for keeping a check on North Korea's underground  batteries."    In the meantime, as far as diplomatic efforts are concerned,  the ROK and the United States have reportedly worked out a  step-by-step way of imposing sanctions in such a way as to  immediately refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN  Security Council if the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] reports that it is difficult to verify whether nuclear  material has been taken because of North Korea's replacement of  nuclear fuel rods.    If imposing sanctions against North Korea is impossible with  China's exercise of its veto power, an international joint  sanction between the ROK, the United States, and Japan may be  imposed. It has been learned that with a view to increasing the  efficiency of the sanctions, the ROK Government is devising a  way to have Russia join in the sanctions against North Korea.    As part of this strategy, the government will make efforts  to  see an adoption of a ROK-Russian joint statement or joint  declaration on the basis of the denuclearization of the Korean  Peninsula during President Kim Yong-sam's visit in Russia in  early June.    On 17 May, a high-level government official stressed: "If  there is a report from the IAEA team saying that it is  impossible to secure nuclear transparency because North Korea  has already replaced its nuclear fuel rods, referral of this  matter to the UN Security Council and following through on  procedures to impose sanctions will be inevitable."</p>

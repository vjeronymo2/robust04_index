			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Former Interior Minister Guillermo Capobianco said  Isaac Chavarria evidently financed the Revolutionary Left  Movement, MIR,'s political campaign. He explained that a MIR  committee was then in charge of collecting those funds.    Capobianco added, however, that he did not know about  Chavarria's illegal activities and Chavarria had introduced  himself as a prosperous businessman.    Capobianco requested that Gonzalo Torrico explain whether he  knew about Chavarria's illegal activities. The former minister  said Chavarria contributed money to the MIR New Majority  political campaign, but he does not know exactly when the  contribution was made. He added that Chavarria lent his planes  to former President Jaime Paz Zamora's campaign, during which  the photographs that have been creating commotion were taken.    Capobianco explained that he does not know how much  Chavarria  gave the campaign. He denied, however, receiving these funds  because they were handed to a committee of MIR members in charge  of receiving this sort of campaign contribution.    Capobianco pointed out that at the time, the MIR was fully  implementing the New Majority political program, but did not  count on the financial help of prosperous businessmen as  interested as we were, he said, in financially supporting them.  He added that at that time, Chavarria introduced himself as a  prosperous businessman dedicated to agricultural activities in  the Chiquitana region and offered to help in the implementation  work [words indistinct]. From then on, he said, facts are known  to a [word indistinct] committee and that he has nothing to do  with them.</p>

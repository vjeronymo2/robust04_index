			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: McKechnie slides to Pounds 10.5m as Australian recession hits sales TAXABLE PROFITS continued to slide at McKechnie, the West Midlands-based plastic components, specialist engineering and household products group. For the half year to January 31 1991 profit came to Pounds 10.5m, down from Pounds 12.7m, which itself was down some 27 per cent on the 1988-89 first half. Earnings per share for the latest period were 8.8p (10.5p). The interim dividend, however, is maintained at 5p. That reflected a degree of optimism about the prospects for the second half. Indeed, Mr Jim Butler, chairman, said not only that UK companies, even those in the sluggish automotive sector, were reporting 'steadier trading conditions' but also 'it is tempting to believe that the worst of the recession is over.' At the same time group companies in the US had growing order books. However, that was offset by continuing problems in Austral-asia. Recession in Australia led to lower demand and put pressure on margins during the first half. Exchange rate movements took Pounds 500,000 out of operating profits; those factors were the most significant in the decline of group profits. UK and US operations, helped by cost cutting and product improvement, managed to hold their earnings levels of 1989-90. Return on assets and on sales fell largely because of the acquisition of Engineered Custom Plastics in the US. That company had not been operating profitably but should be by the end of the year. Turnover dropped to Pounds 153.6m (Pounds 178.6m), partly because of the Australian experience. Just as important, however, was the re-positioning of the group, its greater concentration on plastics and specialist engineering, brought about by the sale of its UK metals operations, which had provided a quarter of operating profits. The impact of the sales will be spread over the whole year. During the second half turnover and profits again would be affected but interest charges would be lower. The sale of the metals companies - McKechnie Extruded Products, Worcester Parsons and Stelco - would realise Pounds 53m cash which was initially being used to strengthen the balance sheet. Gearing would be reduced to less than 10 per cent by the end of the financial year.</p>

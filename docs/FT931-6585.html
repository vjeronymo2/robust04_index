			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Small player looks for a chance to stay in the game: The man who is leading the buy-out attempt at Leyland Daf Vans MANAGING director Mr Allan Amey and five colleagues launching a management buy-out attempt today for Leyland Daf Vans in Birmingham know they must explain an apparent paradox to potential backers. Backers are certain to ask how such a small vanmaker could possibly be viable. There are 190 employees still working in the Birmingham plant who are subcontracted to Renault of France. They are developing the new van range which Renault and Daf had intended to launch jointly at a cost approaching Pounds 400m if Daf and its Leyland Daf subsidiary had not collapsed into receivership. Renault will move this Excel van project to France later this year for sale throughout Europe at projected volumes approaching 100,000 a year. The company envisaged by Mr Amey's management buy-out would have no access to this van range, and would seek to modernise the current Leyland Daf 200/400 van range, which has its origins in the British Leyland Sherpa van launched 20 years ago. Further, the buy-out company's sales activities would, initially at least, be confined mainly to the UK market, where Leyland Daf sold fewer than 14,000 vans last year. The new Daf company formed in the Netherlands and Belgium has already made plain that vans will not form part of its activities. So until alternative distribution arrangements could be made, an EC market which last year absorbed 7,000 Leyland Daf vans would be lost to the Birmingham production lines. Mr Amey, 46, who has run Leyland Daf Vans for the past three years, questions that being a small player should be seen as a problem. 'Big doesn't necessarily mean anything except the potential for big profit - or big losses. You've simply got to be the right size for your market,' he says. 'Excel is a massive project to design, develop and produce a completely new van. We won't do that, at least in the short term. 'Our customers want economic load-carrying capacity at a competitive price. We can provide that today. But instead of revolution, like the Excel, we can evolve the product perfectly satisfactorily.' He acknowledges that Ford and other vanmakers might seek to move in for the kill with a price war, but says the company is already well versed in fighting its corner. The breakeven level for the Birminghan operation is believed to have been about 14,000 units a year before the Daf takeover. Mr Amey says this can be cut sharply. The plan envisages an operation of such a size that the 'vast majority' of the remaining 1,200 workers would be retained. As for backers, Mr Amey gives a clear hint that short- termism is not on the agenda. 'We are intent on the long-term development of the product and processes, and the foundations necessary for them.' As for assumptions that little investment has been made at the Birmingham facilities in recent years, Mr Amey insists that this is not true. 'Millions have been spent in the past few years, particularly on the factory structure . . . in terms of facilities, there is the risk of confusing low technology with fitness of purpose.' With pledges of support also made at last week's Leyland Daf dealers' council, 'realistically, we think the vast body of the network will stay loyal and work with us to develop our market', Mr Amey insists. The management team - which includes finance director Mr Roger Cable, marketing director Mr Malcolm Jefferies, commercial operations director Mr Jim Parks, technical director Mr John Rae and manufacturing director Mr Tony Sergeant - has already held talks with local Department of Trade and Industry officials on whether the buy-out qualifies for regional selective assistance. Otherwise, Mr Amey said, 'the financial net is wide open'. He added: 'A number of financial institutions have already contacted us to say that 'when you're ready, come and talk to us'. We have to be cautious, though - we don't want anyone taking a 45 per cent stake on a three-year, sell-it-off basis.' He insists the business plan is predicated on a viable, stand-alone operation. 'But it would be wrong at any point to be blinkered. If an opportunity came along which it was felt might be in our best interest, then naturally we would explore it fully.'</p>

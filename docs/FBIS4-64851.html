			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Commission Approves Pignone Sale to </F> General Electric"]    [Text] Rome 6 May (ANSA) -- European Union antitrust  authorities have given the green light to sell Nuovo Pignone to  the American company General Electric, the European Commission  announced today.    Under the approved plan, public sector energy group ENI  [National Hydrocarbons Agency] will sell 69 percent of the  Florence-based engineering company to GE, retaining 20 percent  and making available an additional 11 percent of shares in a  public tender offer that GE is expected to take up.    When the deal is concluded, GE will thus hold four-fifths of  the capital, while ENI retains a fifth. Dresser and Ingersoll  Rand, which had held 12 percent each in the privatization plan  as originally outlined, and a group of banks holding another 20  percent, have thus effectively been excluded from the deal as  approved by EU anti-trust authorities.    GE's acquisition of Nuovo Pignone "raises no serious doubts"  that the sale is compatible with the common market, the  Commission said in its finding.    The new ownership scheme carries no monopolistic  implications  apart from the doubling of productive capacities in the sector  of heavy duty gas turbines, which will give the new company 25  percent of the market, the EU decided.    "A condition for the acceptance of GE's offer is that the  company has promised to adhere to a business plan for 1994-97  drawn up by them and approved by ENI," the Commission said.  "During that period, ENI will negotiate certain rights in  relation to actions taken to put into effect the business plan."    The details of the privatization scheme were first forwarded  to the commission on February 24, but the EU asked for  additional information in April before making its finding.    The deal brings as estimated 1.1 trillion lire into ENI's  accounts, of which 700 billion lire as cash and 400 billion as  debt transfers.    The main business consequence of the sale, the commission  wrote, lies in license accords. Nuovo Pignone, which has been  using GE technology to produce heavy duty gas turbines, will now  find itself competing with other turbine makers using GE  technology on license.    The question of what GE intends to do with Nuovo Pignone  facilities has been a source of conflict with labor unions and  local authorities since the deal to the American company was  approved in December.    In January, in response to fears of a `foreign takeover',  unions and Florence government officials obtained, via a  syndication pact inside the new ownership, veto rights for ENI  over the 4 year business plan.    Those fears were focused not so much on GE as on Dresser and  Ingersoll Rand, with concerns they might shift the balance of  ownership by selling their large share packages.</p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Caldera nears poll victory in Caracas A 77-year-old former head of state, Mr Rafael Caldera, yesterday proclaimed his victory in Venezuela's presidential elections before thousands of supporters as unofficial exit polls gave him a significant lead over his rivals. Mr Caldera, the pre-election favourite and candidate of a group of 17 parties, had secured between 30 and 35 per cent of the vote, according to television exit polls. His margin of advantage over his three rivals jostling for second place strongly suggested he would emerge as victor in the official count. Mr Claudio Fermn of the Democratic Action party, Mr Oswaldo Alvarez Paz of the Christian Democrat Copei party, and Mr Andres Velasquez of the left-wing Radical Cause party polled support in the low 20s per cent, according to most exit polls. Venezuelans also turned out in greater numbers than expected in the elections for a new president, Congress and 22 state assemblies. Estimates before the vote suggested as many as 35 to 40 per cent of voters would abstain. As the polling stations closed, there was no evidence of any disturbances that would disrupt the elections. The military said it uncovered last week a plot to derail the elections involving active and retired officers in the armed forces and civilians. If the results are confirmed, Mr Caldera will be 78 by the time he is scheduled to take office, February 2. He broke away this year from Copei, the party he helped found in 1946, to stand independently in the election. President from 1969-74, he first stood in presidential elections in 1947. He has vowed to reverse aspects of the economic reform programme introduced by the administration of President Carlos Andres Perez, who was ousted this year to allow his trial on corruption charges.</p>

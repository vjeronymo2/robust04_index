			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [SAPA PR wire service issued by the government spokesman] </F>   [Text] Media Statement by the Government Spokesman    Reaction by the State President, Mr F W de Klerk, to    the Attack Last Night on an Observatory    Restaurant    The state president has learned with shock and horror of the  attack last night on an Observatory restaurant in which four  people were killed.    The identity of those responsible for the attack is not yet  known. The state president has, however, given the assurance  that the South African Police will use all their resources to  track down the perpetrators and to bring them to justice.    The state president has emphasised that there can be no  justification whatsoever for this barbaric deed. The  representatives of the vast majority of South Africans have  reached agreements that will soon lead to our first inclusive  national elections and to the establishment of a truly  representative government of national unity. The attack last  night is evidently an attempt to destabilise this process.    The state president has called on all South Africans to  resist any attempt to force them to deviate from this course and  has urged them to stand united in their condemnation of violence.    He has conveyed his condolences to the family and friends of  those who lost their lives in this shocking attack.  Issued by the government spokesman Pretoria, 31 December 1993</p>

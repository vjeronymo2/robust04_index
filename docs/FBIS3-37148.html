			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Stepanakert, February 14 (SNARK) -- The reports  issued by TURAN NEWS AGENCY caused at least a surprise -- to the  great surprise of Levon Melik-Shakhnazaryan, a parliamentary of  the Karabakh Supreme Soviet, a Chairman of the Permanent  Commission on External Relations, [who] according to these  reports participated in a alleged meeting of the social and  political leaders of Armenia with the representative of the Kurd  Labour Party [Kurdish Workers Party, PKK] Zahir Bardani. TURAN  says the meeting took place in Echmiadzin (Armenia) at the end  of 1993.    "It was for the first time when I knew about such a meeting  and my participation in it from TURAN reports issued on February  12", Mr. Melik-Shakhnazaryan told SNARK.    The report mentions that the result of the as if [i.e.  supposed] meeting was the as if partial move of the PKK  Headquarters from Turkey to Armenia and the appearance of 600  Kurd mercenaries within the Armenian detachments fighting in  Azerbaijan.    "Official Baku is for numerous times trying to play the  `Kurd  game' to justify his unprecedented military failures at the  Karabakh fronts", Mr. Melik-Shakhnazaryan underlined. According  to him, the Azerbaijani authorities sometimes announce the  Lachinskiy, Kubatlinskiy and Kelbadzharskiy regions which are  under the control of Karabakh forces to be "Kurd lands",  sometimes accuse Armenians of the cooperation with Kurds. The  fact that the Echmiadzin town was elected by them as a place of  the as if meeting is not occasional, Levon Melik-Shakhnazaryan  considers. It's known, the Echmiadzin town is the center of the  Armenians' spiritual life. So, Azeris make their provocation  report the religious coloring.    Nevertheless, such statements are of the aim to justify the  Afghan mujahedeens' participation in clashes against Armenians,  the Azerbaijani Army's training of military instructors from  Turkey, the USA and some states of the CIS. But such statement  can't mislead the world community.</p>

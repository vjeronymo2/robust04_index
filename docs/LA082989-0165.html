Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> HERNANDEZ TO MISS REST OF SEASON  </P> <P> Detroit Tigers pitcher Guillermo Hernandez will miss the last weeks of the  season because of a muscle tear in his elbow that could require surgery. The  injury, where the forearm muscles meet the elbow, has limited Hernandez to  pitching only eight times in the last 2 1/2 months. The Tigers' team doctor,  Clarence Livingood, said Monday that Hernandez will be evaluated in two weeks  to see if surgery is needed.  </P></p>

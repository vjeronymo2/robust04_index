			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / New effort to agree global pact TRADE officials are to make a fresh attempt to negotiate a Multilateral Steel Agreement to eliminate trade barriers and phase out most subsidies. After a two-day meeting this week, the officials agreed to meet again in late March or early April to consider a revised text. The officials said that there seemed to be a genuine will among the 30 or so participants to reach an accord, following the breakdown of talks last March, but that many delegations had no mandate to negotiate. 'Perhaps by the next meeting Washington will have got its act together,' said one official, referring to the lack of policy guidance to US negotiators from the still incomplete Clinton trade team. The MSA, originally intended to govern world steel trade after the expiry of 'voluntary' export restraints to the US market last March, came to grief a year ago over permissible subsidies and US anti-dumping and anti-subsidy actions. Since then the discussions have been further complicated by swingeing US anti-dumping and countervailing duties recently imposed on steel imports from most foreign suppliers. Yesterday, US officials held bilateral meetings with the EC and Brazil under the Gatt disputes procedure.</p>

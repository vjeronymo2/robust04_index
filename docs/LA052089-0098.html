			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'IT COULDN'T BE BETTER,' SAY RELAXED, PLEASED COMMUTERS ON TROLLEY'S NEW EAST  LINE  </P> <P> Penny Wilcox, who lives in El Cajon, boarded the San Diego Trolley at 6:49  Friday morning. Exactly 34 minutes, 16 seconds after leaving the Spring Street  station in La Mesa, the end of the new East Line Extension, the car arrived at  the Gaslamp Quarter stop near 6th Avenue downtown.  </P> <P> For Wilcox, a Pacific Bell employee who used to spend $65 a month on parking  and always took El Cajon Boulevard because she loathed the freeway, the $1.25  ride was a chance to rave.  </P> <P> "I think it's great!" she said. "It saves me all of that money on parking, plus  gas, wear and tear on the car, plus nerves. It's a wonderful way to get to  work."  </P> <P> Friday marked Wilcox's first ride on the trolley, which began full service on  the new leg of the East Line Extension Monday. She was persuaded to take the  fire-engine-red trolley by her buddy and co-worker, Jim Tomlinson, who drove  her to the station, which is 15 minutes from her home.  </P> <P> "I used to take the bus," Tomlinson said. "One day, three different buses  overheated. The trolley is so much better than the bus, you can't believe it,  man. The bus might get you there in the same amount of time, but the trolley is  cooler and cleaner, and you don't have to fight wall-to-wall people."  </P> <P> That may have been the most surprising facet of the Friday commute. Trolley  cars leaving La Mesa between 7 and 11 in the morning were far from sold out --  more like half full. But, by the time the trolley arrived downtown, stopping at  stations along the way, few seats were left. The parking lot outside the Spring  Street station offered plenty of spaces at 6:45 a.m. and wasn't full at 11.  </P> <P> Trolley officials offer a different story, however. Heather Kunz, a spokeswoman  </P> <P> for the Metropolitan Transit Development Board, said the 150-space Spring  Street parking lot "is almost always filled to capacity, with 20 to 30 people  parking illegally throughout the day.  </P> <P> "We don't have figures for the total number of customers yet, but we've had to  add extra trains on the run to La Mesa. We're taking an estimated 200 riders  per (trolley car) at rush hour. We're calling rush hour 6:30 to 9 in the  morning, 3:30 to 6 in the evenings."  </P> <P> Friday's customers said morning rush hour had been quiet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Want to Keep It Secret  </P> <P> "It's been this way, and I hope it stays this way," said Bill Lemen(, an  SDG&amp;E engineer who boarded in La Mesa. "It's a secret we should try to  keep. I used to drive 45 minutes into work from my home in Jamul. Now, I drive  11 miles to the Spring Street station, 15 minutes or so, and take it right in.  I'm free of the hassle. I read and relax and look at people on the freeway,  fighting the traffic. I love it."  </P> <P> Lemen's office is two blocks from the trolley stop. Before, he had to walk 15  minutes from a parking lot to the SDG&amp;E building. His one complaint is that  the rate for a monthly pass will jump at the end of the month from $40 to $45.  </P> <P> Sandra Sotelo, a legal secretary who works for the state, boarded the trolley  at Massachusetts Avenue in Lemon Grove, one of four new stops that snake beyond  Euclid Avenue in Southeast San Diego to Spring Street. The others are Encanto  62nd Street and Broadway in Lemon Grove. By June 25, service will extend to  four more stops, the last at Main and Marshall in El Cajon. Early in the next  decade, service will expand into Lakeside, Santee and also north, toward Del  Mar.  </P> <P> Like those around her, Sotelo was bullish on the trolley, for not having to  hassle with traffic and pay for parking. She offered another, more subtle  reason -- the "meditative" ride it gives her.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Chance to Think  </P> <P> Granted, the scenery along San Diego's Southeast corridor isn't the best, but  it "gives me the opportunity to think," she said, "to get my mind together, to  frame the day. I think it helps me at work, makes me a better employee."  </P> <P> Byron Frohn, a draftsman for the city of San Diego Planning Department, is no  stranger to riding buses. Frohn said he spent more time getting to and from  work via the trolley, but that the pleasure of a trolley ride was "boundless"  contrasted with stuffy stop and go of the city's bus system.  </P> <P> "I just love to look out the window and think about things," he said. "The ride  is calm and efficient and a lot better than driving or busing."  </P> <P> A co-worker and friend, Leo DeJesus, who works in Frohn's department, got on at  the Encanto 62nd Street station. DeJesus said he had been paying $8 a day in  parking and that "more than once" the money he had placed in the proper slot  had been pilfered. So, he would lose $8 and have to pay a parking ticket as  well.  </P> <P> "The trolley helps a lot," he said. "I'm saving at least $40 a week."  </P> <P> Bernetta Puryear(, a preschool teacher who boards at the Euclid station, said  she has made "lots of new friends" and met "lots of nice people" by riding the  rails. She, too, is a veteran of the bus.  </P> <P> "You can't believe how much more comfortable the ride is on this thing," she  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vampire Lovers, Too  </P> <P> Not everyone comes across as someone you'd want to meet, however. One gangly  fellow boarded the trolley near downtown and accosted two passengers who were  reading newspapers.  </P> <P> "Can I see your movie section?" he bellowed. "I want to see where that new  vampire movie is playing. I love vampire movies."  </P> <P> After finding out the dozen or so locations where "Fright Night: Part II" was  playing, he let them know that his favorite vampire "of all time" was Bela  Lugosi, whom he proceeded to imitate. Finding the audience unreceptive, he got  off at the next stop.  </P> <P> Penny Wilcox said she will happily endure benign vampire aficionados for the  grim anxieties of motoring to work each day. She once had an engine catch on  fire on the freeway, and another of her cars broke down in some sleazy  neighborhood she would just as soon forget.  </P> <P> "I was gone no more than a half-hour, to call for help," she said. "I get back,  and they've stripped my car! They've finished! They took everything that wasn't  nailed down. No sir, I'll take the trolley and get to work relaxed -- and in  one piece, thank you. Based on a first time, I'd say this couldn't be better."  </P></p>

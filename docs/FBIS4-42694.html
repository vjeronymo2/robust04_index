			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPEAN REPORT: </F> "Biotechnology: Communication Outlines Two-Pronged Growth  Programme"]    [Text] Environmentalists have reacted angrily to the  preparation of the soon-to-be released European Commission  Communication on the deregulation of biotechnology legislation.  The Communication is to be presented by the Commission at the  Heads of Government Summit in Corfu on 23, 24 June. It outlines  what the Commission believes should be done "in order that the  full potential of modern biotechnology for jobs, investment and  growth can be realised." But environmental groups, such as  Greenpeace International, are afraid the Communication might  become part of EU policy before any proper examination of the  risks of associated with the easing of controls over  genetically-modified organisms (GMOs).    The Commission's White Paper of Growth, Competitiveness, and  Employment pinpointed biotechnology as one of the fields  offering the greatest potential for innovation and growth in the  EU. To help the industry, the white paper concluded there  should be a review of the EU's biotechnology regulatory  framework. That review concluded that the risks involved in the  use of GMOs when the EU's regulations were developed are  "substantially less than were once foreseen." For example, the  potential for horizontal gene transfer resulting in novel and  harmful properties being acquired by micro-organisms has not  been shown to present hazards to human heath and the  environment. "There is growing confidence that the GMOs used in  research and in industrial production can be more precisely  categorised, so that they are unable to survive except in the  special environment of the experiment or process in which they  are used," the Communication says. It adds that bearing in mind  its findings during the review, the Commission had developed a  twin-track approach to the future development of the  biotechnological regulatory framework, covering:     -  The  exploitation of existing possibilities for revising  measures/procedures/degree of oversight/requirements, through  use of a "light" procedure of adaptation to technical progress  (via the regulatory Committee procedure); and    -  The bringing  forward of amendments to existing legislation in order to  incorporate changes which cannot be achieved by technical  adaptation while leaving the basic structure of the framework  intact.     Put simply, the Commission wants to ease the current  legislation. The particular Directives concerned are 90/219/EEC  on the contained use of genetically-modified organisms and  90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of GMOs to the environment.  For Directive N 90/220 the Communication outlines the following  objectives for further action:    i) streamlining and easing of the  administrative/notification/consent requirements where this does  not compromise safety;    ii) ensuring that the classification of the  genetically-modified micro-organisms and of the activities in  which they are used are appropriate to the risks involved;    iii) ensuring that the conditions of use are appropriate to  the risks involved;    iv) extension of the flexibility of the Directive so it can  be more easily adapted to technical progress by regulatory  Committee procedure.    In line with these objectives, this will mean that it will  continue to make full use of the inherent flexibility of the  Directive with the help of a regulatory committee, i.e.  by:     -  Preparing a Decision redefining the risk categories of  GMOs through the revision of Annex II;    -  Revising the guidelines  for classification as established under Article 4.2 of the  Directive as a result of the discussion undertaken for amending  the criteria of Annex II;    -  Further exploiting the need to adapt  safety assessment parameters, containment measures and required  information for technical progress.     The evidence and experience also indicate that the  functioning of the Directive could be further improved, mainly  by refocusing administrative procedures on activities presenting  a risk to human health and the environment. This can only be  achieved by proposing a number of amendments, since the  Directive does not provide for such adaptations. Amendments  will therefore be prepared, aimed at:     -  Replacing the consent  requirements by record-keeping, or notification for information  purposes, for certain low-risk activities;    -  Replacing the  explicit consent requirements by implicit consent for certain  higher-risk activities;    -  Reduction of time periods involved in  implicit/explicit consent procedures;    -  Adapting the present risk  classification system for GMOs, in accordance with new safety  considerations;    -  Removal of the differentiation between  activities in research laboratories and production plants.     In order to increase flexibility, the Commission will  propose  the possibility of adapting the definitions contained within the  scope of the Directive via a Committee procedure, as is, for  example, at present foreseen in the case of pharmaceutical  legislation.    The Commission will make these proposals before the European  Council to be held in Essen in December 1994, and will undertake  broad consultation with Member State authorities and interest  groups before doing so, the Communication says.    As for Directive N 90/220, the Communication says the  Commission has already made a number of technical changes  reflecting the evidence acquired from the wide number of GMO  releases in the plant area which were not shown to pose any  specific risks. But on the "improvements" to the Directive  which the Commission deems necessary, it has not drawn up its  proposals because it says "further experience is necessary in  order to determine the right balance between the need for  safety, public reassurance, and the minimum restraint on  industry and research work."    The Communication also outlines other aspects of the  Commission's programme to assist the growth of the biotechnology  industry. These include strengthening the scientific advice  available to the Commission; coordinating research and  development programmes between Member States; undertaking  Community initiatives and supporting small- and medium-sized  businesses; improving the investment climate and raising public  awareness of new technology.</p>

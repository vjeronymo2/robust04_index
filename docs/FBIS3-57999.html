With a view to Germany taking on the presidency itself in six  months, he announced today that there would be "constructive  collaboration."    "This year, 1994, the EU is facing a new stage of European  integration and enormous tasks, in view of profound upheavals in  world politics and global economic challenges," Kinkel said.  Particular attention must be paid to securing Europe as an  investment location. It is also important to deepen relations  between the EU and the states of Central and East Europe, and to  support the reform process in Russia. Relations with the  Asiatic region and the southern African states also have to be  strengthened.    Negotiations with the EFTA [European Free Trade Association]  states (Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Austria) on expansion must  be concluded by 1 March in order to allow these countries to  join on 1 January 1995. In addition, cooperation has to be  improved between the 12 EU states, particularly in the area of  asylum law, Kinkel said.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Italian Treasury alarmed at plans for spending THE Italian Treasury yesterday sought to prevent the imminent dissolution of parliament and spring elections becoming an excuse for the political parties to increase government spending, writes Robert Graham in Rome. Alarmed by a flood of laws being pushed through the legislature to satisfy special interest groups against the prospect of an April general election, the Treasury yesterday requested parliament to block all financial provisions currently going through the chamber. The request also underlined Treasury anxiety about over-runs in spending targets in the 1991 budget and the bunching of expenditure at the beginning of the new financial year. A government spokesman said: 'It is natural at the end of the legislature that a larger number of financial provisions tend to be tabled. Some provisions are correct and will inevitably be passed but there are others which clearly go against the need to hold down public spending.' He added: 'If these steps are not taken the budget is undermined, making subsequent adjustments necessary.' Police confiscated 4m litres of wine in northern Italy yesterday and arrested four men in an alleged new doctoring scandal, Reuter reports from Milan. Para-military police said the wine had probably been laced with toxic substances in five cellars near the northern towns of Vicenza and Padova. Italy, one of the world's largest wine exporters, was badly hit by a scandal six years ago in which 23 people were killed by adulterated wine.</p>

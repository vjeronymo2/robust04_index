			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> LIMELIGHT: The Rev. Louis Sheldon, Anaheim's "traditional values" crusader, is  being shadowed by a CBS News crew this week as he lobbies in Sacramento. . . .  He'll be included in a "48 Hours" program in June examining gay rights and its  opponents. . . . "48 Hours" is a step up from the clamor of his recent  "Donahue" appearance, Sheldon says. This time, he promises, "you'll see the  real Lou Sheldon." Kris Lindgren and Dean Takahashi  </P></p>

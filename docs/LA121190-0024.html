			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELEASE OF HOSTAGES  </P> <P> Richard Goodwin's column "The Shirking Cowards of Capitol Hill" (Column Left,  Commentary, Dec. 5) is right on! He chastises Congress for not doing its  constitutional duty in making the decision about war. This is the most  important point of the entire Iraq-Kuwait affair. His article should be  required reading for every voter.  </P> <P> TOM KILLGROVE, Frazier Park  </P></p>

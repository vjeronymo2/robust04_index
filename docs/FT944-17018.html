			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / ScotRail tries to win back travellers ScotRail, which operates most passenger trains in Scotland, yesterday launched a series of marketing initiatives aimed at replacing revenue lost because of the signalworkers' dispute. Mr Chris Green, former managing director of InterCity who became managing director of ScotRail in April, said the company's revenue from fares was down by Pounds 8m because of the 18 days of strikes in the past three months. It also lost passengers because of disruption in the Haymarket area of Edinburgh owing to a major signalling fault that took Railtrack three months to repair. The fault caused punctuality on services from Edinburgh to Glasgow and Fife to plummet but they have now recovered. To win back lost passengers ScotRail has not had its usual autumn fares increase. It is promoting a two-for-one offer running until the end of November under which applicants obtain a free voucher for a second person if they pay for one ticket for travel anywhere in Scotland. ScotRail has launched an executive ticket to promote first class accommodation on services linking Aberdeen with Edinburgh and Glasgow. The return ticket costs Pounds 49 instead of Pounds 96. Eight other promotions are planned to boost train travel in the winter months. Mr Green said the promotions would cost Pounds 250,000 but should bring extra passengers on trains which were running anyway and incurring fixed costs. He said ScotRail was 'more or less on schedule' with its preparations for the selling of its franchise by the government, which should take place late next year.</p>

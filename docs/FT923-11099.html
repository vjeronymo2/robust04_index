			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (3): How the bank governor controls economic policy - Don Brash is interviewed by Andrew Adonis NEW ZEALAND has achieved what Britain's economics establishment can only dream of: an independent central bank, free of month-to-month interference from politicians, with but one prime objective, to conquer inflation for good. The publicly-a vowed objective of New Zealand's Reserve Bank could not be clearer: '(to) formulate and implement monetary policy with the intention of achieving a stable general level of prices by the year ending December 1993 and maintaining price stability beyond that date'. Price stability is defined as an annual rate of increase in the consumer price index of between zero and 2 per cent. The target is almost certain to be met. Inflation is currently at just over 1 per cent, down from 12 per cent five years ago. It could be virtually zero in a year's time. Until the Reserve Bank Act of 1989, New Zealand's monetary policy was directed by its Treasury, with the Reserve Bank largely subservient. The decision to grant the bank independence was political: with an inflation record for the previous 20 years far worse than the average for leading OECD countries, the then Labour government determined to attack the hydra once and for all. The remedy was of a piece with wider reforms to the New Zealand public service, much of which is now hived off into quasi-independent state enterprises. Even senior officials in what remains of government departments are now on individual short-term contracts. 'There are two broad propositions behind what we have done,' says Dr Don Brash, the Reserve Bank's urbane but cautious governor. 'First, that central banks independent of the government are better at achieving price stability, and can achieve it at lower social and economic cost; but second, that governments of any persuasion are going to be very reluctant to hand over total control to a central bank.' Dr Brash now possesses as much effective control of economic policy as Ms Ruth Richardson, the finance minister, and his profile in the financial world is higher than anyone's but hers.  Nonetheless, total control has not been given to the Reserve Bank: the new regime has been carefully crafted to retain a political long-stop should it be needed. In vision and detail it owes much to Professor Charles Goodhart of the London School of Economics. Thus the Reserve Bank Act is a part of New Zealand's ordinary law: it has no special constitutional status, and could be repealed by a simple majority in parliament tomorrow. Even without repeal, a government could quickly undermine it - by using its statutory power to issue instructions to the bank, or by seeking to rewrite the inflation targets set out in the written agreement between the finance minister and the governor. And since the governor is, in effect, appointed by the minister, a determined government could secure a compliant governor before long. The independence of the Reserve Bank accordingly rests on two essential pillars: its own reputation and credibility, which the 1989 act supports but does not guarantee; and the almost complete political consensus behind the maintenance of price stability. The 1989 act was passed by the Labour government, which had already appointed Dr Brash, a former National party candidate, to the governorship. But it was supported by Ms Richardson in opposition; and when she took office at the end of 1990 only one target was changed: 0 to 2 per cent inflation was to be achieved by 1993, not 1992, a change with which Dr Brash was entirely happy, given the looming uncertainty of the Gulf War. Dr Brash is very much a politicians' banker, preaching the message of price stability at countless lunches and dinners with a slick PR machine in tow. 'If we don't carry broad public consent for what we are doing, the bank's independence will come under acute strain - whatever the legislation says,' he says. The bank's half-yearly monetary policy statement, issued earlier this month - just before the budget, to warn of the dangers of loosening up on fiscal policy - concentrates on refuting claims that throttling inflation is slowing recovery. Not all are convinced, but voices like that of Mr Len Baylis, a consultant who argues that the single-minded assault on inflation has deepened the recession, are surprisingly few. Given the political wind behind him, Dr Brash's job is largely to act as the politicians' conscience. In its last budget before the 1990 election, Labour increased spending and added significantly to borrowing: the bank responded with a hike in interest rates. 'The great virtue of the new system is transparency,' says Dr Brash, recalling that shortly after, the New Zealand Herald ran a leader arguing that New Zealanders now realised that governments could not win elections by unjustified loosening of fiscal policy, since the Reserve Bank would simply send them the bill in higher interest rates. Dr Brash's term comes up for renewal just before next year's elections. He is too much of a politician to speculate on the future. But he is an easy target if recovery does not materialise; and a prize exhibit if it does.</p>

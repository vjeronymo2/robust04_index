			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SPOTS: A WALK IN TREEPEOPLE'S ORGANIC GARDEN OF DELIGHTS  </P> <P> Sunday at 11 a.m., the TreePeople people will offer a free tour of their  42-acre site. Set in the middle of Coldwater Canyon Park, TreePeople's  hourlong, weekly tours are geared to appeal to visitors of all ages.  </P> <P> Visitors will be taken on a tour of the organic garden, where volunteers will  talk about how they keep the bugs and other garden pests away (nets for snails,  herbs with odors bugs don't cotton to, mulching with wood chips). The penned-up  chickens and opossum usually are a draw for youngsters.  </P> <P> TreePeople is an environmental problem-solving group that works on creating  solutions to ecological problems in Southern California. The group has  championed drought- and smog-tolerant gardening as well as emphasizing the  importance of trees in an overall clean-air policy.  </P> <P> TreePeople hosts tours for 50,000 schoolchildren a year as part of its  educational program. Whether on a classroom field trip or a Sunday walkabout  with their parents, children are quick studies when it comes to the importance  of water conservation and recycling.  </P> <P> After the walk, families may shop in the group's nursery of drought- and  smog-tolerant plants or continue their outing on the many trails of the  surrounding park. Picnicking here is pretty much limited to wide spots along  the trails.  </P> <P> TreePeople is at 12601 Mulholland Drive, Los Angeles. Information: (213)  273-8733.  </P></p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Personal View: High bond yields: too good to be true Hindsight gives commentators an-swers to yesterday's conundrums, but it has been remarkably silent as to why bond markets have fallen this year. Do the resulting high real yields foretell inflation? Do they reflect a shortage of capital? Or have the activities of hedge funds created a technical distortion? A dip into the history books suggests that the markets demand a premium to lend to countries which they feel might default. Such a premium has not been widely required since the 1920s and 1930s. If it is needed today, it is because western governments are running deficits that have built up unprecedentedly high absolute levels of debt. These levels continue to rise in most countries. The capital flows which will fund such debt levels are now international, seeking out the best return. Countries with unattractive credit credentials find it hard to attract money; they can no longer rely on the inertia of local investors who know no better, or who have been bribed by fiscal incentives. The real yields now on offer may, though, prove completely unsustainable to service. Yet even at current levels, they are still not high enough to protect investors from the adverse currency movements that can occur. Investing in some of these countries is unattractive on any yield basis. Japanese investors have been learning that for the last decade and are, late in the day, voting with their feet and refusing to buy those countries' bonds. It is instructive to see from the precedent of the 1920s how dangerous a situation is thus created. Then it was the dollar surplus that dominated the capital flows and, uniquely, the dollar's freedom of movement around the world at that time compares with today's. Any US investor who had obligingly lent other nations' governments his dollars in 1918 had by 1930 lost all his money in six leading currencies, including the D-Mark. He had also lost 86 per cent of his currency investment in France, 93 per cent in Portugal, 70 per cent in Italy and 50 per cent in Spain. The exchange rate had held its own only in the Nordic currencies, sterling, the Swiss franc, the Dutch guilder and - incredibly in the light of postwar experience - the Argentine peso. So it is hardly surprising that, by the early 1930s, real yields on bonds were as high as they are today. The ingredients in today's high bond yields are slightly different - but only slightly. Deflationary pressures have not led to falling retail prices as they did then, thus guaranteeing high real yields whatever the nominal rate. Against this, two factors are worse today. The first is the absolute burden of debt. The other is that nominal yields are much higher. In the worst of the 1930s, UK government stocks never yielded more than 6.1 per cent. If inflation were to disappear today, the cost of servicing bonds at present rates could destroy even sound finances. One consequence of the 1920s was that governments stopped spending. John Maynard Keynes, the economist, famously pointed out that, when citizens are frightened to spend and corporations cannot spend, governments have a duty to spend. Today we gaze in wonder at the naivety of the governments of the time in struggling to balance their books in the teeth of de-flation. Seen in context, though, it was arguably the only thing to do. The 1920s taught a harsh lesson: take the single example of Portugal in 1919 and 1920. Its government ran a deficit of about 15 per cent of gross national product in each of those years. The money supply went from Es273m to Es611m, and the exchange rate against the pound from 7 to 36.6. This was not inflation - exactly the opposite. In real terms, less money was circulating, as is always the case when a currency collapses. This can easily be seen in Russia today. When markets go on strike, government spending stops. As recently as 1976 in the UK, the International Monetary Fund halted the spending programme of a socialist Labour government. Between the wars, it took the destruction of most of the world's currencies to persuade governments to stop spending. The moral is deeply deflationary. The bond markets will be as wonderful as they were in the 15 years from 1920 for countries whose currency survives. For others, however, the promise to deliver on real yields that have recently been as high as 9 per cent (the going rate in Sweden, Canada, Italy and Australia) for decades to come will be like the cheque for Pounds 2m given by a drunken reveller to the carol singers: too good to be true.

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (7): Financiers favour the hands-on approach - How to stage a buy-out / Charles Batchelor offers guidance on the once-in-a-career exercise Attempting to buy your business at the same time as you are running the company makes for a demanding and exhausting time. Managers who stage a management buy-out can expect an apparently unending round of meetings and presentations, as they attempt to convince financiers that they are worth backing. They may not even have the certainty that their employer is willing to sell the business to its management. And, while they are preparing their own offer, they may also be required to show other potential bidders round. Since most managers only carry out one buy-out during their career, everything will be new to them. Managers responsible for running small divisions and subsidiaries may find themselves considering strategic and financial problems which have previously been dealt with by head office. Fortunately, as buy-outs have become a more accepted part of the commercial world, there is no shortage of advisers who specialise in this area. But the problem then arises of choosing the most suitable accountant, lawyer or venture capitalist without running up large bills. The first issue that has to be resolved is whether the business is up for sale. Some group managements are opposed to buy-outs on principle - they believe the buy-out team is in too privileged position in any negotiations. It is not unknown for managers who suggest a buy-out to be told to clear their desks. Finding out if head office is ready to consider a sale can best be done by making an anonymous approach through an accountant or other business adviser. He, or she, should also be able to give an honest assessment of whether the business is suitable for a buy-out. Financiers tend to like stable businesses in traditional sectors, with strongly positive cash flows to pay off the debt. They are less attracted to high-technology businesses with uncertain prospects in rapidly changing markets. Advisers should be chosen for their experience in dealing with your type of business. Some venture capitalists specialise in particular sectors, but more commonly they differentiate themselves by the size of deal they back. Some are only interested in the larger transactions of Pounds 10m value or more. Others are quite happy to spend time on smaller deals. Increasingly, on the larger deals, the venture capitalists have been taking a lead role, putting a deal together and only then approaching management to take part. It is important that the managers feel they can get on with their advisers on a personal level, because they can expect to spend many hours in meetings. Professional advisers can act as a buffer between the managers and the vendor during negotiations. Many managers find it difficult adopt a dispassionate stance when dealing with the boss with whom they have worked for many years. They feel uneasy about pointing out the weaknesses of a business which they have been responsible for running. A crucial document in the buy-out process is the business plan. Accountants can help to draw these up, but it is no use presenting a plan which has come out of someone else's computer. It must clearly be the work of the managers themselves. Many venture capitalists are deluged with business plans, so it is important to keep it short and to the point. Over-elaborate plans, running into hundreds of pages, are unlikely to be read. Venture capitalists complain of business plans which calculate large numbers of future scenarios down to the last decimal point, but which neglect to include essential information about the business or the management team. The plan should contain a short executive summary, probably no more than two pages, and put the detailed financial calculations into separate appendices. The body of the plan should describe the background and recent history of the business; its products or services; and its markets and marketing strategy. The quality of the managers and their ability to work together as a team will be vital to the success of the buy-out, so detailed profiles of the management will be needed. On the financial side, there should be summaries of past and projected profit-and-loss accounts, balance sheets and cash flows. In terms of management, the venture capitalist will be looking for a strong team leader with support from managers with a good mix of other skills. Marketing, production and financial expertise will normally be required. If anotherwise strong team lacks skills in a particular area, the venture capitalist may well suggest bringing in an outsider to fill the gap. The financiers will be looking for a management that can take a hands-on approach to the problems, which are bound to arise once the business is independent. Managers who have grown too used to the support services provided by a large corporate headquarters may not do as well once they are on their own. Managers can expect to be called on to tackle a broader range of problems in a smaller, independent business. Fund-raising involves a balancing act. The business must not be saddled with an impossible burden of debt at the outset. At the same time, there must be enough money to see the company through the early years without the need for a refinancing. The banks have become more cautious in their approach to buy-outs, and will not back plans requiring an unrealistic amount of debt. Set against the total amounts which will be needed to finance a deal, the sums provided by management appear small. Individual managers can typically expect to be asked to provide between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 50,000 of their own money. The point is that, for many managers, this represents a considerable financial commitment. It is enough to motivate them to work hard, but not too much so that they feel under excessive pressure. Curious as it may seem, at the point when they are negotiating their independence, managers need to be thinking about how they might dispose of their business. Their financial backers will be looking for an 'exit', either by means of a trade sale or a flotation, after a few years. If the business does very well, the managers may be able to refinance the deal and buy out their backers, thus retaining full control themselves. But more likely outcomes are a stock market listing or a sale. Managers must be prepared for the loss or limitation of their independence. But set against this is the prospect of considerable personal wealth if the business does well.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  LISTED AND UNLISTED MBOs OVER POUNDS 10M  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Number                     Value Dollars m               Total      Listed       %      Total      Listed       %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1981-84          25           1       4        857         310      36 1985             23           2       9        869          70       8 1986             27           2       7        939          30       3 1987             33           4      12      2,753         480      17 1988             55           6      11      4,508         940      21 1989             71          12      17      5,851       3,780      65 1990             59           4       7      2,038         170       8 1991             44           1       2      1,880          20       1 1992             55           1       2      2,319          10       0 1993 (to date)   33           0       0      1,631           0       0 Total           425          33       8     23,645       5,810      25  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: KPMG Corporate Finance  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------            ESTIMATE OF TOTAL UK MBOs  --------------------------------------------------                                      Average                           Value         size             Number   (Pounds m)   (Pounds m)  -------------------------------------------------- 1980           100           40          0.4 1981           180          130          0.7 1982           200          550          2.8 1983           220          240          1.1 1984           200          270          1.4  -------------------------------------------------- 1985           250        1,070          4.3 1986           300        1,300          4.3 1987           350        3,230          9.2 1988           400        5,070         12.7 1989           500        6,490         13.0  -------------------------------------------------- 1990           550        2,840          5.2 1991           500        2,600          5.2 1992           520        3,040          5.8 1993   (to date)    390        2,190          5.6  -------------------------------------------------- TOTAL        4,660       29,060          6.2  -------------------------------------------------- Source: KPMG Corporate Finance  --------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Larger management buy-outs 1988/1993 (total funding Pounds m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds m 1988                         1989  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 0 - 25   Kirklees Chemicals (10)      Busways (10)          Radstone Tech (10)           Citytab (10)          Celebrity CP (10)            Rosenthal (10)          National Express (10)        Fine Art Wallcoverings (10)          Lowfield (11)                *Range Valley (11)          Burlington Int (12)          *Abacus (11)          Motor World (13)             Seckers Silks (11)          *Burn Stewart (13)           Coin Industries (11)          AMG Inds (13)                *Maison Caurette (11)          Harrap Publishing (13)       Lancashire Enterprises (11)          *Autoclenz (13)              *Haigh Castle (12)          *Clairmont (14)              Golden West Foods (13)          Grand Transport Systems (14) *Severn (13)          Lowndes Lambert (16)         Tallent Eng (13)          Grampian CF (18)             Horlicks Farms &amp; Dairies (13)          Peerless (18)                *Valor Stoves (14)          Maccess II (18)              *Country Casuals (14)          ABI Caravans (20)            Country Holidays (14)          John Perring (21)            BREL (14)          Welland Homes (21)           Eurovein (14)          Travellers Fare (21)         *Hill Leigh (15)          Meteor (22)                  *British Air Ferries (15)          Yorkshire Rider (23)         *Exide Batteries (16)                                       Wilcomatic (17)                                       Geest CD (17)                                       Godiva (17)                                       *Britannia Data Mgt (18)                                       Barbour Campbell (19)                                       Mercado (20)                                       Solicitors' Law Stationery Soc.

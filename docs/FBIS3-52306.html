He was speaking during a visit to the  Jordan Valley moshav Na'ama, some five kilometers north of  Jericho. According to the draft agreement reached in Cairo,  Na'ama will reportedly be bordered to the east and to the north  by the Palestinian autonomous zone. In Na'ama today was  reporter Dick Winter:    [Begin recording] [Winter] Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu  dropped his bombshell after Na'ama members accused him of  selling them out, when in September after the Knesset approved  the Israel-PLO accord, he pledged then that the Likud would  honor the agreement if they came to power. Now, says Netanyahu,  the situation has changed:    [Netanyahu] Agreements are made to be abided by, but that  cannot be a unilateral action. In fact, the PLO has already  violated the central tenets of the agreement. It hasn't  canceled the PLO charter, as it promised; it hasn't espoused an  antiterror policy. What it has done, in fact, is the very  opposite. So if the PLO violated this agreement, I don't see  why we should be bound by it. In all international law, an  agreement that is not kept by the other side does not bind the  other signatory. That is the common thing. Contracts are not  one-sided. If one side violates, it doesn't oblige the other,  and in this case the PLO has clearly violated this agreement  completely, eviscerated it of any meaning, abrogated it central  tenets, and therefore I will not see this agreement as binding  on a government that I would lead.    [Winter] Addressing the Na'ama settlers, most of whom were  Rabin supporters in the last elections, Netanyahu said he  couldn't believe that the Labor Party, much less the Likud,  could support an agreement which reportedly leaves Na'ama  bordered to the east and to the north by the Palestinian  autonomous zone. As to his program, this is what the Likud  leader had to say:    [Netanyahu] I think what we have to see is an alternative  plan that gives autonomy to the Palestinian Arabs in their  cities and their villages and gives Israel control over  security. Security for Israel, autonomy for the Arabs, and not  a PLO state that would perhaps fast become the bridgehead for  another war against Israel.    [Winter] Displaying to reporters the document including what  he said were the latest Israeli proposals to the Palestinians --  but not giving many details -- Netanyahu said they were a  blueprint not for autonomy, but for a Palestinian state.

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Peru faces 12-month wait for democracy PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori of Peru has announced a 12-month timetable for the restoration of democracy, in an attempt to stave off international economic sanctions against his military-backed government. Mr Fujimori, who closed Congress and suspended the judiciary on April 5, said parliamentary elections would be held next February. In his speech, broadcast on Tuesday night, the president said he would hold a referendum on July 5 to obtain an endorsement for his 'emergency government'. Amendments to the constitution would be announced at the end of August, and these would be put to another vote in November. Mr Fujimori said it was not his intention to install a dictatorship, but to build a 'new, more efficient democracy'. He has pledged to rid Peru of corruption and drug trafficking, and to end a 12-year guerrilla campaign that has claimed more than 23,000 lives, mainly civilian. There was no immediate reaction from a delegation of the Organisation of American States (OAS) that arrived in Lima this week to press Mr Fujimori to restore constitutional rule. But the president's speech was clearly timed to impress the visiting diplomats. At home, Mr Fujimori is now struggling to maintain business confidence following the resignation of Mr Carlos Bolona, the finance minister. Mr Bolona was regarded as the key cabinet minister who could have maintained links between Peru and the international financial community. The Lima stock exchange plunged on the news of the resignation. Mr Augusto Blacker Miller, the foreign minister, is expected to take over the finance portfolio. Meanwhile, Mr Maximo San Roman, the former vice-president, has been sworn in as president by the dismissed Congress. He said he would establish a new government and asked for support. Mr San Roman claimed he had the backing of high-ranking military leaders, but on Monday the armed forces issued a communique reaffirming their allegiance to Mr Fujimori. About 400 rival supporters of Mr Fujimori and Mr San Roman scuffled in front of the hotel where the OAS delegation was meeting separately with government and opposition representatives.</p>

During his meeting with his American counterpart Mike Espy  they had agreed that it was impossible for these steps to be  unilateral, but had to have some response from the European  Union.    On developments in agriculture after 1990 Lux said that  there  was a rather naive opening up to the world, followed by the  realization that the world had not opened up to us so much.    We must attempt to reduce protectionist policies, but it has  to be in the context of European Union policy, he said.    Given the size of land areas and the concentration of  production, and assuming that the redressal [as received] of  property relations would be an important motivating factor,  Czech Agriculture could be competitive in two or three years'  time, Lux said.    Espy and he had talked about their common view of  negotiations with the EC, and about how they had a common  interest -- to aim at reducing the high level of protectionism  in the EC, Lux said.    He told Espy he welcomed the support of American exports to  the Czech Republic, and asked that they be aimed at those  commodities of which the Czech Republic had insufficient  supplies.    Lux also told World Bank representatives about the state of  Czech agriculture. As the World Bank lacked information about  the state of Czech agricultural transformation, it was agreed  that an information system would be quickly established so  enough information could be provided.    He said he had met with Californian entrepreneurs, who  expressed concrete interest in "agrobusiness" contacts. "I  realized there that our export policy has to be strengthened by  the physical presence of our people in particular places, such  as the United States. One and a half business attaches working  in the United States is not really enough," he said.</p>

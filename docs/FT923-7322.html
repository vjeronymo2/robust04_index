			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Bonds: South-east Asia leads demand for German issue LACK of supply during the latest rally in the US Treasury market has led to a dearth of fixed rate Euro-dollar bonds trading around par. Yesterday's Dollars 500m issue of fixed-rate Eurobonds for Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau provided investors with a welcome opportunity to stock up on paper which pays a coupon reflecting current interest rate levels. Demand was particularly strong among investors in south-east Asia, including a number of central banks, many of which view the KFW issue as quasi-German government, although it is not explicitly guaranteed by the government. The issue of 5 3/4 per cent bonds, arranged by Deutsche Bank, was considered fairly priced to yield 24 basis points more than the comparable US Treasury. The spread widened by one basis point yesterday, due to the rally in the underlying US Treasury market. A recent Dollars 500m five-year Eurobond offering for the Inter-American Development Bank was trading at a spread of 21 basis points yesterday, having previously widened to 25 basis points from an aggressive launch spread of 18 basis points two weeks ago. Interest in dollar bonds has been stimulated by increasingly positive sentiment on the dollar, which most investors view as cheap at current levels. Investors in the Far East in particular see shorter-dated Eurobonds as a suitable instrument for taking a view on the currency. European investors, however, are also focusing on yield levels, and are consequently tending to buy longer-dated paper at substantially higher yields due to the very positive US yield curve. In addition, many European investors feel that if short-term US interest rates start to bottom out, the long end of the market will not suffer, because of the steepness of the the curve. Redemption levels in US dollar bonds are heavy over the next few months  - Dollars 6.6bn in August, Dollars 7.9bn in September and Dollars 6.8bn in October. While the level of reinvestment in dollar securities is likely to be high, the pattern of reinvestment is unpredictable as the majority of the paper consists of maturing ex-warrant bonds, largely held by Japanese banks. Barclays Bank has set up an Ecu2bn Euro medium-term note programme, arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Under the programme, deposit and medium-term notes with maturities ranging from 30 days to 30-years can be issued. The multi-currency programme includes a D-Mark option, taking advantage of the recent lifting of Bundesbank restrictions.</p>

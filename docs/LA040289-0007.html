			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALK LIKE A MAN  </P> <P> Littwin gives women a bad name. She praises women for being self-conscious,  self-effacing and for taking up as little space as possible. These qualities  are not feminine; they are neurotic.  </P> <P> She says she wants equality. She wants revenge. She went into that room  spoiling for a fight, carrying a lifetime of anger. Then she did the equivalent  of driving into a parked car, and blamed it on the car.  </P> <P> Littwin claims she speaks for all women when she says women have spent most of  their lives trying to be one of the boys, and that she wants men to behave like  girls. A real man doesn't behave like a girl. Neither does a real woman.  </P> <P> LINDA CIVITELLO  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dzhokhar Dudayev by Yakhya Akiyev; date not </F> given: "Dzhokhar Dudayev Indirectly Confirmed the Presence of  SS-20 Missiles in Chechnya"]    [Text] Groznyy, Chechnya--[Akiyev] How did you view the  recent statement of the mayor of Moscow on the expulsion of  "persons of Caucasian nationality," are you not about to adopt  similar measures?    [Dudayev] My good sense has not quit on me yet, and good  sense has stopped working long since in any person who calls for  physical violence on a national basis. The Almighty will not, I  believe, let me drop to this level. Grant me the strength not to  sink to the level of the barbarian and respond with such methods  to citizens of my republic: this would be blasphemy on my part.    [Akiyev] A multitude of publications and statements of the  special services concerned that SS-20 missiles are allegedly  deployed on the territory of Chechnya have appeared lately.  Please comment on this.    [Dudayev] Are we not worried that a quantity of nuclear  potential which could wipe out the world in a matter of days has  been stockpiled on the territory of other countries? We are  entitled to our defense, like all peoples.    [Akiyev] And the international agreements on the  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons?    [Dudayev] There is in the world the law of the strong. No  one  observes other laws or juridical, humane, or legal provisions.  Only strength is recognized.    [Akiyev] You believe that only the wolf's laws operate?    [Dudayev] Yes. And the stronger the state, the more strongly  it extends these wolf's laws to the weak and merely hides behind  the screen of the law. All these are ways to further torture  peoples that are small and incapable of survival.    [Akiyev] The news media reported that you met with Bill  Clinton during his election campaign.    [Dudayev] The point is that this meeting could not have had  a  positive influence on Bill Clinton's campaign and could have  turned the situation against him. Not every meeting in the  personal interests of one party has a positive influence on the  other. I turned down this meeting as far as possible, therefore;  Bill Clinton's opponents could have used it against him.    [Akiyev] Does Chechnya as of the present have diplomatic  relations with countries of the "far abroad" and with which  precisely?    [Dudayev] Diplomatic relations with half the countries of  the  world.    [Akiyev] Are they enshrined legally? Does Chechnya have  embassies and missions in other countries, as in sovereign  states?    [Dudayev] As in sovereign states, we have missions in many  countries of the world. And if it is a question of the  recognition to which the world is accustomed, we do not need  this recognition, we reject it and will continue to reject it.    [Akiyev] But this is irrational.    [Dudayev] It is rational.    [Akiyev] The world is the world, and this is an aggregate of  all the nations in the world, and you are required to observe  primarily statutes and laws.    [Dudayev] We must observe our interests, and our interests  consist of not succumbing to the euphoria to which Azerbaijan,  Tajikistan, Moldova, and other republics of the state succumbed.  No sooner had they crowed about this recognition than  disintegration set in. What happened in Georgia? The world  recognized Georgia. The intelligentsia and the whole people  stood up in support of Gamsakhurdia when Georgia acquired its  sovereign law. And what? Political forces embarked on a power  struggle. Gamsakhurdia has perished....    [Akiyev] I would like to ask you about Chechnya's refusal to  take part in the elections. How do you justify this refusal?!  You could have found a compromise with Russia and have sent your  observers to the State Duma, to the Federal Assembly.    [Dudayev] First, no one invited us as observers, second,  what  is the Duma today? We were citizens of the USSR. This juridical,  legal base has been demolished. The initial demolition came from  deprivation of citizenship of the USSR. And Russia was a subject  of the USSR. There is no citizenship in Russia as of the present  either, I believe, and all elections have been pointless,  consequently.    [Akiyev] What do you think of Ingushetia's problems? Does it  not seem to you that the entire economic potential, which was  accumulated by both the Chechen and the Ingush, has remained on  the territory of Chechnya and that Ingushetia is in the position  of a girl without a dowry?    [Dudayev] For 75 years both the Chechen and the Ingush were  bequeathed the most onerous legacy throughout the former Soviet  Union. According to the statistical data of Russia of 1990,  Chechnya was in 73d place in social development. We were left  with the highest infant mortality. We were left with the highest  percentage of tuberculosis morbidity and intestinal disease. We  inherited the most devastated economy. All resources were pumped  out of here for 100 years. So neither the Chechen nor the Ingush  were left with any technical potential or production. The legacy  was identical. We are EQUALLY POOR!    [Akiyev] Will Russians, Chechen, and Ingush ever see a Boris  Nikolayevich and Dzhokhar Dudayev hand-shaking ceremony?    [Dudayev] I am sure of one thing: Russia could win an  unprecedented victory in the Caucasus were Chechnya to shake  Russia's hand. Russia's 500-year endeavor could be eclipsed by  this handshake. This would be the most dazzling victory in the  Caucasus. If it does not want this victory, this is its PROBLEM.    [Akiyev] So you are not, for all that, prepared to meet?    [Dudayev] Not only not prepared, I reject this meeting. For  any meeting a base has to be prepared, and it should produce a  conclusive result.    [Akiyev] You mean, recognition of Chechnya?    [Dudayev] Not entirely. We have been recognized by the  Almighty.    [Akiyev] But the Almighty has, I believe, recognized all  mankind?    [Dudayev] We are an indigenous nation here. This land was  given us by the Almighty, and we have a right to administer it  independently of the wishes of any other state.    [Akiyev] Your attitude toward the measures that have been  adopted in respect to your fiercest enemies: Rutskoy and  Khasbulatov.    [Dudayev] I can assure you that neither Rutskoy nor  Khasbulatov were ever my enemies.    [Akiyev] But political foes?    [Dudayev] Not entirely. They have their interests in their  state, and as far as Chechnya is concerned, had some others been  in their place, the attitude toward them could have been even  worse. They are people of their time and their structure, and I  am far from thinking that they are my foes. But I will say  unequivocally that their being incarcerated will not improve the  situation in Russia. Khasbulatov is a son of the Chechen people,  he was raised and educated by Chechnya, and, whatever he did  against Chechnya while in Russia's power structures, he will  remain a most gifted politician of our time.  <H5>  From the editors: </H5>   Mr. Dudayev's answers were not emended for style. We deemed  it possible to leave without comment the president's graphic  expressions, especially since two days ago he conferred on  Chechnya by edict a new name--the Republic of Ichkeria.</p>

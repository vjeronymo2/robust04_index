			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Ferry port development A Pounds 7m expansion of the continental ferry port at Portsmouth, Hampshire, is to be considered by planners next week. The development would increase the size of the port by nearly 6 acres and the annual capacity by 152,000 freight vehicles. The city council - whose policy and resources committee will discuss the development - says growth of freight traffic through the port has exceeded all forecasts, with an increase of 22 per cent in the first half of this year.</p>

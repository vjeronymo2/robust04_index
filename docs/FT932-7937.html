			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / IMF watches as Kyrgyzstan fights the battle of the som A REMARKABLE experiment is taking place in Kyrgyzstan, the poorest of the former Soviet republics. It has introduced a new currency with strong support from the west. On its success depends the future of the state itself, the viability of new currencies in the post-Soviet world and the reputation of the multilateral financial institutions. Kyrgyzstan is a small, landlocked state on the Chinese border. It has an ethnically divided population - the Kyrgyz are a bare majority with a 25 per cent Russian-speaking minority which dominates production and forms the majority in the capital Bishkek. The industrial sector of Kyrgyzstan is like that of all ex-Soviet states, but more so. The Frunze agricultural machinery plant made one type of machinery for the former Soviet trading bloc which is no longer in demand and for which it usually cannot get steel anyway. A sugar refinery got its raw material from Cuba, hauled across central Asia from the Black Sea. Both have all but stopped production. This is a grim position in which to find oneself 'independent' - especially since its years as a Soviet state have left what Kyrgyzstan's foremost economist, Mr Turar Koichuyev, calls a 'psychology of dependence'. But in introducing the som ('catfish' in Russian) in place of the rouble, it blazes a trail for the other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States - only one of which, Ukraine, has introduced its own currency, and that without an accompanying programme approved by the International Monetary Fund. The effects of the introduction of the som have so far been both dramatically good and disturbingly bad. Its first trading session took place on Monday in the street outside the National Bank, where some Dollars 2m was exchanged for som issued the week before. It held its introductory rate of 4 to the dollar, while on the black market the official rate of Rbs150 to a som doubled to around Rbs300. A government decree that, after a five-day transition period, the rouble may no longer be used seems to have been obeyed. But it has caused an inflamed reaction in neighbouring Uzbekistan. The border between the two states has been closed, money transfers and trading of any kind stopped and gas supplies shut off. Uzbek President Islam Karimov, no friend of the pro-western leaders of Kyrgyzstan, accused the Kyrgyz of plotting to flood his republic with unwanted roubles. His action threatens to strain further the bad relations between the Kyrgyz and the ethnic Uzbeks who live in the border areas of Kyrgyzstan. The currency's introduction was badly executed and badly advertised; the result has been that only Rbs7bn to Rbs10bn of the estimated stock of Rbs30bn in the country were exchanged for som in the five days. Residents of Bishkek grumble about the bright new currency - accusing the government of raising prices under its cover, and fearing that the government had given them an unconvertible currency. The som is a test case in two ways. First, it poses a colossal challenge to the leadership of Kyrgyzstan: a leadership which, under the presidency of Mr Askar Akayev and the premiership of Mr Tursumbek Chyngyshev, attempts to chart a pro-market course. Mr Chyngyshev says: 'We believe we had no choice but to introduce the som: it allows us to escape from the inflation of the rouble and to create our own economy.' The chance is there, but the task is difficult. The second test is of the IMF and, to a lesser extent, the other multilateral financial agencies. The IMF, some six months ago, switched its policy advice dramatically: having previously advised the former Soviet states to stay in the rouble zone, it concluded - after observing the actions of the central bank of Russia in supporting enterprises with a flood of credit - that the only way ex-Soviet states could fight inflation was to control their own currencies. Says Mr Harry Trines, the resident man from the IMF: 'It became clear that in the present circumstances no one could reduce inflation while remaining tied to the rouble. And thus the IMF executive board decided that if the (ex-Soviet) countries wanted their own programmes with the IMF they must have their own currency.' This decision. meant that the IMF, and through it the richer countries of the world who provide aid to the former Soviet Union, were implicitly offering to support the new currencies if the state could commit itself to an IMF programme with its familiar features of monetary stability, budget stringency and rapid privatisation. Kyrgyzstan, uniquely - outside the Baltic states which are not part of the CIS - has done so, earlier this month signing on to a tough programme and receiving Dollars 23m as a first tranche of an Dollars 85m package of support. These funds form the reserves with which the National Bank has supported the currency. In all, Kyrgyzstan should receive Dollars 400m in loans, including a Rbs75bn (about Dollars 100m) from Russia which is promised but the delivery of which must be in some doubt. The World Bank and the Japanese government are to put in about Dollars 110m in budget support - in the form of goods which will be sold in Kyrgyzstan. For the foreign experts now in Bishkek, the future seems clear enough: a programme (barely begun) which pushes enterprises into the private sector - though there are signs that the state favours worker-ownership, with which the Fund would be unhappy. It will also trade on its few assets - wool; fruit and vegetables; hydro-electric power; natural beauty; minerals including gold; and a relatively well-educated population. A final asset is the harsh realism of people and leaders alike. Says Mr Chyngyshev: 'We have things we can sell, but they are not yet of world quality. We haven't got the equipment or the experience, and we lack the money to buy the equipment. It's going to be very hard - it's inevitable.'</p>

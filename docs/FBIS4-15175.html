			<p>BFN     [Text] The government of the Republic of Latvia  categorically states that it has not agreed, does not agree, and  never will agree to the creation of a military base by the  Russian Federation, nor to the testing of new armaments and  military technology on Latvian territory, and it rejects any  possibility of discussion on these issues, says a statement  adopted at the extraordinary session of the Cabinet today  concerning the decree signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin  on 5 April on the creation of Russian military bases in the CIS  states and Latvia.    The statement says that the order of the Russian president  sharply contradicts the draft treaties prepared by the Latvian  and Russian delegations, initialled on 15 March, on troop  withdrawal, and the order can be regarded as Russia's  unwillingness to sign these treaties. The Latvian Government  views this order as blatant bowing to pressure from the  reactionary imperialist circles in Russia&gt;  It demands an  explanation from the Russian Federation concerning this order,  and it also demands again the withdrawal, without reservation,  of all the Russian troops and military personnel who are  illegally on Latvian territory.    Latvian State President Guntis Ulmanis also says in a  statement that Yeltsin's announcement creates justified fears  for the intended meeting of the Latvian and Russian presidents  and the possible development of political dialogue. It does not  testify to the stability of Russia's internal and external  politics, and it reduces faith in Russia as a partner in  treaties. In the past few hours Ulmanis has tried to talk with  Leonid Mayorov, commander of the Baltic Military District, and  the Russian president's administration, but he has received no  reply. This proves a certain evasiveness about offering an  explanation, the statement says. Latvia will never allow the  creation of a Russian military base on its territory, Ulmanis  says.</p>

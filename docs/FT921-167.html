			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Letter: Entertaining energy manifestos Sir, The claims and promises on energy policy made by the main parties in their manifestos are - to put it charitably - entertaining. The Conservatives credit record expansion in the North Sea to 'low taxation'. But the present marginal rate of taxation on crude oil production in the North Sea stands at 85 per cent. Furthermore, they sing the virtues of deregulation but expect to give ever-increasing powers to 'independent regulators' such as Ofgas. The Labour party recognises the need to cut C0 emissions to counter the greenhouse effect, but promises to secure the future of the coal industry in preference to gas. Coal is of course the principal source of C0 emissions, whereas gas is widely accepted as clean, efficient, plentiful and increasingly economic. Liberal Democrats face a dilemma with a commitment to discourage private car use, since much of their support comes from rural communities dependent on cars. Petrol price increases will be introduced to discourage cars but 'compensation schemes' will soften the blow. They also propose 'measures to help isolated communities'. Could this amount to a national petrol tax with Liberal constituencies excluded? All parties are at least agreed on one point: the newly-elected prime minister will enjoy a holiday in Rio this June attending the Earth Summit at the taxpayers' expense.

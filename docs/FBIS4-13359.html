			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 20 Apr (INA)--AL-THAWRAH has criticized  some parties' attempts to harm Iraq's relations with Lebanon,  describing them as an effort to distract the attention of the  Lebanese people from the enemies of its sovereignty and unity in  Damascus and Tel Aviv.    The paper, which speaks for the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party,  says in an analysis today that no matter how cunning those  parties are, nobody will be convinced that Lebanon's problem is  Iraq. Iraq, the paper maintains, has not been sharing the  occupation of Lebanon with Israel for approximately 20 years.  Nor has it been imposing on Lebanon its presidents, prime  ministers, and Arab and foreign policies. Besides, the history  of the Iraqi Army is not spoiled with the crimes of the invasion  of Lebanon, nor has this army turned the Lebanese territory into  a hotbed of terrorism, kidnappings, and extortion.    Referring to the level and quality of Iraq's relations with  Lebanon, the paper says that Iraq's extremely clean official and  popular relations with Lebanon are known. They have always been  based on respect for Lebanon's unity, sovereignty, and  independent options. They have never advocated any tendencies  that would harm the unity of the Lebanese people and territory.  This is well known by all Lebanese.</p>

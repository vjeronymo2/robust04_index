			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Schneider's lawyers resign The defence lawyers of fugitive German property tycoon Jurgen Schneider have said they will no longer represent him, the Frankfurt public prosecutors' office said yesterday. 'The lawyers informed us that they were resigning their mandate,' the prosecutors' office said. Media reports said the lawyers quit because all attempts to contact Schneider personally had failed. Schneider is wanted by police for alleged fraud. He and his wife disappeared in April leaving his property group to go bankrupt with more than DM5bn (Dollars 3.3bn) of debt to banks and trade creditors. His Geneva-based intermediary, described as an Arab with links to intelligence services and arms dealers, had consistently blocked attempts to make contact with him, prompting speculation he may be dead, the media reports said. The lawyers doubted whether Schneider's signatures on documents giving them power of attorney were real. But police have verified the signatures and said there were no indications that Schneider was dead.</p>

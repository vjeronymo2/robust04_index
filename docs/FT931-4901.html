			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pound's slide brings arable bonanza - The transformed outlook for some UK farmers THE DEVALUATION of the 'green pound' by more than 20 per cent since September has transformed the outlook for profit on UK arable farms this year, more than wiping out the effect of reforms to the European Community's common agricultural policy. Figures given at a London conference last month - before last week's further 1.3 per cent devaluation of the green pound - showed that a 200-hectare (500-acre) mainly cereal farm getting average yields, which earned Pounds 18,000 before CAP reform, had been facing a drop in income to only Pounds 7,000 this year. But the UK's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism and the subsequent devaluation of the pound had pushed prospective earnings up to about Pounds 32,000. The figures given for a similar-sized farm achieving above average yields were Pounds 38,000 before CAP reform, Pounds 13,000 after and Pounds 45,000 since devaluation. Mr Bill Hall, head of the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service, described the figures as 'quite remarkable'. Farms that had been querying their viability had seen their profit prospects jump fourfold, he told the conference. Under the CAP reforms, aid is being switched to area payments while intervention prices are cut. The green pound system is used to convert EC support prices, which are set in European currency units, into national currencies. In the past the green rate was set each year by EC farm ministers, but since the advent of the Single European Market on January 1 it is being revised at the end of each month. Mr Andrew Mason, managing director of Sentry, a farm management company with 44,000 acres under its control, believed the devaluation had created a unique 'window of opportunity' for the UK farmers. 'We have a one to two year period when profitability for UK arable agriculture has increased very substantially,' he said. He outlined the increased prices he was expecting sector by sector. The market value of oilseeds had risen from Pounds 100 to Pounds 140 a tonne, while the EC acreage payment had risen from Pounds 155 to Pounds 185. Basic feed wheat was selling for Pounds 93 a tonne in September; now it was fetching Pounds 103 a tonne, while the acreage payment had gone from Pounds 47 to Pounds 55. The market price of pulses had moved from Pounds 90 to nearly Pounds 110, while the acreage payment was up to Pounds 155 from Pounds 125. Sentry will also be setting aside 8 per cent of its land, equal to 15 per cent of its grain area, and is expecting about Pounds 100 an acre for 3,000 acres. 'We were already making a profit,' said Mr Mason. 'Now we expect a 20 to 25 per cent rise in our margins this year, with cost increases basically nil. The seeds were there, the fertiliser was paid for at a fixed price and contracts were signed.' Sentry, which made Pounds 800,000 on turnover of about Pounds 5m last year, predicts profits this year of Pounds 1.1m. Mr Mason attributed half the increase to the green pound and half to expansion and improved efficiency. Booker Farming, with 50,000 acres farmed and managed, estimated last month that a 500-acre farm's profits would be bolstered from Pounds 17,474 to Pounds 33,474 through the green pound effect. Mr Malcolm McAllister, managing director, warned, however, that by 1995 the same farm's earnings would be down to just under Pounds 19,000 as the CAP reforms began to bite and the inflationary pressure on inputs came through. 'The costs of the pound will eventually hit agriculture very very hard.' The importance of the currency factor is illustrated by Booker Farming's decision this year for the first time to hedge the Ecu against the pound. 'We have locked in half our area aid payments, including set-aside,' Mr McAllister said. Farming is becoming a very detailed business, with computers as necessary as tractors. Sentry has computerised records for every input in every field - routine at this level of the business. But it is now as important to watch currency fluctuations as the weather. 'Profits will be extremely dependent on the way the pound moves. Until we either rejoin the ERM or some other mechanism volatility is going to be there in the prices we achieve,' said Adas's Mr Hall. EC payments are dependent on the level of the pound on July 1. It was inevitable that producers would have to cope with more ups and downs than they had been used to, Mr Hall warned. He also foresaw further reforms to the CAP - perhaps an increase in the amount of land to be set aside. Such pressure would lead to an increase in contract farming with companies like Booker, which took 25 per cent more land last year. Mr Hall said farmers had to realise that contractors could look after a farm at Pounds 80 to Pounds 100 an acre. 'That is the bottom line comparison if you want to be competitive.' Mr McAllister said farm owners were turning to contracting to eliminate the risk of running their own enterprise and guarantee a forecastable income. For those who wanted to remain independent he warned that this year's expected windfall profit should not be seen as an opportunity to spend too much on reinvestment. 'You are immediately raising costs, even though the interest rates are low, by taking on a lot more depreciation. I would say don't - use the money to restructure your business.' Mr Mason also warned against complacency. 'The message is you have an opportunity to put yourself right. But be quick - it's going to get very much harder very quickly.'</p>

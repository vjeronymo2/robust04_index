			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Gore up front and deals in the backrooms - What turned the tide in the fight for Nafta VOCIFEROUS opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement first surfaced three years ago when a coalition of US labour, environmentalists, consumer groups, farm and church organisations formed to oppose extension of the 'fast track' authorisation, under which Congress agrees to vote on trade pacts such as Nafta without amendment. These groups comprise the worker bees of the Democratic party, so it was with trepidation that the supporters of then Governor Bill Clinton watched their candidate endorse Nafta during the primary and general election campaigns last year. Mr Mickey Kantor, the campaign chairman and now US trade representative, said Mr Clinton immediately recognised that Nafta would not be 'politically viable' - with either the electorate or the Congress later on - without the side deals ultimately negotiated on labour, environment and unexpected import surges. The big business backers of the trade pact perceived that Nafta was in deep trouble when, during the presidential debates, Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate, repeatedly raised the threat of a 'giant sucking sound' drawing US factories south of the US-Mexico border. The phrase found resonance in the steady drumbeat of corporate cutback announcements, fuelling worker insecurity as the US economy restructures. Organising against Nafta continued as negotiations over the supplemental pacts dragged on for seven months. The administration was in a squeeze; business, Mexico and Canada were resisting a strong deal guaranteeing the right of Mexican workers to organise and strike. It was not clear that the US unions would support any Nafta at all. Just as Republicans and the business community were grumbling that President Clinton did not have his heart in Nafta and Congress returned from its summer recess alarmed about the pact's unpopularity, the White House put on a spectacular launch ceremony. On the bill were President Clinton at his most passionate (inexplicably, he is always his best on Nafta) and the endorsements of former Presidents George Bush, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, all of which came to symbolise the extraordinary bi-partisanship which in the end got Nafta through the House. Thereafter, a succession of White House events, including Nafta endorsements by practically every living former cabinet official and economist, presidential trips and speeches, just barely moved public opinion on Nafta. 'Four weeks ago not one person, outside a few, thought we could pass this Nafta,' Mr Kantor said. The president was eating with, jogging with and pressuring congressmen, but making little apparent headway until Vice President Al Gore suggested debating Mr Perot. It was a brilliant strategy, because it personalised Nafta in the form of an arrogant, secretive and peculiar Texas billionaire. Mr Perot's televised threats - and those of labour - that they would eject from office all Nafta supporters in the House was a big miscalculation. It caused resentment among congressmen and a determination by some not to be seen as being in labour's pocket. Implicitly acknowledging that backroom deals would be key to passage, the administration brought in as 'Nafta czar' Mr William Daley, son of the late Chicago mayor 'Boss' Richard Daley and brother of the current mayor. It was a series of deals that Mr Daley was involved in and which were detailed in presidential letters to congressmen, and a turnaround in public opinion after the debate, which brought a flood of endorsements just before the vote and clinched the 234-200 victory.</p>

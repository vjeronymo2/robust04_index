			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Russian deputies challenge Yeltsin over PM THE Russian parliament yesterday passed a motion demanding that the government rework its economic programme and that President Boris Yeltsin present to the Congress of People's Deputies his choice of candidate for the post of prime minister . The motion threw down the challenge to Mr Yeltsin to nominate Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, as premier for another term. The motion came as intense political struggles continued behind the scenes over the shape of the reform programme and of the next Russian government. Mr Gaidar, in a uncompromising speech to parliament on Thursday, ruled out any weakening of the main principles underlying economic reform. The effect of his speech has been to challenge Civic Union, the centrist group which is pressing the government to revise its programme, and to force the powerful grouping to either accept the government's stand or break off negotiations aimed at co-operation. Mr Alexander Shokhin, a deputy prime minister, repeated yesterday that 'there will be no fundamental change in the course of the reform.' He said that the government was prepared to take from the programme of the Civic Union only these factors elements which seemed sensible and which aided reform - such as selective support to industry. Interfax agency yesterday reported that leaders of Civic Union and of the nationalist Russian Unity faction in parliament had agreed on the need for more cabinet resignations. These include Mr Valery Makharadaze, a deputy prime minister, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister and of Mr Gaidar himself from the post of prime minister. Civic Union has long wanted such dismissals - but was said to have dropped the idea in the past two weeks following agreement with government experts on an economic programme. However, Mr Arkady Volsky, the group's leader, has charged the government with breaking the agreement.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Business and the Environment: Putting money on efficiency - NatWest Bank is striving for greater environmental awareness National Westminster Bank is making a strong pitch to become the UK's greenest clearer. The bank has just published the results of a two-year environmental audit which it claims is the first of its kind by any bank. The report is not the stuff that will set environmentalist pulses racing. Banks do not spew filth into the atmosphere or pollute rivers, nor do they chop down forests or hunt whales. Their impact on the environment is far more subtle. Think only of the amount of paper that a bank employing 100,000 people uses each year, or of the size of its vehicle fleet. The bulk of the 25-page report is therefore about how NatWest can cut its appetite for resources by using less paper, or switching to cars with smaller engines. It also looks at the 4,250 buildings which the bank owns around the world to see how they could be made more energy efficient. Much of this will strike people as obvious, if not rather trivial. The report even says that employees should use the photocopier less and switch off the lights. One of the main achievements highlighted is the installation of small waste paper compactors in 1,850 branches which will save the group Pounds 640,000 a year. However, Lord Alexander, the bank's chairman, and Derek Wanless, NatWest's group chief executive, make clear in a statement of environmental policy that there is more to NatWest's approach than age-old exhortations to staff to economise. The aim is to create a stronger environmental awareness within the group and apply this not just to the bank's own operations, but also to its suppliers and its customers. They say: 'We recognise that environmental risks should be part of the normal checklist of risk assessment and management. As part of our credit risk assessment, where appropriate, environmental impact assessments may be requested. 'We will encourage our suppliers to pursue best practice. Our procurement policy will take account of this.' Hilary Thompson, manager of NatWest's environmental unit, says this does not mean that suppliers and customers will immediately be struck off the list if they do not meet NatWest's green standards. 'But we hope they move in that direction,' she says. 'We want to encourage customers to report on what they're doing. It makes risk assessment easier.' But she also expects that NatWest itself will become more efficient as a result of the audit. The identified savings amount to several million pounds a year. 'Just looking at things afresh can help,' she says. The audit is not the end of the exercise. NatWest intends to publish annual environmental reports, and to incorporate environmental factors into its planning. But Thompson admits that this cannot be done by diktat from headquarters. Staff must have the incentive to become greener, and she thinks that this will come through the benefits that greater efficiency will bring to their departmental budgets. Some sample environmental targets include: Introduce a supplier environmental appraisal system during 1993. Increase the proportion of diesel-engined bank cars to 34 per cent by the end of 1993. Achieve a 5 per cent reduction in photocopying in 1993 as against 1992. Educate staff to expect information to be screen-based rather than paper-based. Search for new ways to increase the utilisation of soyabean/water-based inks. Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the potential for further use of alternative energy sources, for example solar power.</p>

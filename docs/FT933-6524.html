			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Brussels doubles duty on sacks from China THE European Commission has almost doubled anti-dumping duties on plastic woven sacks imported into the Community from China, after manufacturers allegedly absorbed the original duties instead of increasing prices. It is only the second time that the Commission has used its fast-track 'anti-absorption' procedure, which allows it to increase anti-dumping duties without opening a new full inquiry. The plastic sacks will be subject to an overall anti-dumping duty of 85.7 per cent. 'A measure aimed at restoring the effect of the duty concerned is in the Community's interest,' said the Commission. The anti-absorption procedure was introduced in 1988, but not used as the basis for an inquiry until 1991. Some Brussels trade lawyers have suggested the fast-track procedure may infringe Gatt rules. Importers have also pointed out the reverse procedure - which allows for refunds when duties prove to be too high - is much slower.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Machine tool deal JONES &amp; SHIPMAN, the UK machine tool builder, has won an important Pounds 400,000 order from Tong Nam Precision, a South Korean toolmaker, for one of its sophisticated 'creep-feed' grinding machines. J&amp;S described the order as a breakthrough in terms of industrial application and market. Creep-feed grinding involves passing the component under the grinding wheel at a slow pace, allowing more metal to be removed. The order for Tong Nam includes a cylindrical grinding machine.</p>

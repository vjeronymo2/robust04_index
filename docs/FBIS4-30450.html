			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within slantlines published in English] </F>   [Text] Nusa Dua, Bali, REPUBLIKA -- ASEAN members  undeniably need foreign funds, but they are by no means  competing neck-to-neck to attract foreign investors.    "ASEAN members will not compete with one another to attract  foreign investors, but will instead cooperate in attracting  foreign investors as well as investors from fellow ASEAN  members," Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, minister of state for  investment affairs and chairman of the Investment Coordinating  Board, said to reporters after opening a meeting of the ASEAN  /working group on the promotion of direct foreign investment/ in  Nusa Dua, Bali on Monday.    He said ASEAN members should seek a promotional means to  attract foreign investors now that the competition has become  stronger. Accordingly, Sanyoto stressed the need for ASEAN  members to anticipate global economic developments that have led  to the formation of regional groups such as NAFTA and the  European Union in addition to APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation] and AFTA [ASEAN Free Trade Area]. "They also have  to anticipate the implementation of the GATT accord endorsed  last April," said the minister of state for investment affairs  and chairman of the Investment Coordinating Board.    The working group is expected to create an intra-ASEAN  investment mechanism as well as a mechanism to attract foreign  investors during the meeting.    Sanyoto said fellow ASEAN members welcomed Government  Regulation No. 20 on Foreign Investment. "They welcome  Government Regulation No. 20 on Foreign Investment. I got this  impression during an /informal dinner/ in Jakarta on Sunday  evening," he said.    According to Sanyoto, the government regulation was in fact  inevitable. This means that Indonesia must take this step or  else it will be left behind. Indonesia must enhance  competitiveness in all fields if it wants to /survive/ in an era  of globalization.    The government regulation is a means to consolidate  ourselves  to enhance its competitiveness to attract foreign investors.    Meanwhile, Sugihono Kadarisman, deputy chairman for  promotion  of the Investment Coordinating Board, said the working group  will discuss the so-called noneconomic pressure in addition to  jointly attracting foreign investors during the meeting.    Western nations have often exerted noneconomic pressure such  as human rights and the MFN [most favored nation] status on the  developing nations.    "We will discuss a strategy to counter the noneconomic  pressure."    Sanyoto said Japan remains the largest foreign investor in  Indonesia. "Japan may not be the number one foreign investor  this year due to a recession, but this country cumulatively  remains in the top slot of the list of foreign investors here,"  he said.    The second slot, which was held by Hong Kong from 1967 to  May  1994, has been taken over by Taiwan. This is understandable  because Taiwan has been aggressive since the president and a  number of Taiwan ministers paid unofficial visits to Indonesia.    Moreover, the Taiwan Government adopts the so-called /Go  South Action Program/ that encourages Taiwan businessmen to  invest not only in China but also countries to the south of  Taiwan.    "For example, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and  Thailand," Sanyoto said.</p>

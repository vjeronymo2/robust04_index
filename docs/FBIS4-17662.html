			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow 25 April TASS -- Crimean leader Yuriy Meshkov  rejected on Monday accusations of separatism voiced by Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk and accused Kiev of pushing the  peninsula out of the country.    Speaking to ITAR-TASS by telephone, he turned down  Kravchuk's  allegations that the Crimea is looking for independence. On the  contrary, Meshkov stated, it was Ukrainian Defence Minister  Vitaliy Radetskyy who actually "expelled the Crimea from  Ukraine" banning its president from participating in the  Russian-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea fleet held last week in  Sevastopol.    Meshkov said that "on the eve of the presidential elections  Kiev is merely staging a political show to please nationalists  of all sorts".    According to the Crimean president, the Ukrainian leadership  makes "a serious mistake" by ignoring the opinion of Crimea's  people on the sharing of the fleet, whereas it would be the best  option to attract the Crimea to the negotiations in the capacity  of the third party.</p>

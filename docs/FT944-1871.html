			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: A simple guide to buying a computer - What sort do I need? How much will it cost? What does all the jargon mean? Paul Taylor has the PC answers Forget mountain bikes, hi-fis and designer outfits; a personal computer is second only to a foreign holiday on wish lists in Britain this Christmas, according to a survey. The Gallup survey, conducted on behalf of Intel, the US semiconductor manufacturer, reveals that those who most want a PC are aged between 35 and 44, and the majority live in London and the south-east. 'We have seen phenomenal growth in the home PC market this year,' says Nick Wood, marketing manager for Intel in the UK. 'The PC is vying for attention with the television as a ubiquitous tool for the entire family.' Sales of home PCs are buoyant on both sides of the Atlantic. In the US, where 7m home computers will be sold this year, they have become one of the hottest-selling consumer electronics items, outselling everything except colour televisions. The surge in home PC sales reflects tumbling prices and the success of computer manufacturers in designing machines with something for everyone - as the Intel survey confirms. Families with children between 11 and 15 years old are much more likely to wish for a PC in their stocking. Today's home PCs boast 'multimedia' features to run the latest games and 'edutainment', such as Microsoft's Encarta encyclopedia. But they also run more traditional word-processing packages and home-finance software for parents. Some can double up as a fax or telephone answering machine. Once they are hooked up to a 'modem' and a telephone line, they provide access to the information superhighway - the rapidly expanding world of on-line services, electronic mail and the internet. However, potential home PC purchasers still face a bewildering array of machines, especially if they are not an expert. So here is a guide to buying a family computer: Question: Is this a good time to buy a family PC, or should I wait until next year? Answer: It is never an ideal time to buy because technology is advancing all the time and prices will continue to fall. But the factors to consider include the new types of PC which are coming shortly (some, for example, will combine features such as television), new software, and the falling prices for the latest generation of faster PC chips including the Pentium and the rival PowerPc. Q: I think I want to buy, but how much is this going to cost me? A: The price range is from about Pounds 800 for a basic machine built around an entry-level Intel 486 chip, up to Pounds 2,000 or more for a top-of-the-range PC with a state-of-the-art Pentium processor. Remember, in Britain most PC prices in computer magazines exclude VAT. Q: Please explain in simple language what are the most fundamental choices I have to make between equipment. A: The most basic choice is which software operating system to choose - Apple or Microsoft/IBM compatible. Generally, Apple machines still have a reputation for being 'easier to use'. But thanks to Microsoft's Windows and 'plug-and-play PCs' from Compaq and other manufacturers, IBM-compatible PCs are catching up fast. There is a much greater range of software available for IBM compatible PCs. And add-ons, such as a modem or extra memory, tend to be easier to find and cheaper. For children, a decisive factor may be which system is compatible with those at school - although many primary schools have older computers which cannot be used with either Apples or IBM-compatibles. For parents, if they intend to use the machine to work at home, they will want one that runs the same software as the machines in the office. Q: So what sort of machine do I need? A: The next important decision is how sophisticated a machine to buy. It is possible to buy a basic PC, which just runs conventional software, or a multimedia machine, which will also run software stored on CD-Rom discs which are similar to audio CDs and are capable of storing a vast amount of digital information. Multimedia machines will probably also have a special soundcard inside and two external speakers which are needed to provide high quality sound. Many will also come bundled with some 'free' software and some will have 15in or even 17in colour screens rather than the standard 14in variety. A multimedia PC will cost about Pounds 200-Pounds 300 more than a basic machine. It should be possible to buy a basic PC from a good quality manufacturer for less than Pounds 1,000 and a similar multimedia machine for around Pounds 1,200. Q: Are there any other big technical decisions? A: Unfortunately, several. One with expensive implications is whether the machine's central processing unit - brains - contains an Intel 486 chip (or a similar chip from a different manufacturer), or a faster one such as Intel's Pentium or the rival PowerPc chip that has been developed by Motorola, Apple and IBM. The 486 - which itself comes in several speeds ranging from a relatively slow SX/25 up to the fastest DX4/100 - allows you to run almost all the family software that is available now. But machines based on Pentium/PowerPc chips may be more use in future as software is developed which makes better use of their extra power. The choice also depends on how much money you have to spend, how big the price difference is, and how long you plan to keep the machine - in a year or 18 months 486s will probably look old-fashioned. But most important, what is the PC going to be used for? If it will mainly be used for simple word processing and standard games then a 486  - say an SX33 or preferably a DX2/66 - will be OK. Apart from high-powered graphics and a few other processor-hogging functions, there is not much that a 486 cannot handle adequately. If your children insist that they need to keep up with the latest games 18 months hence, if you plan to develop an interest in rocket science, or if you explore the outer reaches of the Internet, then it might be worth digging a little deeper into your pocket and getting a Pentium or a PowerPc. In general, it is best to buy the highest performance machine that you can afford. This prolongs the useful life of the machine and may stop you kicking yourself in six months. If you decide to go for a Pentium they too come in several types. The 'slowest' Pentium processor runs at 60MHz - but is still a bit faster than a DX4/100 486. The most recently introduced Pentiums run at 75MHz and the fastest (so far) run at 90MHz. In terms of cost, a quality P60 machine can be bought today for less than Pounds 1,500, a P75 will cost about Pounds 100 more than that and a P90 an additional Pounds 100. From a home user's point of view any Pentium-based machine will be fine, but if only the fastest will do, then go for the P90. If you think of a mid-range 486 as a solid dependable family saloon car, then a P60 is a BMW and the P90 a Porsche. Q: Can I buy a 486 now and upgrade it to a Pentium machine later? A: Yes and no. Most slower 486 machines can be quite easily upgraded to a faster 486 chip using one of Intel's 'overdrive' processors. In addition some machines, which are labelled as such, should be upgradable to a long-promised Pentium-style overdrive processor called the P24T. However, beware. Upgrading to a Pentium-style chip can cause problems. Intel has a system for 'qualifying' systems as upgradable, so look out for that in product specifications. Generally, it is much easier and cheaper in the long term, to buy a more powerful machine to start with than to upgrade a slower one later. Q: I've heard of things called hard disks and 'Ram'. What are they? A: Just as important as the processor, if not more so, are the other bits and pieces which go into a computer. As almost every PC-owner will confirm, a huge hard disk-drive, capable of storing loads of programs and data, plus lots of internal memory or 'Ram', which also helps speed up processes, are both vital. The old rule with both hard disks and Ram was take the current 'standard' amount and double it. Generally that rule still holds true. Software packages are getting more hungry for power and space. Therefore it is useful to have a hard drive of at least 500MB for software yet to be developed. Lots of machines only have 200-300MB. Similarly, many PCs come with just 4MB of Ram - which is just about sufficient to run the latest heavy-duty software programs such as Microsoft's Office Suite, but you really should go for at least 8MB. This amount of Ram speeds up current applications dramatically, and will be essential for the next generation of software including Windows 95, which Microsoft is due to launch by June next year and which will boast a number of important and desirable extra features over the current Windows 3.1 version. Q: What about multimedia machines? A: The most important thing here is to ensure that the machine at least meets the latest Multimedia PC industry- standard dubbed MPCII which lays down a set of minimum requirements. In particular, make sure it has a double or even triple-speed CD-Rom drive because this is what is required by the latest games and multimedia encyclopedias that contain video-clips, and it must me able to read PhotoCD discs. Q: What about picture quality? A: This depends on two main factors, the internal graphics card and the external screen or monitor. The graphics card, which generates the screen image, must be a capable of generating at least 65,536 colours and of supporting screen resolutions of 1280 x 1024. A card labelled '64-bit' is a good bet for a multimedia machine. Generally the graphics card should have at least 1MB of its own video Ram (Vram) memory and ideally it should be possible to add to this Vram later. This will ensure that the graphics card is capable of keeping up with the latest software. On an ordinary PC, as opposed to a multimedia machine, a slower graphics card capable of reproducing fewer colours is acceptable. But multimedia machines and ordinary PCs both need a high quality SVGA or better colour monitor. For your eyesight's sake, also make sure the monitor has a flicker-free image refresh rate of at least 72Mhz. Q: And sound? A: The sound quality from a PC's tiny internal speaker is usually pretty poor. A multimedia machine should have a 16-bit internal sound card which guarantees audio-CD sound quality. It should also have connections for external speakers and a games joy-stick. A set of headphones with adjustable volume are a must if you do not want to listen to children playing on the computer all the time. Q: If I get all this gear, can I dial up on-line services, cruise the information superhighway and access this internet thing I have heard about? A: No. You need two more things: a modem, which enables a computer to send and receive information over an ordinary telephone line. Get at least a 14,400-baud modem - this speed is rapidly becoming the main standard. Fax-modems will also allow you to send and receive facsimile messages. Then you also need the right communications software to dial up and log into on-line services. Windows comes with a basic communications program called Terminal. For more information on gaining access to on-line services, see Paul Taylor's feature on Page III. Q: What about home PC brands? A: Unless you really know your stuff, it is best to stick to well-known brands with strong warranties, telephone helplines and service plans for when things go wrong. Among the well established brands are Apple, Compaq, Dell and IBM. Others include Gateway 2000, Packard Bell, Viglen and Elonex in the UK. Q: Should I buy from big high street retailers, computer superstores or from mail-order firms, such as Dell? A: It is a good idea to look around first. Buy a copy of one of the big computer magazines such as PC Plus or Personal Computer World then go and have a look in Dixons or one of the other high street retailers or one of the big PC superstores such as PC World or Byte, if there is one near you. If you know what you want, buying from a well-established mail-order company that advertises in one of large PC magazines can be the cheapest and easiest way. Make sure you get an order number and a delivery date, then pay by credit card. However many people feel more comfortable buying from a retailer or superstore. The big advantage is that you can see what you are buying and should be able to try it out. PC superstores have a wider range of machines and should be willing to configure the computer to your requirements. A high street store may be more convenient, but do not rely on the sales staff knowing what they are talking about. If you have a friend who knows about computers take them along too. Q: Do I need to worry about the software? A: Yes. All home PCs come with operating software already loaded on to the machine's hard disk, and many brand-name PCs now come with additional free bundled software such as Microsoft Works, so you can just plug the PC in and play. With some machines you will have to load the software yourself which can be tricky and time consuming - especially on Christmas Day. Most multimedia machines are sold with some games software and CD-Roms included in the price. Beware though, the games are not usually particularly hot ones. You may also want to consider what extra software you want to buy, so the novelty of the machine does not wear off on Christmas morning. For older children, popular games include 7th Guest, Myst and Sim City 2000, but there are thousands of software and CD-Rom titles. Ask friends with PCs what software they like, or read some of the reviews in the popular PC magazines. Q: What about a printer? A: You will probably find a printer extremely useful. These are usually made by a different group of manufacturers. The most important considerations here are what the printer will be mostly used for, the type of printer and the price. If children will be using the printer a lot, consider buying a colour printer. Colour ink-jet printers can now be bought for around Pounds 350. If colour is not important, then a good low-cost option is a standard inkjet printer from an established manufacturer such as Hewlett-Packard, Canon, Epson or Olivetti. These cost around Pounds 200. Dot matrix printers are cheaper but cannot produce such good print. For the highest print quality pick a laser. Recent price cuts and technical innovations mean some laser printers designed for use with windows software now cost Pounds 300 or less. Good quality manufacturers with low cost models include NEC, Panasonic, Star and Oki. Q: What if the machine malfunctions? A: Branded PCs are generally sold with a one-year warranty. Check the details. Often they are back-to-base warranties, which means the PC manufacturer will fix the machine if it goes wrong, but the purchaser has to get it back to the factory or the shop. Some manufacturers (and shops) offer extended warranties. But these tend to be expensive and it is worth noting that most computers that go wrong do so in the first year - which is covered by the basic warranty. Q: Is that it, then? A: Yes, happy computing.</p>

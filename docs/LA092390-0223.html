			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. DRUNK DRIVER JAILED -- FOR 19TH TIME  </P> <P> David Edwin Wilson may be Orange County's most dangerous driver, but he was  still on the road last week until a sharp-eyed fingerprint technician finally  tracked him down.  </P> <P> The 41-year-old Westminster tree-trimmer has been arrested for drunk driving 19  times under five different aliases, his tangled court records show. Wilson has  been fined, ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous, had both real and fake  driver's licenses revoked, and spent more than two years in Orange County Jail,  records show.  </P> <P> All, apparently, to no avail. In a interview last week in Orange County Jail,  where Wilson is being held on $100,000 bail after his arrest on a 12-count  felony warrant, Wilson said he knows he is an alcoholic but continues to drive  because he needs his truck to work.  </P> <P> "When I know I'm drinking too much, I don't get in my vehicle," he said. "But  when I black out, I have no idea."  </P> <P> Wilson said he does not remember whether he broadsided another driver in a  hit-and-run accident in June, as police allege. He does remember waking up in  jail unsure what name he had given to police. "Every one of the drunk drivings  I've had has been a blackout," Wilson said. "I don't remember any of them."  </P> <P> California has enacted a host of tougher drunk-driving laws since 1982, most of  them aimed at making sure that first offenders do not transgress again.  </P> <P> Among recent changes, the legal blood-alcohol level has been lowered from 0.10  to 0.08. A four-time offender may be charged with a felony, and police may  impound the cars of those driving with a suspended license. As of July 1, drunk  drivers may also have their licenses confiscated on the spot.  </P> <P> Yet a small but dangerous population of hard-core recidivists like Wilson  continue to drive drunk. And authorities say it is virtually impossible to stop  them.  </P> <P> "There's just of few of those out there, but they're walking time bombs," said  Westminster Police Sgt. C. Russ Miller, who has encountered Wilson. "Even if  you give them 30 days, it does absolutely no good."  </P> <P> A Department of Motor Vehicle study found that at least 75% of Californians  whose licenses had been suspended or revoked continued to drive anyway, and  2.5% of drunk drivers give police false names, said Cliff Helander, DMV  director of research.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Helander said, license revocation is effective in preventing  accidents. "Even though they continue to drive, they drive less and they drive  more carefully, because it becomes a feat for them to drive and not get  caught."  </P> <P> Helander said Wilson's case is one of the most extreme on record.  </P> <P> "That's one of the worst cases I've ever heard of," Helander said, noting that  he had heard unconfirmed tales of an Oakland man with 33 drunk-driving arrests.  "I can say with a good deal of certainty that there aren't many people like  this person."  </P> <P> Westminster police and prosecutors said Wilson had managed to slip through the  system by a combination of skillful deceit and foul-ups in the criminal records  system.  </P> <P> Among the problems, said Westminster Police Lt. Richard Main, is that the state  no longer records misdemeanor offenses, including drunk driving, on the central  criminal records computers. Further complicating matters, Wilson's first set of  fingerprints were filed under an alias, making it difficult to keep his records  straight, authorities said.  </P> <P> Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Nina Brice and John Robinson, the county's  chief deputy probation officer of field services, each declined to discuss the  details of the Wilson case last week. Robinson, citing state statutes that  forbid disclosure of criminal record information, said he could not confirm or  deny that Wilson had ever been under the supervision of the County Probation  Department.  </P> <P> Wilson's records in Municipal Court in Westminster consist of at least seven  tattered, confusing, cross-referenced manila files that contain warrants,  citations, charges and DMV records dating back to his first arrest in 1978. In  an interview, Wilson said he did use five aliases, including the names and  driver's license numbers of two of his brothers. "They're really mad at me," he  said.  </P> <P> Wilson said he had also served at least one jail sentence under another fake  name, Eugene Edward Burns. Eventually, he said, police began to recognize him  by his aliases, and would book him under those names even when he gave them his  real one. Nevertheless, he said, police would usually release him once he  sobered up.  </P> <P> "They knew who I was," Wilson said. "I don't know why they let me out. . . .  They just let me go . . . and I wasn't going to say anything."  </P> <P> In fact, the Wilson case was finally unraveled only because Richard J. Howie,  an 18-year veteran fingerprint man at the Westminster Police Department,  noticed an odd whorl on a set of prints back in July.  </P> <P> Howie, a confessed workaholic, "remembers fingerprints the way other people  remember faces," according to his boss, and once identified a notorious rapist  by remembering a tiny scar on one of his fingers.  </P> <P> About three times a week, Howie is called over to the courthouse and asked to  fingerprint people who claim to have been misidentified or falsely arrested.  </P> <P> On July 19, Howie was asked to "roll prints" on a man who insisted that  although his name was on a court summons, he had not been arrested for drunk  driving. The man turned out of the one of Wilson's brothers, and indeed, his  fingerprints did not match the alleged drunk driver's.  </P> <P> But when Howie took a closer look at the original prints, he realized that he  had seen them before.  </P> <P> Howie said he spent hours sleuthing in his fingerprint files, as well as  county, state and DMV fingerprint files -- a search usually conducted only on  suspects in crimes far more serious than drunk driving. Finally, Howie said, he  connected Wilson to the aliases, and concluded, "If I knew he was on the  street, I would not go driving. Period."  </P> <P> "The strange thing is every time he got arrested, he showed up (in court) and  got fined and all that, and nobody ever picked up on who he was," Howie said.  </P> <P> On Aug. 22, Wilson was charged with 12 counts, including felony drunk driving,  driving in an unregistered car, driving on a revoked license, leaving the scene  of an accident and giving a false name to police officers. A $50,000 warrant  was issued for his arrest, an unprecedented amount for a drunk driver,  authorities said.  </P> <P> "We're very eager to find him, obviously," said prosecutor Brice, who prepared  the charges, on the day before Wilson was arrested. "He's a potential killer,  just like the Night Stalker."  </P> <P> Police and prosecutors said Wilson's blood-alcohol levels had been measured at  0.28 -- more than three times the legal limit.  </P> <P> "Not only can he drive, but he's able to lie about his name and pull it off. .  . . " said Sgt. Miller. "A normal person could not stand."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, an Orange police officer who recognized Wilson from the County  Jail spotted him, sober but behind the wheel. At his arraignment Friday, Wilson  pleaded not guilty and Municipal Judge William L. Mock set bail at $100,000.  </P> <P> Now it is up to the courts to straighten out Wilson's tangled past. Court  records show he was sentenced to jail twice, for six months in 1984 and 18  months in 1987. Wilson, however, said he has served a total of five years in  Orange County Jail, including 45 days for receiving stolen property, a charge  which does not appear in his court files.  </P> <P> Wilson said he could not remember exactly how many times he has been arrested,  or how many times he's been sent to jail. He said he has tried to stop  drinking.  </P> <P> "I didn't drive for almost three months after I got out last summer," said  Wilson, speaking into the telephone at the visiting room of the Orange County  Jail. "Then I had one beer. . . ."  </P> <P> Wilson insisted that he had asked repeatedly for treatment for his alcoholism  while in prison, and had once been accepted into a program at the Roque Center,  but a judge refused him admission. That and other details of the case could not  be verified last week, but authorities said alcohol offenders are routinely  required to complete drunk driving education programs or show proof of  attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.  </P> <P> Jail officials said AA meetings are held three times a week in jail and all  inmates are welcome. Wilson said he had accompanied friends to a few AA  meetings.  </P> <P> "It was OK, but I never really went enough to get into it," he said.  </P> <P> Through the glass that separates inmates from visitors, Wilson's blue eyes  appeared clear under a mass of long brown hair and a bushy beard, but the hand  that held the telephone trembled.  </P> <P> "When I'm in here, I really don't think about (drinking) at all," he added. "I  have the shakes and everything, but I've had the shakes for years.  </P> <P> "If I ever get out of jail again, all I want to do is get out of this state and  go somewhere it's wilderness, and I don't ever have to drive again," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A SNAPSHOT OF HABITUAL DRUNK DRIVERS  </P> <P> REPEAT OFFENDERS  </P> <P> Despite harsher penalties, recidivism among drunk drivers remains high.  Department of Motor Vehicle studies have found that roughly 15% to 20% of those  convicted of driving while intoxicated will be arrested again within one year,  and 40% will be arrested again within four years.  </P> <P> MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS  </P> <P> In 1989, about 250,000 Californians were convicted of driving while  intoxicated. Of those, roughly 53,000 were second offenders, 18,000 were third  offenders and 8,000, or 3%, had at least four previous convictions.  </P> <P> FALSE NAMES  </P> <P> About 2.5% of those arrested for driving while intoxicated give police false  names or have more than one driver's license, a 1987 DMV study showed. Some  drivers deliberately do not carry identification and give police the driver's  license numbers of friends, relatives or strangers. If the description matches,  and unless the fingerprints are on file locally, the offender is likely to be  released before police know his true identity.  </P> <P> LOW DETECTION RATE  </P> <P> Statistically, drunk drivers are likely to be behind the wheel drunk many times  between arrests. The DMV estimates that most violators must drive drunk from  200 to 2,000 times before they are caught.  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE  </P> <P> The DMV is working on a new system that would encode data about each driver --  including a physical description and a thumbprint -- on a digital strip on each  driver's license. This would be a boon both to law enforcement and to merchants  plagued by credit card fraud, DMV research director Cliff Helander said.  </P> <P> Source: Police departments, DMV  </P></p>

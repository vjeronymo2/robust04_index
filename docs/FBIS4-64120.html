			<p>BFN     [Text] TALLINN, May 25, BNS - The United States say they  will extend financial support for Estonia over the issue of the  pullout of retired Russian military, Estonian Foreign Minister  Juri Luik said Wednesday [25 May].    Luik was briefing reporters on a letter from U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher in which Christopher says the United  States will give Estonia 1,000 vouchers to buy for some of the  retired Russian military living in Estonia flats in Russia.    The Estonian Foreign Minister hailed the Washington proposal  as a very positive one and expressed hope that also other  countries would join U.S. and help Estonia to resolve the issue  of Russian military pensioners.    U.S. Vice President Al Gore at a meeting with Estonian Prime  Minister Mart Laar during Laar's visit to Washington last month  said the United States was ready in principle to give initially  aid for sponsoring the moving out from Estonia of some 300  retired Russian military.    Gore had also said his country was going to do everything so  that Estonia would be free of Russian military presence by Aug.  31, 1994, adding that this was the logical final aim of the U.S.  policy of non-recognition of the incorporation of the Baltics  into the Soviet Union in 1940.</p>

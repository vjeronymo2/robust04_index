			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Imanu'el Sivan: "The Myth of the `Children of </F> Israel'"]    [Text] One Friday about two years ago, Shaykh Bassam Jarar,  a popular preacher and a leader of Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] on the West Bank, stood up and gave a sermon in the  mosque in al-Birah. As is the custom, he chose a passage from  the Koran, this time the first passage of Chapter (Sura) 2.    In this chapter, the prophet Muhammad blasts the "Children  of  Israel" for being a stiffnecked people with uncircumcised  hearts, as Moses already told them in his time, a people that  breaks covenants, a faithless and treacherous child. These  things are proven, the Koran says, by the events of the golden  calf and the rebellion of Korah, and later by the persecution of  many of the prophets. These characteristics are deeply engraved  in the Jewish character.    Muhammad goes on to say that he learned this to his  detriment  when the pact between the Jewish tribes and the Muslim community  in the city of Medina in the Arabian peninsula collapsed, when  those tribes did not live up to their commitments.    Thus far, the sacred text. And Bassam Jarar adds: "and is  this not just the way we know them in Palestine: a harsh and  devious people, with hearts of stone, cunning and cruel--and  when it comes down to it, there is no difference between an  Oriental Jew or an Ashkenazi."    These words are on an audiocassette circulating widely in  the  territories, and cassettes by other preachers from the Arab  countries, some sold even in Israel, say very similar things.  They pass on, in fluent language and to a large audience, the  array of images (myths) that Islam has built up about the Jews  since its dawn.    Two acquaintances of mine, both moderate men, one from east  Jerusalem and the other from Gaza, told me that they sat with a  group last week and listened to Egyptian tapes of commentary on  Chapter 2 of the Koran, and found it "amazingly relevant, really  speaking to our day." And indeed, about the cruelty of that  thick-bearded man wearing the yarmelke and carrying the gun--the  stereotypical character from the Arab cartoons of Jews in  general and settlers in particular--there is no argument; and  slyness, he demonstrated in the way he slipped into "Isaac Hall."    But is it really just him? When they preach about the  details  of the incident from the viewpoint of that second chapter, it  becomes clear to the Muslim believer that slyness and treachery  are something all Israelis have in common. As though by chance,  say Palestinians in a style reminiscent of "Hagashash Hahiver";  as though by chance, half the guards were missing that morning;  as though by chance, the metal detectors were not working  precisely then; as though by chance, the closed circuit TV was  not covering all the halls of the cave that morning; as though  by chance, the guards who were there did not notice the murderer  slipping into the Muslim prayer area; as though by chance, the  General Security Service [GSS] did not warn of a possible attack  by Kach extremists, and did not sound the alarm that the Cave of  Makhpela was a potential target of attacks by Jewish opponents  of the Rabin-'Arafat agreement.    The Palestinians are all the more suspicious because two  groups are involved here: the border police and the GSS, both  part of the unholy trinity, as Hamas calls it, which keeps the  residents of the territories in a state of fear (the third group  is undercover agents disguised as Arabs). "This typical Jewish  way of breaking their word" was what led to the horrible event  that has already taken its place in the Palestinian and Muslim  pantheon of horrors next to Dayr Yasin, Kfar Qasim, Sabra, and  Shatila. In those cases, too, a Muslim will claim, the two-faced  Jews had no shortage of excuses: in Dayr Yasin, it was the work  of the rejectionist groups; in Kafr Qasim, the muttered words  "Allah Yirhamu" were taken as a clear command to kill peaceful  citizens; in Sabra and Shatila, the Christian phalangists were  the ones who committed the massacre.    All this comes to teach us the seriousness of the incident,  and the broader context of which it is part. But as philosopher  Karl Popper said, human reality is surrounded by plastic hoops;  it is limited, but yet still has a measure of flexibility. That  is, basic data (economic, demographic, technological, and even  mental, such as the Muslim myths about the Jews) determine the  framework that binds and distincetly limits the range of  possibilities open to human societies. But man is a creature of  reason and understanding and has certain degrees of freedom and  flexibility. He can maneuver the range of possibilities he is  given, and more than just once even break past it and turn it on  its head.    Clearly, to really use this potential to the fullest, the  opportunities must be there, but also, and especially, there  must be leaders who will guide society so that it can make the  most of the opportunities and get beyond the "plastic hoops."  The unforgettable example of this was the Sadat initiative.  Sadat took advantage of the "window of opportunity" that had  been created by the stalemate in the 1973 war, and by American  patronage in the detente era, thatled to peace with that very  same Jewish people whose stubbornness and treachery he and his  predecessor 'Abd-al-Nasir had said so much about.    Menahem Begin, who proved a fitting partner for the Egyptian  president, caught the ball in the air, returned the gesture  quickly and easily, and at the end of a process filled with  pitfalls, proved that Israel was capable of keeping its signed  commitments and withdrawing from Sinai and its settlements by  the appointed time. The historically negative image of "the  Children of Israel" was dealt a heavy blow, at least in the eyes  of the Egyptian leader and most of his people. And though  sinkholes still exist, the Muslim opposition in Egypt is no  longer as capable as it once of profiting politically from this  image.    More and more contact with reality seems to be able to  change  group perceptions; and it is all the more likely, when there is  a strong motivation to let this happen. Such a motivation does  exist among the Palestinian public, as Hamas itself admits:  tired from years of intifadah that caused loss of life for some,  and bodily harm and loss of freedom for others, continuous  interruption of the processes of normal life, damage to the  standard of living (because of commercial strikes, the closure,  lack of investment). And beside these motives, there is also  this positive side--that modest hope that burst into sight in  the Palestinians' spontaneous demonstrations in the streets in  the middle of September.    Though our legal advisers say that: "90 percent of the work  of formulating the agreements is still before us," it is  imperative to finalize immediately the details of putting the  Rabin-'Arafat agreement into effect without quibbling over petty  details (like symbols of sovereignty). And on the only subject  still on the agenda, i.e., "tariff envelope," is it not  possible, with no other choices, to agree to start with a  complete separation of the two economies, and afterwards  negotiate a gradual and mutual opening up, until the point is  reached where both sides are comfortable?    This is, as the "nationalist" commentators say, the only  Jewish and only moral response to the Hebron massacre--swift  signing of the application agreement, and withdrawal of forces  within weeks once it is signed. A step like this would offset  the influence of the bloodbath a little, even though the scars  will not heal soon.    Gestures like freeing more prisoners or opening PLO offices  will do no more than dull the pain. Only carrying out the Oslo  agreement in the field will renew faith in the political  process, will not in any way crush the stereotype of the  treacherous Jew, but it will take out a bite out of it in a  practical way.    The "plastic hoops" of the world of myth were tightened  around us by the murderer from Qiryat Arba', but it is still  possible to heal them and regain our freedom of action. In spite  of everything, the historic conjuncture is still shining its  light on the peace process.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Output plunges amid call for national postal strike THE continuing deterioration in the French economy was highlighted yesterday by news of an unexpectedly steep 1 per cent fall in industrial output in December compared with November. The drop in December pushed the production index to its lowest level since October 1988, according to INSEE, the state statistics institute. The news came as the government yesterday stepped up efforts to try to end the strikes and stoppages by postal workers which are creating chaos in France's mail service. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, said he had told Mr Emile Zuccarelli, the post office minister, to 'do his best' to ensure that talks got under way 'as quickly as possible.' However, a few hours after the prime minister's remarks, union negotiators broke off talks with the Paris post office and called for an all out postal stoppage in the city today. The strikes, against plans to lay off 3,000 workers, come at a sensitive time for France's socialist government which is braced for a crushing defeat by the conservative opposition in next month's parliamentary elections. The socialists, battered by gloomy economic news, are anxious to prevent further damage to the economy. A prolonged mail strike would seriously disrupt French business, which accounts for 85 per cent of the country's post and is already suffering in the economic slowdown. Industrial output in December was 3.7 per cent lower than in December 1991. Worst affected was manufacturing, with output 2.8 per cent down on November, mainly due to a steep fall in car production. The INSEE figures, which come little more than a month before the first round of voting in France's parliamentary elections, have fuelled fears that the combination of high interest rates, a strong franc and the gloomy economic environment in Europe is intensifying pressure on French industry. Earlier this week the Bank of France's monthly business survey suggested that the trading climate had been even tougher in the opening weeks of this year. The consensus in the survey was that output had fallen even further in January than in December and that stocks had risen sharply across most areas of French business. Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman of Rhone-Poulenc, France's flagship chemicals company, has warned that the European economy was unlikely to recover until 1994.</p>

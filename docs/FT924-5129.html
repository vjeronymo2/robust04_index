			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Brussels lets BA buy TAT stake THE European Commission has approved British Airways' plan to buy nearly 50 per cent of the French regional airline Transport Aerien Trans-regional, after the British carrier offered to open certain UK-France routes to greater competition. The decision is likely to incense Air France, the French state-owned carrier, which had already protested to Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, about alleged double standards in judging deals involving BA. BA, TAT and Dan Air, the UK carrier which BA is also taking over, will have 98.6 per cent of all flights between Paris and Gatwick, and a monopoly on flights between Gatwick and Lyons. But the Commission decided to assess the merger on the basis of flights between all four London airports and the French cities. 'There's a strong competitive relationship between those airports,' claimed Sir Leon's spokesman yesterday. The deciding factor, however, was that BA promised to give up slots on both routes if rivals want to start or step up their service from Gatwick to France. That is unlikely to be enough to satisfy Mr Bernard Attali, president of Air France, who threatened legal action against the Commission two weeks ago. He believes that Sir Leon adopted the wrong approach last month in deciding the takeover of Dan Air did not fall under Brussels' jurisdiction, and that he should have prevented the purchase of TAT going ahead during the four-week investigation of the case. The British company said it was pleased with the favourable decision and added that it only required formal clearance from the French authorities for the takeover to go ahead. BA is hoping for the go-ahead around the beginning of next year. Taking into account all London airports, BA will increase its share of the London-Paris market from 49 to 52 per cent, and from 45 to 58 per cent on the London-Lyons routes. Air France is the second airline in both markets, with 33 per cent and 41.5 per cent respectively. The European Commission confirmed yesterday that it was conducting a preliminary study of EC airlines' 'frequent flier' customer loyalty programmes, but a spokesman said it had not launched a formal investigation under competition rules.</p>

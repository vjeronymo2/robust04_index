			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Death, lotteries and taxes all on poll agenda TODAY, the citizens of the District of Columbia, the least enfranchised people in the US, will not only be voting for a president and a fistful of local offices. They will also be asked if they want the death penalty restored for capital crimes. DC does have a murder problem, about 370 so far this year. But it has not executed anybody in its jurisdiction since 1957 and in 1981 the city council formally repealed the death penalty statute. There has been no discernible movement in what is the most rock-solid liberal Democratic constituency for it to be restored. The proposal is on the DC ballot because Congress, from which DC derives a large chunk of its budget, ordered the council to put it there. It did so after an aide to Senator Richard Shelby, Democrat from Alabama, was brutally murdered earlier this year. Some outraged members of Congress wanted the death penalty forced back in the nation's capital, but agreed in the end to let the local citizens decide. Most states voting today will also be passing judgment on over 60 issues not apparently directly related to the choice of their national and local leadership. Some initiatives have been placed on the ballot by the petition process, some by special interests and some by governments themselves. The greatest number of these are devoted to restricting the number of terms elected representatives may serve, on the ballot in 14 states, and to state and local finance, covering both tax increases and reductions. If the term limit bandwagon is successful today - and in the current anti-political mood more victories than defeats are anticipated - as many as a third of state legislature members will know they can count on only limited years in office. Financial initiatives conform less easily to type. Nine state ballots contain proposals to repeal or limit taxes and eight to increase them on particular sectors, such as the wealthy, smokers and gamblers. Several state and local authorities propose to introduce lotteries. The governors of California, Colorado and Michigan have proposed initiatives opposed by their own state legislatures. In Michigan, for example, Mr John Engler, the Republican governor, has sponsored the move to cut property taxes by 30 per cent over five years. California's Republican Governor Pete Wilson is seeking voter permission, not granted by his legislature, to cut welfare payments and assume greater control over the budget. In Colorado, it is the Democratic governor, Mr Roy Romer, who is seeking to bypass his Republican legislature by getting approval for a rise in state sales tax. But the most controversial proposals are in social policy. None is more bitterly fought than the initiative in Oregon, sponsored by right-wing Christian activists, to curb rights of homosexuals. Nowhere is the initiative process stronger than in California, appropriately for a state whose tax-cutting referendum in 1978, Proposition 13, gave impetus to policies later practised nationally by the Reagan administration. There are five state-wide referenda in California today, perhaps the most hotly contested on allowing the terminally ill to order a physician to practise euthanasia.</p>

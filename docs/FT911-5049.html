			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Arts: Dresden Staatskapelle - Royal Festival Hall During his years with the London Philharmonic Bernard Haitink's Bruckner performances provided some of the most searching and exhilarating experiences concert life in the capital could offer. Now, with Haitink a rare guest on the South Bank, only Gunter Wand's and Klaus Tennstedt's occasional excursions exhibit anything like the same Brucknerian command. Meanwhile Haitink's new cycle of the symphonies with the Vienna Philharmonic has provided evidence of how his interpretations are still deepening, still maturing, and that was gloriously confirmed in the Festival Hall last night, by his account of the Seventh with the Dresden Staatskapelle. The Dresden orchestra is by any standards a priceless asset to a conductor of a late 19th- century symphony. The sound is so rounded and well integrated, with fathomless depths of string tone and wind blending into a seamless chorus, that the music can acquire an effortless patina. The finest Bruckner performances seem to play themselves, with the minimum of intervention, and the Staatskapelle's instinctive command of phrase length and paragraph shape goes a long way towards such an ideal. With a less eloquent band it's doubtful that Haitink could have successfully unfolded the first movement at such a leisurely pace, and made so much sense of its steadily changing perspectives, or built the Adagio into such a radiant, serene hymn, while still pointing up every detail and expressive nuance. Even the scherzo never lost the sense of imperious purpose, and while the finale has other, neglected strands of argument - there is a dark quality, a Gotterdammerung-like balefulness, that Haitink failed to contact  -it brought the symphony home in utter certainty, musically and expressively. Yet the Staatskapelle has its own idiosyncracies: the vibrato-laden, watery trumpets are definitely not to British taste, nor would it be everyone's ideal of a modern Mozart orchestra. Yet Haitink began with the Haffner Symphony, giving it sprightly, alert rhythms and fining down the string tone without ever losing the bloom. Even if the wind remained beefy, and the textures over-succulent, there was no lethargy or soupy phrasing; if big symphony orchestras have to play the classical repertory with scarcely a nod to the discoveries of period performance then this was certainly one viable approach.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Bonn seeks way round ban on military action abroad THE Bonn government has agreed to keep German crews on board reconnaissance aircraft over the Adriatic if the UN Security Council decides to enforce a no-fly zone over Bosnia - but the decision will immediately be challenged in the constitutional court by the minority coalition partner. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, vice-chancellor and senior member of the Free Democratic Party in the government, will allow his party colleagues to appeal against the decision approved by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In the meantime, German crews will not be allowed to fly on missions providing information for UN enforcement. They will, however, be allowed to prepare the Awacs aircraft. The court will be asked to consider whether keeping German crews on the reconnaissance aircraft offends against the constitution or not. Hitherto, that document has been interpreted to prohibit the use of any German military personnel on active operations outside the Nato area. Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats insist that the constitution is not clear in its prohibition. The FDP and the opposition Social Democrats insist that such missions require a full constitutional amendment, which the SPD has refused to endorse. Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, parliamentary leader of the SPD, yesterday condemned the delicate manoeuvre as 'simply ridiculous', and a 'crazy piece of government trickery'. A colleague called it 'an early joke for April Fool's Day'. Even Mr Otto Lambsdorff, the leader of the FDP, said it was absurd and remarkable. But he, like Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the parliamentary leader of the CDU, roundly blamed the opposition for forcing them into it: it was the refusal of the SPD to agree a constitutional amendment which left the coalition condemned to contortion. Lawyers warn that the court may simply refer the issue back to Bonn for a constitutional amendment.</p>

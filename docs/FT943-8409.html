			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Lac suitors seek to have 'poison pill' takeover defence dissolved The two gold producers bidding for Toronto-based Lac Minerals will ask the Ontario Securities Commission tomorrow to dissolve a 'poison pill' which Lac has put in place to discourage predators. American Barrick and Royal Oak Mines are expected to argue that the poison pill was designed to give Lac's directors time to find better offers, but that it now deprives shareholders of the ability to choose between competing bids. Lac's directors have rejected both bids, saying shareholders would be best served if the company remained independent. Lac is expected to oppose the application to suspend its poison pill. Royal Oak's CDollars 2.4bn (USDollars 1.73bn) offer, comprising cash and shares, is due to expire on Friday. American Barrick's bid is worth about CDollars 2.1bn, but is widely considered to be more attractive because its paper is more desirable and more liquid. Royal Oak is by far the smaller company and its mines are relatively high-cost operations. The Barrick offer expires on August 26. Barrick will ask the Commission to allow both bids to expire at the same time 'so investors will have a meaningful choice between them'. Lac, which is widely owned, put a 'shareholder rights plan' in place in 1991. The poison pill would be triggered if any outsider acquired more than 15 per cent of Lac's shares. The directors would be able to thwart a full takeover by issuing shares at a substantial discount to existing shareholders. Barrick's lawyers said in a letter to the commission that Lac has had 'ample time' to seek alternative offers since Royal Oak unveiled its first bid on July 7.</p>

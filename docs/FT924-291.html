			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Long march to the market: Deng Xiaoping, China's reformist leader, is the FT's Man of the Year. Alexander Nicoll examines his achievements It is only thanks to the political bankruptcy of China's Communist party that Deng Xiaoping can be considered Man of the Year for 1992. China's new push to open up the world's 10th-largest economy has raised the possibility that it could quickly become a much more potent force. That this could have been triggered by a frail 88-year-old with no official position underlines the country's parallel failure to develop politically. Through a simple visit in January to the most prosperous, fast-growing parts of the south, Deng sparked a nationwide renewal of enthusiasm for free-market reforms. From revolving restaurants atop new skyscrapers, Deng surveyed the special economic zones he created in Shenzhen, now hard to distinguish in appearance from Hong Kong across the border, and Zhuhai, close to the Portuguese enclave of Macao. His praise of the achievements there, and exhortation to even faster development, fuelled an economic boom. China's growth rate is about 12 per cent. The world's most populous country is now, therefore, almost certainly to have its fastest growing economy. Deng's southern visit was part of a carefully crafted campaign against more conservative Communists to further the cause of the reforms he began in 1978. Victory came in October's party congress, with the promotion of reform-minded officials, such as as vice-premier Zhu Rongji, to top executive positions. Deng had done all he could to ensure that his doctrine of free-market development under party control would outlive him. Since October, Deng has demonstrated his continued dominance - and his darker side - by directing China's furious reaction to modest proposals for democratic representation in Hong Kong by its governor, Chris Patten. Yet he did all this during the year in which he turned 88. He is in failing health, and holds no posts in government or party. His principal adversary in this year's battle over economic reforms was 87-year-old Chen Yun. After 43 years of the Communist apparatus and 14 years of 'opening to the outside world', the fate of China's 1.1bn people still lies in power struggles between very old men. Their influence is testimony to the failure of China's leaders, including Deng, to develop mature political institutions through which power can be transferred. Even after his rout of the conservatives, Deng can barely be more confident than he was a year ago that, after his death, China will continue along the path he has set. To the visitor to China, reform feels irreversible. Businesses are growing everywhere and there is clear popular support - consumer goods are widely available, markets are flourishing. This year has substantially increased the likelihood that the reforms will be long-lasting. The majority of the economic activity is in the private sector. Foreign capital, especially from ethnic Chinese in the rest of Asia, is pouring in; investment flows of Dollars 12bn in 1991 have been exceeded this year. Foreign retailers have been allowed to establish joint ventures and prices of many goods have been freed. The economic growth of provinces has reduced the influence of Beijing. Yet continuing struggles within the party indicate that reform may be only as deeply rooted as the officials who promote it. The party's propaganda machine remains at the disposal of whoever wins temporary supremacy in factional wrangles. In the seminal 'Document No 2', the party's official version of Deng's remarks in the south, the veteran Chinese leader argued a new version of his celebrated remark that it did not matter whether a cat was black or white, as long as it caught mice. 'The fundamental difference between socialism and capitalism does not lie in the question of whether the planning mechanism or the market mechanism plays a larger role,' said Deng. 'Both planning and market are just economic means. The nature of socialism is to emancipate and develop the productive forces, to eliminate exploitation and polarisation, and to finally achieve the goal of common affluence.' China is proud of the contrast between its growth and stability and the economic and political chaos in the former Soviet Union. But China's Communist leadership still agonises about whether the reforms are socialist or capitalist. Even after Deng visited the south, hardliners led by Chen Yun launched an attempt to slow reform. Though Chen Yun said he agreed with Deng about the need to stimulate the economy, he argued for careful planning. According to his 'bird-cage' theory, 'you cannot hold a bird tight in your hand, it will die. You must let it fly, but only within the cage. Without a cage it will fly away and lose direction.' Deng won out, managing to get the document published in March. Then, his new year message was doggedly spread by the Communist propaganda machine. Factories and provincial officials acted in unison to increase production and investment - in many cases, indiscriminately - arousing fears that the economy will rapidly overheat. It cannot yet be concluded that free-market reforms mean the Communist system is on the way out. About half of industrial production is still accounted for by inefficient state-owned factories, many of which depend on state subsidies. The 'contract responsibility' system, putting the onus for profitable operation on managers instead of bureaucrats, is a step in the right direction. But managers are handicapped by their lack of authority to change officially controlled prices and reduce their workforces. Nor does economic freedom mean political freedom. Deng's rationale is that reform is the best way to create prosperity, and fostering prosperity is the best way for the Communist party to achieve its most important objective - the retention of power. It was Deng who ordered in the tanks on June 4 1989 to crush pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square, ensuring the party's maintenance of total dominance at any cost. Deng also shares responsibility for countless abuses of human rights - such as the detention of Wei Jingsheng, jailed for 15 years in 1979 after editing a magazine which advocated democracy. Though the official line is that Wei passed military intelligence to a foreigner, his sentence is thought to have been particularly severe because of criticisms of Deng in a wall poster. And it is Deng whom the people of Hong Kong have most to fear. In implacably rejecting Mr Patten's proposals to broaden the franchise for elections in 1995, and in threatening not to honour business contracts extending beyond 1997, the author of the 'one country, two systems' approach to China's sovereignty over the territory from 1997 has himself sown doubts about Beijing's commitment to it. Yet it is also Deng from whom Hong Kong has most to gain. Thanks to his policies, Guangdong province across the border has expanded rapidly with Hong Kong investment and employment as a driving force. He wants Guangdong to catch up with the four industrialising 'tigers': South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong, within 20 years. Hong Kong's participation will be vital if this is to be achieved. Deng may not live to see Hong Kong returned to China. At his triumphal but brief appearance at the end of the party congress, it was his shaking hand which caught everybody's eye. But the man who twice fought back after being purged from the leadership and was once reviled as the 'number two capitalist roader' cannot be written off until his last gasp. 'The people are pleased and the world has been astonished,' he commented of the progress of his reforms. But saddest for China is that the most important question remains: what will happen after he dies?</p>

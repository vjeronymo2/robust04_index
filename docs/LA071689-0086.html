			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REFLECTIONS: 'I CAN'T PAINT A PICTURE, BUT GIVE ME A PAIR OF SCISSORS . . .'  </P> <P> Two years ago, Margaret Eaton would have scoffed at the idea of doing anything  other than the political consulting and lobbying she had done for years. Yet,  after rising from door-to-door soliciting for a grass-roots labor organization  in Cleveland to becoming field director for the National Abortion Rights Action  in Washington, Eaton chucked it all -- without a clear notion of what she would  do next. The 32-year-old woman fell into creating handbags as Christmas gifts,  then delved into creating artsy earrings, necklaces and pins out of clay and  plastic. Now, from the workshop in her North Park home, Eaton is busy crafting  hundreds of pairs of earrings to sell this fall at art shows in Southern  California. Times staff writer Caroline Lemke interviewed her, and Vince  Compagnone photographed her.  </P> <P> </P> <P> My mom says ever since I was a little girl I always was very interested in  politics in some way, even if it was just what was on the news or what was  going on in the neighborhood. I was always asking, "Why are these people doing  this?" and "Is it the right thing to do?"  </P> <P> I went to a small, private liberal arts college, which was expensive. I come  from a big family of 12 kids, and I had financial aid for the first three  years, but in the middle of my third year there was a problem and I didn't get  my financial aid. And it was so expensive I was going to drop out for a year  and get a job. The first job I found was with this political organization in  Cleveland. They were working on issues that affect labor and the people in the  community.  </P> <P> I was 19 years old, and I learned more in two weeks working that job than I  learned in 2 1/2 years in college. I got really interested, and, before I knew  it, I was running one of these operations, and I was an organizer. I just kind  of moved up the ladder from there.  </P> <P> By the time I finished (with politics), I had been a lobbyist in the state of  Washington, I had run a successful City Council campaign in Seattle, and I had  worked on a big union election campaign in California for the California State  Employees. That was very exciting. So I tried all these things I really wanted  to do before I actually gave it up completely.  </P> <P> I never thought I would quit until the last year and a half. I never thought I  wouldn't do it forever, but then something just happened. It wasn't like this  conscious choice that I didn't want to do political work anymore because  somehow I don't believe in it. If anything, my feelings about certain things  are still very, very strong. I just had this other part of me. I've always been  a tinkerer. I sewed clothes when I was in high school. That's how I got  started, by making handbags.  </P> <P> There's a place in Seattle where I was living, an open-air market that has 200  spaces reserved for artists and crafts people who live in the state. My sister  and I got a space, and I started making different kinds of purses and handbags  and tote bags out of upholstery fabric with big cabbage rose prints. And we  made a little money.  </P> <P> It was so exciting. I got into the whole thing of if you make 10 bags and sell  them for this amount of money. . . . Everyone kidded me. They said, "Oh, you're  just organizing this little world," because I was putting all my political  organizing skills into this. I love cash-flow projections, and I love  strategies and time lines.  </P> <P> I switched to jewelry because I like shapes. Even when I made handbags, the  thing I liked was coming up with the most unusual shape you could make for a  handbag. I'm much better at sculpting things instead of painting. I can't paint  a picture, but give me a pair of scissors . . .  </P> <P> This year, I'm going to do about 30 art shows. I'll do about 18 in the fall,  every weekend. That's why all summer now I'm making stuff to get ready to sell.  I do pins, earrings, bola ties, bracelets and necklaces.  </P> <P> I think people aren't meant to do one thing their whole life. I think that  people who do do one thing their whole life are either very driven and very  passionate about it, or they're trapped and they can't leave their job.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Piet Muller] </F>   [Text] Ninety senior executive posts in the central civil  service system, among others those of receiver of revenue for  Pretoria, will most likely soon be filled by officials from the  former homelands and self-governing regions. This will be the  practical result of a recent directive from the new minister  responsible for the civil service, Dr. Zola Skweyiya.    Several ministers and premiers are understandably also  walking around "with lists of their own pals who they want to  appoint to executive positions in the civil service," RAPPORT  was told.    According to Dr. Skweyiya's instructions, these 90 posts may  not be filled before officials of the civil service in the  former black territories have obtained positions. This has  caused a stir in civil service circles as it is seen as a  deviation from the constitutional ruling that the most qualified  person should be appointed in a specific post.    RAPPORT asked the minister by fax to either confirm or deny  the information, and to give an explanation of his standpoint  and the practical effect it will have on new appointments.  <H5>  Frozen </H5>   The 90 vacancies, from deputy director upward, have been  frozen by the Transitional Executive Council. There will not,  however, be a lengthy waiting period regarding the appointment  of personnel, since the relevant departments cannot be without  executive staff for an indefinite period.    One of the senior posts likely to be filled by an official  from a former independent territory is that of receiver of  revenue in Pretoria. The post is regarded as one of the most  senior in the civil service. The appointee "must not only have  a thorough knowledge of tax law, but should also be well versed  with the practical implementation of that law, otherwise the  government will be shooting itself in the foot," RAPPORT was  told.    The dismissal of the director general for housing, Mr. Louis  Kock, by Joe Slovo, has sent shockwaves through the civil  service even though it took effect with Mr. Kock's consent.  They are now waiting to see how many other ministers are going  to try the same.  <H5>  Vacant </H5>   The post of director general for manpower is currently  vacant  after Mr. Joel Fourie resigned at the end of last month.  Manpower Minister Tito Mboweni reacted sharply when RAPPORT  approached him in the wake of rumors that he was trying to  appoint Professor Halton Cheadle, who has strong ties with  COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions], but found out  that civil service regulations made the move difficult. An  allegation has also been made to RAPPORT that Prof. Cheadle was  then appointed as a consultant at 1,000 rands per day.    The minister, in a faxed message, rejected those rumors and  said that they were inaccurate and based on hearsay. "The  process to appoint a new director general has not started. The  process will necessitate consultation between the minister of  manpower and the civil service commission. You will be informed  at the opportune moment when the process has been completed and  the appointment made."    According to the same fax, Prof. Cheadle "was not a member  of  the department or the ministry. He is one of the possible  candidates being considered to comprise a team of advisers for  the ministry. No decision has yet been taken on any member of  the team."  <H5>  The Chosen Ones </H5>   Mr. Casper van Rensburg, executive manager of the  Association  of Civil Servants, said he was aware of the rumors that  ministers were walking around with lists of the chosen people  they intended to appoint. His organization has already resorted  to "certain measures" regarding the rumors.    He adds that "a director general is not without rights, and  that it will not be so easy to get rid of senior staff members."    "People must be careful not to undermine the expertise of  the  executive staff in the civil service," Mr. van Rensburg said.  "If they are surrounded by inexperienced people, it is usually  the minister who falls on his face."</p>

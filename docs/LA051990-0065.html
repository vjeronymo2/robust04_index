			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANDELA VISITS LIBYA, THANKS KADAFI FOR HELPING TRAIN ANC  </P> <P> African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, saying, "We consider ourselves  comrades in arms," thanked Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadafi on Friday for  military training he gave ANC fighters and condemned the 1986 U.S. air raids on  Libya.  </P> <P> About 3,000 cheering students greeted Mandela when he arrived in Tripoli from  Algiers as part of an African tour he is taking with his wife, Winnie.  </P> <P> The anti-apartheid leader was whisked to Kadafi's Bedouin tent residence inside  the heavily armed Azizya barracks in Tripoli.  </P> <P> "You have given military training to South Africans who wanted to obtain their  liberation through armed struggle," Mandela said after embracing Kadafi outside  his tent. "In our situation, as in other countries, an armed struggle is one of  the most effective ways for fighting for political change in our country.  </P> <P> "Your readiness to provide us with the facilities of forming an army of  liberation indicated your commitment to the fight for peace and human rights in  the world," Mandela said.  </P> <P> Diplomats say Libyan officials regard Mandela's visit as a triumphant symbol of  Libyan policy that will considerably boost Tripoli's prestige in the African  world.  </P> <P> On the way to the meeting with Kadafi, Libyan officials stopped and showed  Mandela the ruins of Kadafi's former residence, bombed by the United States on  April 15, 1986, in retaliation for terrorist attacks allegedly sponsored by the  Libyan strongman.  </P> <P> Mandela insisted on seeing every room in the building, which was littered with  bomb shrapnel and wreckage from a downed U.S. Air Force plane.  </P></p>

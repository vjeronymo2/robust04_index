			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: Rocard's career in the balance MR Michel Rocard, the Socialists' expected standard-bearer in the 1995 presidential elections, was last night fighting to keep his political career alive. The ex-prime minister, who headed the Socialist government in 1988-91, was predicted by the opinion polls to have gained only 28.2 per cent support in his suburban Paris constituency, easily outdistanced by his Gaullist RPR challenger, Mr Pierre Cardo, who received 38.8 per cent. Hoping to turn this around in next Sunday's second ballot by gaining the left-wing support outside the Socialist party, Mr Rocard said that the Socialists' generally disastrous performance underlined 'the degree to which we (the Socialists) need to transform our party, to rally other elements' of the left. Mr Rocard was referring to his recent call for 'a big bang' recomposition of the French left. To mark a certain distance from President Francois Mitterrand and the current Socialist government of which he is not a member, Mr Rocard described the defeat as only 'partially unmerited'. As recently as last Wednesday, Mr Rocard repeated open criticism of Mr Mitterrand, saying that the president had failed following his 1988 presidential victory to reach out properly to parties to the left and centre of the Socialists. The president, said Mr Rocard, had chosen to deal 'with individuals and not with political forces'. Last night Mr Rocard urged Socialists to join other sympathetic political forces, particularly the badly battered Greens, to limit the right's further gains in next weekend's second ballot.</p>

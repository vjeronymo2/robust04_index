			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Europe rises on interest rate optimism Continental Europe outperformed the rest of the world last week, according to the FT-Actuaries Indices, as investors piled into equities in anticipation of falling interest rates later in the year. The FT-A Europe index, excluding the UK, rose 1.8 per cent in local currency terms, compared with a fall of 1 per cent in the FT-A World index. Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at BZW, is cautious about the interest rate optimism, and attempts to call the turn in stock markets. While he believes that Continental rates are now at their peak, last Friday's tough talking by Bundesbank deputy president Mr Hans Tietmeyer has reinforced his fear that rates will stay on a plateau for several months. Finland, one of Europe's worst performers last year, advanced 6.4 per cent in a delayed response to the currency devaluation and the wage freeze implemented last November. Ms Taina Uljas at Kleinwort Benson says these measures had led analysts to reduce their corporate loss expectations. 'The outlook for 1992 is better,' adds Ms Uljas. Helsinki's rally concentrated on the big blue chips, such as Huhtamaki and Pohjola, and was accompanied by relatively high volume of FM30m a day, compared to last year's lows of around FM10m. The implementation of stock market reforms helped Italy, another dismal performer in 1991, to make a 5.6 per cent gain in better volume. The market was also cheered by the near certainty of a general election in early April. Among the senior markets, France recorded a 3.4 per cent rise in heavy turnover, fuelled by Wall Street's record highs and by news that the French government plans to encourage long-term savings, either through company pension funds or personal equity plans. Hopes of further exemptions from the bourse turnover tax also helped. The interest rate cut on December 30 failed to have a lasting impact on Japan, the worst performer last week as it fell 3.5 per cent.</p>

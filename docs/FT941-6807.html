			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / UK Company News: WH Smith music merger WH Smith, the retail and distribution group, is close to reaching a deal on merging its Our Price record chain with Virgin Retail, Smith's 50-50 joint venture with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group. The move - which may be announced this week - will create the UK's biggest music retailer, with sales of Pounds 350m, or about 20 per cent of the market. WH Smith is expected to take a further 25 per cent in Virgin Retail, increasing its stake to 75 per cent, and transfer all 305 Our Price stores into the joint venture. The enlarged group will be managed by Virgin Retail's existing management, headed by Mr Simon Burke, managing director. Although they have been run by separate management teams, the development of Virgin Megastores and Our Price outlets has been carefully co-ordinated since Virgin and WH Smith formed their joint venture in 1991. The 24-store Megastore chain has concentrated on central sites in large towns and cities - with an eventual target of about 35 stores - while Our Price has been aimed at smaller catchment areas. WH Smith is now thought to see advantages in integrating the two chains under one management, and to be keen to increase Our Price's share of the home entertainment market. After the merger, Our Price is likely to continue its recent programme of expanding its range of home entertainment products, especially computer games. WH Smith does not report separate results for Our Price, but it is thought to have lost money in the year to May 1993, but returned to profit this year. Profits at Virgin Retail this year are expected to exceed Pounds 4m, on sales of Pounds 120m.</p>

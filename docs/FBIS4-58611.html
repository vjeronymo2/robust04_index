			<p>CSO     [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. Last  Tuesday the Majles met in open session chaired by Mr.  Movahedi-Kermani. Maqsudpur, deputy from the Assyrian and  Chaldean minorities, and Rowhani, deputy from Mahallat and  Dalijan, gave speeches. Then Mr. Movahedi gave a short speech in  which he offered condolences on the martyrdom of Imam Ja'far  Sadeq (peace be upon him). Then the Majles took up its agenda,  and we direct the attention of our esteemed readers to the  details of the proceedings.  <H5>  Shamshun Maqsudpur, Deputy From the Assyrian and Chaldean </H5> Minorities    In the area of food production, Iran can become a major  exporter.    The first preagenda speaker at last Tuesday's open Majles  session was Maqsudpur, deputy from the Assyrian and Chaldean  minorities. He offered congratulations on the new year and  discussed the priorities in the Second Five-Year Plan and its  administrative weaknesses. He said: Economic experts and the  nation's executive officials agree that the deadend arising from  oil revenues must be resolved by increasing oil export  activities. Under current circumstances agriculture is certainly  the most important sector for achieving this objective, and it  therefore demands special attention from the government.    He discussed the fact that Iran, which has the necessary  resources, can achieve self-sufficiency in food production and  can even become a major food exporter. He added: Last year,  despite the limitations in this area, agricultural exports made  up 40 percent of the nation's nonoil exports, and the  agricultural sector accounted for 24 percent of the gross  domestic product. We are already very close to self-sufficiency  with regard to several very important products, yet only 25  percent of the arable lands are being used.    Continuing, he cited some of the important problems and  priorities in the Second Five-Year Plan, including the need to  alleviate the problems with ownership of agricultural lands; the  need to change the system of utilization and to gradually get  away from the limitations of the traditional system; the need  for technical determination of cultivation methods for crops,  which for years have alternately been subject to severe  fluctuations on the consumer market; the need to increase  investment in the industries affiliated with agriculture,  emphasis on research and the education of farmers; the  encouragement of agricultural exports; the guarantee of  investment in the agricultural sector; and finally the need to  procure judicial security in the country.    Continuing, he added: The need to give attention to  agriculture is also important in the political dimension. For  years the imperialist forces have used food as a weapon of war  to impose their political views and they have imposed food  boycotts on some countries. The possibility of using this weapon  is still strong.    Continuing, the speaker said: There is no doubt that  achieving the aforementioned objectives will require a revision  of the organizational structure and the creation of unified  management organizations. It is hoped that in the studies now  being done to bring about change in this country's  administrative system, attention will also be given to this  important matter.    Continuing, the deputy from the Assyrians said: The  procedures provided in the Second Five-Year Plan for the  government's executive agents are being implemented. The  executive agents in terms of organizations are the ministries,  and the government organizations and institutions. The  organizational positions in each of them are held by human  beings. Therefore if a comprehensive and appropriate management  program composed of truly skilled and committed agents for  implementing the programs does not emerge, this plan will  undoubtedly be the subject of articles in the magazines.    He discussed the fact that so far no revolutionary steps  have  been taken to solve the problem of the bureaucracy and reform  the administrative system and structure. He said: The nation's  administrative problem is not merely a matter of malfunctions in  the law or too many regulations. The major problem is considered  to be the way the laws are implemented and how some executive  officials deal with the public. It is in this regard that  unaware or counterrevolutionary individuals appear with their  filthy intentions to sow discontent.    In the same regard, the deputy from the Assyrians added: An  example of nonrevolutionary dealings with the people by some  officials is the hostile takeover of the property owned by the  Tehran Assyrian Society on Azadi Street. About a year ago, in  the middle of the night these urban lands were confiscated by  the District 10 Municipal Office without informing the owner and  obeying the Lands Possession Law. After this land was  confiscated and the vegetation was destroyed, a sign identifying  it as a place for cultivating municipal flowers and plants for  the District 10 Municipal Office was erected, but instead of a  place to grow flowers and plants it became a parking lot.  Repeated contacts by the society's officials with the district  municipal office have so far brought no result, despite repeated  promises and the failure to implement the Urban Lands Possession  Law. Several letters to the Ministry of the Interior have also  gone unanswered.    Maqsudpur said he brought this matter up in the Majles  reluctantly and that he had no choice other than to ask the  minister of the interior to issue the necessary order concerning  this matter.    In conclusion the speaker asked the minister of education  and  training to implement the measure enacted by the commission in  charge of schools for religious minorities and the written  commitment from Education and Training District 5 to close the  afternoon shift at the Her Holiness Mary Educational Complex,  because in the afternoons the classroom space under discussion  is badly needed to carry out supplementary programs for students.  <H5>  Mostafa Rowhani, Deputy From Dalijan and Mahallat </H5>   Isn't it a shame that Muslim girls in France are expelled  from school for wearing Islamic attire?    The final preagenda speaker was Rowhani, deputy from  Mahallat  and Dalijan. During his speech he offered congratulations on the  new year and condolences on the martyrdom of Imam Ja'far Sadeq  (peace be upon him). He said: According to the experts, in the  years 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] and 1372 [21 March  1993-20 March 1994], 31 of the 40 known natural and unnatural  disasters in the world took place in Iran. According to the  published statistics these losses total R1,000 billion.    Therefore, in view of the losses from the period of the  Islamic revolution and the imposed war and the various  disasters, it will be difficult to make up the losses, and one  must pray for the success of the nation's highest officials.    Continuing, the speaker added: The First Five-Year Plan,  with  the implementation of infrastructure and essential work in the  various organizations, has concluded more or less successfully.  We have come close to self-sufficiency. The year 1373 [21 March  1994-20 March 1995] will be a year to welcome the Second  Five-Year Plan. With guidance from our great leader, it will  find reconciliation with God and the people.    Rowhani noted that we will endure all hardships to please  God. He added: Some people have compared life to a battlefield,  and they consider it a struggle to survive. Some people compare  life to a playing field and consider life a matter of  cooperation and competition. The need for competition entails  two things, individual freedom and social order. This was the  content of the exalted leader's New Year's message, who advised  the nation to strengthen its work ethic and to observe social  regulations in all affairs.    Perhaps this is the very thing that is needed for society to  take on the form of a playing field where everyone has the right  to compete and where positions and jobs are given based on  individual talent and effort to those who have shown themselves  more worthy in social competition. If someone violates the law,  he is punished and is not exempt from Islamic punishments.  Islamic justice is implemented, and the executive officials find  the mechanism to implement justice, which is the elimination of  racism and improper discrimination, because the exalted leader  wants social justice to be carried out, and this goal will be  achieved with the implementation of the commands of Islam.    Continuing, the speaker said: Isn't it a shame that today,  despite the fact that everyone is free to choose how to dress,  in France Muslim girls are expelled from school for the crime of  wearing Islamic attire, and are deprived of education?    The deputy from Mahallat and Dalijan also said: The experts  believe that in the year 1372 Iran's economy went through one of  its most difficult years in the process of moving away from an  economy relying on the market, and it suffered many pressures  caused by economic adjustment. The fluctuating foreign exchange  market increased so much that it was almost unprecedented in all  of Iran's history. It is hoped that last year an historic lesson  was learned by the nation's foreign exchange management. Of  course, the repayments and extensions of the period allowed to  meet financial commitments in the year 1372 was a great success,  and in the year 1373 the government will find an opportunity to  solve its economic problems.    Rowhani discussed the fact that the exalted leader of the  Islamic revolution and the chiefs of the three powers all follow  the school of Imam Sadeq (peace be upon him), they understand  the exigencies of the time well and they have never abandoned  their simple way of life. He added: Those who are close to them  know that their way of life is even simpler than it was before  the revolution.    He discussed the approval of the project to set prices and  supervise basic goods by the Economic Council and the president  of the republic in the year 1372. He called on the minister of  commerce to implement this project as soon as possible.    The speaker also added: Our people do not complain about  shortages, because our production is good, but they complain  about discrimination and distribution.    At the end of his speech he issued memos to the officials  concerning his electoral district.  <H5>  Legislation </H5> <H5>  Bill Appending Note to Article 1 of Police Force Law </H5>   The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was the report from the first consultation of the  Councils and Domestic Affairs Commission concerning the Bill  Appending a Note to Article 1 of the Police Force Law, the  general form of which was not approved and was rejected.    Concerning this a replacement said: "All the executive  organizations, which due to the necessity for lawful  authorization have a unit to protect and guard their assets,  resources and installations, will be exempt from Note 1 with  approval from the Council of Ministers."    It is worth mentioning that the Councils and Domestic  Affairs  Commission rejected this bill, for which the most important  reasons are as follows:    1 - The basic conflict between the proposed bill and the  philosophy of the law consolidating police forces, enacted by  the Majles, which was aimed at consolidating forces and  centralizing the police security forces.    2 - The conflict between the proposed bill and the nation's  general policies on the need for unity and a single organization  for the police and security forces.    3 - So far the note to Article 1 of the police force law  requiring the merging of the police guards in the government  organizations with the police forces has not been implemented  nor has it elicited praise or blame due to the fact that the  Employment Law is still before the Majles. Therefore, to approve  this bill would be to change the earlier Majles measure too soon.    4 - It is necessary that all the armed forces be connected  to  the General Armed Forces Command Staff so that this can be  achieved by merging the organization security forces into the  police force and putting them under its mantle. Approving this  bill would be in conflict with that policy.    5 - Maintaining order and security in accordance with the  law  is the responsibility of the police force. According to  Paragraph 5, Article 4, the mission and duties of the police  force as enacted in 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] is to  protect the classified sites and points, and approving this bill  would be in conflict with the previous measure.  <H5>  Motion To Supervise Government Employee Foreign Travel </H5>   The second item on the agenda was the urgent Motion To  Supervise Government Employee Foreign Travel, the general form  of which was approved.    Concerning this motion, the opposing deputies took the view  that the aforementioned motion was already given Note 13 of the  1373 budget bill, and that there is no need for a new law. The  supporters emphasized that the budget is for one year and cannot  be a permanent law.    It is worth mentioning that a number of the deputies sought  to eliminate the motion's urgent status. Discussing this  proposal, Mohammad Reza Bahonar said: Since we have a law for  the year 1373, the aforementioned motion should therefore be an  ordinary motion that will have a second consultation, in order  to be comprehensive and well-considered. It will be worked on  for a year in order to be implemented in the year 1374 [21 March  1995-20 March 1996].    After talks by opponents and supporters, the proposal to  remove the urgent status was put to a vote and approved.  <H5>  Motion To Protect and Utilize Wetlands </H5>   The next item on the agenda was the report from the first  consultation of the Agriculture Commission concerning the Motion  To Protect and Utilize the Wetlands of the Islamic Republic of  Iran, the general form of which was approved.  <H5>  Amendment to Article 17 of the Judicial Courts Appeals Law </H5>   The fourth item on the agenda was the report from the second  consultation of the Judicial Affairs Commission concerning the  Motion To Amend Article 17 of the Judicial Courts Appeals Law,  enacted 5/17/1372 [8 August 1993], which was approved by the  deputies.    Article 1: Article 17 of the Judicial Courts Appeals Law  enacted 5/17/1372 is amended as follows:    Article 17: In cases where a court's final verdict is in  conflict with religious law or the law, even if it has been  affirmed by the Supreme Court, within 30 days of the verdict's  announcement the national public prosecutor may request one  review from the Supreme Court. A special branch of the National  Supreme Court will be designated to deal with these cases.  <H5>  Motion To Append a Paragraph to Note 15 of the 1372 Budget </H5> Bill    The next item on the agenda was the report from the second  consultation of the Accounting Court Commission concerning the  Motion To Append a Paragraph to Note 15 of the 1372 National  Budget Bill, of which Article 1 was approved.    Article 1: Because of the special procedures in the  educational system, Payam-e Nur University may again spend 65  percent of its current expense and allocated credits and also 25  percent of its development credits based on the Law on  Procedures for Conducting Financial Affairs and Transactions of  the Universities and Institutions of Higher Learning and  Research, without adhering to the government's other general  regulations.  <H5>  Report on the Research and Investigation of the Haj and </H5> Pilgrimages Organization    The final item on the agenda was the report from the Culture  and Islamic Art Commission concerning the research and  investigation of the Haj and Pilgrimages Organization, which was  read by the commission expert as follows:    After the report on the request for research and  investigation of the financial resources of the Haj and  Pilgrimages Organization by Mr. Bani-Hashemi, the respected  deputy from Mashhad, the respected Majles approved the  continuation of the research and investigation. The Islamic  Guidance Commission appointed Messrs. Seyyed Kia'i-Nezhad,  Seyyed Hashem Bani-Hashemi, Seyyed Ahmad Musavi, and 'Ali Zadsar  to deal with the matter and to report the result.    The aforementioned council appointed Mr. 'Ali Zadsar as the  group's chief. It then printed an announcement in the press  asking everyone to send any documents or papers on this matter  to the Islamic Guidance Commission. The resources for the  research and investigation consist of: (1) resources from the  public; (2) a careful study of the written documents and  evidence; (3) statements from officials; (4) an inspection of  the building; and (5) consideration of the views of the experts  concerning the aforementioned resources.    It is noted: (1) no documents or evidence of any kind were  sent to the commission by the people; (2) there were no  telephone contacts or personal visits by any real persons or  legal entities; (3) all the documents and financial evidence  from the beginning to the end of the building's operation were  studied and nothing negative of any kind was found; and (4) all  the relevant documents, financial, planning, technical, bidding  and other things are included in the report.    Detailed discussions were held with the respected  representative of the vice regent for pilgrimage affairs and  with the respected minister of culture of Islamic guidance, the  respected chief of the Haj and Pilgrimages Organization, and the  builders of the building, and all of those dear ones answered  the questions from the members of the council and cooperated.    In a careful and lengthy inspection of the building all the  members of the council learned the details and the quality of  the building:    1 - The money to build the Haj and Pilgrimages Building was  provided in the organization's annual budget, and was spent in  numerous years after Majles approval. Therefore, there was no  extra money, because the annual Haj and Pilgrimages surplus was  deposited into the president of the republic's account and was  spent as determined by the respected president of the republic.    2 - According to the views of His Holiness the Imam (peace  be  upon him), the Haj and Pilgrimages Organization sells the  expenses of the pilgrimage to the pilgrims, meaning that the haj  sales are final and not on account. Therefore it owns the money  and will be authorized to spend it.    3 - With the registration of the respected pilgrims in the  year 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985], R270,000 was collected  from each pilgrim and they were sent in accordance with a  timetable authorized by His Holiness the Imam (peace be upon  him), and in this regard written documents were submitted.    4 - The construction of the building took almost 85 months  and it cost almost R7 billion. According to the views of the  experts and the value of money at that time, the price is  appropriate. If exact numbers and figures are needed, the  applicant may report to the Islamic Culture and Guidance  Commission and see them.    5 - The construction of this great building was done with  decoration suitable for the position of the Islamic Republic of  Iran, because Islamic Iran is the center of the Muslim world.    6 - The collection of the difference in the year 1372 and  the  sending of people who were not on the priority list was a bitter  experience. The respected haj officials determined that they  would declare plainly that as long as one pilgrim remained from  the year 1363, they would not agree to any other motion or  proposal and that they would reject the collection of  differences, although the decision to collect the difference or  not collect it is the decision of the government of the Islamic  Republic of Iran, and if the government authorizes that such a  thing be done, that definitely makes it possible.    In conclusion, with thanks to the officials, it is hereby  announced that this report is late in appearing, but its  submission was delayed because of the presence of the 1373  budget bill on the Majles agenda.  <H5>  Letter From More Than 158 Deputies Concerning Armenia's </H5> Downing of the C-130 Aircraft    Respected speaker of the Majles:    With greetings and congratulations on the New Year to all  compatriots, in the final days of the year 1372, when our  compatriots were praying at the court of God and were hoping for  peace, tranquility and stability in all the world, the hand of  criminality came out of the sleeve of the deluded Armenian army  and shot down a C-130 aircraft carrying the innocent families of  Iranian diplomats, and as the merciless slaughter of the people  of the Republic of Azerbaijan continued, it revived the habit of  killing people and waging rebellion.    Therefore, with condolences to our dear compatriots, and  especially the bereaved families, and with protest against the  silence of the international organizations, especially the  so-called Human Rights Organization, in the face of this air  piracy by the army of Armenia, which is the main perpetrator of  this open and terrifying crime in the Karabakh area, we demand  an expeditious answer for these crimes from the Government of  Armenia, and we demand that the Foreign Ministry of the Islamic  Republic of Iran pursue this matter seriously.</p>

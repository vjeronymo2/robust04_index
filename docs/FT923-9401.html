			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: UK seventh in team jumping Britain's John Whitaker on Milton (right) clears a jump in the first round of the equestrian jumping competition. The Yorkshireman guided his charismatic 14-year-old grey to a clear round and followed this with just four faults in the second round after Milton put a foot in the water jump. Nick Skelton, on Dollar Girl, was poised for a clear round approaching the last fence on the testing Real Club de Polo course. But the 12-year-old mare refused twice, so Skelton was eliminated from the first round. Then Tim Grubb, on Denizen, steadied the ship with 8.7 faults. Whitaker's brother Michael on Monsanta then recorded just four faults before Milton's clear round. For all their efforts, however, Britain could still only finish in a disappointing seventh place. Holland took the gold with 12 faults, Austria collected silver with 16.75 and France the bronze with 24.75.</p>

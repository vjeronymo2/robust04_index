			<p>BFN     [Text] Rauf Denktas, in a new maneuver, appears in a  statement to have accepted all the points raised by the United  Nations on the confidence-building measures. Speaking to  correspondents after his meeting with Gustave Feissel today,  Denktas said that Mr. Feissel must be satisfied now because he  said that he gave Feissel all that he wanted. He further  maintained that Feissel also gave the Turkish Cypriot side what  it wanted. Denktas said that some changes will be made to the  latest UN document of 21 March. He also noted that what is left  now is to prepare the draft agreement for signing.    Gustave Feissel said after the meeting that Rauf Denktas has  moved from some of his positions, but it has not become clear  whether he accepts the 21 March UN document as is. Despite  repeated questions from journalists, Mr. Feissel avoided saying  whether the document had been accepted. He said: It is up to  the UN secretary general and the Security Council to decide  whether the clarifications given by Denktas today represent a  development in the right direction.    Feissel confirmed that Denktas did not give anything in  writing and added that today's meeting with him was the last.    The UN secretary general's representative has briefed  President Glavkos Kliridhis on Denktas' clarifications.    In a statement made to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting  Corporation]  a short time ago, Gustave Feissel noted that what Rauf Denktas  said about him having accepted all the points on the  confidence-building measures is only the opinion of the Turkish  Cypriot leader. Asked if Mr. Feissel really gave all that  Denktas was demanding, as the Turkish Cypriot leader had said,  according to REUTER, the UN official replied that this was  inaccurate. Mr. Feissel made it clear that his mission was not  to agree on anything. He added: My mission was to receive some  clarifications, which I did and I will convey them to New York.</p>

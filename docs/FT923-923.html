			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Exceptionals add to losses at DY Davies AN 88 per cent increase in exceptional items further depressed losses at DY Davies in the year to April 30. Pre-tax losses of this USM-quoted architect surged from Pounds 543,000 to Pounds 1.67m. The Pounds 950,000 exceptional charges were for costs associated with surplus property, bad debts, redundancies, and disposal of fixed assets. Mr David Davies, chairman, said he was optimistic that the majority of the company's high level of excess office space resulting from staff reductions during the year would be removed and costs borne in the current financial year. Mr Davies, who said the company's performance was affected by the severe recession hitting the construction industry, also announced that board members have agreed to accept salary reductions amounting to an average of 25 per cent in the current year. Turnover fell 30 per cent to Pounds 7.29m. An increase in operating losses to Pounds 430,000 (Pounds 349,000) was partly offset by a reduction in interest charges to Pounds 287,000 (386,000). Mr Davies said the company had secured a rescheduling of Pounds 1.3m of its bank borrowings, or 50 per cent of total debt, to long-term finance repayable in three to 10 years. Losses per share jumped to 21.8p (5.5p).</p>

A source at the National Unification Board said on Sunday  the  measures being reviewed are for implementation in two separate  stages: One for the period of reconciliation and cooperation  and the other for the period of South-North Commonwealth.    In the initial stage, the source said, the government plans  to call for improved human rights conditions in the North in  collusion with international human rights organizations like the  Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red  Cross.    Through these organizations, Seoul would ask Pyongyang to  allow, for instance, visits by human rights inspectors and stop  perpetrating torture and all other forms of maltreatment of  prisoners.    Another method under review is to adopt a human rights  manifesto applicable to all member countries in return for  economic cooperation for North Korea when a Northeast Asian  multilateral security dialogue involving North Korea is held.    The source said that when inter-Korean exchanges and  cooperation are promoted in earnest, the South could extend  support to the North with emphasis on those areas which could be  helpful to elevating the quality of the North Koreans' lives,  the source said.    In this stage, efforts could also be made to resolve the  dispersed family question on a priority basis without linking it  to political questions, he said.    The source said the board also feels the need to think about  the method of obtaining the release of political prisoners and  facilitating the reunion or meeting of displaced families in  return for some prices.    He noted that before their integration, West Germany paid  3,440 million marks in all to East Germany from 1963 to 1989 to  have the communist regime set free 34,000 political prisoners  and allow the reunion of 250,000 dispersed families.    Measures reserved for the stage of a South-North  Commonwealth  are centered on the promotion of mutual opening of the press.    In this stage the South could one-sidedly lift control on  the  viewing of North Korean television programs or subscribing to  North Korean newspapers, and, based thereon, ask North Korea to  reciprocate it, the source added.</p>

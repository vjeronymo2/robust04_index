			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / People: Critics and supporters on energy advice panel The government's first energy advisory panel, the composition of which was announced yesterday, includes at least three members likely to voice opposition to ministerial policies. But the government's free market approach to energy will also receive strong support from some members, not least Nigel Evans, managing director of Caminus Energy and an adviser to the government in the recent coal review. The panel includes energy industry executives and consultants, a city expert on privatisation and a union leader. The government announced its intention to set up the panel in the coal white paper after a recommendation from MPs on the trade and industry select committee. Among potential critics, Dieter Helm, a consultant with the Oxera research company, has consistently argued that the government should adopt a more centralised energy policy. He has also been a strong critic of the results of electricity privatisation. Criticism can also be expected from Tony Cooper, general secretary of the Engineers' and Managers' Association. His union is merging with the British Association of Coal Management and he is likely to argue forcefully for a strong role for coal. The case for coal will also be put by Mike Parker, former director of Economics at British Coal who recently published a gloomy prognosis of the industry's prospects. Among other members is Lynda Rouse, director of the public sector unit at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, who is a specialist on power and energy privatisation. Other members are: Lady Archer, chairman of the National Energy Foundation and of Lloyd's hardship committee; Ron Campbell, former managing director of Babcock Energy and a consultant; David Green, director of the Combined Heat and Power Association; Peter Ibbotson, construction director at Sainsbury; Alexander Kemp, economics professor at Aberdeeen University; Sam Laidlaw, managing director of Amerada Hess (UK); Paul Rich, managing director of Allied Steel and Wire; Ann Scully, vice chairman of the National Consumers Council and chair of the Domestic Coal Consumers' Association; Tony White of the National Grid; and Alan Williams, professor at Leeds University's energy department. The panel, chaired by Martin Holdgate, whose appointment is already announced, is to advise on the government's annual energy report, also published in the coal white paper. The report will provide 'information relevant to business and investment decisions', and will be published by mid-1994.</p>

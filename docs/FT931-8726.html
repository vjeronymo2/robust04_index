			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Singapore refines its status as an oil centre: Kieran Cooke reviews the recent and rapid growth of petroleum-related investments throughout Asia LAST week British Petroleum, Caltex and the local Singapore Petroleum Company announced a SDollars 1.3bn (Dollars 850m) refinery project in Singapore. This is significant, not just in dollar terms, since the centre of the world oil market is gravitating towards Asia. The project was the latest in a long list of petroleum-related investments by Shell, Mobil, Exxon and others in Singapore. Even at a time when its balance sheet is dipping into the red, BP is investing about SDollars 380m in this new facility. In the west, oil refining and related activities are either stagnating or declining. In Asia, and particularly in Singapore, they are growing rapidly. Singapore has become the world's third-biggest refining centre after Rotterdam and Houston. It now has a refining capacity of slightly over 1m b/d, supplying almost 40 per cent of Asia's imports of refined products. Singapore has also become - along with London and New York - one of the world's three main oil trading centres. Singapore's geographical position, at the centre of the supply chain from the Middle East to Asia's main markets in Japan and South Korea, is one reason for its growth as a petroleum centre but it also benefits from the rapidly developing economies of southeast Asia. Oil consumption in the Asia region is now rising by nearly 4 per cent per year compared with a world average growth of about 0.5 per cent. While Asia's own oil resources have been developed, the region's demand far outstrips supply. Only about 44 per cent of Asia's oil needs come from the region: the rest is imported, mainly from the Middle East. New oil fields being developed in the region are unlikely to alter this trend. By the end of the decade, oil analysts estimate that the Asia region will be consuming nearly 20m b/d compared with 13.8m b/d at present. China and Indonesia, both big regional producers, expect to become net importers by the end of the decade. The Gulf war, as well as Asia's fast economic growth, encouraged the expansion and upgrading programme in Singapore. Kuwait had been supplying large amounts of refined products, particularly gas oil and naphtha, to Asia. Suddenly there were shortages. The war underlined the fact that Asia had not been investing enough in refineries. Policies quickly changed: Japan brought mothballed refineries back into production, increasing refining capacity to nearly 5m b/d, and South Korea plans to double its refining capacity to 1.6m b/d. But other less financially endowed countries baulk at the idea of spending precious financial resources on refineries. A relatively unsophisticated facility with a capacity of 100,000 b/d now costs between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.5bn. In 1989 Indonesia announced plans to build nine more oil refineries. So far only one new refinery is under construction: expansion and upgrading work at existing plants was recently put on hold due to the introduction of tight government borrowing policies. Singapore is in the fortunate position of having an established refining industry: it is far cheaper to expand and upgrade existing plants than build new ones. The oil majors have all been refining in Singapore for several years. Shell now has its largest refinery world-wide on the island. While the upgrading process has been heavily capital intensive, it has led to cost efficiencies: Singapore is now regarded as among the world's most efficient refining centres and is attracting business from producer countries, most recently Kuwait and Bahrain. A petrochemical industry has developed alongside Singapore's refining sector. Du Pont, Mobil, GE plastics and others are investing more than SDollars 2bn in a variety of projects. A landfill project is planned which will unite five islands off the main island of Singapore into a SDollars 4bn petrochemical complex. Singapore interests have teamed up with Indonesian concerns to build what will be one of the world's biggest oil storage depots on the Indonesian island of Karimum, nearby to Singapore. In time both Japan and China could become refining competitors of Singapore. But Japan's refining costs are still more than 10 per cent above those of Singapore, while China's domestic demand for refined products is likely to blunt any growth in exports. Thailand, which has embarked on a large refinery building programme, could provide some additional competition. But for now Singapore is sitting pretty.</p>

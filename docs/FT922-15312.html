			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / World Trade News: ABB wins Dollars 305m Indian power deal ASEA BROWN BOVERI, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, has won a Dollars 305m contract to supply equipment for a 650MW combined cycle power plant to be built in India by a consortium involving Japan's Marubeni and Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The deal illustrates the growing trend for partnerships between western power equipment suppliers and Japanese companies to exploit fast-expanding Asian demand for power generating capacity. The contract, for a project at Gandhar due to come on stream in 1995, also illustrates importance of local manufacturing content for western suppliers in competitive markets. ABB in Germany will be the main supplier, together with ABB India, of three GT 13E gas turbines and accompanying steam generator and associated equipment. Marubeni will supply waste recovery boilers. The project is funded by Overseas Export Co-operation Finance (OECF), the Japanese export credit agency.</p>

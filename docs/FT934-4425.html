			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: P&amp;O in second China port investment Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation yesterday announced its second investment in Chinese container ports in 10 days. The group is to take a controlling stake in the Yangtze river port of Zhangjiagang. The terminal is being expanded to develop two container berths. P&amp;O believes it will become the focus of one of the main industrial centres of central China. The Zhangjiagang port can handle Panamax carriers, and the leading Chinese shipping groups already operate services to ports around Asia. The total cost of constructing the two berths will be about Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.5m). Last week, P&amp;O joined forces with Hong Kong's Swire Pacific to purchase 50 per cent of the container terminal at Shekou, in the Pearl River delta, for HKDollars 615m (Pounds 54m). The investment in Zhangjiagang is less ambitious. The terminal is situated about five hours upstream from Shanghai and currently has container capacity of 150,000 trailer equivalent units.</p>

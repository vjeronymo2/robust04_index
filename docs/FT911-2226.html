			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Malaysian stake taken by Morgan Grenfell MORGAN Grenfell, the UK merchant and investment bank owned by Germany's Deutsche Bank, announced yesterday that it had taken a 30 per cent stake in K&amp;N Kenanga, Malaysia's fifth largest stockbroker by volume. The deal ends two years of searching for a Malaysian partner by Morgan Grenfell. 'Kenanga is well-managed, clean, with no hidden liabilities,' said Mr Hsieh Fu Hua, regional managing director. The acquisition will strengthen Morgan Grenfell's ambition to establish a strong, independent presence in the south-east Asian securities market, in which Malaysia has been one of the most tightly controlled. Industry reforms introduced last year by the government, particularly through a 10-fold increase to MDollars 20m (Dollars 7.24m) in the minimum capital requirement, have forced Malaysian brokerage houses to restructure their businesses. Entry by foreign brokers remains difficult; in Morgan Grenfell's case, the acquisition was made possible by the decision of John Hancock International, the previous partner in Kenanga, to retreat from Malaysian equities and focus on insurance instead. Trading volumes at Kenanga, which controls a 10 to 15 per cent share of the market, are likely to rise once Morgan Grenfell transfers the business from its regional headquarters in Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. The group's move into Malaysia is also strategic, necessitated partly by the split between the local and Singapore bourses in January last year. Over-the-counter trading in Singapore is expected to disappear when the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange introduces scripless trading by next year. Morgan Grenfell has the option to raise its Kenanga stake to 49 per cent - the official limit - within three years. This reflects the fact that the UK group is the most active foreign brokerage in Malaysia. W I Carr is the only other large international securities group with any equity involvement in the country; it operates a research office, but its 30 per cent shareholding in Seagrott and Campbell has largely been passive.</p>

[Begin Alem recording] In its statement, the council said  that it had been following the situation in Burundi very keenly  since the November coup attempt. At the present time, when  everything possible is being done to solve this problem  peacefully, some unwanted things are happening in the country to  disrupt the national reconciliation process and are plunging the  country into chaos. In the light of new developments, the  council, in its five point- resolution, reaffirmed its support  for last year's election results and urged the country's army to  work faithfully for the benefit of the people by not considering  people's political affiliations. The council also expressed its  support for sending an international peacekeeping force and  observer team to bring peace and stability to Burundi. The  council expressed its solidarity with the people of Burundi in  their tribulation. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

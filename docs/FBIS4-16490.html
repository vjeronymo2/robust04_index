			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sharip Asuyev] </F>   [Text] Groznyy April 17 TASS -- Yaragi Mamodayev, head of  the Chechen Government of People's Confidence which is in  opposition to the republic's current authorities, called upon  the leaders of all political forces and movements to achieve  national conciliation with an aim to work out a single position  at the upcoming talks with Russia.    Commenting on the decree by President Boris Yeltsin,  instructing the Russian Government to resume consultations with  the Chechen side in order to overcome the present social and  political crisis, the Chechen opposition leader said on Sunday:  "This document, confirming the commitment by the Russian  leadership to a political settlement of our differences, gives a  historical chance to the Chechen people. But under the current  confrontation within Chechen society, we cannot seize this  chance and take a civilized path of building our statehood.  Those who do not understand this or consciously oppose the  process of national reconciliation are taking an anti-popular  stand".    Mamodayev said his government of people's confidence  believes  that Russia's attempts to contact not only with Chechen  President Dzhokhar Dudayev but also with his political opponents  threatened to mount political confrontation in the republic and  complicate the fragile negotiating process. For this reason, we  urge all our compatriots not to divide themselves into Dudayev's  supporters and opponents but to subordinate their personal or  corporate ambitions to the national interests in order to pull  the long-suffering Chechen Republic out of the general crisis,  the leader emphasised.    Mamodayev is convinced that none of the political movements  or groups can reflect the will of the whole people. With this  in view, we suggest convening a Congress of the Chechen People  in the near future and work out a single attitude towards  relations between Russia and Chechnya, he said in conclusion.</p>

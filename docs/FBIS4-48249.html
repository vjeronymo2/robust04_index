			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Alpha Conde, secretary general of the Rally </F> of the Guinean People, by Africa No. 1 correspondent Jean de  Dieu Ndong Ovono; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Conde] The situation in Guinea is deadlocked on  the political, social, financial, and economic levels. There is  a deadlock on the political level because no new government has  been formed since the elections. The old one is still in place.  Now when everyone is expecting a cabinet reshuffle, no minister  works. The president himself said on television that Guinean  ministers do not believe in God and that they spend all their  time consulting fetish priests as they do not know whether they  will remain ministers or not. So ministers do not work and  neither do civil servants. Civil servants no longer obey their  ministers because they could also become ministers in future.  The administration, therefore, is not functioning properly and  political life has come to a standstill.    On the financial level, an IMF team visited the country in  March but no agreement was signed, so there is also a deadlock  at that level. On the economic level, investors have recently  hesitated to invest in the country because of insecurity,  corruption within the legal system, lawlessness, and an  administration bogged down by bureaucracy. Coupled with this,  political uncertainty does not augur well for the economy, so  there are no investments. On the social level, people's living  conditions have worsened terribly, especially in the informal  sector. Petty traders and others have had their shops damaged  and vandalized without any compensation....    [Ovono, interrupting] Do you not think that the opposition  is  partly to blame for this political, economic, and social  deadlock since the government, and indeed President Conte, have  made an effort by inviting the opposition to become part of a  national union government?    [Conde] I think it is a double-edged invitation because  since  the elections, extremist elements within the presidential group  have forced President Lansana Conte to brutally suppress Rally  of the Guinean People [RPG] activists. In Haute-Guinee and  Guinee-Forestiere Regions, RPG activists have been arrested,  imprisoned, beaten, and asked to pay heavy fines so it is rather  confrontation that the authorities have extended to us. [passage  omitted]. In our view, the government is doing everything  possible to destroy the RPG but, thank God, the more RPG  activists are suppressed, the more determined they become.    [Ovono] Do you not believe that as a member of the national  union government, you, as the RPG leader, could help to end this  state of affairs?    [Conde] You know, people engage in politics for two reasons:  They do so either because they have an ideal [words indistinct]  or because they are bread and butter minded and therefore fight  for a portfolio or for a presidential seat. The RPG is a party  that is fighting for an ideal. This ideal, which remains the  same, is the fight for democratic change in Guinea and the  establishment of the rule of law for sound and rigorous  management of state affairs: in other words, the fight against  all forms of corruption and ethnocentrism. We can join in the  management of state affairs only if this will help achieve this  ideal. Of course, we try to avoid excesses; we do not want  clashes because we do not want a civil war. That is why I said I  did not come to govern cemeteries; but that does not mean we are  going to accept just anything. We are not bread and butter  minded, that is, we are not ready to give up our ideals for  material gains. [passage omitted]</p>

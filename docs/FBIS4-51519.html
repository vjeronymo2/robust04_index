			<p>BFN     [Text] Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan, in an interview with a local TV  station in Oita City on 29 April, indicated the possibility of  the House of Representatives being dissolved for a general  election once the fiscal 1994 budget is passed. He said: "Some  people say the next election should be held only under the  single-seat electoral district system. But if there is no  prospect for finding a breakthrough in the current political  stalemate, there will be no other choice [but to hold the  election under the current medium district system]."</p>

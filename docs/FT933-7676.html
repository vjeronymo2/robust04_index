			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Nippon Kayaku to raise its prices NIPPON KAYAKU, the Japanese chemicals company which is the world's biggest supplier of an epoxy resin used in making semiconductors, is to raise its prices by as much as 30 per cent, writes Gordon Cramb in Tokyo. The move follows an explosion last month which halted production by Sumitomo Chemical, the market leader, until the end of the year. It lends substance to fears among chip makers that epoxy makers will use the shortfall in supply caused by the accident to restore profit margins, which had been eroded by aggressive pricing. Nippon Kayaku said yesterday it was investing Y1bn (Pounds 6.5m) to enlarge capacity at its plant and would increase prices from next month by at least Y200 a kilogram, from its current Y600-Y700 range. Its expanded production will come on stream in January. About then, Sumitomo is to restore half its previous capacity.</p>

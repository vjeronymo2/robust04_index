			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, March 8 (TANJUG) -- Spokeswoman for the U.N.  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sylvana Foa on Tuesday  announced that the airfield near Tuzla, a Moslem-controlled town  in north-eastern Bosnia, would be reopened in 7-10 days if  everything went as planned.    At a press conference, Foa stated precisely that an  agreement  would be signed, envisaging which air corridors would be used  and which countries would use the airfield near Tuzla. Runway  of the airfield requiring a thorough repair is the greatest  problem at the moment, said Foa.    The U.N. Nordic battalion on Monday began to deploy troops  around the airfield near Tuzla. The agreement on the opening of  the airfield near Tuzla was reached after Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic had given his consent, provided Russian  observers controlled all air shipments, to make sure no arms,  ammunition and equipment were supplied to the Bosnian Moslems.    Humanitarian land convoys pass through Bosnia mainly  unhindered, said Foa and added that 7,320 tonnes of food,  medicine and clothes were distributed last week, accounting for  73 percent of the total needs. She confirmed it was the highest  total reached by the U.N. in that former Yugoslav republic.    Foa, however, accused the Bosnian Serb side of what she  called stopping of the convoys headed for Tuzla and eastern  enclaves.    Bosnian Serbs check the contents of the convoys, because  earlier experience had proved that they transported arms and  equipment to the Moslems. Checking of the convoys does not mean  their stopping, because all of them passed unimpeded and safely  through the Bosnian Serb territory and reached the Moslem  territories, as was confirmed by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]  reports.    The bulk of humanitarian aid to which foa referred arrives  from Yugoslavia via the Bosnian Serb territory to the Moslems,  because this is the safest way since land routes from Croatia to  Bosnia are unsafe due to one-year-old bitter Croat-Moslem  fighting in central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

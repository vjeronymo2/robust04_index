			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Appointments: 'More opportunity' in private estates Nicholas Miller, a 42-year-old chartered surveyor, has become director of commercial developments at Grosvenor Developments, a division of Grosvenor Estate Holdings, one of the largest private estates in the country. Miller's task is to manage the developments which are already under way and to seek new opportunities within and outside the estate's holdings. 'In a recession there are some enormous opportunities . . . my challenge is to find those for Grosvenor Estate,' he says. Grosvenor Estate is not immune from the property recession but it is still prepared to undertake new developments. By contrast, MEPC, Miller's former employer, is thought unlikely to get involved in any during the current slump. Established private companies may offer more opportunities than the quoted sector at present, in Miller's view. 'A public company always has to keep an eye on the shareholder issues. You cannot ignore the issues in a responsible private company, but such companies are able to take a longer view.' While a director of MEPC, Miller was involved in its Finsbury Circus, St James's Square and Chilworth developments. ***** Richard Bate has been appointed director of ICC United Kingdom, the British affiliate of the International Chamber of Commerce, the Paris-based organisation which promotes the interests of private business. ICC United Kingdom rep-resents more than 300 British businesses - including BP, Shell, ICI and Unilever - in working with the International Chamber to promote private sector business interests around the world. Bate, 53, has had a career in marketing and international management and has previously been managing director of several companies, including Nicholas Laboratories, Guinness Plastics, Wyeth Laboratories and Wilkinson Sword. He joins the organisation after a period as an executive search consultant, and replaces Rodney Sutton.</p>

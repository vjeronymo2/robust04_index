			<p>BFN     [Text] Fukushima, May 22 KYODO -- The leader of the  country's second largest opposition party renewed its call for  the minority cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to resign  immediately after the state budget passes the Diet.    Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party  [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], said there is no difference of opinion  between him and the party's No. 2 man, Wataru Kubo, the SDPJ  secretary general.    On Saturday in China, Kubo said that the Hata cabinet should  resign en masse soon after the Diet approves the fiscal 1994  budget bills and before the opposition camp submits a  no-confidence motion.    Murayama, delivering a speech in the city of Fukushima, some  270 kilometers northeast of Tokyo, said talks can be launched  among various political parties to restructure the coalition  government.    The present coalition is mainly formed by Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party], Komeito, and the Japan New Party. The SDPJ,  which was the No. 1 component of the previous cabinet led by  Morihiro Hosokawa, quit the coalition late last month in protest  against the abrupt formation of a large parliamentary group  excluding the SDPJ.    Meanwhile, the SDPJ chairman also said a dissolution of the  House of Representatives for a snap general election might be  inevitable in the event of political turmoil. "There may be no  other way but to seek the judgment of voters," he said.</p>

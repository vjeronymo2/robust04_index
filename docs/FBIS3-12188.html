			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yitzhaq Rabin, the prime minister and defense  minister, has decided to transfer the security in the Cave of  the Patriarchs from the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to the  Border Police. This was divulged today by Police Minister Moshe  Shahal. Our police affairs correspondent Uri Kohen-Aharonov  reports the battalion-strong force will collect all the weapons  from the Jewish worshipers. Senior sources in the Police  Ministry regard this decision as a sign for the transference of  more powers to the police in the territories. The police  minister also said he intends to facilitate the erection of a  security fence above the Western Wall. The proposal to erect  this fence was one of the main recommendations of the Hefetz  Committee which investigated the Temple Mount bloodbath three  years ago. Minister Shahal supported the implementation of the  recommendation, but so far it was delayed.    In a meeting this evening in the defense minister's office  in  Tel Aviv it was decided to examine a series of steps to be taken  against inciting elements from among the settlers in Hebron and  Qiryat Arba'. The meeting was attended by the prime minister,  the police minister, the attorney general, and security  elements. Police Minister Shahal told our correspondent Menashe  Raz this evening that there is only one law for Jews and Arabs:    [Begin recording] [Raz] Mr. Shahal, you just came from a  consultation held with the prime minister. Have you decided on  a series of steps to be taken against inciting elements from  among the Hebron and Qiryat Arba' settlers?    [Shahal] I cannot give details. We held a discussion which  reviewed all the problems. The legal and operational  ramifications were raised. The discussion was held on a  professional and general level, without entering the details of  the issue. The attorney general, the chief of staff, the  commander of the Central Command and other elements participated  in the consultation.    [Raz] Does the current law in force in the territories allow  you to deport elements you do not want to remain in the  territories, or to implement other measures against inciting  Jewish elements?    [Shahal] The authority vested with the commanders of the IDF  Commands and other military officers are sufficiently broad to  enable them to implement steps when the commander believes there  is a danger to the public's security. In order to prevent this  danger he is entitled to order an administrative detention or to  remove the persons concerned, or to limit their exit from or  entrance to certain areas. He can implement these steps on the  basis of information he possesses and if he believes this is  necessary to maintain security. In these hours of hardship,  however, we must not forget that we must preserve civil rights  and Israel's democracy.    [Raz] Are you referring only to Kakh people, or to other  familiar figures in Qiryat Arba' and Hebron who are not Kakh  members?    [Shahal] We are referring to whoever might pose a danger to  security and those who intend to carry out attacks or have done  so in the past.    [Raz] Mr. Shahal, in yesterday's cabinet session, ministers  referred to the necessity of implementing dramatic steps in the  wake of the new situation. Will one of this dramatic steps be  implemented in Hebron and Qiryat Arba' in the next few hours?    [Shahal] I cannot answer this question. I do not think that  any dramatic steps are called for. We need a step within the  limits of the law, to be implemented firmly and without any  hesitations against whoever tries to break the law. Here we  will not discriminate: Everybody, no matter what his  nationality, is subjected to the same law. The Israeli  Government is bound to act on the basis of this principle, both  morally and legally.    [Raz] Today we have seen that the intifadah crossed the  Green Line. There were riots in Yafo and in Israeli Arab  villages. I assume the government is very concerned about this.    [Shahal] The prime minister will shortly meet the heads of  the Israeli Arab sector. I will also attend this meeting. We  are calling on the Israeli Arab population not to lend  themselves to incitement and extremists. Relations between the  Israeli Arab population and the state have always been good.  They know very well what the government is doing. We are  calling on them -- and especially on their leadership -- to  prevent inciters and extremists from gaining control.    The Israeli Police are evincing great restraint, but at the  same time we will firmly prevent any deterioration in the  situation. This must be very clear to all those who tried to  violate the law. We are holding several detainees, and we will  deal with them according to law. I hope tempers will calm down.  We will continue acting as we have always done, as a law  abiding country where all the citizens must act according to the  law. [end recording]</p>

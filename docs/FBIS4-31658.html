			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Josef Moravcik by Alena </F> Melicharkova; place and date not given: "I Am Not at All Afraid  of Elections"]    [Excerpt] The final deadline for parties and movements to  decide whether they will run in the elections independently, in  a coalition, or on the slate of a stronger party is drawing  near. Representatives of the Democratic Union announced some  time ago that they would run independently. This will be no easy  test for them. We talked to Jozef Moravcik, chairman of the  Democratic Union and prime minister, about this difficulty and  other issues.    [Melicharkova] After our interview several months ago, you  said in a certain context that you were not afraid of anything.  Are you not afraid of the coming elections and their results?  When you look at the results of the current public opinion  polls....    [Moravcik] I am not at all afraid of the elections. To run  in  the elections, you need determination, above all. We have enough  determination and the needed amount of self-confidence to run in  the elections. We are trying to draft a very serious program  that will be convincing--that is, we are creating the conditions  for obtaining positive results in the elections. What is  important is that we perform our duties well in order to  convince the people that this style of government and politics,  above all, are viable and capable of solving long-term problems  of development in Slovakia. The current public opinion polls  confirm that the coalition that has formed the government could  continue. We will try to improve its position.    [Melicharkova] Do you anticipate that this or a similar  government coalition could exist after the elections?    [Moravcik] This is one of the alternatives, and, in my  opinion, it is quite likely.    [Melicharkova] You intend to present a summary of your  government's activity to parliament before the elections. What  do you consider to be the greatest success of your government  Cabinet?    [Moravcik] We would like to develop in the economic field  some activities that would stimulate development, which means  outweighing a certain restriction that we have to impose in the  state budget. This restriction is inevitable but should be  counterbalanced by development stimuli. This is what we want to  secure in the period before the elections.    [Melicharkova] The coalition government is a very  interesting  compromise, and its seems to be a good one for Slovakia. On the  other hand, this coalition is very fragile. The most interesting  solutions are reportedly reached during strong differences of  opinion. Have you ever experienced a tough conflict or  difference of opinion in your government?    [Moravcik] We cannot speak of conflicts. A difference of  opinion is very natural and happens very often. It is quite a  usual working method and a usual way of solving problems. From  this point of view, everything is all right. Regarding the basic  problem, I believe this coalition is less fragile than the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] was. The HZDS was  unable to retain its compactness. It was unable to keep its  election results. I am convinced that this coalition is stronger  and capable of exercising its power in the period for which it  has received a mandate or in the period for which it could  possibly receive a mandate after the elections.    [Melicharkova] It is often said that you have a calming  effect on people. Was this not your main trait that you used to  appeal to the people? Public opinion polls show that you are  catching up with your predecessor. Or is there another reason  for that?    [Moravcik] Personally, I have never analyzed this problem,  so  I will leave it up to the people. Maybe everything you said  plays a part. I believe that the Slovak electorate is very  rational and can very well express or reflect values that are  important for Slovakia in this or that period. Maybe in this  very period it is important to be able to calm the public and  introduce a certain amount of discretion into decisionmaking.    [Melicharkova] One of our readers says that you are an  artist  when it comes to diplomatic answers. According to her, you can  speak for a long time and say nothing. Why do politicians give  diplomatic answers from time to time?    [Moravcik] I only speak exceptionally for a long time. I  always try to say what is essential.    [Melicharkova] The Democratic Union wants to be a liberal  party, but, in our part of the world, it has not been clearly  explained yet what liberalism actually is. At a conference in  the United States not so long ago, J. Carnogursky, chairman of  the Christian Democratic Movement, defined liberalism as being  very dangerous. What is liberalism, which the Democratic Union,  of which you are the chairman, is going to push for?    [Moravcik] Liberalism is a basic orientation. We are  interested in establishing a skeleton program for the  development of Slovakia in which the basic ideas of liberalism  would be used. Many publications and books have been written  about the essence of liberalism. Liberalism emphasizes human  values, human beings, and their responsibility. Liberal policy  is also oriented that way. If we speak about economy, this  policy is based on individual initiative, which means private  ownership and emphasis on the responsibility of the individual  not only in the sphere of economy but also in other spheres. For  example, in the social sphere, liberalism prefers activities of  the nongovernmental sector, various foundations, and similar  organizations to the paternalism of the state, even if some  paternalism cannot be avoided. Our intention is to create  conditions for the people to be able to solve basic problems  themselves, while the state should intervene where people are  unable to solve these problems by their own activities or  through institutions under civil law. This policy, in which the  individual and his development have a central place, is based on  support for education because education and cultural  development, in fact, intensify the significance of the  individual in society. Those are, in a certain sense, basic  directions.    [Melicharkova] When you speak about the responsibility of  the  individual, what is the responsibility of the politician  according to this philosophy?    [Moravcik] He secures the execution of the political power,  state power, in a direction that makes it possible to develop  society's mechanisms on these principles. This means that a  liberal politician, above all, has to make it possible for the  people to be able to secure the development of their own  character and thus the development of society as a whole.    [Melicharkova] Governments are either successful or  unsuccessful according to the extent to which they are able to  secure economic development, which is closely linked to  cooperation with economic experts. Whom do you consider to be  the top expert in Slovakia? If we look at the Czech Republic,  the country is swarming with economists. What is your opinion of  Prime Minister Klaus's policy in that respect?    [Moravcik] Regarding your question on whom I consider to be  the best economist...? I am a proponent of teamwork. I do not  see any prominent person in Slovakia whom I could describe in  that way. However, we have a lot of wise and competent experts,  many of whom have a good chance of becoming good politicians.  Regarding Mr. Klaus, I highly respect him as a politician. Above  all, I appreciate his ability to make an unequivocal analysis  that enables him to pinpoint and describe the essence of the  matter very quickly and make a decision. Then there is the  consistency in his policy. Despite the fact that I do not always  agree with him politically, I have to respect the methods he is  using.    [Melicharkova] My previous question was also linked to the  question of who would be a better prime minister, an economist  or a lawyer.... Do you see any advantages in the prime minister  being a professional?    [Moravcik] This can have certain advantages. However, a  politician should be universal--that is, the said criteria are  only auxiliary. Of course, it depends on the function. You  mentioned the function of prime minister: Here, universality is  very important. The experience he acquires during his studies,  as well as practical experience later on, is very important.  However, professional orientation is only an auxiliary aspect.  [passage omitted]</p>

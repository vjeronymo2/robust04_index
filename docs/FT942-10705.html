			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Exceptional goodwill charge puts Elan IPounds 49.5m in red Correction (published 12th May 1994) appended to this article. Elan Corporation, the Athlone-based pharmaceutical company, reported a pre-tax loss of IPounds 49.5m (Pounds 48.3m) for the year to March 31 after exceptional charges of IPounds 85.1m relating mainly to goodwill write-off of an acquisition. The previous year there was a profit of IPounds 22.5m. Operating profits were ahead by 47 per cent from IPounds 19.8m to IPounds 29.1m on turnover up 19 per cent to IPounds 107m (IPounds 89.8m). A breakdown of turnover showed the main growth occurred in royalties up from IPounds 12.6m to IPounds 19.9m, licence and option fees from IPounds 5.72m to IPounds 13.5m, and manufacturing and distribution income from IPounds 57.3m to IPounds 58.9m. Losses per share came out at 144p, against earnings of 67p. No dividend is payable, as under New York Stock Exchange rules, where the company has its primary listing, Elan is classified as a growth stock and not permitted to pay dividends. It has IPounds 148m in cash and short-term investments, IPounds 95m of which was raised in an issue of subordinated loan notes in October 1992. Mr Tom Lynch, financial director, said: 'This gives us the strength and leverage to fund acquisitions and organic growth.' He added, however, that the company had no plans at present to make an acquisition. Elan has built up a niche market in the development of dermal patches and by extending the patents of established pharmaceutical products through their further development in making their gastric absorption more controlled, facilitating once-a-day dosage. Elan has 19 products approved for distribution in 44 countries, which focus on the treatment of chronic ailments such as cardio-vascular and arthritic diseases. It plans to have a range of new electrical trans-dermal drug delivery devices on the market before the end of the decade. CORRECTION Elan Corporation is listed on the American Stock Exchange and not the New York Stock Exchange as reported in Tuesday's FT.</p>

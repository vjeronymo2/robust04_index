			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Schroder Wagg wins sell-off role J. HENRY Schroder Wagg, the UK merchant bank, has been selected to advise on the privatisation of MVM, Hungary's electricity utility, the AV RT state holding company has announced. MVM is Hungary's second largest company with net sales in 1992 of Ft 102bn (Dollars 1.1bn), on which it made profits of Ft 1.88bn. Competition was vigorous for the advisory role in the last significant mandate in Hungary's four-year privatisation programme. Schroders was selected over Credit Suisse First Boston and Salomon Brothers. CSFB and Salomon are among the most active western investment banks in Hungary, and Schroders' only previous government mandate has been to advise on the accelerated privatisation programme. However, Schroders was lead adviser to the UK government on the sale of the water industry, and the firm's international experience in utility privatisation appears to have been decisive. Advisers hope that the MVM sale can be completed next year, probably after elections scheduled for May. Under present guidelines, the state will retain a shareholding of 50 per cent plus one, leaving a minority for privatisation. Advisers also judge that flotation is inappropriate, which suggests a trade sale. Beyond that, the structure of the sale remains uncertain. Much will depend on forthcoming electricity market regulation and the outcome of the elections. MVM is the last of Hungary's large state-owned utilities to take on a consultant. Lazard Freres of France advised on the privatisation of the state oil company, MOL, earlier this year, and AV RT expects a sale in one or two years. Salomon is advising Matav, the telecommunications company, on the sale of a minority shareholding.</p>

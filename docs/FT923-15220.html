			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Arts: Today's Television If I said that Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson, whose embarrassing comedy series Bottom is being repeated on BBC2 (9.00), were 'white and proud', or that Hale and Pace, whose tacky comedy series Hale and Pace is being repeated on Channel 4 (10.30), were experts at creating 'white centred comedy', television producers would be appalled. Why, then, are they so ready to patronise Lenny Henry by lauding his 'black centred comedy'? It is true he is black, but equally true that Chaplin and Keaton were white. Do we celebrate their comedy in terms of their skin colour? Who cares? Television executives do because they believe in apartheid. They think that without special treatment black people will never make it, hence ghetto slots where blacks don't have to compete for attention with more gifted whites. What hooey. The billing for today's repeat of a Lenny Henry Show (10.00 BBC2) asserts that Henry is 'one of the few comedians successfuly to have created black-centred comedy'. What about Gary Wilmot, Sammy Davis Jr, and Norman Beaton? Bill Cosby, Eddie Murphy? The trouble with broadcasting executives is that they see so little television.</p>

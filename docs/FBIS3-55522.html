Elections are set for 6 March 1994. The voters of the  Koryak Okrug are to elect eight deputies to the okrug Duma, two  deputies from each rayon, who will work on a full time basis.    The decree of the okrug electoral commission establishes the  okrug electoral districts, some of which will be territorial,  and others, national. The composition of the rayon electoral  commissions is to be submitted for approval before 14 January.  The commissions will prepare and conduct the election of  deputies to the okrug Duma.

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Hungary wary of debt swap deal: Russia aims to cut Dollars 900m arrears with innovative package Moscow yesterday agreed to offer stakes in Russian ventures as part of an innovative settlement of the country's Dollars 900m (Pounds 616.4m) trade debt with Hungary, the former Soviet satellite. In Budapest this week a Russian delegation, led by Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, presented a list of 80 privatisation projects in which Hungarian participation was invited. Mr Bela Kadar, Hungarian minister of international economic relations, said Hungarian companies were pressing for shareholdings in the Russian energy, vehicle manufacturing and pharmaceutical sectors. The minister calculated that Hungary's proposals implied a debt-for-equity deal worth up to Dollars 500m but cautioned: 'We have to harmonise Hungarian demand and Russian supply.' Budapest will be aware of the limited success so far of debt-for-equity swaps with Russia. Skoda Plsen, the Czech engineering company, last year pressed for shareholdings in Russian rolling stock companies in exchange for trade debt, without success. Nevertheless Hungary said it had little choice. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said: 'If there is this debt, we have to use it.' The Russian deal with Hungary is the mirror image of the situation in the former Soviet Union, where Russia is the creditor, attempting to retrieve debts from other former Soviet republics. Russia last month pushed for ownership in Ukrainian underground gas storage tanks and gas transit pipelines as part of a debt settlement with Kiev. In the former Soviet Union, Russian demands for equity in the energy industry are also seen as an effort to regain economic influence. To pay off the remainder of the arrears to Hungary by the agreed deadline of 1996, Russian enterprises may also assist in the construction of Budapest's fourth metro line as well as supplying military equipment. Any arms sales would be in addition to the deal last year whereby Hungary acquired 28 Mig-29 fighter aircraft, spare parts and ammunition worth Dollars 800m from Russia. When east European countries closed the books on their trade under the Comecon system in 1992, Russia carried over a debt of Dollars 1.7bn with Hungary. Nearly half of that outstanding balance was cleared last year and yesterday's deal settled much of the remainder, at least in principle. Claims carried over from the previous trading system have proved a constant factor, and often irritant, in relations between Moscow and the former Soviet satellites. Russia paid off some of its debt to Slovakia last year by delivering five Mig-29 aircraft. Moscow and the Czech Republic have not come to terms.</p>

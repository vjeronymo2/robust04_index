			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Retail sales defy tax increases: Treasury 'wise men' upbeat on recovery - Bank warns against rate cut Signs that Britain's economic recovery is withstanding April's tax increases were reinforced yesterday after an unexpected rise in monthly retail sales and an upbeat verdict from Treasury advisers. But although figures from the Central Statistical Office strengthened the picture of subdued price rises, Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, further damped hopes of an interest rate cut, stressing that now was not the time 'to take risks on the side of inflation'. Retail sales volumes rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent in April, compared with March, and 4.4 per cent year-on-year. The British Retail Consortium, the main industry body, said preliminary reports from retailers indicated that the rise was continuing this month. The figures surprised the City, which had predicted that April's tax increases, coupled with the impact of an early Easter holiday, would depress consumer spending. Meanwhile, the Treasury said there was now a 'steady upward trend in retail sales, which is further evidence of economic recovery'. However, it warned that it was still too early to assess the full impact of April's tax rises on consumer spending. Analysts stressed that the real impact would not be known until the summer, when the full range of tax increases began to bite into households' monthly budgets. A report from the so-called 'wise men', the Treasury's panel of independent forecasters, predicted that the recovery would withstand the tax rise, and that growth in gross domestic product would be 2.9 per cent this year - ahead of the government's forecast - and 2.8 per cent in 1995. But although this optimistic message was supported by yesterday's sales data, City analysts doubted whether the seasonal adjustment used in calculating April's figure had accurately reflected the fact that Easter - and the heavy pre-Easter shopping week - had occurred in March, not April, this year. The CSO admitted this meant 'there was more uncertainty surrounding the figures than usual'. But the three-month figures, generally regarded as the more accurate indicator of trends, showed that retail sales' volumes rose by 1 per cent between February and April, compared with the previous three months. The data also underlined the low level of retail inflation, with the total value of sales virtually unchanged between March and April, in spite of the volume growth. Nevertheless, Mr George warned against the danger of further cuts in interest rates. Speaking to the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, he warned against easing policy 'in anticipation of a weakening of activity . . . which may not materialise'. The governor pointed to the rise in average earnings, announced on Wednesday, as a dangerous sign of inflationary expectations. His caution was echoed by the Treasury panel, four of whom said they saw little need for a change in interest rates. However, all bar one of the six panellists expect underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, to remain within the government's target range this year and next.

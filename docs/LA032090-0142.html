			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SPRING MOUNTAIN GROUP OF NEWPORT BUYS PIONEER S&amp;L  </P> <P> Abandoned twice by suitors in recent years, Orange County's smallest thrift,  Pioneer Savings &amp; Loan, finally has tied the knot with the Spring Mountain  Group in Newport Beach, the new owner disclosed Monday.  </P> <P> Spring Mountain, whose primary subsidiary is Spring Mountain Escrow Corp., won  state and federal regulatory approvals late last week to purchase Pioneer, said  Christine Sanderson, the group's president. The new owner will take control  next Monday, she said.  </P> <P> Anne Bacon, a former Downey Savings &amp; Loan executive who ran Butterfield  Savings &amp; Loan for regulators while it was in receivership, will be  Pioneer's new president, Sanderson said.  </P> <P> Sanderson did not reveal the price, but she said Pioneer's book value at the  end of February was about $350,000. As part of the deal, federal regulators  required Spring Mountain to put $3 million into the S&amp;L's capital base, its  final reserve against losses, to revive the troubled institution.  </P> <P> Pioneer has not had a profitable year since it opened in 1985. The S&amp;L's  assets dropped to $14.6 million at the end of September from a high of $22.2  million in December, 1986. It lost $325,000 for the first nine months last  year.  </P> <P> Sanderson said Pioneer will now look for a branch to buy in the Newport Beach  or Laguna Beach area and move out of its second-floor offices in Newport  Center, a location that isn't conducive to gathering deposits from walk-in  customers. The new owner plans to change the S&amp;L's name, possibly to  Southern Cities Bank, she said.  </P> <P> Pioneer's lending initially will focus on residential loans for those who buy  the homes built by Spring Mountain Escrow's builder clients, Sanderson said.  </P> <P> As part of the deal, Spring Mountain and Pioneer will be indemnified for any  damages in pending litigation between Pioneer's lone shareholder, Palm Springs  builder James Deane, and seven others over the financing for the S&amp;L's  start-up five years ago. That litigation has thwarted two other attempts to  sell the institution.  </P></p>

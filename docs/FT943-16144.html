			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Building upturn 'to remain weak' The construction recovery will remain weak because of a sluggish housing market and lower public spending, say independent forecasters which previously provided output estimates for the National Economic Development Office, Andrew Taylor writes. But figures published by the Department of the Environment yesterday showed that housebuilding activity continued to increase during the first five months of this year. The department said builders started work on 7 per cent more homes during the three months to the end of May compared with the corresponding period last year. More recently, builders and estate agents have reported that the pace of sales recovery has faltered after increases in tax and fixed interest rate mortgages. According to Construction Forecasting and Research, total construction output is likely to rise by 1 per cent this year, by a further 2 per cent next year and 2.5 per cent in 1996. This follows three consecutive years of decline in which the value of construction output at constant 1990 prices fell by 12 per cent. Mrs Jacquie Cannon, CFR director, said: 'While there are many positive indications, the fragile state of the housing recovery together with the problem of government finance does dampen expectations.' Infrastructure output, which had risen by two-fifths between 1990 and last year helped by the construction of the Channel tunnel, is forecast to fall 9 per cent this year and a further 5.5 per cent next year. Private-sector housing output, which rose 9.5 per cent last year, is forecast to rise 5.5 per cent this year and 7 per cent next year. JFC Construction Forecasts 1994/5/6.

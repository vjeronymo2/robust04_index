Two policemen  arrested Johnson Aristide of the grass-roots organization "Sun  of Justice for the Liberation of the Haitian People" [Sol de la  Justicia para la Liberacion del Pueblo Haitiano] while he  attempted to deliver a press note to Radio Plus, a radio station  in downtown Port-au- Prince, the Haitian press agency reported.    Aristide, who is not related to the president, was struck  and  forced into an automobile used by the police, the source  informed.    Soldiers arrested several of President Aristide's supporters  this weekend in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area.    Uniformed members of the military arrested Engineer Jacques  Dorcean in the Thomassin area in eastern Port-au-Prince.  Dorcean is a well-known supporter of the Lavalas Movement,  which backed the exiled president in the December 1990 elections.    According to press reports, 20-year-old Val Maxime [not  further identified] was also arrested and seriously beaten.    On Saturday, the home of Jean-Camille Calvin in Lillavois,  an  alleged Aristide follower, was strafed with machine-gun fire.  Lillavois lives in northern Port-au-Prince.    So far the military has not released any information  regarding the reason for the arrests.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Power Corp studies US investments POWER Corp of Canada, with nearly CDollars 1bn (USDollars 700m) of cash and short-term investments, is considering several new projects in the US, says Mr Paul Desmarais, chairman. In all, Power Corp and Pargesa, the jointly-owned European holding company, have cash resources totalling CDollars 2.5bn and very low debt, Mr Desmarais said. 'We're making satisfactory progress reinvesting these liquid resources, and areas of interest also take in Europe, Asia and Latin America.' Power Corp plans a joint-venture industrial park in China and later may enter the life insurance business there. Its first-quarter net profit fell to CDollars 29.6m, or 23 cents a share, from CDollars 39.2m, or 30 cents, a year earlier. The decline was mainly due to reduced special gains on Pargesa asset sales.</p>

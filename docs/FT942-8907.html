			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Amey to raise Pounds 10m via market listing  -New issues Amey Holdings, one of the UK's largest private construction companies and the sixth biggest roadbuilder, plans to raise about Pounds 10m in new money when it comes to the market next month. Existing shareholders, including Close Brothers which holds a 25 per cent stake on behalf of approximately 30 investment institutions, also expect to raise Pounds 10m by selling some of their holdings. Amey, which issued a pathfinder prospectus yesterday, is expected to have a stock market value of about Pounds 50m when the price of the issue is announced on June 2. The shares will not be offered for sale but will be placed with Baring Bros, sponsor to the issue. James Capel will act as broker. The company, previously part of the ARC building materials and construction group, was briefly a Hanson subsidiary when ARC was acquired from Consolidated Goldfields by Hanson in August 1989. Amey was sold almost immediately by Hanson for Pounds 6.5m to Amey directors: Mr Neil Ashley, executive chairman, Mr Eddie King, managing director, Mr David Cawthorne, finance director and Mr Richard Douglas, managing director of Amey Building. Mr Ashley said the company's continuing businesses made pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.7m last year on group sales of Pounds 210m, compared with profits of just Pounds 300,000 on sales of Pounds 70m in 1989. If losses from the former electrical business of JM Jones, now closed, are included pre-tax profits last year would be reduced to Pounds 2.16m At the end of December Amey had net cash of Pounds 8.64m.</p>

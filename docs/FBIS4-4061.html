			<p>BFN     [Text] The seven-day Second Session of the Seventh Fujian  People's Congress ended in Fuzhou this morning after fulfilling  various items listed on the agenda. The session called on  people throughout the province to unite more closely around the  CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core.  Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and of the  party's basic line, and under the leadership of the provincial  party committee, they must be of one heart and one mind, and  must make persistent efforts to carry out reform, rely on their  own efforts, and work hard to promote their undertakings. They  must strive for a new victory in our province's reform, opening  up, and construction.    The executive chairmen of the session--Jia Qinglin, Yuan  Qitong, Guo Ruiren, Huang Changxi, Su Changpei, Liu Yongye,  Zhang Mingjun, Hong Huasheng, and Song Jun--were seated in the  front rows of the rostrum. Presided over by Su Changpei, the  session adopted a resolution approving the work report of the  provincial people's government. The resolution held that the  review of the report on last year's work conformed with reality,  and that the tasks and arrangements proposed by the report for  the coming year were practical and feasible.

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Hard line on calling in German receivers TELEKOM, the lumbering telecommunications arm of the giant Deutsche Bundespost, is patting itself on the head this month after re-uniting the severed telephone systems of east and west Berlin. It is also in the process of installing 112,000 new phones in east Berlin by the end of this year. Some easterners had waited for 30 years and more for a telephone. Small wonder that the former East Germany's fossilised Deutsche Post was relegated to the scrap heap last year. However, my own urgent request to Telekom for two telephones to be installed in the east Berlin office-to-be of the Financial Times was nearly five months old when I aborted it this month. It began optimistically enough. The pleasant Telekom lady in charge of the press department in west Berlin said the telephones would be connected to the most up-to-date new digital exchange in east Berlin, she promised. With visions of care-free dialling I filled out the required form in triplicate on January 17. As of last week the copy of the form still lay on my desk, yellowed and brittle. But no telephones. Throughout the winter months I was blithely assured that my requests were continuing to receive priority attention. My calls to responsible officials resembled communications into a black void. Phones rang unanswered, only to be engaged moments later and then unanswered again for hours. By March it was clear that something was seriously amiss when a Telekom underling called to request information I had given months earlier. A note of irritation entered the voice of the press department lady when I suggested that we were paying a lot of money to rent an office which still had no telephones. My punishment was to be quickly transferred to another colleague who began by requesting the relevant information from scratch. It was after a holiday in May that I found the first written advice from Telekom, a form letter saying that 'unfortunately your urgently requested telephone cannot be immediately installed'. The following day I was nearly floored when I opened the door to the still-empty east Berlin office after an absence of weeks. Perched on the window sills were brand-new telephones in both rooms. I marvelled at the steady dial-tone and incoherent with excitement called my home. I rushed downstairs to speak to the manager of the building. Yes, she explained, the phones were installed several weeks after she had applied for them last January. What accounted for Telekom's remarkably swift installation? I asked, With a knowing smile she said she had personally handed in her application to a long-time acquaintance from the old Deutsche Post who was now happily at work for Telekom.</p>

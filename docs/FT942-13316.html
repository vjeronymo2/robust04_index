			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Recovery speeds up in east Midlands The pace of economic recovery in the east Midlands has quickened, says the regional group of Chambers of Commerce. The chambers concluded after canvassing 323 companies that 51 per cent of them had improved domestic order books compared with 40 per cent at the end of last year. But the proportion of companies reporting increased export orders - at 38 per cent - is little changed from three months ago. Although 34 per cent of companies are expecting to recruit more labour over the next three months and 51 per cent are expecting higher profitability, Mr Michael Hadfield, chairman of the regional chambers of commerce, noted that fewer than a third of companies were operating at full capacity. 'Cashflow is still a major worry,' he said. Caution about the depth of the regional recovery has also been emphasised by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, and Nottingham Business School. The early responses to their six-monthly survey of business show that, in spite of higher sales recently, there is concern that growth will not be sustained in the second half of the year. Mr Marten Fraser, Price Waterhouse partner in Nottingham, said the construction industry had enjoyed a good six months. He added, however, that the outlook for the textile industry was not as encouraging and that there was nervousness in the retail and service sectors.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Arts: Impressionists by the yard - William Packer examines the choice of a secretive collector IN THE early years of this century, Dr Albert C Barnes, of Philadelphia, and his partner, Hermann Hille, discovered and marketed a new antiseptic, Argyrol, which made their fortunes. Barnes began collecting in 1912 through the agency of an old painter friend, one William Glackens, who had stimulated his interest in contemporary European art. It was a good time to begin, and while his collection continued to grow, amounting at his death in 1951 to some 2000 works of all kinds, it was in those early purchases that its strength lay. It would seem he bought wholesale, for by 1914 he had 25 Renoirs and a dozen each of Picasso and Cezanne. By 1924 it was more than 100 Renoirs and 50 Cezannes, the final count 180 and 69 respectively. In 1922 Barnes set up his educational foundation at Merion, near Philadelphia, and the following year put 75 works of his younger moderns, Soutine, Modigliani, Picasso and the like, on public exhibition. And, as is so often the way with the latest of modern art, it was not well received. There is no-one more sensitive than the abused philanthropist, and poor Barnes took the rebuff very hard. Critical access to the collection was severely constrained, loans out of the question, and reproduction grudgingly permitted only in black-and-white. So it is that the Barnes has been a somewhat secret collection, honoured more by reputation than direct experience. Now, however, while the old building is repaired and modernised, Dr Barnes's successors have relented - just a bit and for just this once. Seventy-two works have been chosen to go on tour, and to reflect in particular his first enthusiasm for the work of his near-contemporaries of the Ecole de Paris. They include some wonderful things and Paris is the perfect place to see them, in the context of the Musee d'Orsay's own remarkable holdings of impressionism and the post-impressionism. The obvious opportunity has been well taken, where possible, to bring in related works from those collections  -Seurat's three tiny figure studies for his great composition, les Poseuses, for example, and Cezanne's small study for The Card Players. Yet for all the richness of its contents, the French critical response to the show has been decidely cool. Is there something in such criticism after all, or is it simply the reflex of an injured proprietorial pride? Are these lovely things simply too many good fish that got away? A collection, of its very nature, is never critically definitive but only representative. What it may define, and that intuitively, however, is the nature of the collector's idiosyncratic interest and judgment. And the more straitened the means, so often the more acute is the judgment. In this case the selection may well accurately reflect Barnes's particular predeliction for Renoir, Cezanne and Matisse, but it hardly makes for a balanced show and the room of Renoirs, with which it opens, does the quality of his judgment few favours. Renoir is notoriously the most uneven of the impressionist masters, and any trawl through his oeuvre is sure to pull in, as here, much dross with the plums. The trick is to enjoy the plums for themselves and forget the rest - which holds true for the entire show. Even with Renoir there are a magnificent early half-length nude, arranging her hair; the later la toilette, with the girl nude and seated cross-legged with her maid behind her; and the enchanting large composition of young men flirting with the girls as they leave the Conservatoire. The group of Cezannes is very strong indeed, with a remarkable run of still-lifes and three quite wonderful portraits of the artists's wife that are worth the trip to Paris on their own. For the rest, faites vos choix - Matisse still-life, studio interior and portrait of his wife; an eviscerated rabbit by Soutine; Picasso's harlequins and young girl, nude with a boy and goat; an exquisite Lautrec portrait; Van Gogh; the great Seurat. And among the clutch of portraits by Modigliani of his last and tragic mistress, Jeanne Hebuterne, is perhaps the very best of his late reclining nudes, a marvel of erotic painterly directness and sculptural simplicity.

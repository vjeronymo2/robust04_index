			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELIGION CATHOLICS;  </P> <P> BISHOPS' PANEL REJECTS CONDOMS IN AIDS BATTLE  </P> <P> Countering a controversial earlier position, a committee of Roman Catholic  bishops Thursday issued a draft of a new policy paper on the AIDS crisis that  strongly rejects any use of condoms to prevent the spread of the fatal disease.  </P> <P> The document, which claims that sexual abstinence outside marriage is the only  moral and practical solution, also condemns programs in which sterile needles  are dispersed to drug addicts to lessen the risk of infection by sharing  contaminated ones.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, who chairs the five-member committee,  was one of several bishops who had objected to the earlier statement that gave  implicit permission to church hospitals and agencies to provide information on  condoms as a potential safeguard against AIDS.  </P> <P> Mahony called the first statement "terribly confusing" to Catholics.  Compromising on Catholic teaching in order to be more influential in public  policy "has never been our role. Even to start down that road is fraught with  difficulties," he said.  </P> <P> Soon after the first statement was approved by the U.S. bishops' 50-member  administrative board in December, 1987, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, head of the  Vatican Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, joined in the criticism and  admonished the U.S. bishops for not consulting with Rome.  </P> <P> Mahony, adapting the statement for his own archdiocese, revised five sentences  to flatly prohibit the endorsement of public health recommendations on condoms.  </P> <P> The nation's 300 bishops reached a compromise at a June, 1988, national meeting  by letting stand the 1987 AIDS statement, while at the same time commissioning  a second, possibly broader, statement.  </P> <P> The new draft was commissioned "to carry the discussion further and . . . have  behind it the weight of the entire American hierarchy," Bill Ryan, a spokesman  for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington, said Thursday.  </P> <P> The 68-page statement, "Called to Compassion: A Response to the HIV/AIDS  Crisis," is likely to be approved by the full body of bishops next month. HIV  is the virus that causes AIDS.  </P> <P> "HIV/AIDS must be opposed with education, counseling and persuasion," the new  document said. But it charged that promoting condom use is a "quick-fix tactic"  doomed to failure in the long run." Although some studies have shown condoms  are not a foolproof method of preventing infection, health officials advocate  their use as one way of stemming the spread of AIDS.  </P> <P> "The safe-sex approach to preventing HIV/AIDS, though frequently advocated,  compromises human sexuality and can lead to promiscuous sexual behavior," the  document said. "Not only is the use of prophylactics in an attempt to halt the  spread of HIV technically unreliable; promoting this approach means, in effect,  promoting behavior which is morally unacceptable.  </P> <P> "We fault these programs for another reason as well. Recognizing that casual  sex is a risk to health, (these programs) consistently advise the use of  condoms in order to eliminate the risk. This is poor and inadequate advice."  </P> <P> The official Catholic teaching against using contraceptive devices -- even  within marriage -- is disregarded by a large majority of the nation's  Catholics, according to the preponderance of surveys taken during the last two  decades.  </P> <P> And the Catholic prohibition against using condoms to stem the AIDS epidemic  runs counter to the policies of most mainline Protestant churches and Jewish  agencies, which generally follow recommendations by the U.S. surgeon general's  office.  </P> <P> The Rev. Albert Ogle, an Episcopal priest who directs the All Saints AIDS  Service Center in Pasadena, criticized the new bishops' statement for "not  addressing what is really happening in their communities."  </P> <P> "The reality," Ogle said, "is that young people in our parishes are being  infected by the virus and will get sick and die and infect others because the  church has painted itself in a corner over birth control. . . . The (Catholic)  Church is killing young people and that is not a pro-life stance."  </P> <P> Ogle said he had worked with Mahony in founding the Interfaith AIDS Council of  Southern California. He said he believes the Catholic Church could prevent the  spread of AIDS in the Hispanic community, which is heavily Catholic, by  realistically addressing the problem. "I believe there is moral judgment upon  the church not to respond to that challenge," Ogle said.  </P> <P> Retired United Methodist Bishop Melvin Wheatley called it "totally irrational"  to think that providing condoms to people who are sexually active will  undermine the church's teachings on abstinence. Wheatley of Laguna Hills will  be the featured speaker Oct. 27 at a conference of the AIDS Interfaith Council  of Southern California.  </P> <P> Catholic Auxiliary Bishop Carl A. Fisher of Los Angeles said he hoped that the  new statement will not totally negate the previous one.  </P> <P> Fisher was among a number of bishops who had said they supported the earlier  policy statement that Catholics could pass on information, such as that  provided by the U.S. Public Health Service about condoms, "to persons who were  not Catholic or not inclined to alter their conduct or actions" in spite of  church teachings.  </P> <P> Fisher said he felt the first statement was "a profound one" and realistically  faced situations encountered by Catholics involved in counseling people in  danger of contracting the disease.  </P> <P> "I work in the Long Beach area with persons who are dying from AIDS in some  nine hospices," Fisher said. "I do not believe that withholding information . .  . is going to help in the curtailment in the spread of AIDS."  </P> <P> The wide-ranging new draft also opposes universal mandatory AIDS testing, calls  for increasing federal funds for AIDS research and denounces violence and  discrimination against AIDS victims as immoral.  </P> <P> Needle exchange programs, in which drug abusers trade used needles for free  new, clean ones -- because infected needles are considered to be a major means  of transmitting AIDS -- are attacked in the document on grounds that "more drug  use might result while fewer intravenous drug users sought treatment."  </P> <P> "Distribution of free needles and syringes would send the message that  intravenous drug use can be made safe," the statement added.  </P> <P> In a passage directed at public policy-makers, the draft goes on to call for  legislation that includes "helping to prevent the transmission of HIV,  providing adequate medical care and protecting civil rights," including a ban  on discrimination in employment, schooling, entertainment, business  opportunities, housing and medical care.  </P> <P> "Compassion -- love -- toward persons infected with HIV is the only authentic  response," the statement said. "Persons with AIDS are not distant, unfamiliar  people, the objects of our mingled pity and aversion. We must keep them present  to our consciousness, as individuals and a community and embrace them with  unconditional love."  </P> <P> In addition to Mahony, others on the drafting committee are Cardinal Joseph L.  Bernardin of Chicago, Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston, Archbishop William H.  Keeler of Baltimore and Bishop Raymond W. Lessard of Savannah, Ga.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> If approved next month, the Catholic bishops' statement on AIDS will become a  policy guideline for the nation's 55 million Catholics. Catholic hospitals,  schools, social service agencies, priests and church workers will be expected  to use it to convey church teachings on AIDS.  </P></p>

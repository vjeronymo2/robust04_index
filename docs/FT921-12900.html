			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Arts: Tallis Scholars - St John's, Smith Square The elderly lady with whom I attended this concert remarkably heard her first Palestrina Mass at Brompton Oratory in 1913. At that time, as she remarked, it would have been unthinkable to predict the sort of public following in this area now enjoyed by the Tallis Scholars following their television profile on The South Bank Show. For this appearance the choir had attracted a capacity audience (not perhaps surprising when Allegri's Miserere was on the programme). More telling was the attentiveness with which people listened. Apparently it is the composers of the Italian renaissance, rather than their English contemporaries, who draw the crowds when the Tallis Scholars are on tour, for example in Japan, and Palestrina and Gesualdo helped fill St John's on Wednesday. When one considers the continual turnover of personnel in chamber choirs, the Tallis Scholars have maintained an unusually distinctive style. For this the firm and scholarly direction of their founder, Peter Phillips, must be the main cause. He leads a choir of a dozen singers, a little smaller in size than some comparable groups, and draws from them a bright sound, almost astringent when he wants it to be, which gives a cutting edge to words and rhythms. It is a style of early music singing that focusses keenly upon essentials. In Palestrina's Missa Ut re mi fa sol la, an interesting mass to hear as its cantus-firmus (the music's central building-block) simply runs up the scale defined in its title, each of the various sections was neatly differentiated. The flowing lines of the 'Sanctus', for example, achieved a contrast of mood without recourse to exaggeration. It may be that the Tallis Scholars' way with the music would have sounded consciously interpreted in Palestrina's day, but it is effective and reasonably economical according to today's understanding on such matters. A group of four of Gesualdo's Tenebrae responsories caught well the unsettling quirkiness of that composer's music. The Allegri was made the more effective by placing a quartet of singers away from the main body in a rear gallery. In every item the standard of choral singing per se was exceptionally high. Whether it is the increasing popularity of early music that has brought forward performers of this quality or the performers that have attracted the audiences, it is impossible to say. Either way the spread of knowledge and enjoyment in this music proceeds apace.</p>

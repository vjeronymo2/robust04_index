			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Technology: Census on CD-Rom To those who fill out the forms, censuses are a chore. To those processing the information, they are a rich source of information about how people live and work. But to commercial users of the data, the 10-yearly census counts can be an aid to higher profits and lower costs. Supermarkets can work out where to put new branches, companies can assess which areas should produce the best response to direct marketing campaigns and public authorities can decide where to site hospitals, old people's homes or council housing. 'It's a big market place,' says Susan Squires, product development director of Capscan, a London-based company specialising in address and census data. Advances in computer power mean census data can now be used more comprehensively and rapidly than before. Next week, Capscan launches a CD-Rom containing all the 1991 statistics, broken down into about 150,000 small areas (each containing 200 households). By compressing the data, Capscan can make available this information which was stored on 200 magnetic tapes. It takes account of 9,000 variables, derived from cross-referencing answers to questions on such matters as accommodation, family, cars and occupational status; they show how each area breaks down demographically. The data excludes names, addresses or incomes, and the published information is altered minutely to prevent identification. Even so, it is a potential gold-mine for businesses wanting to know more about their market place. Capscan's CD-Rom, called Cenario, allows users to obtain easy access to this data on desktop computers and link it to maps and postcodes. 'Our objective is to demystify access to the census,' says Squires. The CD costs Pounds 3,000 but Capscan charges extra for data beyond the first of its three access levels.</p>

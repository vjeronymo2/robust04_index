			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Martin Shelton doubles to Pounds 796,000 Martin Shelton Group, the USM-quoted diaries, calendars and betting office supplies maker, announced a near doubling of pre-tax profits from Pounds 407,000 to a record Pounds 796,000 for the year to March 31. Mr Paul Martin, chairman, said the stronger performance from all areas of group activity had been coupled with increased manufacturing output and tighter production controls to restrict costs. Most growth had come from the core activity - diaries, calendars and business gifts. Turnover improved to Pounds 5.93m (Pounds 5.02m). A proposed final dividend of 2.5p (1.5p) lifts the total to 3.75p (2.25p), payable from earnings per share of 10.58p (5.73p).</p>

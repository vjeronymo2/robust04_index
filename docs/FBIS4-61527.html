			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 04, BNS -- Crews at the Russian naval  base on the island of Naissaar, bordering the Gulf of Tallinn,  by May 1 had destroyed all mines they had on the island, the  Estonian Foreign Ministry press office reported quoting officers  at the Russian naval headquarters in Tallinn.    A big number of mines and explosives still remains on  another  Estonian island, Suur-Pakri, or Great Pakri, situated off the  former Russian base town of Paldiski. While its neighboring  small island of Vaike-Pakri looks relatively nice, Suur-Pakri  looks like some kind of a "sea hedgehog," the government's  special representative Juri Tikk has said.    The Pakri islands were used as training fields by the  Russian  military. Tikk said the ammunition left on Suur-Pakri ranges  from non-exploding training mines and bombs to shells filled  20-percent with ammunition.    Crews of the Estonian Rescue Department are expected to  start  cleaning Suur-Pakri of this legacy within few weeks. Rescue  Department experts say it is very difficult to determine the  exact types of the shells, because many of them are covered with  heavy rust.</p>

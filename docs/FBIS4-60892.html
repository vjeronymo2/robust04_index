			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Bondarev article: "The President Is Forming a </F> Right- Centrist Alliance"]    [Text] If Russia's Choice is considered rightist,  understanding the latter as the liberal-conservative political  orientation, then the signing of the Civic Accord Charter should  be recognized as an attempt by the president to form a  right-centrist political alliance. Perhaps herein lies the main  essence of the ceremony in the Kremlin.    Of course, far from all the signatories will collaborate  with  the executive branch. But the fact that they have turned up at  the Kremlin points to a certain, and fairly substantial, change  in the political situation in Russia after the October events  and the December elections. Especially indicative is the  discipline of the Federation component leaders. For all its  shortfalls and bleary prospects, the drive for the adoption of  the charter has allowed the presidential team to regain  political initiative after the Duma- inspired amnesty. The  opposition and the opponents of the executive branch had to play  by the rules that were enforced on them. True, after the  elections Yeltsin made both political and economic concessions  to the centrists, which to a substantial extent made the signing  possible. The legitimate question arises: Will a worsening  economic situation not be the price to pay for the temporary  political respite?    The real leader of Russian centrists today is the premier,  while the economic course he has pursued in the past few months  can on balance be deemed successful. Although the government  failed to organize anything properly, and institutional changes  are moving along by themselves, and the government has never  made any useful decisions, nonetheless Chernomyrdin managed  sharply to reduce the rate of inflation and depreciation of the  ruble. In April inflation again will be approximately 10  percent. The fall in the inflation rate, however, has to do not  only with a tough financial policy but also the overcoming of  the dual-power situation and the economic confusion it brought  about. The reforms undertaken by Gaydar provided a certain  impetus which Chernomyrdin had to follow to a certain point.  And while the premier is realizing this policy, the union --  formal or informal -- between liberals (i.e., Gaydar and  Fedorov) and centrists is still possible.    Unexpectedly to many, another main figure in this  right-centrist bloc became Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin. His role  manifested itself especially strongly just before the signing of  the charter, when Zhirinovskiy and the national-communists tried  to use the assassination of a State Duma deputy to provoke a  political crisis. The stormy debate in the Duma, however, did  not go outside its walls, turning into a tempest in a teapot.  The central role in this was played by the current Constitution  which has sharply limited the possibility of deputy  arbitrariness, which was characteristic of the Supreme Soviet  and the Congress of People's Deputies. Yet one cannot  underestimate the significance of the policy of the speaker, who  used his power to promote the charter. Incidentally, Rybkin's  effective inclusion into the presidential team can also be seen  as one of the results in the struggle for a civic pact.    With his activity -- and what is more important, its  effectiveness -- Rybkin even has pushed somewhat into the  background yet another figure on which the president relies:  Federation Council Speaker V. Shumeyko. The latter has already  had a few setbacks: budget blocking by the upper chamber, the  Kazannik case, and the Federation Council's rejection of  Ilyushenko.    The presidential team has conducted the struggle for the  charter to be concluded very actively but mostly behind closed  doors, in the lobbies, and also using material incentives -- by  handing out promises to the industries. The public, ideological  side of the process has been totally inadequate. The  president's immediate entourage, or rather his administration,  failed to produce any strong political figures capable of  upholding his position in debates with opponents and rivals.  Earlier, this role was played by Popov, Poltoranin, Shumeyko,  Shakhray, and Gaydar, who acted as direct exponents of the  president's will. Now they have receded, and the main promoter  of the pact became Gaydar, whose status as a faction leader was  obviously out of tune with his inherited role as legitimizer of  civic peace. True, the Russia's Choice leader's activity allows  to talk about the president's right-centrist, not just centrist,  bloc. Characteristically, Gaydar has already come out with the  idea of nominating Yeltsin in the next elections. Yet it hardly  makes much sense trying to look so far ahead.</p>

Fekete report: "Orban's Key Question: Will </F> Bekesi Beat Sandor Nagy"]    [Text] Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young  Democrats [Fidesz], will also run as an individual candidate at  the elections in Szekesfehervar's electoral district No. 1.  This was one of the decisions at the two-day weekend meeting of  the Fidesz's national committee. After the meeting, in an  interview with NEPSZABADSAG, in addition to talking about  relations between the Fidesz and the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ], Orban also said that the Fidesz's talks with the  National Federation of Trade Unions in Hungary [MSZOSZ] are made  rather difficult by the fact that [MSZOSZ Chairman] Sandor Nagy  is ahead of Laszlo Bekesi on the Hungarian Socialist Party's  [MSZP] national list.    By way of introduction, Orban repeated that the Fidesz  members in Szekesfehervar had asked him to run in the elections  as an individual candidate; he asked the national committe's  support for this, which he received after some debate. Many  members thought that by running as individual candidate, the  party's first man can only play a smaller part in the national  campaign and he exposes himself to unnecessary and unseemly  attacks, and his possible failure might have a negative effect  on the party's performance in other districts. At the same  time, Orban thought that the British election system should be  taken as an example, where those people who had themselves  assessed in the campaign as individual candidates have the  biggest chance of becoming ministers or state secretaries.    The Fidesz will begin the fight for mandates at different  times and in different ways in each county. It is planning a  brief and positive campaign whose "grand national opening" will  be at the beginning of March. Orban said that his party  certainly does not want to commit the same mistake as the MSZP  -- not intending to nominate a prime ministerial candidate until  the final results of the elections are known -- therefore, the  Fidesz will name its prime ministerial candidate at the national  opening of the campaign.    Talking about the Fidesz-SZDSZ relationship, Orban said: I  trust that relations between the two parties will continue to be  correct and balanced in the future, too. It is natural for  minor or bigger conflicts to arise between two rivals, however,  considering the election alliance, it is expedient to reduce the  number of these conflicts to the minimum. It has to be accepted  that the two parties can only cooperate. "According to our  surveys, if either of the parties looked for other election  allies or future coalition partners then it would significantly  reduce its election chances."    In an interview, [Fidesz official] Tamas Deutsch said that  certain forces in the SZDSZ would prefer cooperation with the  MSZP to the parties of the liberal bloc. Not disputing this,  Orban pointed out that if the SZDSZ came noticeably closer to  the MSZP, or possibly started talks on cooperation between the  two parties, then this would prove the claims made by the  politicians of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] in the past  three years. They claimed that the two parties had evolved from  the same cultural and social roots and set rather similar goals  for themselves. However, cooperation with the MSZP would  destroy the SZDSZ. A significant section of the SZDSZ's  membership joined the party at a time when it most loudly  advocated its anti-communist views. Anyone who knows the  provincial SZDSZ organizations is aware that rapprochement with  the MSZP would lead to the SZDSZ's splitting into two.    At its congress held in Debrecen in March 1993, the Fidesz  accepted its election program. Orban said that, in the past  year, major changes that would require a significant adjustment  of the program have not happened in Hungary. The party  continuously coordinates its goals with the organizations of  interest representation and interest protection. They will  first talk to the representatives of employers, and they wish to  hold discussions with the trade unions in early April. As is  known, the chairman of the MSZOSZ, the biggest trade union  federation, is second on the MSZP's national list. In  connection with this, Orban said that this issue even evoked  serious debates in the Fidesz. The party's economists claimed  that Laszlo Bekesi's economic program was worth accepting as a  basis for discussions. Three years ago, I said the same on this  issue, namely that the MDF's program was full of liberal  elements and we can see what has happend to that, Orban  reminded. The key issue for us is whether Bekesi is before or  after Sandor Nagy on the MSZP's list. Naturally, if Nagy is  further forward, we still have to talk to the trade unions, but  perhaps, in this case, not on the level of the chairman.    Finally, Orban said that after the elections, we have to  expect a strengthening of the extreme right wing and radical  right-wing forces. So far, these forces have either been part  of the government coalition or, if they were out of it, the  conservative government was still acceptable to them. Although  they criticized the government regularly, they did not make  social or economic demands on it. After 1994, the situation  will be different; especially if the trade unions, namely the  representatives of the employees' interests, get into Parliament  or government through the MSZP. After this, it will be the  radical right-wing forces, rather than the various trade unions  that will make demands contrary to economic rationality; the  reduction of the retirement age for example. It will be these  forces that will radicalize the strata of society that are  becoming poorer.    In reply to whether this reasoning would justify the MDF's  participation in the next coalition, Orban said that this can  also be a solution, but he would rather that a government  supported by a broad coalition be established after the  elections. It will not be possible to govern the country with a  51 to 52 percent majority between 1994 and 1998. Anyone who  keeps announcing with whom he is unwilling to govern is acting  against the country's interests, he stated. A party chairman  only acts wisely if he either does not talk about the coalition  possibilities or, if he does, he keeps as many avenues open as  possible.</p>

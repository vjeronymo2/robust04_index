			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Food and Drink: Slap another smoked 'roo on a barbie for me  -Nicholas Woodsworth finds that Australia's 'new food' is very much to his liking STARTLING food discoveries sometimes come at unexpected moments. I made one not long ago as I streaked through the sky from London to Australia, and it is this: if you travel east at 500 miles an hour, not only do you go through two sunsets and two dawns in 24 hours - you also go through two breakfasts, two lunches and two dinners. This might not sound earth-shattering but it had me worried. I do not like the idea of travelling faster than my own stomach. Hardly were the Medoc and lamb medallions disposed of than the odour of hot coffee, bacon and croissants drifted from the galley. My companions on the flight - four women journalists from London - seemed wholly unperturbed by these endless offerings and tucked in heartily. But then, they are hard-bitten food-and-wine professionals who make their living through eating. For them, this was just a limbering-up exercise in preparation for the rigours ahead. I, on the other hand, was merely a token male and food amateur who had come along to see what ordinary visitors might make of Australian fare. And, since food is a product of geography and social history, to discover what it might say about Aussies themselves. First stop, Adelaide. For most visitors, Sydney - that brash, bustling, and most cosmopolitan of cities - provides an initial contact with the continent. Adelaide is something else; the only small town I know of with a population over 1m. With old-fashioned and unhurried civic pride, red brickwork and Victorian iron filigree, Adelaide exudes an air of colonial Australia. Not even its endless and sprawling bungalow suburbs modernise the image wholly. Tidy, staid, conservative, intolerant of airs or pretensions - they push the city straight into the 1950s. Does the food match the dated atmosphere? Walking past the cheap and cheerful cafes of Hindley Street, the main drag, I suspected it would. Here, amid pool halls, tattoo parlours and noisy, hard-drinking pubs were dozens of establishments of the egg-and-chips, beans-and-chips, sausage-and-chips variety - the kind of places that, world over, have satisfied the stolid Anglo stomach and soul since colonial days. Evidently, there is a strong element of Australian cuisine that remains faithful to its English meat-and-two-veg origins. The further you get from the larger centres of population on the coast, the simpler the whole idea of food and eating becomes. At Alice Springs, in the dead centre of the continent, such concepts are simplified to the irreducible minimum; witness the dress code sign outside Bojangles restaurant: 'Neat casual or bugger off.' Even in civilised South Australia, though, the famous Adelaide 'pie floater'  -a meat pie in a soup bowl of mushy peas and topped with gouts of tomato sauce - retains its proud place. It is an item best bought, only half sober, from the mobile vans that set up on the city's street corners at sunset. 'After a few tinnies on a cold winter's night, there's nothing better than a floater,' one demure young waitress told me. I followed her prescription and found, on the few-tinnies level by which such things should be judged, that she was right. None the less, if you move off Hindley Street and look just a little bit harder you will, without much problem, discover a world of sophisticated food and drink that belies wholly Adelaide's provincial image. For the visitor, it is the start of a culinary trail that leads to some of the most innovative and intriguing cuisine found anywhere. Where does Australia's more exciting cooking come from? Not, we began to realise over dinner at Adelaide's Universal Wine Bar, from British tradition. That was not the source of the tender, charcoal-grilled squid and marinated red pepper salad I was eating. If Anglo-Australians had been left to their own devices, the Universal's menu today would not be enlivened by garlic and olive oil, aubergine and shallots, scallops and fresh-water crayfish. It would be duller even than the Adelaide suburbs. The cuisine of the antipodes has moved on since the 1950s, however. Before that time, Australians suffered from what was known as 'cultural cringe,' a deep-seated malady that associated things superior with things British. Conversely, everything domestic was regarded as inferior. The result was as depressingly predictable as a Vegemite sandwich: tinned and heavy foods, fried foods, preserved foods, foods with their natural flavours and textures literally boiled out of them. It was only when the first large waves of immigrants arrived from Italy, Greece, Lebanon and Turkey that Australians discovered freshness. Based on fresh ingredients, cooked rapidly and prepared without pretension, Mediterranean cooking fits in well with the country's relaxed, outdoor life-style (nouvelle flopped miserably in Australia). It shares something with the back-yard barbecue that has always been popular Down Under. Put plainly, the best Australian cooking is a kind of barbie-style cooking with refinement. By contrast, Adelaide's water supply, drawn from the city's rivers and reservoirs, is not very refined at all - indeed, locals say there is a meal in every mouthful. But then, water is not drunk in great abundance at South Australian restaurant tables. Neither, these days, is beer, nor the sweet and grapey Moselle that Australians used to favour. Why should it be when, less than an hour's drive from Adelaide, is the Barossa valley, one of the country's finest wine-producing areas? France has lost a steady customer. In the Barossa - home to 48 wineries and a centre for a third of Australia's premium wine output - I wandered around vineyards lit up in autumnal shades of red and gold and found that, with a little experimentation, Australian wines can give as much pleasure and satisfaction as French wines and, generally, cost less. I shall not pretend to serious wine judging; after the third tasting session, I lost my standards of comparison. South Australian wines, grown in a different soil and under a stronger sun, are fuller, fruitier and bigger than the wines with which I am familiar. But it is these qualities that revived my flagging interest in whites (particularly Semillons and the country's superb, buttery-tasting Chardonnays), and gave me a taste for red Shiraz, Australia's major grape variety, more commonly known in Europe as Hermitage. At St Hallet's winery, I revelled in Old Block, the product of Shiraz vines planted by German Lutherans at the beginning of the century. At Maggie Beer's delightful Barossa valley restaurant, the Pheasant Farm, I tasted an even more exotic form of this rich, flavourful, heady variety, a sparkling wine by Rockport called Black Shiraz. It is so big and full of tannin and fruit flavour that it quite swept me away. So, too, did the meal that it accompanied. Like all Australian chefs of note, Maggie Beer believes in using freshly-prepared local produce. No victim of cultural cringe, her menu features gum-tree smoked kangaroo on duck-egg pasta. I found it as good as the best smoked venison. Even a decade ago, such a dish would have horrified her compatriots. The kangaroo might be a national icon but, in the past, most Australians have rated it fit only for dog food. Today, kangaroo is just one of the items of 'bush tucker' - indigenous foods, hunted traditionally and gathered by Aboriginals - in which there is growing interest. I could go on. Certainly, our group did - on and on and on until I though we would split. At Seppeltsfield winery, we sat drinking Para tawny port, a concoction just right for the wintery, grey, June weather. At the 1812 Restaurant in Tanunda, I downed a tartare made from sweet and flavourful Tasmanian salmon. At the Yalumba winery, I sipped a sparkling rose and learned why it would never sell well Down Under - even the liberated Australian male has a strong aversion to the colour pink. And at the Cafe C in the town of Springton, we dined on spicy scallop salad and a delicate Thai green chicken curry. It was a fair sampling of yet another trend: Austral-Asian cooking. Brought once again by the country's newest wave of immigrants - Vietnamese, Thais and ethnic Chinese - this is a fusion of styles that is fast changing the culinary scene. The nation is finally realising that its future lies not with the distant west at all, but with the Asia that lies on its doorstep. I shall not go on, though. We were still in South Australia. Ahead lay Victoria and New South Wales, both reputed for the sophistication of their cuisine. Already, I was exhausted and ready to go on the Scarsdale diet. My suspicion on the plane was right: Australia is just too much for one sitting. But given a while to catch my breath, I shall be heading Down Under once again. The culinary exploration of Australia is no mean achievement. It took a Cook, after all, to discover it in the first place. Nicholas Woodsworth travelled with British Airways. His trip was arranged by Austravel (50 Conduit Street, London W1R 0NP, tel. 071-734 7755), a specialist in Australian holidays.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Miguel de Tucuman, 17 Mar (NA) -- At 1200 today,  nearly 200 workers from the La Florida Sugar Mill invaded the  Tucuman Congress building and destroyed a large portion of its  facilities.    After attempting in vain to be received by the congressmen  who were present in the building, the demonstrators invaded the  provincial Congress and destroyed the glass windows on the  ground floor, as well as several offices.    After the incidents, the workers went to Independence  Square,  in front of Government House, where they are still waiting for a  meeting with Tucuman Governor Ramon Ortega to take stock of the  situation.    The workers' protest demonstration was staged within the  framework of those that began 15 days ago after news was  published that the sugar mill had gone bankrupt.    Governor Ortega said he would not meet with "anyone who has  chosen to adopt violent methods."    Ortega is holding a meeting with the representatives of the  Alcofin company, which will be in charge of exploiting the sugar  mill from now on.    The congressmen were surprised at the police delay in  containing the demonstrators. The police did not arrive at the  Congress building until the demonstrators were already leaving,  and did not arrest anyone.    The workers' version of the incident has it that "the  attacks  began from inside the Congress building," from where the first  stones and firecrackers were hurled.    Some Congress employees were injured trying to leave the  area.    Acting Congress President Christian Saracho held Miguel  Brito, secretary general of the local General Confederation of  Labor office, as one of those responsible for the incidents.</p>

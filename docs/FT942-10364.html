			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Modern architecture rapped: Gummer aims to use planning powers to raise quality of buildings Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, launched a savage attack yesterday on the standard of much modern architecture, echoing criticisms repeatedly made by the Prince of Wales in recent years. Speaking to the Cities 94 conference in London's Docklands, Mr Gummer indicated he would use his planning powers to improve the quality of buildings in British cities. He made it clear he would block city-centre developments that he regarded as poorly designed or out of keeping with existing buildings. He said: 'Too many buildings which won prizes in the 1960s need to be pulled down in the 1990s.' Mr Gummer gave as examples Birmingham's Bull Ring shopping centre, his own departmental headquarters in Marsham Street in Westminster, and the National Westminster Bank building in Leeds. He later added to the list residential developments such as the high-rise flats overlooking Richmond Park at Roehampton, south-west London. Many 1960s flats suffered from water penetration, he added. 'One important quality of buildings is that they should keep the water out,' he said. 'Many of the buildings of the 1960s are bad buildings in a functional sense.' Mr Gummer assured his audience that he was not against all modern architecture. 'I certainly don't want pastiche styles,' he said. 'I want buildings of today and tomorrow which respect what has gone before.' He promised an initiative to set standards for developers, encouraging them to create developments that complement existing buildings and specifying the use of appropriate materials and finishes. 'This generation could be remembered for architecture which enhanced its environment and used imagination and innovation to build for the future by building to last,' he said. Architects and town planners welcomed Mr Gummer's plans. 'A lot of architects and planners were seduced by the new style of buildings in the 1960s, and went too far,' said Mr Jed Griffiths, senior vice-president of the Royal Town Planning Institute. The Royal Institute of British Architects said it was 'delighted' at the new emphasis on quality and design.</p>

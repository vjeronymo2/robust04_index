			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Older staff are found to be more reliable OLDER workers are better with customers, more reliable, more responsible and less likely to take time off sick than their younger colleagues, according to the preliminary findings of a study of Tesco employees by the World Health Organisation. The supermarket chain, which employs more than 7,000 staff over the age of 55, has pioneered the employment of older workers. Demographic changes and the fall in the numbers of school leavers have led some sectors, including retailing, to examine the active recruitment and retention of older employees. The WHO study is part of a research programme into the prevention of what it terms 'retirement disease' - the acceleration of ageing associated with lack of stimulation, motivation and purpose. A survey of 80 workers aged between 50 and 71 and 10 under 25 at five Tesco stores found the older employees were much more satisfied with their work and conditions than the younger workers. A quarter of the older age group said their health had improved since starting their jobs - most had been with Tesco for two years or less. Forty of 50 managers and supervisors at the same five stores said the older workers were better with customers and more reliable. Similar numbers rated the older employees as more responsible and less likely to be absent. Many of the 50 managers and supervisors questioned at the stores said that, while older workers might be slower than the younger employees, their greater reliability, responsibility and efficiency meant they were just as productive. The majority commented on reliability, trustworthiness and good customer relations as the most valued attributes of older workers. The WHO says the findings have implications for other sectors. Several studies have shown that older job applicants face prejudice from employers - it is only when organisations are confronted with recruitment shortfalls that they are prepared to 'try' older workers. Campaign for Work, the pressure group, yesterday called for legislation to ban age discrimination in employment in a report detailing how older workers were bearing the brunt of redundancies in the recession.</p>

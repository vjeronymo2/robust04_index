			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Ex-BCCI official denies six charges A former senior employee of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International pleaded not guilty to six charges of fraud at the Old Bailey yesterday. Mr Imran Imam, a former official at BCCI's London offices, faces two charges of conspiring to conceal documents, three of furnishing false information and one of conspiring to falsify records. His trial, expected to last between eight and 10 weeks, is set to begin on April 11 next year. Mr Imam was released on bail with sureties of Pounds 75,000. Earlier, Judge Pownall QC rejected an application for the prosecution to be dismissed. Mr Imam had claimed that the Serious Fraud Office had given an undertaking to the US authorities investigating BCCI that he would not be prosecuted in the UK. Mr Imam gave evidence to the US authorities as a witness which was then passed to the SFO before his arrest. The judge ruled that the SFO had given no undertaking that Mr Imam would not be prosecuted.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Tatyana Viktorovna Samolis, press </F> secretary of Russian Foreign Intelligence Service director, by  Vitaliy Gan; date not given; from the "Panorama" program --  recorded]    [Text] [Gan] The tension in Russian-American relations  caused by the arrest of the CIA staff member Aldrich Ames and  his wife on charges of spying for Russia is intensifying. The  sides have already exchanged compliments in the form of a  reciprical expulsion of diplomats or those who were considered  to be diplomats. The turn of events is a rather a suprising  one. Bill [Clinton] and Boris [Yeltsin] had pledged friendship  in the eyes of the world and now here we are faced with this  embarrassment. On the American side the fuss is due to many  factors: the striving to block the establishment of closer  political and economic ties with Russia, the opposition to  President Clinton, the dissatisfaction with our efforts to state  once again, as it should be, our position and our place in the  world in spite of our internal squabbles. It is also due to the  cherished desire to put a squeeze on the Russian intelligence  service.    Tatyana Viktorovna Samolis, Russian foreign intelligence  service director's press secretary, is our guest today.    Tatyana Viktorovna, the fuss around the arrest of CIA staff  member Ames and his wife on charges of spying against [as heard]  Russia is not subsiding. One gets the impression that by  carrying out reciprocal expulsions the sides have revived the  eye-for-an-eye policy. How do you see the situation?    [Samolis] First of all, I would not define the situation  that  has emerged as fitting the eye-for-an-eye scheme. To a certain  extent we have here a different variant. Why? Primarily  because we consider the expulsion of Aleksandr Iosifovich  Lisenko as a discourteous act. This was, most likely, a  political step and the Russian side was forced to undertake a  reciprical measure, first and foremost, because the expulsion of  Lisenko was carried out not out of any operational  consideration. Then, whoever Ames really was, Lisenko had had  no contacts with him whatsoever. All this situation is to a  certain extent burdensome to both the sides. The Russian side  would not like to drag out this conflict. On the contrary, we  would like, by using all means, to strive to return to the  cooperation which has already begun between the Russian and U.S.  intelligence services, because the interests that coincide  between our states are relatively sufficient in number and the  sphere in which we could cooperate is broad. The world is a  complex place and very dangerous and there are problems that can  be resolved only by applying joint efforts.    [Gan] You know that, according to some information, Ames's  main aim was in preventing the CIA doing harm to Russia and  Russia's agents; in other words, to ensure our security but not  to sell and disclose U.S. secrets. Is this so?    [Samolis] First, I would like to say that the Russian  intelligence service is not going to comment on the Ames case.  This is a practice adopted by all the intelligence services.  This we should make clear to ourselves.    As for your question, on the whole, you are right, to some  extent. One could possibly agree with you here. In any case,  if one analyzes the U.S. press, a sufficient number of  suppositions on this matter have been expressed, including one  which can be expressed in the following way: to Ames it was most  likely not a operation to penerate U.S. secrets but a  counterintelligence measure, a protective measure and a  defensive measure for the country which he was acquiring the  secrets for. Once again, this is without commenting on the  situation itself. The court will decide everything.    [Gan] There is another question. It is well known that the  CIA is actively involved in intelligence activities on the  territory of Russia. The other day, CIA Director James Wolsey,  on the whole, openly recognized this. It looks like everybody  is engaged in this kind of game. One could then ask why is it  necessary, generally speaking, to aggravate and poison the  relations between our countries which are already complicated?    [Samolis] Yes, you are right here. This was said by the CIA  director and not only by him. Many senior officials had made  such remarks, including the chairmen of the committees for  intelligence services of the Senate and the House of  Representatives. On the whole, many people look at this in an  absolutely normal way. What can be done about this if the world  is made like that? The world is not a safe place and it is  quite natural that states cannot do without such a function as  the intelligence services.    I would also like to speak about some small trivial things.  We would not like the Russian proverb that says what the priest  is allowed the deacon is not, to be applied to Russia. If the  world is a complicated place and is not safe for the United  States, the same would be right for Russia and for another  country; am I right?    [Gan] Yes, of course.    [Samolis] Russia has also its own national interests, no  matter how strange this might seem. It will continue to defend  them by also using intelligence methods.    Second, I would to remind you of or maybe acquaint you for  the first time with one of the thoughts of Richard Helms, a  former CIA director, who once cleverly and ironically remarked  that they very well knew that their friends were watching them.  The only thing they could blame their spies and foreign spies  for was for allowing themselves to be caught redhanded.    By the way, speaking about the Ames case, I am obliged to  remind us all that he was not caught redhanded. But I said this  in connection with another matter: carrying out intelligence  activities in the present civilized world is, in no way at all,  an obstacle to upholding friendly and even allied relations  between states. That is why I do not quite understand all the  noise around this case and the attempt to raise this problem  from a solely professional level to a supreme political level.</p>

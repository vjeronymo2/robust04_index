			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Labor hit by report on loss by state bank THE Australian Labor Party's formerly strong grip on state governments was further weakened yesterday by a damning royal commission report on losses of ADollars 3.1bn (Pounds 1.4bn) incurred by the State Bank of South Australia, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. The report found no evidence of corruption or illegal activity by the South Australian Labor government. However, it said the state government should have known about the bank's serious financial problems. The report was severely critical of Mr John Bannon, the state premier and treasurer (finance minister), who quit in September to take the political blame for the bank's losses. Mr Samuel Jacobs, the royal commissioner, said Mr Bannon interfered in the bank's commercial activities, and failed to monitor its rapid asset growth or take action to deal with its growing problems. Mr Bannon, a former Labor Party federal president, said he had been kept in the dark about many of the bank's activities. He rejected the commission's findings as 'extremely hurtful and unfair.' Mr Lynn Arnold, the premier, distanced the government from the report, which he said failed to establish how the bank's problems could have been avoided.</p>

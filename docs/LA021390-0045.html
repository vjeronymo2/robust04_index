			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> SWEETWATER GETS TITLE, CHULA VISTA GIVES SCARE  </P> <P> Chula Vista came within seconds of doing what no other team in California had  done this year -- defeat the Sweetwater High boys' basketball team.  </P> <P> Chula Vista held an eight-point lead with two minutes 47 seconds remaining, but  then it was tied with seven seconds left.  </P> <P> That's when Sweetwater's Joe McDowell sank two free throws to sink Chula  Vista's hope of an upset at home against the county's top-ranked team.  </P> <P> Sweetwater's 73-71 victory in front of a standing-room-only Monday night crowd  gave Sweetwater the Metro Conference championship.  </P> <P> The Red Devils, whose only loss was to a Seattle team in a tournament in  Burnaby, Canada, are 24-1, 11-0. Sweetwater has just one game remaining against  Bonita Vista before the playoffs.  </P> <P> Chula Vista, previously ranked 10th, fell to 19-7, 10-3.  </P> <P> After McDowell (21 points) made his free throws, Chula Vista zipped the ball  upcourt where Shane Howell attempted a 19-foot shot from the right baseline.  The ball carommed off the front of the rim and over with one second left. A  Chula Vista player grabbed the rebound and was fouled, but time had expired.  </P> <P> Sent to the line with seven seconds left, McDowell, a senior guard, said he was  thinking about all the free throws he had missed (four) earlier.  </P> <P> "My friend Carlos (Campbell) told me its just like in practice, McDowell said.  "(He told me) take my time and take my mind off the crowd. Once I made the  first one, I knew the second was going down."  </P> <P> The trend of the game was such: Sweetwater would build a lead -- normally four  to seven points -- and Chula Vista would scramble back close.  </P> <P> But that changed late in the third quarter when Chula Vista turned a six-point  deficit into a 62-53 lead by scoring 15 unanswered points.  </P> <P> Carnell Penn, who led all scorers with 29 points, scored 10 in the run,  including the first six. "All I was thinking about was bringing the team back,"  Penn said.  </P> <P> Jerome Green then gave Chula Vista its first lead since the first quarter,  55-53, with an 18-footer and added a free throw eight seconds later.  </P> <P> The only other Spartan to score in the run was Derek Chapman, who tipped in his  own missed shot with one second left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> At 2:47 in the fourth, Chula Vista held a 68-60 lead, but Sweetwater scored  nine of the next 10 tying it, 69-69, with 1:21 left on Campbell's tip of a  McDowell missed free throw. Campbell finished with 21 points.  </P> <P> After Penn made a layup, Sweetwater reserve Isaac Bruce made a layup with 18  seconds left to tie it, 71-71, and set up McDowell's heroics.  </P> <P> Sweetwater took the opening tip and assumed an 8-0 lead after nearly three  minutes. McDowell scored the first six points and Mendel Nafarrete added a  17-foot jumper.  </P> <P> Chula Vista could do little right early on, but soon found its groove.  </P></p>

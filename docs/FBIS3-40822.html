			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jawad al-Bashiti: "The Right to Compensation for </F> the Right of Return"]    [Text] The gist of this article/treatment is that America's  first-time abstention from voting for Resolution 194 may be  intended to imply that Palestinians must choose between the  right to a state and the right of return--between a political  right and a human right.    Since UN General Assembly Resolution 194 was passed on 11  December 1948, the United States alone every year has sponsored  a vote on the resolution, renewing its support for it. Paragraph  11 of this well-known international resolution (which Israel  says binds no one, as it was passed by the General Assembly, not  the Security Council) establishes the right of Palestinian  refugees to return to their homes and live in peace with their  neighbors and the obligation to pay compensation for property to  those who choose not to return and for every missing or injured  person.    Only this year did the United States take a different  position. It refused to sponsor the motion to renew the  international community's support for Resolution 194 and joined  Israel in abstaining from voting.    The Arabs were dealt a double blow. They were gripped by  fear  that American policy in President Bill Clinton's administration  would become more strongly inclined to disengage itself from the  international authority for the Middle East peace process  embodied in Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on  the Arab-Israeli conflict.    Critics of the Declaration of Principles agreement signed by  the PLO and the Israeli government, as well as forces that were  hostile to it from the beginning, can find in the new American  position reason to conclude that the Oslo-Washington agreement  was what allowed the United States to retreat from its  traditional position on Resolution 194 as prelude to devising an  unjust solution to the problem of the Palestinian refugees.    Critics and opponents can also say that it is politically  naive to demand that the United States be more royalist than the  king or more Palestinian than the Palestinians, now that the PLO  has signed an agreement that puts the refugee problem on the  "permanent solution" agenda without mentioning Resolution 194,  deemed to be the international authority for resolving this  problem.    We will not evade a response to this point of view, which  seems to have acquired some plausibility in the wake of and  because of the recent American position, but we shall first try  to assess the real dimensions of the American step.    About a year and a half ago, the United States announced  that  it had in the past supported and still supported UN General  Assembly Resolution 194. This position was announced by the  State Department's spokeswoman Margaret Tutweiler prior to the  meeting in Ottawa of the committee on refugees that has emerged  from the multilateral negotiations on regional cooperation in  the Middle East. Her statement reinforced the feeling that Arab,  and especially Palestinian, participation in the multilateral  negotiations would help enable the American administration to  develop its positions on the peace process and make them more  positive by Arab-Palestinian standards. Certainly, the mention  of Resolution 194 in official American statements raises in the  minds of those who yearn for "a just peace" a headlong desire to  believe that the Palestinian problem from A to Z will be  resolved finally in a political settlement that drives into  oblivion the "humanitarian clause" contained in Security Council  Resolution 242. This clause revealed to us how much those who  hold the reins of international policy wrapped in international  legitimacy lack the humanitarian sense; for setting  "humanitarian right" in place of what is "political right"  represents a complete negation of true humanitarian criteria.    Of all Palestinian rights, the right of return is the one  that most inspires the dreams of afflicted Palestinians. It will  turn out to be an outrageous crime if the United States feigns  inability to help us respond to this political and humanitarian  need. This we say, having been taught by the experience of  international politics that a major power's announced political  commitment on an issue can for practical considerations turn  into a political deception that its authors usually categorize  as part of what they like to call "the political game."    Tutweiler's statement, which was in response to a  journalist's question, was followed by an American official's  admission that the administration preferred not to answer  "questions of this kind."    The officially announced reason was that the American  administration preferred to avoid raising difficult problems,  such as the right of return for Palestinians, at the beginning  of the talks, because raising them could lead to "the collapse  of the house of cards" in which the peace negotiations are  taking place.    Signaling that the United States would adhere to an  interpretation of Resolution 194 that evaded the essence of the  resolution, the American assistant secretary of state for Middle  Eastern affairs, Ambassador Edward Djerejian said: "The matter  (Tutweiler's statement) has been magnified and given more  importance than it really has. You know the United States'  position on Jerusalem. That is a good example of how the matter  can be twisted."    It is indeed a good example. Resolution 194 also speaks  about  putting Jerusalem under United Nations custody, whereas the  American position (which until the other day supported this  resolution) leaves the destiny of Jerusalem to the negotiations  and supports the city's continued unity.    How does the United States now justify its new position of  abstaining from voting?    Explaining the reasons for his country's abstention, George  Sherman, the American representative, said: "We want at this  important moment to avoid problems that might cause division;  for the positions of the parties in the region differ in  important respects on the refugee issue, and these differences  must be settled at the negotiating table."    After renewing America's strong commitment to "a  comprehensive, just, and lasting peace," he expressed his  government's hope that this peace would include a satisfactory  settlement of the refugee problem. As for the "philosophical  principles" of this American view, they are: "not showing  partiality in advance, not prejudging the results of the  negotiations, and rejecting any language that could be deemed a  premature judgment."    The American representative registered his country's  objection to such expressions as "occupied Palestinian land,  including Jerusalem," and "Palestinian and other Arab lands that  Israel has occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem." According  to the American representative's explanation, these phrases or  expressions could be considered "prejudiced and prematurely  judging the results of the negotiations."    For the same reasons, the United States abstained from  voting  on a draft resolution on the Golan "condemning Israel, the  occupying power, for refusing to obey resolutions on the  occupied Syrian Golan, particularly Security Council Resolution  497, in which the Council deemed that Israel's decision to  impose its laws, judicial rule, and administration on the Golan  was null and void and of no effect under international law and  demanded that Israel rescind the decision immediately."    We do not know how this American position squares with  Clinton's announcement that his meeting with Syria's President  Hafiz al-Asad "will show the authority of the foundations of the  process for a comprehensive, lasting peace."    Washington has transferred the refugee question from the  bilateral to the multilateral negotiations. At the same time,  Washington has prevented making Resolution 194 a basis for  negotiations in the committee on refugees. Washington has  announced several times that it opposes raising the question of  the Palestinians' right to return at the multilateral  negotiations on refugees.    Although the United States has moved the subject of the  refugees to the multilateral negotiations, it has affirmed on  many occasions that this subject must be discussed when the  parties begin negotiating in the bilateral negotiations about  the final disposition.    Washington views the committee on refugees that has emerged  from the multilateral negotiations as the place where the  "technical aspects" of the refugee problem and its mode of  resolution can be discussed.    But only the bilateral negotiations based on Resolution 242  are responsible for finding "a just solution to the refugee  problem" in accordance with this resolution. In the context of  the bilateral negotiations, from the purely legal point of view  the United Nations can at the appropriate time interpret "a just  solution" to the refugee problem as being full implementation of  Resolution 194. In seeking to interpret the phrase "just  solution," the international organization cannot ignore  Resolution 194, for the legitimate international authority is an  indivisible whole. Without downplaying the significance of the  latest American position, we expect the United States to  continue its support for Resolution 194--this because it is the  party most eager for the peace negotiations to encompass all the  difficult issues and problems for whose solution the United  Nations has defined foundations through its various resolutions.  The most important thing for Washington is that the political  negotiations reach results in light of which one can claim that  all UN resolutions have turned into agreements between the  parties, even if these agreements turn out to have the form of a  distorted and arbitrary interpretation of the resolutions of the  international authority.    Even Israel wants a certain implementation of Resolution  194.  It hopes that the negotiations on a "final solution" will arrive  at results that guarantee the Palestinian refugees their right  to compensation for their right to return to their homes.    Perhaps the most important thing that must be avoided is  indulging in the illusion that the UN General Assembly is  capable of implementing Resolution 194. For 45 years, the  Assembly has stated that the condition of the refugees is  disturbing and has expressed regret that no means have yet been  reached to realize progress in implementing paragraph 11 of  Resolution 194.    Yet, what if paragraph 11 were implemented under the current  circumstances of the peace process?    Israel, with support from the United States and other  powers,  would strongly reject allowing the Palestinian refugees to  return to their homes, so that compensation would become the  likely alternative. And compensation by itself would not be the  solution, since Israel would seek to make it part of a process  of resettling the refugees in Arab and foreign countries and  granting them the nationalities of these countries.    Palestinians can in no way accept such a solution. The focus  of their striving and struggle will remain guaranteeing the  refugees' right to return to their homes and guaranteeing the  right of returnees or those who receive compensation to obtain  Palestinian nationality, so that the Palestinian state in the  West Bank and Gaza Strip will belong to Palestinians wherever  they may be.    While holding fast to Resolution 194, we realize that some  requirements of a just solution to the Palestinian refugee  problem cannot be found in this resolution. A just solution to  the refugee problem cannot come about through implementation of  Resolution 194, just as it cannot come about without its  implementation. The impact of the political and strategic  pressures by which the state of Palestine has been limited  geographically to the West Bank and Gaza Strip must be  neutralized as regards the demography of this state, so that the  economy can be its defining factor in regard to population.</p>

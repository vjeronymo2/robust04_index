			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / The swan song of a Tyneside shipyard DOWN BY the River Tyne yesterday Swan Hunter workers wisecracked about renaming one of the Navy frigates they are completing HMS Receivership. But their hearts were not really in the joke. In the Commons, Labour MPs were not in a mood for jokes either. They blamed the government for the possible closure of Swan Hunter after the shipyard's failure to win a vital defence contract, and spoke of a 'betrayal' of the workforce by the government. They also jeered at possible measures to help employment in Tyneside put forward by Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister. Yesterday Dr David Clark, Labour MP for South Shields and shadow defence secretary, said the government took the decision knowing that the shrinking size of the Navy meant four warship yards were no longer needed. 'They've decided to close Swans down - it makes life easier for them,' he said. The government's announcement of an enterprise zone and other aid, in the event of 'substantial' job losses, and silence from Swans' management - believed to be in crisis talks with its bankers - only deepened Tyneside's sense of doom. As workers digested the news that Swans had lost the fight for a helicopter carrier the 2,000 employees were trying to work normally, but the mood of pessimism about the shipyard's future was palpable. There was bewilderment and anger that the company was so dramatically underbid - by more than Pounds 50m - by its rivals VSEL and Kvaerner Govan. Mr Eddie Darke, leader of the union campaign to win the order, said: 'It's like asking for a Ferrari and getting a Lada.' The unions have called for an inquiry into the tender gap. But Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, rejected claims there had been unfair competition between Swan Hunter and VSEL. He said: 'We were watching out for any unfair subsidy or unfair undercutting; we have to say we don't believe that was the case.' But no one questioned the severity of the economic impact that closure of Swans would have on the area. Estimates put direct and indirect job losses at 6,000. Mr Sainsbury's announcement that Newcastle and South Tyneside travel-to-work areas would retain development area status, even after the review of the assisted areas map, brought little cheer. As Mr Stephen Clark, chief executive of South Tyneside council, pointed out, development area status could hardly be removed from an area that already has Britain's highest mainland unemployment with 28 per cent of men jobless. Mr Sainsbury announced a Pounds 2.5m development by English Estates at Walker Riverside, in East Newcastle, an additional Pounds 2m for the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation, and a new enterprise zone in an unspecified location. Mr Clark said that South Tyneside already needed an enterprise zone to help it compete against other nearby zones and to cope with the effects of the mothballing and effective closure last Friday of the Westoe colliery. Mr Sainsbury's Commons argument about the benefits of moving 'excessive dependence on the old industries of coal, shipbuilding and steel to a more diversified economy with vehicles, pharmaceuticals and electronics providing employment that will last' struck a hollow note. Dr Clark said: 'How does a working class town of 100,000 people come to terms with there being no work when the whole culture is based on work?'</p>

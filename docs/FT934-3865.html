			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Resilient S&amp;N shows 2% advance to Pounds 109m Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the brewing and leisure group, showed resilience amid continuing market difficulties to record a 2 per cent increase in first half pre-tax profits to Pounds 108.9m, against Pounds 107.2m. 'In the UK we experienced some signs of returning consumer confidence but it remained inconsistent and a lack of certainty was particularly evident in the high street,' said Mr Brian Stewart, chief executive. 'In our European leisure operations, bookings continued to be remarkably high but the reluctance of customers to spend freely was evident. 'Christmas sales will not only be important in the immediate financial contribution they make to annual results but also as an indicator of consumer attitudes to spending.' Fully diluted earnings per share for the six months to end-October edged ahead to 17.7p (17.4p). The interim dividend is increased 4 per cent to 5.99p. Operating profit was virtually flat at Pounds 122m on turnover of Pounds 773.7m (Pounds 760.7m). Beer profits declined from Pounds 53.9m to Pounds 50.4m before tax on marginally lower turnover of Pounds 443.1m. Leading brands, such as McEwan's, Theakston's and Beck's, backed by a 20 per cent increase in advertising, held volume decline to 2 per cent in a market which declined 3 per cent. However, increased competition in the take-home trade resulted in a significant fall in volumes of low-margin, own-label products and a small overall loss in market share. The change to end-product duty brought additional costs of Pounds 2m but the results benefited from a Pounds 3m reduction in bad debt provisions. Cost reduction initiatives taken last year made some contribution but will only become fully effective in the second half. Retail profits improved from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 29.2m on turnover maintained at Pounds 145.3m in spite of fewer managed pubs. Food sales grew more than 5 per cent - and at 8 per cent of turnover offered 'great scope for future development,' said Mr Stewart. Integration of the Chef &amp; Brewer estate, acquired in October, will be completed by the end of the financial year together with the first phase of an investment programme of Pounds 11m in 150 of the pubs. Leisure operations lifted profits 9 per cent to Pounds 42.4m (Pounds 38.8m) on turnover up from Pounds 169.7m to Pounds 185.3m. Center Parcs' profits in the UK were ahead 15 per cent and bookings for 1994 were significantly higher. Occupancy rates of 89 per cent were achieved in France where capacity was doubled. Pontin's recorded a 5 per cent increase in turnover and an 8 per cent rise in bookings. See Lex</p>

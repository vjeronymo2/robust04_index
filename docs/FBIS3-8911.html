			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Hajrudin Sermic report from Maglaj] </F>   [Text] Maglaj has again been shelled heavily today. Just  before 1100 the chetniks opened fierce artillery fire at the  town and the surrounding area, unselectively destroying  residential quarters. Only at 1400, when NATO bombers appeared  and swooped over them, did their guns fall silent. Some 30  destructive shells were fired from multiple rocket launchers at  the town, killing one person and inflicting serious wounds on  two others.    So the suffering of the population of this town is  continuing  with new brutality every day, and things are only made worse by  hunger. There is no sign of the convoy with food that has been  announced for today, as Karadzic's mob is still preventing the  entry of the aid that is so needed in Maglaj.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Eligibility for integration.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The debt instrument is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifying debt instrument because it is a variable rate debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument. The swap is a &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge because it is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial instrument and a yield to maturity on the combined cash  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flows of the swap and the debt instrument can be calculated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the debt instrument is denominated in pounds, the swap  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hedges only interest rate risk, not currency risk. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1.988&hyph;5(a) for the treatment of a debt instrument and a swap if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the swap hedges currency risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Treatment of the synthetic debt instrument.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> synthetic debt instrument is a 5-year debt instrument that has an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue price of 0D1,000 and provides for semiannual interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments of 0D50 and a principal payment of 0D1,000 at maturity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under paragraph (g)(6) of this section, the semiannual interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments are treated as qualified stated interest payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under paragraph (g)(7)(ii) of this section, the synthetic debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument's stated redemption price at maturity is 0D838 (the sum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of all amounts to be received on the qualifying debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge, reduced by all amounts to be paid on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge and the semiannual interest payments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> synthetic debt instrument). Because the issue price of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> synthetic debt instrument exceeds the instrument's stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redemption price at maturity, the synthetic debt instrument does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have OID. The synthetic debt instrument, however, does have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0D162 of amortizable bond premium. The 0D162 prepayment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge made by H on January 1, 1996, increases the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusted issue price of the synthetic debt instrument to 0D1,162  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately after it is issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 4. Legging into an integrated transaction by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holder <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On January 1, 1996, X corporation purchases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for $1,000,000 a debt instrument that matures on December 31,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2005. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest at the rate of 6 percent and for a payment at maturity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equal to $1,000,000, increased by the excess, if any, of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price of 1,000 units of a commodity on December 31, 2005, over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $350,000, and decreased by the excess, if any, of $350,000 over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the price of 1,000 units of a commodity on that date. Assume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that on the issue date the forward price of the commodity on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 31, 2005, is $370,000. The projected amount of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment at maturity, determined under &sect;1.1275&hyph;4(b)(4), therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is $1,020,000. On January 1, 1999, X enters into a cash settled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forward contract with an unrelated party to sell 1,000 units of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the commodity on December 31, 2005, for $450,000. Also on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1999, X identifies the transaction as an integrated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transaction in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (f)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Eligibility for integration.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> X meets the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for integration as of January 1, 1999. Therefore, X legged into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an integrated transaction on that date. Prior to that date, X  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treats the debt instrument under the applicable rules of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1.1275&hyph;4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Treatment of the synthetic debt instrument.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> As of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1999, the debt instrument and the forward contract are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated as an integrated transaction. The issue price of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> synthetic debt instrument is equal to the adjusted issue price of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the qualifying debt instrument on the leg-in date, $1,004,804  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (assuming one year accrual periods). The term of the synthetic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument is from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2005.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The synthetic debt instrument provides for annual interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments of $60,000 and a principal payment at maturity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $1,100,000 ($1,000,000 + $450,000 ^ $350,000). Under paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)(6) of this section, the annual interest payments are treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as qualified stated interest payments. Under paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)(7)(ii) of this section, the synthetic debt instrument's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated redemption price at maturity is $1,100,000 (the sum of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts to be received on the qualifying debt instrument and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge, reduced by all amounts to be paid on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge and the annual interest payments on the synthetic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 5. Abusive leg-in <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On January 1, 1996,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Y corporation purchases for $1,000,000 a debt instrument that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matures on December 31, 2000. The debt instrument provides for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual payments of interest at the rate of 6 percent, a payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on December 31, 1998 of the increase, if any, in the price of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commodity from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 1998, and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment at maturity of $1,000,000 and the increase, if any, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the price of the commodity from December 31, 1998 to maturity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the debt instrument is a contingent payment debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument subject to &sect;1.1275&hyph;4, Y accrues interest based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected payment schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Leg-in.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By December 1998, the price of the commodity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has substantially increased and Y expects a positive adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on December 31, 1998. On December 20, 1998, Y enters into an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement to exchange the two commodity based payments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument for two payments on the same dates of $100,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each. Y identifies the transaction as an integrated transaction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section. Y disposes of the hedge on January 15, 1999.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Treatment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The legging into an integrated transaction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has the effect of deferring the positive adjustment from 1998 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1999. Because Y legged into the integrated transaction with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal purpose to defer the positive adjustment, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commissioner may treat the debt instrument as sold for its fair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market value on the leg-in date, December 20, 1998, or refuse to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow integration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 6. Integration of offsetting debt instruments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On January 1, 1996, Z issues two 10-year debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments. The first, Issue 1, has an issue price of $1,000,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pays interest annually at 6 percent, and, at maturity, pays  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $1,000, increased by $1 times the increase, if any, in the value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the S&amp;P 100 Index over the term of the instrument and reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by $1 times the decrease, if any, in the value of the S&amp;P 100  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Index over the term of the instrument. However, the amount paid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at maturity may not be less than $500 or more than $1,500. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second, Issue 2, has an issue price of $1,000, pays interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annually at 8 percent, and, at maturity, pays $1,000, reduced by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $1 times the increase, if any, in the value of the S&amp;P 100 Index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over the term of the instrument and increased by $1 times the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decrease, if any, in the value of the S&amp;P 100 Index over the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the instrument. The amount paid at maturity may not be less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than $500 or more than $1,500. As of January 1, 1996, Z  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identifies Issue 1 as the qualifying debt instrument, Issue 2 as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge, and otherwise meets the identification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

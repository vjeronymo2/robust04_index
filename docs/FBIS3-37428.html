"Lack of unity has hampered the opposition armed formations  from taking radical measures to stabilize the situation in the  republic," a spokesperson from the opposition headquarters told  Interfax.    According to the same sources, after the final unification  of  the opposition forces, the regime of President Dzhokhar Dudayev  will be "more precarious than ever."    Interfax asked several supporters of the opposition to  comment on the proclamation of sovereignty by official Groznyy.    "I do not need that kind of independence such as when my  mother is not paid her pension for two years," Rizvan Gairabekov  said.    "Sovereignty proclaimed by a group of bandits, leads to  surprising paradoxes: A person who was in prison at the same  time with me is now a major of the Committee of National  Security," he remarked.    According to Zaindi Khajimuradov, Chechnya is now a "hotbed  of crime."    "Kidnapping of women, murders, vendettas have become wide  spread and murderers and rapists are still free. We are an  integral part of Russia. So why did it forget about us? Where  are we living?" he said.    The opposition headquarters showed Interfax a list of  weapons  which could be acquired in Groznyy: a Kalashnikov automatic gun  is sold for 700,000-850,000 rubles, a Makarov gun for $600, a  short gun for $1000, a 76-millimeter canon without battle scale  of ammunition will cost 50,000 rubles, a howitzer goes for 30 Mn  rubles and an APC for 5-6 Mn rubles.</p>

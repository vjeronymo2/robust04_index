			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Greece lifts fuel blockade Greece yesterday allowed 80 railway tanker trucks loaded with fuel to cross into neighbouring Macedonia after 22 days of blockading its borders, according to Macedonian state-run radio. Another delivery of 50 tankers was expected to cross later in the day, the radio said. Yesterday's surprise fuel delivery coincided with United Nations-mediated talks in Geneva between the foreign ministers of Greece and Macedonia. But UN mediator Cyrus Vance said he could report little immediate progress in efforts to settle the dispute.</p>

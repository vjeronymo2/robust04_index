			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "vg": "Hungarian Civic Party: Coexistence Offer </F> Is a Belated April Fools Joke"]    [Text] K. Petocz, secretary of the Hungarian Civic Party  [MOS] for foreign relations, yesterday described as a belated  April fools joke the Coexistence Movement's offer for the  conclusion of a three-member [ethnic Hungarian] coalition  without the participation of MOS leadership members on the  common slate of candidates. "This cannot be a serious political  gesture," he said. MOS Chairman L. Nagy assesses [Coexistence  Chairman Miklos] Duray's movement's attitude as an attempt to  eliminate a competitor. "It is like cutting off an athlete's  arms and legs and putting him on the starting line," he said.  At the same time, however, he conceded that, so far, MOS has  not been informed through official channels of the conclusions  of the Coexistence Republic Council's meeting [at Lucenec on 28  May], which it knows only from media reports. According to  Petocz, Coexistence representatives should finally start  behaving like politicians and stop acting like offended persons.  Otherwise, he stressed, it might happen that the Hungarian  minority will not be represented in parliament at all. "And  that would mean an additional 20 deputies for Meciar and the  Slovak National Party," he said. MOS Chairman Nagy observed in  this context that not only the Hungarian minority would be  placed at a disadvantage in that case but also the whole of  Slovakia, which, owing to the irresponsibility of a handful of  people, would acquire the reputation of a country that is  intolerant toward ethnic minorities.</p>

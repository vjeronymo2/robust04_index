			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> An editing error in Monday's Calendar distorted Martin Bernheimer's review of  "Asia," as performed by the Feld Ballet in San Diego. As published, the passage  read: "There is a lot of arm in too many directions, both stylistic and  emotive, for aesthetic comfort."  </P> <P> The passage should have read: "There is a lot of arm undulating, a lot of  mock-Oriental posing, a lot of twisting, churning and limb-tangling among the  lunging ladies. The communal silliness rambles in too many directions, both  stylistic and emotive, for aesthetic comfort."  </P></p>

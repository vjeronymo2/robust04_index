			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Military loyalties - Ballot Box Followers of the Staffordshire Regiment, destined for amalgamation with the Cheshires if the ministry of defence has its way, have put county loyalties on the electoral agenda. Each candidate in the county's 26 constituencies has received a letter from the Save our Staffords campaign. 'What we are aiming to do is for the 26 selected candidates to go back (to Westminster) knowing that retention of the regiment is a priority in Staffordshire,' said Brigadier John Levy, running the campaign from his headquarters in the Lichfield shopping precinct. In the shop window is a board which will list where each of the candidates stand on the issue: at their meetings, the candidates will face planted questions about the future of the regiment. The Staffords were part of the UN spearhead which liberated Kuwait. Less well known is that the Lichfield shop headquarters is owned by the Kuwaitis. St Martin's Property Corporation, part of the Kuwait Investment Office, made the shop available.</p>

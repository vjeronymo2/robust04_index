			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Labour takes London borough LABOUR TOOK control of the west London borough of Hillingdon yesterday after winning a by-election. The seat gave the party 35 councillors to the Conservatives' 34. No other parties are represented on the council. Hillingdon was last controlled by Labour in 1978, and had a hung council between 1986 and 1990. Mr Steve Panayi, the borough's Labour leader, said the result demonstrated that 'not only the Liberal Democrats can win by-elections in the south'. He said Labour intended to spend reserves to reinstate a range of social services that were cut by the Conservatives earlier this year. Hillingdon's shift reflects the growing strength in local government of both Labour and the Liberal Democrats. These parties have shared control in a number of county councils since the elections in May, despite Labour's opposition to deals with the Liberal Democrats at national level. In Bedfordshire and Wiltshire, however, Labour shares power with the Conservatives, while in Cheshire and Surrey the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats hold power. Labour denies that these deals have involved bargaining over policies. Labour said: 'The essential point is that Labour must maintain a separate political identity. That's the overriding criterion the national executive committee has used. Clearly on a day-to-day basis there will inevitably be some co-operation.' Local Labour parties have been asked to explain their power-sharing arrangements to Labour's national executive committee, which has given approval to most of the deals for a year.</p>

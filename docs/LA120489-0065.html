			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> PENTAGON SUPERCOMPUTER GRANT  </P> <P> A Cambridge, Mass., company will get $12 million from the Pentagon to help it  build a computer that would be 1,000 times faster than today's most advanced  models.  </P> <P> Thinking Machines Corp. said the new computer would be capable of conducting a  trillion mathematical operations per second. The grant will come from the  Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.  </P> <P> High-speed computers simulate events in the physical world numerically. They  are widely used by the government in such fields as nuclear weapons design and  weather forecasting, by scientists to simulate subatomic processes or very  large systems such as the atmosphere, and by private companies for such things  as semiconductor circuit design.  </P></p>

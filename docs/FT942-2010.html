			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Futures-linked sales leave Nikkei down 1.6 per cent Weaker bond prices and a higher yen depressed investor confidence, and share prices fell sharply on technical selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average declined by 351.27, or 1.6 per cent, to 21,152.03 on futures-linked selling. The index opened at the day's high of 21,515.60 and fell to a low of 21,125.63 in the late afternoon. Bond prices declined on continued expectations of an economic recovery, while fears that the Bank of Japan had failed to inject enough funds into the money market exacerbated the fall, raising worries of higher interest rates among stock market participants. Meanwhile, the strength of the yen, which rose back to the Y102 range against the dollar, depressed export-related stocks. Selling of Nikkei futures by foreign investors triggered liquidation of arbitrage holdings. Traders said dealers, who had accumulated positions in the futures market last week on hopes of increased participation by domestic institutions, followed suit. Although individual investors and some domestic institutions sought bargain prices, many investors remained nervous of the large arbitrage overhang. Volume totalled 410m shares, against 518m. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 21.06 to 1,684.47, while the Nikkei 300 fell 3.99 to 305.64. Declines led rises by 841 to 215, with 131 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index dipped 14.75 to 1,363.50. Export-oriented, high-technology shares lost ground on the higher yen. Hitachi slipped Y30 to Y1,060, NEC Y30 to Y1,270 and Sony Y60 to Y6,280. Oki Electric, a recent favourite among retail investors, was the most actively traded, declining Y7 to Y808. Rising commodity prices helped mining and oil related stocks. Mitsubishi Oil advanced Y25 to Y1,000 and Sumitomo Metal Mining Y26 to Y998. However, Dowa Mining lost Y7 at Y620 on profit-taking, and Showa Shell Sekiyu, the oil refiner, receded Y40 to Y1,480 on index-linked selling. Banks declined on arbitrage selling, Industrial Bank of Japan by Y50 to Y3,200 and Mitsubishi Bank Y30 to Y2,680. Nippon Shoji, a pharmaceutical wholesaler, fell Y80 to Y1,570 on allegations of insider trading among its employees. Speculative buying supported Nippon Zeon, which rose Y20 to Y595, Hanwa, the steel trader, up Y7 to Y642, and Sanrio, Y30 higher at Y2,090. In Osaka, the OSE average retreated 222.23 to 23,560.91 in volume of 82.2m shares. Roundup Much of the region was under pressure, while Karachi was closed for a two-day religious holiday. HONG KONG was concerned about the weakness of the US dollar, and the Hang Seng index, which fell more than 150 points at one stage, finished 115.78, or 1.3 per cent, lower at 8,998.18. Turnover was a thin HKDollars 2.2bn. Property issues weakened on profit-taking and in further response to government measures to cool rocketing prices. HSBC Holdings dipped HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 85 and Cheung Kong HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 35.25.

The SET index fell 17.25, or 1.3 per cent, to 1,353.28 in turnover of Bt6.2bn, after Friday's Bt14bn. KUALA LUMPUR staged a sharp reversal to early gains in the afternoon to close lower as investors took profits. The composite index finished 2.58 down at 1,035.46 after a day's high of 1,041.93. Construction and Supplies House, which resumed trading after signing a MDollars 2.59bn timber deal, led activity with 22m shares traded. The stock rose to a high of MDollars 11.20 before closing at MDollars 9.60, against its pre-suspension price of MDollars 7.95. TAIPEI saw profit-taking in the heavily weighted financial sector, which led last week's rally.

Among the hardest hit financials, China Trust dropped TDollars 4.5, or 6.3 per cent, to TDollars 67.5.

The composite index receded 28.15 to 2,854.68 as PLDT lost 40 pesos at 1,695 pesos. SINGAPORE turned volatile on rumours that Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad might not call a general election this year. A report quoting Mr Mahathir as advising investors to avoid speculation on stock market rumours and tips also dampened business, and the Straits Times Industrial index closed 21.73 lower at 2,284.50. WELLINGTON lost 1.5 per cent in response to weaker world bond and equity markets, particularly in the US and Australia. The NZSE-40 capital index slipped 30.63 to 2,072.70 in typically thin Monday turnover of NZDollars 32.8m.

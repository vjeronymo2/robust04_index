			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> GULF OF MEXICO;  </P> <P> OIL SLICK FOUND IN GULF AFTER SOS  </P> <P> A Coast Guard plane found an oil slick in the area of the Gulf of Mexico where  a mystery ship had reported that it was sinking, and the captain of another  vessel reported seeing flares in the area, 23 miles south of Pensacola, Fla.  The distress call did not identify the boat but said there were 18 people  aboard but only 17 life vests. However, there have been no reports of overdue  vessels. The Coast Guard said the call could be a hoax but that the search  would continue.  </P></p>

The report said that the situation in other sections of the  front remained relatively calm, meaning that the sides were  exchanging fire but did not mount offensives.    The Azerbaijani army has lost up to 5,000 soldiers and  officers, one warplane and 62 armoured vehicles, including 36  tanks, in the 1.5-month large-scale offensive it launched on  December 18, 1993. It also lost 12 artillery guns, including  three Grad missile launchers, and a large amount of other arms.  Twenty six Azerbaijani soldiers have surrendered.    The Karabakh side lost about 300 people and 24 armoured  vehicles which have been fully made up for by seized Azerbaijani  tanks and armoured personnel carriers.    The Nagorno-Karabakh military explain the decline in the  activity of the Azerbaijani army by considerable losses,  especially among new recruiters who make up the bulk of its  troops, and the absence of big positive results. Karabakh  experts said that Azerbaijan's initial successes owed to its  strength superiority. They were of a local nature and were  eventually neutralised by the Karabakh forces.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National News Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Ninety percent of the military commanders of the  main combat fleet under the People's Navy have achieved an  educational level equivalent to a regular university degree.  This is one of the hallmarks of a new stage in the Navy's  modernization.    According to what a reporter saw during a tour of a certain  submarine detachment in the North Sea Fleet, officers and men  have acquired a range of training methods aimed at improving  their overall fighting capability with the assistance of  existing equipment in complex settings; this has been made  possible by the general improvement in their educational levels.  Their detachment has been named as an all-army, advanced  training unit for two consecutive years.

In its early days in 1949, most captains did not even have a  primary school education. Since the fifties, the Navy Vessels  Academy, the Navy Submarine Academy, and other naval academies  aimed at training commanders for troops on surface vessels and  submarines have been established one after another. Most of the  Navy's primary-level commanding officers are graduates of those  academies. Commanding officers of all ranks must undergo  training anew in those academies or training groups if they want  to be promoted. This will enable them to constantly renew their  knowledge, improve their strategic and command skills, and  master the various modern equipment and systems employed at  their posts and their ranks. Nineteen cadres from a certain  detachment in the East Sea Fleet have been admitted to Chinese  University of Science and Technology and other major colleges  and universities for graduate programs leading to master's and  doctoral degree.

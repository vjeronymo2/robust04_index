			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Historical Sciences Aleksey </F> Andreyev, chief of the Department of Political Science at Kuban  State University, under the rubric "Bearings": "The Cossack  Movement: Trends and Prospects"]    [Text] The Cossack movement has become one of the  significant elements in the sociopolitical and sociocultural  life of present-day Russia. Experts estimate that at present  there are about 5 million descendants of Cossacks in the Russian  Federation, who as a rule reside both in areas of traditional  settlement of their ancestors (Don, the Kuban, Terek, the Urals,  and the Transbaykal area) and in large cities (Moscow, St.  Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, Omsk, Samara, and  Voronezh). Many of them have formed the social foundation for  the organizational establishment of the Cossack estate in Russia  in the late 1980's and early 1990's.    The modern-day Cossack movement emerged in stages. The  creation of cultural-educational and military-historical Cossack  societies in 1988-1989 can be considered the point of departure.  At the first stage these structures resembled organizationally  amorphous discussion clubs with a patriotic orientation.  However, it was precisely within these societies that the  process of perceiving and ideologically expressing the need for  the rebirth of the Cossack estate developed. This phenomenon did  not escape the attention of local party committees. Moreover,  some of them, perceiving the Cossacks as a major sociopolitical  force capable of becoming the backbone of the authoritarian  regime, tried to lay their hands on the movement. In the future,  this fact engendered a contradictory response to the rebirth of  the Cossack estate among the population and major differences  within the movement itself.    The second stage of the assertion of the Cossack movement  embraced the period from the beginning of 1990 through August  1991. During the first half of 1990 extensive preparations were  made for holding the Cossack Grand Assembly, which was held on  28-30 July 1990 in Moscow and drew 200 delegates and 457 guests.  The assembly founded the Union of Cossacks, elected Ataman A.G.  Martynov and members of the board, and adopted a statute and an  appeal to the Cossacks in the country and abroad. According to  the statute, the Union of Cossacks was proclaimed to be a  voluntary public association of the representatives of Cossack  areas, districts, and communities on the basis of common  socioeconomic, spiritual-cultural, and other interests. The  historic and spiritual renaissance of the Cossack estate as an  original ethnic formation was declared to be the main objective.  Certain contradictions shone through in the principles of  operations. On one hand, free economic development was  proclaimed, while on the other hand, private ownership of land  was rejected. The mandatory nature of Orthodoxy appeared next to  religious tolerance, and assembly-run democracy--next to the  restoration of the prerevolutionary status.    The formation of the Union of Cossacks inaugurated the  organizational establishment of the Cossack movement. Within a  few months, unions and societies were formed locally, primarily  at the middle level (okrug, kray, oblast). Expansion of the  chain of primary Cossack structures in cities, rayons, Cossack  settlements, and hamlets is still underway. The creation of  Cossack formations on the principle of compatriot communities  has become characteristic in territories that have never been  populated by Cossacks and to which they had not been deported on  a mass scale during Soviet times. In particular, such  organizations were founded in St. Petersburg, Tula, Voronezh,  and a number of other cities of the Russian Federation. In Riga,  the Baltic Cossack Community was formed, which united Cossacks  from different hosts who by the will of fate ended up in the  Baltic area. A trend toward interregional unification emerged:  This was how the Union of Cossacks of the Volga Area and the  Urals (organizations and communities of 15 oblasts and republics  of the Russian Federation) appeared.    The disintegration of the USSR and the strengthening of  centrifugal tendencies in Russia, the aggravation of interethnic  and state-to-state relations on Russia's borders, the overall  growth of instability and social tension, the growth of the  anti-Russian sentiment in nearby foreign countries, the ever  increasing flow of refugees and forced resettlers streaming to  the territory of Russia from the CIS countries, the need to fill  the spiritual vacuum that formed after the rejection of  communist ideology, and the striving of the people to plug into  some kind of stable community in order to counteract the  mounting atomization of society may be considered the main  factors stimulating the growth of Cossack entities.    The third stage in the development of the Cossack movement  (from the end of 1991 to present) has been marked, on one hand,  by the creation of a state-legal foundation for the renaissance  of the Cossack estate and, on the other hand, the increasing  politization of Cossack organizations and an organizational  split within the movement on ideological and political grounds.  The Union of Cossack Hosts of Russia was created as the  successor of the "White" movement to counterbalance the  "postcommunist" Union of Cossacks. The main differences between  the two unions in question may be reduced to the following:  first, their orientation toward differing political forces and,  as a consequence, differing attitudes toward the policy of the  Russian authorities: from moderately hostile on the part of the  Union of Cossacks (SK) to enthusiastic on the part of the Union  of Cossack Hosts of Russia (SKVR); second, differences in  interpreting the role of Cossacks in interethnic conflicts: from  direct involvement in them of SK representatives to the  orientation toward the need for negotiations on the part of the  SKVR; third, differing attitudes toward private ownership of  land: from its negation by the SK to its recognition by the SKVR.    The complex processes of division among the Cossacks locally  can be traced using the Kuban as an example. In addition to the  largest organization which was the first to appear, the Kuban  Cossack Rada (ataman V.P. Gromov), the Cossack Host of the Kuban  (ataman Ye.A. Nagay), the "Russia" Cossack Association of the  Kuban (ataman V.I. Kayuda), and a number of other, smaller  organizations have taken shape organizationally and made their  presence known in the Kuban. Despite the efforts of the leaders  to consolidate the Cossack movement, which have brought about  the creation of the Cossack Host of all the Kuban, the main  confrontation between the Rada and the Cossack Host of the Kuban  has not been eliminated. The ataman of the latter has ignored  the unification congress. The differing sociopolitical  orientation of the organizations, which may be conventionally  called "statist" and "market-oriented," as well as to a certain  degree the personal ambitions of their leaders are at the root  of such divisions. In the political struggle of 1991-1993, the  Cossack Host of the Kuban (KKV) invariably supported President  B.N. Yeltsin, the ideas of a Russia united and indivisible, and  private property. KKV leaders affirm their anticommunism and  consider themselves the sole successors of the prerevolutionary  Cossacks of the Kuban. The KKV Statute which was adopted by the  Grand Assembly on 13 April 1992 proclaims the unification of  "all progressive Cossack forces" that are interested in bringing  back the traditional way of life. Orthodoxy is acknowledged to  be the spiritual foundation of the movement. Taking issue with  the Rada and its legal successor, the Cossack Host of all the  Kuban, the KKV Statute codifies collective leadership and  democratic principles in the structure of the host and  emphatically advertises the restoration of prerevolutionary  symbols and forms of governance.    The existing split in the Cossack movement testifies to its  objective sociopolitical and economic nature. The division will  continue, and will possibly exacerbate in the immediate future.  It is much more serious, and its roots are far deeper than  personal enmity between and ambitions of the atamans. No matter  how desirable it is, the task of the Cossack renaissance will  continue to be interpreted differently in a society with a sharp  social stratification and periodic civil wars. As we see it, at  present efforts should be directed toward mitigating the forms  of struggle between "Reds" and "Whites" and the prospects for  unifying positive actions rather than toward searching for an  illusory unity of "Reds" and "Whites."    A genuine rather than superficial perception of Orthodoxy  may  become the most important factor in rallying the Cossacks. The  "Declaration of the Cossack Estate" stressed: "The renaissance  of the Cossack estate is inconceivable and impossible without  Church affiliation and away from the bosom of the Church."  Belonging to the Orthodox religion is becoming one of the  requirements for anybody joining the movement. At the same time,  sociologists who have surveyed the world-view principles and  political orientation of the population of the Kuban have  concluded that the levels of religious commitment of the Cossack  and non-Cossack populations differ little. Order, social  protection, combating crime, and the integrity of Russia are the  main priorities and ideological planks of the Cossack estate  that ensure its consolidation.    The involvement of Cossack organizations in regional  conflicts on the territory of the CIS has become a certain  factor of consolidation, although based on "negative unity." The  Cossacks perceive themselves as a force capable of defending the  interests of the Russian-speaking (Slavic) population. This  perception makes it possible to push internal contradictions  into the background. First of all, at issue are conflicts  associated with the lack of correspondence between  administrative-territorial and ethnic boundaries in the areas  historically populated by the Cossacks. Thus, the Area of the  Don Host at present includes parts of Lugansk and Donetsk  Oblasts of Ukraine and the lands of Volgograd and Voronezh  Oblasts of the Russian Federation. Rayons in the Stavropol area,  Karachay-Cherkessia, and Cossack settlements at the Georgian  border belonged to the Area of the Cossack Host of the Kuban.    Two tactics and strategies for settling these conflicts have  come to the fore within the movement. The supporters of resolute  and uncompromising measures favor restoration of the status quo  of 1913. Thus, five republics have now been proclaimed on the  territory of the former Karachay-Cherkessia Autonomous Oblast  within Stavropol Kray, of which three are Cossack republics--the  Batalpasha, Zelenchuk-Urup, and Abaza Republics. Such surges of  sovereignization hamper the search for compromise solutions  substantially. The supporters of a moderate course come out for  taking into account the reality that has come to exist in the  past decades. They strive to grasp the experience of recent  years, which has indicated that not only the redistribution of  territory in and of itself but even a "claim" to such is capable  of causing unpredictable consequences for all parties.    Cossacks are also being drawn into conflicts on the  territories of other countries. Military formations of Cossacks  from various regions of the Russian Federation have participated  in combat actions in the Dniester area, Abkhazia, and on the  side of the Serbs in Bosnia (according to some data, in 1993 up  to 300 Cossacks from Russia were there). It is hard to predict  all the direct, indirect, and remote consequences of the  participation of Cossack formations in armed conflicts. However,  we can talk about one thing with a measure of confidence--these  are the consequences of the accumulation of weapons in the  regions of traditional Cossack settlement. The existence of  these weapons and easy access to them draw criminal elements  into the movement. Their arbitrary and unlawful actions not only  discredit Cossack organizations in the eyes of the local  population but frequently bring about serious public clashes.    An analysis of the contemporary Cossack movement presupposes  the meticulous consideration of its real and potential social  base. Before 1917 the numerical strength of the Cossacks was  determined quite accurately on the criterion of estate  affiliation and the requisite legal aspects. However, such an  estimate is impossible at present. For the last time,  affiliation with the Cossack estate was noted by the All-Union  Census of the Population in 1926. A survey taken in August 1992  by the Monitoring Russian Sociological Service made it possible  to come up with an approximate estimate of the number of the  Cossacks in Krasnodar Kray by the method of self-identification  and outside identification. It comes to approximately 18-27  percent of the kray population (that is, between 900,000 and 1.3  million people). This data may be accepted as a working  hypothesis. The educational level and occupations of the  Cossacks do not differ from the remainder of the population of  the Kuban. At the same time, as we see it, a certain  contradiction exists between the hypothetical number of the  people who identify themselves with the Cossack estate and the  real base of Cossack organizations which have so far been unable  to activate this potential. The degree to which the activities  of Cossack organizations adequately reflect the interests of the  reborn community is not clear. In particular, the programmatic  documents of these organizations include the demand to withdraw  land traditionally settled by Cossacks from the process of  privatization. At the same time, 72 percent of Cossacks polled  in the Kuban came out in favor of the right of Russia's citizens  to privately own land. For comparison, 59 percent of  non-Cossacks came out in favor of this.    A majority of the population is now quite loyally disposed  toward the Cossack movement. At the same time, the already  mentioned poll in Krasnodar Kray registered considerable  differences in the evaluation of the Cossacks from "within" and  from "without" this community. The fact that 40 percent of the  non-Cossacks take a negative view of the rebirth of the Cossack  estate indicates a source of possible social tension.  Non-Cossacks frequently view the renaissance of the Cossack  estate as a random phenomenon (and in some of its  manifestations--a vaudeville) based on superficial, temporary,  extraneous factors, and the Cossack estate of our times as an  "illusory" community. In view of this, it is important that  regulatory acts of the Russian state devoted to the Cossacks  stress the impermissibility of infringements of the rights of  any other group of the population, the reinstatement of estate  privileges, and the forcible foisting of the Cossack lifestyle  on citizens.    Despite the nonpolitical nature of the movement being  proclaimed at the first stage of the movement under study, it  developed from the outset as a sociopolitical organization. The  Union of Cossacks set forth its programmatic demands in the  "Declaration of the Cossacks of Russia." Most of its points have  now been carried out (with the exception of the points on  exempting the Cossacks from state taxes, including those on  land, until 1995 and on taking state measures to bring  administrative-territorial borders into conformity with ethnic  borders in areas traditionally settled by Cossacks). In  particular, all acts passed concerning the Cossacks beginning  1918 have been canceled as illegal with regard to taking  repressive measures. The rights of the Cossacks to restore the  traditional social and economic lifestyle and cultural  traditions and to establish territorial public self-government,  traditional forms of land use, the restoration of the  traditional names of inhabited localities and areas, and the  creation of public associations of Cossacks with historically  established names have been acknowledged. Obviously, the  legislative acts were intended not only to do historic justice  but also to expand the base of support for executive and  legislative structures in the environment of a crisis of power.    The Unification Congress of the Cossack Host of all the  Kuban  (October 1992) reflected the sociopolitical evolution of the  movement: The main principles of the statute were approved,  amounting to the "assumption by the Cossack organization, which  had previously been merely sociopatriotic, of the  responsibilities of a state structure and the impermissibility  of membership in any political party for Cossacks" (see  KUBANSKIYE NOVOSTI, 28 October 1992). This aspiration was  expressed in the "Declaration of Cossacks" dated 30 January  1993, which said that at the present stage the Union of Cossacks  plays the role of an organizational center which should be  transformed into a state structure assuming the functions of  governing the Cossack estate. The ataman of the Union of  Cossacks, the atamans of troops, regional unions, districts,  divisions, communities, and Cossack settlements were viewed as  official representatives of the Cossack estate in the local  organs of state power. The possible forms of state service by  Cossacks reflecting their traditions were specified.    The above facts indicate that attempts to restrict the  Cossack movement to a cultural-historic, "folklore" framework  are unsuccessful. Only a conflict with the power structure may  result from such attempts. Under present-day conditions, the  Cossacks are becoming one of the most active and--this is  particularly significant--most politically organized groups of  the population.</p>

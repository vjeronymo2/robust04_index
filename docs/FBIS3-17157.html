			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 23 TASS -- German Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel has called for giving Russia a role in establishing  new security structures and new architecture of security in  Europe.    Speaking at the inauguration ceremony at a retraining centre  for the demobilised military in Moscow on Wednesday, Kinkel said  that relations of strategic partnership should be established  between Russia and NATO. He stressed that after many years of  confrontation Russian-German relations are developing on the  basis of principles of good-neighbourliness, friendship and  partnership.    Kinkel said that the money spent by the German side to build  the centre and establish a re-training programme for the  military returning from Germany is a good investment in  Russian-German friendship and partnership.    The German Government said it would allocate 200 million DM  [German marks] to fund the programme and 7.800 million DM to  finance housing construction for the military. By the end of  the year the Russian military should receive 36,000 new  apartments.    Kinkel noted that Germany wants the Russian troops to leave  it as friends. It is also seeking to ensure the integration of  democratic Russia into the international community, he added.    The German foreign minister said that Germany is looking  forward to a meeting with President Boris Yeltsin, Defence  Minister Pavel Grachev and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on  August 31, 1994 when the last Russian troops will leave German  soil.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: High-risk Ulster vote may be allowed The Tory leadership will decide today whether to allow a vote on an amendment urging the government to be 'a persuader for the union' at the end of this afternoon's conference debate on Northern Ireland, David Owen writes. The amendment has been promoted heavily by the party's grassroots members in Northern Ireland. They have voiced concern at what they term the government's 'neutrality' on the issue of Ulster's future status. A decision to allow a vote would be a high-risk strategy as adoption of the amendment could strain relations between London and Dublin. The motion salutes the 'courage' shown by both Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, in agreeing the Downing Street declaration, and urges ministers to leave no stone unturned in pursuing peace 'consistent with the rights of the people of Northern Ireland to determine by democratic means their future'. In Bournemouth yesterday, Mr David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, backed Mr Major's caution in responding to the IRA's open-ended ceasefire.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, "Hamas official in </F> Syria," by 'Ali al-Salih; place and date not given]    [Text] [Al-Salih] What is the truth about disagreements  between Hamas and the Democratic Front [for the Liberation of  Palestine] [DFLP] and the Popular Front [for the Liberation of  Palestine] [PFLP] in the 10-factions [opposed to the peace  process] framework?    [Mustafa] I do not believe there are any fundamental  differences over the 10-factions issue and the need for them to  remain as they are or to be developed. An agreement has been  reached on a name for the alliance framework of these forces,  namely the "Alliance of Palestinian Forces." But there was a  disagreement over the previous name agreed by all parties,  namely the "Palestinian Islamic National Alliance," on which the  DFLP and the PFLP backtracked, demanding that it should be  changed for fear of it becoming an ideological tendency as a  result of the word Islamic.    [Al-Salih] What I meant were any political disagreements  over  the alliance's program.    [Mustafa] The disagreement over that question revolves  around  the resolutions adopted by the United Nations and recent Arab  summits. The question raised was whether we should accept or  reject these resolutions. The position of Hamas and the great  majority of the 10 factions was to reject and not to recognize  these resolutions, because they endorse the legitimacy of the  Zionist presence in Palestine. The resolutions adopted by  recent Arab summits endorsed this by accepting international  Resolutions 242 and 338. We demanded the application of the  resolution adopted by the Arab summit held in Khartoum in 1967.    There is a disagreement over the Palestinian national  charter  and its emphasis on the Arab and Islamic dimension of the  Palestinian issue. The point of disagreement is that the DFLP  is demanding the adoption of the PLO's phase program (the  10-point program) endorsed by the Palestine National Council in  1974.    [Al-Salih] Do you mean that they are demanding that the  charter be amended?    [Mustafa] They are demanding that part of the phased program  be added and UN resolutions endorsed.    [Al-Salih] The PFLP and the DFLP also attribute the  disagreement to the big share you are demanding in the alliance  leadership and your attempt to impose your influence on it.    [Mustafa] Several proposals were made when we agreed on  calling the alliance the "Palestinian Forces Alliance" in order  to form a central leadership for this alliance. For our part,  we proposed that the Islamists (Hamas and the Islamic Jihad led  by Dr. Fathi al-Shiqaqi) have one-third of the seats --  including independents -- in the leadership, namely 14 members  out of 40. That is, four members for us and 10 independent  members to be recommended by us. But our proposal was not  accepted, especially by the PFLP and the DFLP. And the brothers  in the Islamic Jihad requested that Hamas choose five  independents and that it choose the other five, but Hamas  rejected this offer.    As a result, and when we felt that some people wanted to  marginalize Hamas' role, I thought that the movement should  return to the proposal over which it had bargained with (PLO  Chairman) Yasir 'Arafat, namely to demand 40 percent of the  seats in the alliance leadership for it, 40 percent for the  other factions, and 20 percent for the independents.    This is with regard to the central leadership. As for the  alliance's executive committee, we proposed a 15-member  formation in which each faction has one representative, provided  the remaining members are selected by the central leadership.  We also proposed that the chairmanship of the leadership be  assumed by the factions in turn, provided that the deputy  chairman be from among the independents and that an agreement be  reached on who should be the secretary of the leadership.    We were supposed to hold a meeting to discuss these  proposals  but we preferred to postpone it until today in order to give the  other factions a chance to study them.    [Al-Salih] But the other factions -- specifically the DFLP  and the PFLP -- accuse you of evasion because of differences  among your leadership ranks over your position on Israel and  relations with the United States. What is your opinion?    [Mustafa] As I said, the meeting was postponed because we  wanted to give them an opportunity to study the new proposals so  that they will not come as a surprise to them. Because the  meeting would be futile if the aim is just to present proposals.  Second, because the brothers in the leadership were busy and  could not come to Damascus.    [Al-Salih] But do you expect the factions to accept the  40-percent proposal, when they, or some of them, rejected or did  not accept the 30-percent proposal made by you and the Islamic  Jihad?    [Mustafa] We are open-minded and willing to engage in  dialogue and debate. This is our position in order to obtain  our natural rights so that the alliance will go ahead and play  its role.    [Al-Salih] What will the alliance's position be if  tomorrow's meeting fails?    [Mustafa] We would continue the dialogue. But in the end we  would return to our previous situation, that is 10 factions.    [Al-Salih] The PFLP and the DFLP say there are two  tendencies inside Hamas: One represented by Musa Abu-Rizq, head  of the movement's Political Bureau, and calling for  consolidating the alliance with the opposition factions in order  to thwart the Palestinian-Israeli agreement; and another  represented by Ibrahim Ghawshah, the official spokesman, and  banking on dialogue with Israel and improving relations with the  United States. What is your opinion?    [Mustafa] Actually there are no tendencies in Hamas, but,  rather, various views presented to its leading and shura  [consultative] committees in order to adopt the right view after  studying all possibilities. So the minority complies with the  majority's view after being convinced that the latter is right.    As for the talk about a disagreement and the existence of  two  tendencies, it is absolutely groundless. Brothers Ghawshah and  Nazzal respect the opinion of brother Musa Abu-Rizq, who in turn  respects their composure and views.    With regard to the dialogue with Israel, it is rejected  right  from the grass roots to the leadership. As for the dialogue  with the United States, it is not rejected by anyone, so we  cannot say that some people are against or for it.    [Al-Salih] It is also said that there is a tendency  espousing the Iranian position calling for action to topple the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement by any means, and another tendency  which believes that the agreement is going to collapse anyway so  there is no need to embark on any action that is bound to weaken  Hamas' position among the masses.    [Mustafa] Hamas with all its leaders and grass roots is  against the agreement and it is working with all its strength to  topple it. But at the same time we are eager not to reach the  point of Palestinian infighting.    With regard to Iran, we join anyone seeking to confront this  scheme and anyone who is working for the sake of Palestine and  its liberation. We are hostile toward no one, nor do we impose  our views on anyone. Thus the brothers in Iran have requested  nothing of that kind from us. We are eager to maintain balanced  relations with everyone on the Arab and Islamic scenes, and we  refuse to be linked to any quarter.    [Al-Salih] Are there behind-the-scene mediation efforts to  bring your and 'Arafat's views closer, as reported?    [Mustafa] I have no knowledge of such mediations. We are  against 'Arafat's method, including the agreement.    [Al-Salih] What truth is there in reports that meetings were  held between the Israelis and imprisoned Hamas leaders?    [Mustafa] No meetings in the real sense were held. All  that happened is that brother 'Imad al-Faluji (serving a life  sentence), and he is a Hamas leader, was summoned to a dialogue.  The Israelis raised with him the question of suspending military  action. For his part, 'Imad informed them of his inability to  make any decision in this connection. So they offered to  release him in return for discussing this issue with Hamas  leaders outside. But he rejected this proposal, stressing that  these matters do not fall within his powers.    In this connection I would like to stress that the statement  attributed to Hamas and which implies willingness to cease  military attacks in return for [the fulfillment of] some  conditions is untrue and designed to cause confusion on the  Palestinian scene.</p>

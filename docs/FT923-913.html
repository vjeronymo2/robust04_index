			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Trafalgar to appoint two more non-executives TRAFALGAR HOUSE, the property, engineering and construction group, has decided to appoint two more non-executive directors in response to criticism from institutional shareholders. The group yesterday confirmed that the board, which met on Wednesday, had decided to beef up its non-executive directors. While the group has been looking to increase the number of non-executives for some time it is now treating the matter with some urgency in light of shareholder unease with the group's performance. Sir Nigel Broackes, chairman, is understood to have drawn up a list of suitable candidates and hopes to announce the new appointments by the end of the year. The group's three non-executive directors are Mr Tony Ryan, chairman of GPA Group, the aircraft lessor which is trying to raise finance after its flotation was aborted, Mr David Howell, the Conservative MP and Mr Alan Clements a retired senior ICI director who has a string of non-executive directorships. Some of Trafalgar's biggest shareholders have told the group that they expect the new independent non-executives to decide whether the present management is able to halt the slide in the group's share price. In June 1991 the group raised Pounds 310m with a rights issue priced at 190p a share to fund the acquisition of Davy Corporation. Since then the shares have collapsed to a low of 45p. Yesterday they closed 7 1/2 p up at 57 1/2 p. After Trafalgar's board meeting this week directors were adamant that there would be no changes at the top. However, four of the group's 10 biggest shareholders said they believed new non-executives would be in a better position to decide whether or not there should be any managerial changes. One institutional shareholder said: 'Shareholders are not in a position to know who is to blame for what has happened. I hope new non-executive directors will be able to make a judgment about who is to blame and whether there should be any managerial changes.' The message from Trafalgar's directors is that the group is determined to improve its communications with the City and avoid the previous criticisms of its accounting when it announces its full-year results in December. Trafalgar House's accounts have been criticised by shareholders for their liberal use of write-downs, revaluations and reclassification of properties. A Trafalgar executive said: 'We will provide more detail and explanation in our accounts than ever before.'</p>

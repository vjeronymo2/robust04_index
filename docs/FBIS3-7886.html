Based on a typical chauvinistic Serbian logic, a very  known one, without respecting the most natural principles, it  says Albania is deliberately contributing in the rise of the  incidents' number at the Albanian- Yugoslav border, seeking to  make tensions in the relations with Yugoslavia and in order to  find the time for taking Kosova, thus realizing the idea of the  Greater Albania. After detailing the Serbian charges, the  memorandum offers dialogue which is not anything else but a show  for political consumption. The charges are similar with the  dictators' speeches which aim to revive the blind belief of the  people and not the truth.    The so-called "bordering incidents and provocations by the  Albanian side" are known very well inside and outside Albania  through the denunciations made by the Albanian state. According  to the Albanian competent organs and the monitoring missions of  European Union, the main cause of the bordering incidents have  been the firing by the Yugoslav border guards toward the  Albanian citizens which have not been dangerous at all having no  arm with them. The 21 killed and wounded in the Albanian  border, since the beginning of 1993, have been all Albanians and  no one of has been Serbian. Naturally such acts as deliberate  provocations and a part of the Milosevic's tension and war  strategy will bring about unforeseen consequences. The Republic  of Albania has stated more than once that it is not for changing  the borders by force and Albanian bordering organs has been  trying and are trying to respecting and well keeping the  borders. Albania has been always preoccupied to have a quiet  situation at the borders, to cooperate with its neighbours  including the Yugoslav competent organs. Thus the charges made  to Albania are intentional defamations which we reject as false  ones. They do not speak of the Belgrade's preoccupation and a  constructive approach in the relations with Albania but they  seem to be the Serbia propagative campaign before starting the  aggression on its northern borders.    As a democratic state, Albania not only has been openly  declared and in a repeated way, but it is regarded as a  stability and peace factor in the Balkans.    We want to remind to the Belgrade leaders that Albania for  the very reason is for peace and stability and it is interested  and will care for the future of the 2 millions Albanians in  Kosova, who are not a minority as Belgrade considers them but  they are ethnics and they live in their own land. The Albania's  interest for them has legal basis which are sanctioned in the  international charters.    It is not Albania which have caused the tense situation in  Kosova, but it is the Serbian policy, the tanks and the presence  of 50 thousand Serbian police and soldiers, the violence and the  terror created by them, which has caused a tragical situation  where even the children are deprived the right of studying in  their native language.    It seems flagrant to say in that memorandum that the  Albanians have all the rights. This is a grave defamation to  the UN Security Council, the European Parliament, CSCE and the  other international institutions which have ascertained through  their documents the difficult position of the Albanian  population in Kosova.    In its policy on Balkans and in its relations with the far  and close countries, the democratic Albania has had and it has  the purpose to serve the preserving of its state sovereignty and  peace in the region. Albania has never been an alarming object  for the region and Europe. Otherwise the peace-loving forces  would have put sanctions on it and ultimatums as well.    The international community knows very well who are the very  forces seeking to set the Balkans on fire and to endanger the  peace in Europe and broader.    The known Belgrade's policy pursued so far in Kosova toward  the Albanians there who live in their own land and the  defamations and continuing charges to Albania regarding the  openness of its foreign policy and the relations extending with  its friend countries show clearly a pathological and  anti-Albanian approach.    The politicians of the Milosevic's centralised state should  know very well that the road toward the dialogue doesn't depend  on the democratic Albania which has it on the basis of its  social system. You will go to dialogue nor with preliminary  conditions no with psychological pressure.    Once more the Albanian Foreign Ministry rejects the  memorandum recently published by the Federal Ministry of Foreign  Affairs of the Federative Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and  Montenegro). The Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers  the memorandum as another anti-Albanian step, with a provocative  and defamatory character. The Albanian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs makes known that about this it will fully inform the UN  Security Council, the CSCE and the all public opinion.</p>

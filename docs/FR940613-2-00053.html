			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Home Loan Bank advances are an important part of the liability structure of many banks. The question arises: if other debtholders should receive some of the value of a converting institution, why not the relevant Federal Home Loan Bank? We believe there is a good reason for excluding them: the fact that advances are fully secured, making the Banks effectively senior to depositors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although borrowers are technically ``members'' of some mutual savings institutions, we believe most borrowers think of the institution as having a claim on them, rather than the reverse. During that period when they are borrowers, they are in fact already receiving a benefit. Borrowers are typically required to open deposit accounts as well. Finally, borrowers' loans can be, and often are, sold to third parties; distinguishing their rights from those of borrowers whose loans have not been sold would present formidable legal and logistical challenges. For all these reasons, we do not believe the consensus would be to give them a claim, as borrowers, on the value being transferred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We would point out, however, that at least some knowledgeable observers view the rights of depositors to a share of the converting institution's value as not really that much stronger than those of borrowers. The vast majority of both groups do business with mutuals on an arms-length basis, at market terms, at no significant risk, and with no expectation of a windfall. In the view of some observers, it is only the absence of any other ``owners,'' the fact that depositors turn up on the side of the balance sheet where stockholders would be if there were any, and the practice of treating depositors as stand-ins for owners that give depositors the presumption of a right to receive value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rewarding Employees and Managers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is sometimes said that managers_and to a lesser degree employees_of mutual institutions enjoy more job security and a less demanding work environment that their counterparts at organizations subject to stockholder discipline, but are in turn less well compensated. Conversion changes their situation. Some argue that these considerations_and years of loyal service_entitle managers to a share of the value. The opposing view is that managers of mutuals chose to work there and ``bargained for'' whatever pay they got.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We understand both sets of arguments. The no-entitlement view, if we can call it that, has logical purity. The view that managers deserve part of the value has emotional appeal, especially when they have spent decades at the converting institution. The issue of appropriate treatment of long-serving employees is a good example of the essentially political nature of the value-distribution question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 21 May (NOTIMEX) -- The first attempt of  the administration of President Rafael Caldera to privatize  Linea Aeropostal Venezolana (LAV) failed yesterday when four  consortiums rejected the conditions set forth for its sale,  Abdon Vivas Teran has reported.    According to Vivas, president of the Venezuelan Investment  Fund (FIV, the organization in charge of privatizations),  American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Aces of Colombia, and a  local finance company refused to participate in the purchase. In  the opinion of these four companies, the base price of $450  million established for Aeropostal does not reflect the value of  its assets. Vivas explained that although the consortiums  expressed interest, they noted that its overvalue  [sobredimensionamiento], its excessive number of retirees, the  currency devaluation, and social instability are factors that  must be assessed before making the purchase.    Vivas's statements at a news conference following the  opening  of the envelopes containing the consortiums' bids, suggest that  they apparently requested, among other things, a reduction in  the more than 3,000 employees of Aeropostal, the country's third  largest airline. They also asked the government to guarantee  currency stability, a negotiation of the number of retirees, and  the "excessive social benefits" granted to Aeropostal employees.    The FIV minister-president said that the proposals of the  consortiums interested in purchasing Aeropostal will be analyzed  next Monday. He added that the Caldera administration will not  budge in its effort to privatize state companies.    Caldera, who assumed the presidency in February, plans,  within his economic stabilization program, to privatize six  hotels this year and a similar number in 1995, as well as  tourist services, Aeropostal, and electricity companies.  According to FIV estimates, the sale of at least 13 companies,  which should yield $1.8 billion to the state, will start this  year.    The center of the privatization process is the electricity  sector which involves the transfer to private hands of the main  electricity plant and three distribution networks that represent  88 percent of the revenues that the Executive Branch is  expecting to receive. The remaining funds will come from the  sale of the "La Rinconada" Racetrack, a milk factory (Indulac),  Aeropostal (the third largest airline based on operations),  ports, and six hotels rated as five, four, and three stars.    According to FIV figures, 36.3 percent of the revenues will  be used to pay for the costs of the privatization process. The  other 63.7 percent will help ease the serious fiscal deficit of  over $4.5 billion, which represents more than 6 percent of the  $63 billion GNP.    The sale of the stock of the national telephone company  privatized in 1992 that is still in state hands (49 percent) is  scheduled to take place next year and this will produce revenues  of about $7 billion.    The privatization process started in Venezuela in 1989 as  part of a plan to liberalize the economy and it yielded revenues  of $2.6 billion as of 1993. Eighty percent of those revenues  were used to cover the fiscal deficit.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] To avoid genocide in Haiti, it is urgent the United  Nations send the Dominican Republic the list of food products  not included in the embargo. This is the position expressed on 7  June by Dominican Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral.  In his opinion, the complete closing of the border between the  two countries is speeding up an imposed, strategic genocide  within Haitian society.    Cabral also complains that he has not yet received the list  promised about one week ago by Dante Caputo. The deputy foreign  minister also pointed out that he does not know the date on  which to expect the mission of 60 UN observers who have agreed  to help with surveillance of the border area.</p>

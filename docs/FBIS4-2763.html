			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by Lin Ying (2651 7751)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 11 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- In the  past 10 years, investment by foreign businessmen has mainly  concentrated on industries for processing imported materials,  light industry, real estate, restaurants, and the food industry,  in a bid to become profitable quickly. However, investment in  such projects has gradually become saturated, while investment  in many other projects which should be completed sooner is still  lacking. Therefore, the authorities in China have recently  guided foreign investment into infrastructure such as railways,  highways, wharves, power plants, and telecommunications. This  has provided new fields for foreign investment.    According to statistics, the total amount of construction  funds needed in plans for the construction of projects in  transportation and telecommunications on the mainland this year  is over 100 billion yuan. More foreign funds will be used to  make up for any shortage in the enormous amount, in addition to  funds to be jointly raised by the central authorities and  various localities. To attract foreign funds, departments in  various localities have offered preferential terms, such as  long-term cooperation, a guarantee to a 15 to 20 percent profit  rate, and so on.    In transportation construction, agreements already reached  or  being negotiated on Sino-foreign investment cooperation projects  include: The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank will  invest $750 million in the construction of the railway from  Beijing to Kowloon this year; Japan's Overseas Mutual Funds will  also invest $2 billion in a number of railway construction  projects this year; progress has been made in the negotiations  between the two sides on Japan's Mitsui Production Corporation  making an investment of $1.8 billion in the construction of an  expressway from Fuzhou to Xiamen and an agreement is expected to  be signed in the middle of this year; the Hong Kong New China  Hong Kong Group has recently signed a contract with the Sichuan  Expressway Corporation on investing 1.2 billion Hong Kong  dollars in the construction of an expressway from Chengdu to  Mianyang; Chongqing City has recently reached agreements with  some international financial groups and Hong Kong businessmen on  the construction of 11 highway projects involving a total  investment exceeding $1 billion; a financial group formed by a  corporation in a Southeast Asian country and the Hong Kong  Chinese Banking Group will invest $700 million this year as  shares in the construction of an expressway from Nanjing to  Shanghai; the Hong Kong New World Development Corporation will  cooperate with the Guangdong Enterprise this year to invest $1.5  billion in the construction of the section in Guangdong Province  of an expressway from Beijing to Guangzhou; the Hong Kong Chung  Fu Company Limited and the China Fujian group will cooperate  this year and invest $200 million in the construction of an  expressway from Xiamen to Zhangzhou.    In the construction of ports and wharves, agreements being  negotiated or already reached on Sino-foreign cooperation  projects include: The Hong Kong International Container Wharf  Company Limited has planned to invest several billion Hong Kong  dollars this year in the comprehensive development projects of  four ports in Shanghai, Yantian, Zhuhai, and Nanhai; the Hong  Kong Yue King Hing Yip Group has recently signed an agreement on  investing 500 million yuan in the construction of the  first-phase of the Haicang Port project in Xiamen, including a  20,000-ton container wharf and a 30,000-ton goods wharf and  their necessary facilities; the U.S. Mei Wah Group has recently  signed an agreement on investing 250 million yuan in the  development of the Tieshan Port of Beihai City, Guangxi and the  construction of a 50,000-ton wharf together with a warehouse and  facilities. The Hong Kong Hutchison and Whampoa Group has  recently signed another contract with Zhuhai on the construction  of two 20,000-ton wharves. This is another major project  following the cooperation between the two sides in the  construction of the Jiuzhou Port container wharf.    In the field of energy and electricity, Sino-foreign  cooperation springs up everywhere. The Hong Kong Hopewell Group  and the mainland have started the construction of two large  thermal power plants. The Cheung Kong and the Hutchison Whampoa  groups have recently cooperated with Nanhai again in the  construction of a 400 megawatt and a 170 megawatt generating  unit.    In the field of telecommunications, the number of  Sino-foreign cooperation projects is even bigger. On the  mainland, 8 million additional telephone sets were installed  last year and another 12 million additional telephone sets are  planned to be installed this year. With the growing needs of  economic development, the demand for telephones in various  cities on the mainland will increase year after year and the  potential in Sino-foreign cooperation is considerable. Since  the beginning of this year, the Beijing Kaiqi Telecommunications  Corporation has imported from the U.S. Motorola Corporation $125  million's worth of digital telecommunications system equipment  for the mobile telephone network covering the entire Beijing.  Recently, Taiwan's International Standard Electronics Company  Limited and the Fuzhou Postal and Telecommunications  Administrative Bureau have signed a contract on investing $6.5  million in providing hardware and software for  telecommunications systems. Also, Japan's NEC group made a  decision last month on setting up a plant in Wuhan to produce  mobile telephones especially for mainland markets.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Uralaz-Chile enterprise -- 70 percent of its  capital is Russian and 30 percent Chilean -- has become the only  company in the continent authorized to sell MI-17 helicopters,  made in Russia by the Kazan company.    The famous model, which has been produced in various  versions  since 1962 and is used by the thousands throughout the world,  will carry out a series of demonstrations throughout the country  before touring other Latin American countries, according to  Uralaz general manager Anatole Guben Uliantzeff.    Uralaz-Chile has purchased an MI-17, the largest helicopter  operating in Chile, with which it hopes to make many deals.    Guben said: "We set up our enterprise one year ago with 30  percent Chilean capital. Despite the fact that we specialize in  Russian military technology, we started off importing bulldozers  and trucks such as the `Ural' truck, which due to its size can  be used, among other purposes, to carry surveillance radars."    The businessman commented that so far they have been very  successful and hope to be even more so with the MI-17 because it  will meet needs that no other helicopter now used in Chile does.    He noted that one of the MI-17's advantages is its price,  which is no more than $3 million, while a similar helicopter in  the Western Hemisphere costs more than $12 million.    Regarding its safety measures, Gubin said it fulfills all  international safety measures and the company currently is  applying for a permit to fly it in Chile. "For the time being  we have a temporary permit."</p>

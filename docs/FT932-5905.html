			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Observer: Finding out Who's Who Is nothing sacred? When a pillar of the establishment, like Lord Erroll of Hale, attacks Who's Who, the 145-year-old dictionary of people who are thought to matter in Britain, then the prime minister's vision of a classless society may not be as far away as sometimes imagined. Lord Erroll, who was president of the Board of Trade when Harold Macmillan was running the country in the early 1960s, accuses the 2,000 page reference book of being 'too fat and too heavy' and says that he has no idea of how people are selected for inclusion. Hear, hear. In a letter to The Times yesterday, he says that the self-important tome needs stricter editorial control, citing the example of romantic novelist Dame Barbara Cartland who has a 200 line entry all to herself, whilst former US president Ronald Reagan merits just 12 lines. There are plenty of other examples of the quirkiness of a reference book which is regarded by many as the establishment bible. The late Robert Maxwell, for instance, had a 50 line entry whereas Sir Owen Green of BTR has just seven lines. Lord King's entry is more than twice as long as that of his heroine - Lady Thatcher. Lord Erroll (25 lines) is not the first to sound a rebellious note. The Economist, the FT's sister publication, once described Who's Who as Britain's second-most-secret institution noting that its name is not even listed in the telephone directory. Surely, now that Stella Rimington has been named as boss of MI5, the country can be permitted to know who chairs the Who's Who selection board?</p>

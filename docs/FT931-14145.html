			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Arts: Let enthusiasts do their own thing - Television When the Virgin Mary appeared in Medjugorje, in what was Yugoslavia, in 1981, she was in tears. She said that she had come to pray for peace and reconciliation in the world, and one of her repeated messages to the innocent children who could see her was '. . . please stop watching television.' Of course, I learned this important fact from a programme about the Marian phenomenon which I watched . . . on television. I always think of the Virgin Mary as being a bit like Mother Teresa, a practical woman, and her point here was that there are a lot of more useful things to be done in this world than watching television. I expect she was thinking of those statistics that regularly tell us that the average person spends some 36 hours a week watching and listening to the broadcasting media in the UK. I was pleased to be asked to stand in for a week for Chris Dunkley, but I was not quite prepared for the way television eats up time. Television viewing is not something that you can easily plan: life seems to come first. For this column I decided to watch television in the way I normally do, often late at night, after a full day, searching for a little relaxing balm. In fact I ended the week sitting there as though I was determined single handedly to break the national statistics. I even steeled myself to watch the smiling faces of the breakfast programmes. You have to hand it to the presenters of ITV's new 'daybreak magazine' GMTV - they do try to be relentlessly cheerful as they snuggle together on a pink sofa in front of a blazing gas log fire and beam at you. In a week when everything seemed to be falling, from the British monarchy to bombs on Iraq, these presenters were determined to persuade us that the world could still be bright and beautiful and as polished and perfect as a room in a glossy magazine. The do not try to tax us: each item is so short that you do not have to think about anything in depth. Saddam Hussein, John Major, Mr Clinton with his saxophone all become part of the merry show - they flicker and move on. The keep fit spot made me laugh with someone called Linda Lusardi lying on the floor with the Duchess of York's personal trainer - a very solemn American who told her to move her muscles 'bio-mechanically correctly'. Despite this early morning punishment I survived to enjoy several programmes and to ignore a great many more. Television is often too slow and repetitive  -too many rolling titles and theme tunes and too much endless newschat. An atmosphere of permanent inquisition pervades too many of the news programmes. That must be why I like Jeremy Paxman on BBC 2's Newsnight - at least you feel he does not take any politician too seriously. I am waiting for him to stop smirking and burst out laughing one of these days. I just wish he'd buy some better ties. He had his own show last Sunday called Did you see? on BBC 2, when he succinctly put all the nonsensical new sex education programmes into perspective by saying that they were about as exciting as 'dancing the lambada with the Archbishop of Canterbury'. There is a particularly awful one on BBC 1, What shall we tell the children? I began to think the Virgin Mary was right. Children would have learned more about life and love from the best thing I watched in the entire week, which was the launch programme for the new Screen Two on BBC 2. This was a television drama written by Martin Sherman based on 'The Summerhouse Trilogy' novels by Alice Thomas Ellis. I never quite understood the title Clothes in the Wardrobe, but it was the story of a young girl being pushed into an unsuitable marriage by her thoughtless mother and being rescued at the last minute in an outrageous and very funny way by a life enhancing visitor to the London suburb where the story is set  -one Lili, played to the hilt by a magnificent Jeanne Moreau. The cast included Joan Plowright as the elderly mother of the doomed bridegroom and Julie Walters as the bride's mother. It was these three stars playing disillusioned (especially with men) and life weary women in Croydon in the 1950s that made the film so memorable. Jeanne Moreau longing to be farouche in the suburbs must have brought real joie de vivre into every sitting room in the kingdom - she was magnificent and completely overshadowed everything else on television that week. I could not bear a new programme called The Sexual Imperative on Channel 4, which spies on animals during their most private moments. This new sort of voyeurism, apparently masquerading as a serious science programme about mating habits, seemed to be to be completely bogus. Animals should be left alone to be animals. It is not necessary for television to trivialise. I felt that it was at its most successful when it lets enthusiasts, even eccentric ones, convey their passions on the screen. There are two new series that both do this, Dancing and The Name of the Room, both on BBC 2. The first programmes look promising. I expected to enjoy The Name of the Room more than I did, as it deals with architectural matters and the history of the way we use the rooms in our houses. Dan Cruickshank introduced the first one about the bedroom and discussed in detail the changing history of our ideas of privacy. He was good, as was one of the participants, the excellent, re-discovered Professor Lawrence Stone, who tried nobly to explore 'concepts of separation.' The enemy of this series, and I felt the same in the second episode when Gillian Darley struggled to explain the long history of the kitchen, is the director David Turnbull who cannot resist tricky angles, predictable music, old film clips and old advertisements that overwhelm any hope of a clear exposition of an historical thesis. Documentary television programmes often do this. Why do directors not realise that the simpler the programme the more effective it is? From limited experience, I know that making a programme is often a battle with a director who knows little about a subject and does not realise the limitations of the camera. Tricks on television become tiresome. Clarity lasts, and helps documentaries to spread enlightenment - which is surely their point. Dancing managed to use the speedy possibilities of the camera to bring out both the humanity and skill of the dancing participants from all over the world. It was moving to see the late Sir Kenneth MacMillan with the newer young dancers of the Royal Ballet; you felt that although he had died much too suddenly and much too young, he had passed on the flame. The lovely Indian dancer, Malavika Sarukkai, who danced with her eyes as well as her body, explained the origins of Indian classical dancing in a way that made it all so sound completely simple and logical while being completely different from the Western tradition. There was a memorable scene of an Indian wedding procession dancing happily along the Edwardian back streets of Birmingham; any incongruity was banished by the relaxed joy of the participants. This new series promises to be both thoughtful and vibrant. Programmes like Dancing are an antidote to the very high level of gloom, gore and ghastliness that makes up so much of television's weekly output. I was depressed more than a little by the appetite for tragedy of the programme makers as well as the doom laden air of every newscast. Take the terrifying Casualty series on BBC 1. It makes life at a National Health Hospital look more fearful and daily closer to death than any of the Jacobean revenge tragedies. The prevailing tendency to portray grief and misery in large doses as part of the daily diet was almost too much for this soft hearted novice TV reviewer. I felt, at the end of the week, that I was at one with Jeanne Moreau's memorable view: 'Life is too bloody awful without being unhappy.'</p>

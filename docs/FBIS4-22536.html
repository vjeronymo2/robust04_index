			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Georgian Academy of Sciences Vice President </F> Iver Prangishvili by Tamaz Ebanoidze: "It Seems an Academician's  Lot Is Not Easy...": place and date not given]    [Text] That day, they made SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA's  special correspondent "cool his heels" before meeting with  Batoni Iver. But don't think I'm complaining: I realize the Vice  President of the Georgian Academy of Sciences is extremely busy,  he's only in Tbilisi for a month and there are all kinds of  people waiting to see him. Anyway, I did not sit idle while  waiting: the Vice President's assistant made me a copy of the  main points of the paper which Iver Prangishvili had given that  day before a meeting of the Presidium of the Georgian Academy of  Sciences--"A Conception-Program to `Save' the Republic of  Georgia." I read it eagerly.    Iver Prangishvili is the director of the Russian Academy of  Sciences Institute of Problems of Control, the chief designer of  AES [nuclear power plant] automation systems for Russia  (formerly the Soviet Union and, in fact, the CEMA [Council for  Economic Mutual Aid] countries), a professor and department head  in Moscow's Physics Engineering Institute, the President of the  Society of Georgians Living in Russia, the President of the  Georgian Engineering Academy, the Honorary President of the  Georgian Reformers Union, and a member of numerous international  academies and associations.    I will try to give SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA's vast readership  a  closer acquaintance with Batoni Iver and show the man and  personality behind the resume. I confess I got this vital  information from the people closest to him (his wife, his  assistant and coworkers).    Academician Iver Prangishvili is 63 years old, married to  Tsiala Gugunishvili (an energy engineer); his son Archil is a  doctor of technical sciences (incidentally, this young man was  recently handed his doctor's degree--the first ever Georgian  one--by Head of State Shevardnadze himself); and, so far, one  grandson, a year old, who bears the same name, bless his heart.    "He is kind and good-hearted, always trying to make you feel  good; he never acts superior. When we are in Moscow, he's at the  Institute from 9 in the morning until 10 at night, and after he  comes home he works until nearly three o'clock in the morning.  Even on weekends he doesn't stop for a minute [as we can see, an  academician's lot is not easy--T.E.]; he loves to read fiction,  he's musical--he loves Chopin and Schubert. He's a loving  grandfather, and everybody loves him" (his wife).    "He is kind and good-natured, he has a rare gift for  sympathy, and he knows art very well. Every time he goes to  Moscow he leaves me a thank-you card for our work together" (his  assistant).    "He is energetic and industrious and thinks on a vast scale.  In Moscow, even on the highest echelons, he is able to use his  fame and authority to help Georgians of various ranks working in  science, economics, or politics, who come to Moscow. It's  amazing how many kinds of `Georgian' concerns he can deal with  during a two-week sojourn in Moscow. He is very humble, and not  just for show" (close associates).    When it comes to humility and simplicity, I would like to  say  that several times I had to push him a little--surely forgivable  in a journalist--to get him to talk about himself.    [Ebanoidze] Batono Iver, you gave a paper today to the  Presidium of the Academy of Sciences, the significance of which  is clear from the title--"A Conception-Program to `Save' the  Economy of the Republic of Georgia." I've looked at its main  points. We keep hearing the word "save" these days, and we have  all kinds of saviors. How do you envision the country's  salvation?    [Prangishvili] The Conception-Program to "save" the people  from hunger and cold and stabilize the economy was prepared late  last summer by an initiative group from the Georgian Academy of  Sciences, the Georgian Engineering Academy, and the Reformers  Union. It was submitted in September to the Head of State, who  made use of several of the main points in a speech to Parliament.    The Conception-Program discusses problems that need to be  solved immediately. These include basic supplies of essential  resources, in particular food, fuel, and energy for the  population and the economy. It presents proposals for urgent  measures in the most basic sectors--industry, agroindustry, fuel  and energy, and transportation.    In order to realize practical implementation of the economic  reforms called for in the Conception-Program, the following  conditions are necessary:    1. Put a stop to the tense crime situation and mafia  organizations by instituting a state of emergency (mafiosi, also  criminal organizations and individuals, do not like reforms and  discipline);    2. Rather than a parliamentary republic, we need a republic  with a strong head of state or president.    3. Institute strong discipline to rally the people and  restore trust in the government (if the leaders can overcome the  grave crime situation and correct it in short order, they will  regain the people's trust);    4. Get rid of hyperinflation in the very first stage of  reforms; we know that reforms are impossible in a time of  hyperinflation. In general, it is most expedient to carry out  reforms in sequence--first economic reforms (food!), then  spiritual (freedom of speech and information), and finally  political (parliament, a multi-party system, broad democracy).    In continuing the transition period, we need to reject the  "shock therapy" model which calls for a swift transition to the  market economy. It is too painful and will only work with  massive foreign investment. For the transition period we need to  create a mixed, multi-sector model which will ensure a  relatively mild, gradual, and painless transition to the market  economy.    In announcing a modified transition period, we have to form  three provisional sectors of the economy.    The purpose of the first sector, the one that "saves," is to  create the minimum amount of goods necessary for the estimated  5.5-million population's needs (1,500 kilocalories per capita).  These goods need to be produced and distributed on a ration card  basis, with strict state control, so that everyone gets his  share of bread, milk, cheese, and other products providing a  total of 1,500 kilocalories (below that amount, irreversible  physiological impairment from hunger sets in).    The "save" sector must produce the essential foodstuffs  providing the necessary calories (5.5 million times 1,500) at  prices affordable to pensioners, and also meet people's  transportation, fuel, and other minimal consumer needs. During  the first stage, this sector must turn out 50 percent of total  goods output.    The second sector should be the regulated market sector. Out  of 300 to 400 product items, the state regulates the prices of  19 or 20 of the basic prime necessities, not by directive but by  economic methods (favorable credits, tax breaks, and so on).  During the first stage this sector will produce about 25 percent  of total production output.    The third sector will be the free market sector; its role,  importance, and share will gradually increase along with  economic reforms. Prices in it are free, regulated by supply and  demand, without state intervention. In the first period, the  free market's share of the economy will be set at 20 to 25  percent. This is the most efficient sector, because it makes  maximum use of people's personal initiative and interest.    Alongside these three basic sectors there is also the  "shadow" economy, which, in terms of its nature and effect, is  quite different from shadow economies abroad. In other  countries, the shadow economy is chiefly mixed up with  narcotics, pornography, fraud, and tax evasion; in our country,  the shadow economy chiefly involves the theft and sale of state  and public property and mass speculation in gasoline, bread,  flour, and other goods.    The transition period covers three to six years; at the end,  we will convert to the market economy and the state "salvation"  sector will no longer be necessary.    [Ebanoidze] Specific points in your paper deal with the  vital  importance of the fuel and energy, agroindustrial, and  communications complexes.    [Prangishvili] Let's start with fuel and energy. The only  way  to "salvation" here is to institute a state of emergency in  power consumption. We have worked out a three-stage  conception-program of energy development. The first stage runs  through 1995, the second runs through the year 2000, and the  third runs through 2005. We have worked out a mathematical model  and run a computer simulation to find a scientifically  substantiated optimal variant of energy development.    During the first stage (1994-1995), an additional 6 billion  kwh of electricity must be generated, for which, in particular,  a tenth and eleventh power unit will have to go on line in the  Tbilisi GRES [state regional power plant], and existing GESes  [hydropower plants] will have to be renovated to boost their  generating capacity and reduce losses. During the second stage  (1995-2000), we will need an additional 6 billion kwh, for which  a base-load 600-megawatt TES [thermal power plant] will have to  be built near Kutaisi and which will run on local Tkibuli coal.  A number of small and medium-sized GESes will have to be built.    For the agroindustrial complex, the Conception-Program  provides a balance of minimally essential supply and demand of  basic food items for the current year. The grain requirement  this year in terms of physiological norms equals 2 million  tonnes. Of this amount, the republic can produce 0.6 million  tonnes; hence, we will have to buy 1.4 million tonnes abroad. We  have calculated the necessary amounts of meat and meat products,  milk and dairy products, sugar, potatoes, and vegetable oil and  the amounts of money involved.    In order to alleviate the meat problem, the program  recommends enlisting U.S. aid to build 40 modern hog farms in  Georgia with the capacity to produce 100 million tonnes of meat  annually. Plans call for keeping half the meat, the bones, and  all of the hides in the republic; the United States will take  the other half of the meat and sell it in third countries to pay  the costs. The program proposes that orchard and garden products  be used to meet the needs of Tbilisi and Rustavi.    Let's see what innovations there are in the communications  complex. Let me say generally that Georgia's communications  network will be changed totally; Georgia is going to have a  modern communications system.    One innovation will be a 2000-number cellular radio  communications network. The project will be done by a U.S. firm;  it will be implemented in May of this year, using World Bank  credits.    With the help of the Siemens Company, a new 200,000-number  digital telephone exchange will be built in Tbilisi to replace  the old 100,000-number exchange, half of which no longer work  anyway.    Also to be built in Tbilisi is a joint Georgian-Turkish  optical cable plant. Some of the product will remain in Georgia,  while the rest will be sold abroad.    A new local and long-distance digital telephone exchange  will  be built in Kutaisi and Batumi, accommodating 30,000 numbers.    Austria's Teletra Company is going to build two stations for  modern satellite communications. There are other innovations as  well.    [Ebanoidze] The "salvation" program calls for using the  results of scientific-technical research done in Georgia and the  adoption of new, modern technologies.    [Prangishvili] Clearly, rapid adoption of  scientific-technical advances will play a big role in saving the  republic's economy. Therefore, the new technologies, methods,  and advances developed by our scientists are broadly recommended  for a variety of economic sectors. The list of items I will tell  you about now is really impressive:    The adoption of new, energy-saving technologies; the  production and use of new medical treatments; the use of  non-toxic biostimulants to boost grain yields; the establishment  of bamboo plantations and the adoption of a new technology to  make our own paper from it; the production of new medicines,  vitamins, and extracts using local raw materials; the  preparation of a liquid suspension (mixture) of coal for  efficient use; and others.    Let us focus in more detail on a few items.    In the sphere of energy-saving technologies, the  pulse-delivery principle in electrical and gas installations  (instead of constant delivery) yields a 30-percent savings. We  can use it in kitchen ranges, electric and gas stoves, and  boiler facilities to excellent economic and ecological effect.  This new principle is already being adopted in the republic's  enterprises. We have also received orders from other countries.    The non-toxic biostimulants which our researchers have  developed make it possible to double yields of corn, wheat, soy,  beans, sugar beets, onions, coriander, and other vegetables  using practically no fertilizer, thus producing ecologically  clean, toxic-free products. Large-scale (100-hectare)  experiments in Lanchkhuti Rayon have been very encouraging and  ought to be extended to other territories.    A third example--producing a coal suspension to use for  fuel--reduces coal consumption by several dozen percent and  enhances the ecology (pulverized coal mixed with water is used  as fuel). [end of Prangishvili's answer]    The Institute of Problems of Control in the Russian Academy  of Sciences is a world class research center. Iver Prangishvili  has been connected with it for many years: he was the head of a  laboratory from 1964, deputy director for science from 1970, and  he was elected director in 1986. Let's look at that word  "elected": if a 2,000-man collective in Moscow prefers a  Georgian over two Russians to serve as their leader, you have to  think that this man must greatly surpass them in terms of  personality and business qualities. Iver Prangishvili is now in  his ninth year as Institute director; among his numerous duties  is that of carrying out vital missions for that vast country:  for example, working out a conception for managing the overall  development and improvement of Russia's economy, dealing with  problems of reform and administration in Russia, and drawing up  appropriate recommendations.    Since it was established, the Institute has turned out over  100 qualified Georgian specialists, including two other  academicians--Vakhtang Chichinadze and Mindia Salukvadze. Iver  Prangishvili has supervised the training of over 50 candidates  and doctors. Of the Georgians working with him now, doctors of  science Avtandil Anuashvili, Vladimer Zhorzhikashvili, and  Aleksandre Shubladze are heads of laboratories; five are senior  science associates, one is a doctoral candidate, and several are  graduate students.    [Ebanoidze] Batono Iver, as you know, we Georgians often  lose  our sense of moderation--with all our numerous political  parties, universities, commercial schools, newspapers, generals,  banks, and travel agencies in one little country.... Now  consider all the academies: the Academy of Sciences, the Academy  of Agricultural Sciences, the Academy of Engineering (not to  mention colleges such as the Academy of Painting), the Military  Academy.... I've heard, as well, that a Medical Academy and an  Academy of the Humanities are looming on the horizon.... And  later, maybe, an Academy of Literature and Academy of Art....  Right now, though, will you tell us about the Academy of  Engineering, which you are the President of. Does it justify its  existence?    [Prangishvili] I envisioned the Academy of Engineering as a  bridge between fundamental science and production. To put it  figuratively, fundamental science ends with formulas, new  principles and methods, which then need to be calculated,  developed, designed, and put into production. The Academy of  Engineering includes several engineering centers which foster  the revival of production and the development and adoption of  new technologies. From this standpoint, the Academy of  Engineering is already playing a positive role.    [Ebanoidze] Now, as the President of the Society of  Georgians  Living in Russia, would you please tell us what it does.    [Prangishvili] The Society has 95,000 members. Its purpose  is  to help Georgia and the Georgian people. We try to make Russia  better acquainted with Georgian culture, Georgian traditions,  our various accomplishments. The Society and its members put on  benefit concerts and other cultural and educational events. The  Society's financial base comes from members' contributions. We  have helped around 10,000 Georgian refugees in Russia with  lodging, jobs, travel back and forth, costing 50 million rubles.  We have spent millions of rubles to make and distribute Georgian  musical records. Our funds were also used to publish two or  three editions of the newspaper DEMOKRATICHESKAYA ABKHAZIYA in  Moscow, to provide the Russian people with correct information  about what was going on in Abkhazia. We have organized and  financed several television broadcasts about events in Georgia.  I should tell you that our budget is over 100 million rubles.    [Ebanoidze] Batono Iver, could you tell us a little about  your own personal scientific interests, perhaps singling out  some of your more significant recent works?    [Prangishvili] Generally, I'm working on problems of control  [words illegible]. They include scientifically substantiated  control of enterprises, organizations, and sectors, the control  and optimization of technological processes of complex systems  and facilities.    Recently, my colleague Doctor of Sciences Avtandil  Anuashvili  and I discovered a new principle of visibility, and on its basis  we developed the world's first computer system to visualize  "invisible" phenomena and objects. Our discovery makes it  possible to see objects and phenomena which radio and optical  locators can't pick up and the human eye can't usually see (for  example, the ultraspectrum and the infraspectrum). We have  developed a system and device--sensory transformers which, if  the human eye is equipped with such electronic-optical sensors,  it can see objects and phenomena that are invisible today and,  if it exists, "parallel life" as well. There are some other  really nice and interesting things, but we can talk about them  another time. [end of Prangishvili answer]    My last meeting with the Vice President was on 21 January.  The next day he headed for Moscow, and from there, on 24  January, to Tashkent. On 25-26 January, the capital of  Uzbekistan was hosting a conference of members of the  International Congress of Industrialists and Businessmen,  participated in by a Georgian delegation headed by Iver  Prangishvili. The conference discussed measures to quickly  restore economic ties among enterprises of the former republics  of the USSR and establish new, mutually beneficial relations.    Just before Batoni Iver was to fly to Moscow again, I wished  him continued fruitful activities "outside of Georgia"--fruitful  for Georgia and in general.</p>

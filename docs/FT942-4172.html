			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Yemen ceasefire dispute Yemen's rival armies made a fresh ceasefire attempt yesterday but southern leaders accused northern forces of breaking their own self-declared truce within hours of its taking effect, Reuter reports from Aden. After a day of northern artillery fire on the southern stronghold of Aden, Sanaa television reported northern President Ali Abdullah Saleh had ordered his forces to observe a ceasefire from 6 pm yesterday. Southern Yemen, which broke away from a four-year union with the north on May 21, agreed to the truce but later said Mr Saleh's troops had launched a surprise attack including heavy artillery bombardments of its forces.</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Survey of International Capital Markets (7): The rest of the year will be tougher - Prospects for attracting international equity investors are deteriorating COMPANIES HAVE raised a record amount of money through international equity offerings in the first six months of this year, helped by the buoyant underlying tone of the world stock markets. However, investment bankers are doubtful about the ability of companies to coax as much money from international equity investors in the second half of this year, given the recent fall in world stock markets. Already, several equity offerings have been cancelled or postponed as companies await an improvement in market conditions. Companies raised a total of Dollars 12.9bn from the international equity markets in the first half of 1992, using an array of initial public offerings, primary and secondary issues. This compares with Dollars 8.98bn in the first half of 1991, Dollars 7.4bn in the second half, according to data supplied by International Financing Review. The success of these international offerings - which have ranged from US companies seeking to reduce their debt/equity (or gearing) ratios to formerly state-owned Latin American enterprises making their debut in the international capital markets - is attributable partly to the strong underlying tone seen in many of the world stock markets at the beginning of the year. In terms of geographical breakdown, international investors have three main areas from which to choose: the US, Europe and the emerging markets, of which the Latin American countries have proved the most popular in the last year. US companies have been a prolific source of new issues in the last six months, as corporate America has been keen to reduce high gearing levels and pay back some debt. Altogether, US companies raised Dollars 5.08bn - or roughly the same as in the whole of 1991 - of which Dollars 1.18bn came from initial public offerings, Dollars 2.73bn from primary issues and the remainder from secondary issues. Nearly half of the total was raised by a single company - General Motors - which drew Dollars 2.14bn from investors in May in the biggest ever stock offering by a US company. Western Europe has also provided investors with a steady stream of issues, raising Dollars 2.19bn altogether. Provided the market conditions are favourable, Europe could prove the source of several international equity offerings in the remainder of this year, particularly as countries such as France and Sweden have embarked on extensive privatisation programmes. Following the successful partial privatisation of Total, the French oil group, last month (when the state sold a 19 per cent stake for FFr9.5bn), the government is expected to push ahead with the sale of shares in the state-controlled insurance companies. Meanwhile, in Sweden the centre-right government has already started its disposal of state-controlled assets with the SKr1.85bn sale of shares in SSAB, the steel group. However, this issue is small fry compared with the estimated SKr18bn which the sale of the state's stake in Procordia, the food and pharmaceuticals group, is expected to raise this autumn. The area which is becoming increasingly significant is that of the emerging markets. The last 12-18 months has seen a regular flow of issues from Latin American countries, particularly Mexico, which has become such a familiar feature on the international equities landscape that some overseas investors now regard it as an 'emerged' rather than an emerging market. Several partial privatisations and initial public offerings in Mexico have attracted a strong response from international (particularly US) investors. Altogether, Latin American companies raised Dollars 4.2bn in new issues, with Mexico accounting for Dollars 2.76bn of the total. This compares with Dollars 2.05bn raised by Mexican companies in the first half of 1991, when Mexico was the only Latin American country to use the international equity markets. As some of these markets become more mature, investors seek ever newer and more exotic emerging markets in the hope of reaping ever-larger rewards. The most recent novelties have included China (where opportunities for foreign investors remain very limited with only a dozen or so listed companies offering shares in which foreigners may invest) and India (where the government has removed restrictions on Indian companies tapping the international capital markets). 'If you go back to the early 1980s, people used to giggle if you mentioned investing in Spain and Italy - now those are acceptable markets,' says Mr Daniel Smaller, executive director of the emerging markets group at Lehman Brothers International where research is focusing on some of the newer, less developed markets. Despite the upbeat start to 1992, few investment bankers are prepared to bet on a similarly successful second half. The recent bout of bearishness in some of the equity markets has hit a handful of new issues already. GPA, the aircraft leasing group, had to cancel its Dollars 800m global flotation last month due to lack of investor interest, while in the US, Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, the soft drink manufacturer, cancelled its Dollars 600m public offering earlier this month because of unfavourable market conditions. Several US flotations have run into problems at the last minute because of weakness in the market. While 1992 has witnessed a bumper first half for international equity offerings, the prospects for the second half remain rather uncertain.</p>

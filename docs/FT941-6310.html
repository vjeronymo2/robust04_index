			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wainhomes to raise Pounds 32m from placing Wainhomes, the Chester-based housebuilder, plans to raise Pounds 32m from a placing and offer for sale valuing the company at about Pounds 100m. The company is the latest in a series of housebuilders to announce plans to come to the market. Redrow, one of the UK's largest private housebuilders, is expected to announce proposals to float the company today . Beazer Homes - the country's fourth largest housebuilder, presently owned by Hanson - last week published its pathfinder prospectus for an issue expected to raise Pounds 450m. Details of the Wainhomes issue, but not the price, were contained in a pathfinder prospectus published yesterday. Until recently Wainhomes only built homes mainly in north-west England. The company will use the proceeds to repay borrowings - currently Pounds 17m  -and to buy land to take advantage of the recovery in the housing market in the UK. Directors and their families now own 65 per cent of the shares. They will have their stake reduced to just under 50 per cent following the issue. The company is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.1m for the year to March 31. This compares with profits of Pounds 5.3m in the previous year and a peak of Pounds 8.6m in the 12 months to March 31 1990. Mr Ron Smith, chief executive, said the company had been remarkably resilient during recession. Operating margins had remained above 10 per cent, having reached a peak of 18 per cent in 1990. The company now has operations in Yorkshire, Hampshire, Dorset and the south-east Midlands. It expects to have sold about 950 homes by the end of March. This is expected to rise to between 1,200 and 1,500 next year, and then to 1,800. The cash raised by the issue will help the group increase the number of plots with planning permission it owns from 3,000 to 4,000.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Building societies given chance to widen services: Boards to be more accountable to members Building societies will be able to offer a wider range of services but will also have to be more accountable to their members, under government plans released yesterday. Setting out the plans, which affect business loans and societies' ownership of insurance companies, Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, made it clear that the government did not intend to relax the stringent statutory controls which have made societies so difficult for other institutions to take over. 'We don't want to be spoil-sports but I don't want a duckshoot of the building societies,' he said. He added, however, that he wanted to see the benefits of mutual ownership being passed more directly to society members, perhaps through dividends. A second stage to the Treasury's review of societies' legislation will examine how to promote change in the sector, whether societies' powers could be more systematically streamlined, and how society directors could be more effectively held to account by members. Yesterday's announcement includes a requirement for societies' boards to inform their members at the next general meeting of any non-confidential takeover offers from organisations other than societies. This falls short of the call from some senior bankers for an end to the power of boards to block an offer from another institution by refusing to put it to society members for a decision. The government's plans will also allow societies to broaden the range of business lending they can carry out by enabling them to set up subsidiaries to make loans which are not secured on land. Putting this in the context of the Treasury's separate inquiry into the funding of industry, Mr Nelson said this would provide a welcome new source of funds for business. It would also, he added, 'introduce a new element of competition into an area traditionally dominated by a small number of high street banks'. Societies will be able to wholly own general insurance companies offering a limited range of cover related to housing - buildings and contents insurance and mortgage payment protection. At present, there is a limit of 15 per cent on a society's stake in a general insurance company. As widely expected, the ceiling on the proportion of funds that societies can raise on the wholesale money markets is to rise, from 40 per cent to 50 per cent. The initiatives, which will begin to come into effect over the coming months, mark the end of the first stage of the Treasury review. In the second stage, a consultation paper will be published, probably in September. The exercise is intended to be completed by the end of this year. Alongside the emphasis on accountability, which could lead to reserving some board places for members' representatives, it will also look at specific changes to the legislation, including the pay-outs that can be made to members of societies which come together in a traditional merger.</p>

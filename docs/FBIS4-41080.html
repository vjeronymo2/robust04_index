			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vitaliy Denisov under the "KRASNAYA ZVEZDA and </F> News Agency Correspondents Report" rubric: "Will `Blue Helmets'  Suit the National Guard?"]    [Text] Tbilisi -- "All states belonging to the CIS must  have peacemaking battalions, since we cannot rely on Russia all  the time," Georgian parliamentary deputy Tengiz Kitovani  believes.    He has advocated the creation of the republic's own  peacemaking units, so as to have the possibility of  participating in the settlement of conflicts in neighboring  regions. He proposes to form battalions of "blue helmets" on  the basis of the National Guard and the recently disbanded  military police. At the same time Kitovani ignored the question  of where it is proposed to find the funds to maintain them.</p>

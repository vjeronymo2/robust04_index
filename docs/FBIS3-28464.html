The White House officially confirmed Friday that it has  received Kim's message through American envangelist Billy  Graham, who visited Pyongyang last week.    White House Spokesperson Dee Dee Myers declined to disclose  the content of the message. She said she simply did not know  anything about the message delivered to anthony lake, national  security adviser to Clinton.    Many diplomatic sources are said to believe that Kim's  message could very well contain his "general wish" to see an  improvement in bilateral relations between Washington and  Pyongyang, rather than any concrete proposal on resolving the  North Korean nuclear problem.    Nevertheless, a feeling of vague expectation was rising that  a dramatic breakthrough may come in the stalled negotiations on  the North Korean nuclear issue between Pyongyang and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    Regardless of Kim Il-song's message, both hawks and doves in  the Clinton administration and politics are proceeding with  their respective preparations for measures on the North Korean  nuclear question.    On the day the Kim message was delivered, for instance, the  U.S. representative to the United Nations briefed the five  permanent members of the security council about the latest on  the North Korean issue.    The briefing was apparently aimed at preparing the security  council for possible reference of the North Korean question in  case Pyongyang and the IAEA fail to reach agreement on  inspection of North Korean facilities.    Billy Graham met with Kim Il-song and conveyed a brief and  general message from clinton that the United States hoped there  would be progress in the nuclear talks, sources said.    In response to this verbal message, Kim Il-song took the  unprecedented step of replying to the U.S. President and Graham,  who had volunteered to act as a messenger, apparently sensed the  importance of the situation and dispatched an aide to Washington  ahead of him carrying Kim's message.    The message was deivered to the White House on Friday  morning  and as of Friday afternoon, the U.S. State Department had not  relayed its content to the South Korean side.    Many diplomatic sources say that if North Korea was to make  a  proposal accepting comprehensive IAEA inspections of all its  nuclear facilities, it would do so through diplomatic channels.  Therefore, they speculate, the chances are slim that Kim's  message contained important and specific proposals on the  nuclear problem.    Rather, Kim Il-song would probably have reiterated North  Korea's position that it has neither the intention nor the  ability to develop nuclear weapons, and instead spelled out ways  to improve U.S.-North Korea relations, sources believe.    It goes without saying, the sources say, that Kim's message  would not have contained the kind of "hardline tone" as an  earlier statement by the North Korean Foreign Ministry that  called for either "dialogue or war." After all, they say, it was  a message from the president of one country to another.    In any event, the North Korean nuclear issue has reached a  crossroad from where it can proceed either to resolution or U.N.  sanctions.    If North Korea and the IAEA fail to reach agreement on  inspections by Feb. 21, when the IAEA convenes a meeting of its  board of directors in Vienna, the United States will have no  choice but to take the issue to the Security Council. Friday's  U.S. briefing of the five permanent Security Council members  was seen as an expression of the United States' determination to  resolve the nuclear issue. At the same time, the United States  apparently wanted to convey "the hardline current" of the  international community on the matter to China, Pyongyang's only  remaining ally, which has been opposing U.N. economic sanctions  against North Korea. But North Korea is well aware that it  faces further isolation from the international community if it  fails to reach some kind of compromise with the IAEA.    South Korea and the United States, for their part, also  realize that there is a limit to the effectiveness of U.N.  economic sanctions against North Korea. As a result, the  United States and North Korea will do their utmost to avoid  confrontation and reach a compromise.    In other words, North Korea is likely to make another  proposal before Feb. 21 so that its negotiations with the IAEA  are not broken off completely. Or, the United States and North  Korea may resume contacts in an effort to keep their dialogue  going.    From this point of view, Kim Il-song's message could be part  of the process.</p>

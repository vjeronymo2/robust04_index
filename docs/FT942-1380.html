			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Arts: Gleam of gold from the tombs of the Greeks - Gerald Cadogan admires jewellery at the British Museum For the next four months London offers an alternative gold show to the chunky, self-important British Crown Jewels. The pieces in Greek Gold: Jewellery of the Classical World at the British Museum are light, charming and intricate. And, unlike the symbols of state the Tower of London guards, these gorgeous diadems, earrings, necklaces, pendants and wreaths have a human scale and constantly allude to Aphrodite, golden goddess of love. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the State Hermitage in St Petersburg and the BM have combined the best pieces of their permanent collections to create a feast of Greek jewellery of 500 to 300 BC. They are micro-masterpieces of gold, mostly from the fringes of the Greek world. The special treat is the Hermitage collection of treasures from tombs in Greek cities in the Crimea and the north coast of the Black Sea which otherwise we must go to Russia to see. The exhibition gives a new view of the Greeks, taking one away from Athens and the familiar restrained emotion of classic Athenian art. Perhaps the Athenians had jewellery like this. If they did, we know little about it, apart from some in the exhibition from a tomb that Lord Elgin (of the marbles) had dug in Peiraeus. But on the whole the Athenians tried to stop people being buried with luxurious grave goods. That was not the attitude of the still developing societies at the edges of the Greek world, a diaspora that stretched from Spain to the Black Sea. Most of the pieces (which were generally acquired a long time ago) are from tombs. In the fringe regions women - and men - clearly believed that they could take all it with them and their power and prestige would last for ever. The Athenians would probably have said that this was a shocking abuse of capital which should be recycled to the children. But conspicuous consumption in burial by an emerging society was a custom that had begun a millennium before with the gold found by Heinrich Schliemann in the royal graves at Mycenae (now a glory of the National Museum in Athens). The Hermitage jewellery comes from the rich Greek cities of the Crimea and the Cimmerian Bosporus, where the Greeks faced the Scythians as friends or foes. Colossal wealth went with the dead, whether they were true Hellenes or natives adopting Hellenic culture. One man took his weapons and 13 horses with their bronze trappings with him. He also had silver and bronze vessels, two gold necklaces and gold costume jewellery - bull's and ram's heads, sphinxes and lions - for sewing on to his clothes or his shroud. He shone with gold. The woman in another tomb had two large pendants, probably worn on her clothes over her breasts. They are discs with the head of Athena Parthenos as designed by the sculptor Pheidias for her great temple on the acropolis of Athens, the Parthenon. An elaborate ivy-leaf border with green enamel filling and hanging wire scrolls and drops add to the luxury. The ivy was the plant of Dionysos. Oak leaves point to Zeus. One wreath from a tomb in the Dardanelles has two cicadas among the leaves, and a bee to hide the joint where the wires which hold the leaves meet. But most allusions are to Aphrodite and the power of sex - not with the explicit scenes on Greek vases, but with a sophisticated delicacy matching the finesse of the craft - which tickles our imagination, just as it must have tickled theirs all those years ago. Two earrings from Macedonia have the eagle carrying off the beautiful young Ganymede. The heads of bird and boy are so close that they are almost kissing, the claw of one bird resting lightly on Ganymede's hip. In classical times, in central Greece men might wear a ring, and a wreath as a badge of office. But in the east Aegean they wore more, following the habit of their non-Greek neighbours; and on the Black Sea they wore more still. The exhibition fills out the picture of what it was like to be Greek - beyond the images of Athenians erecting temples and Socrates asking questions. Many Greeks clearly loved to dress up. Yet these jewels do not contradict the famous Greek maxim, 'Nothing to excess', because they are almost all miniatures. They show how the top half of society could live, but they are not at all vulgar. The techniques are a revelation, using sheet metal, thin wire and tiny bobbles (granulation). Look closely to see how the craftsmen made straps by knitting many strands of wire, and hung pendants of fruit or faces from the necklaces. Enamel inlays added colour, as in a pair of loop earrings with pendants of women's heads which show - in miniature - what they wore. In the hair is a high diadem like a tiara with relief palmettes and lotus flowers. Rosette shaped earrings are in the ears, the petals picked out in enamel. And around the neck is a choker of a double strand of gold beads with a pendant in the shape of a bull's head. If you enjoy the show, the next stop should be the Thessaloniki Museum in northern Greece where the jewels from the royal graves of the kings of Macedonia found over the last 20 years are a yet more stunning display. They may be crown jewels, but they show the same traits as the jewels in this gem of a show at the BM. Cartier has linked itself to these masterpieces of ancient craft and sponsored the show, winning a further Pounds 25,000 for it from the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme. The uncrowded display of the gold on purple cloth would grace any expensive jeweller's. The catalogue by Dyfri Williams and Jack Ogden is as superb as the jewels themselves. Greek Gold: Jewellery of the Classical World at the BM until October 23; Metropolitan Museum from December 1 - March 23, 1995; the Hermitage, May to August 1995. Catalogue: Pounds 16.95 paperback (Pounds 14.95 during the exhibition) and Pounds 25.00 hardback.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange believes that permitting specialists in PDRs and investment trust securities to participate in the AHT facility in order to ``clean-up'' order imbalances and effect closing price coupled orders would benefit investors by providing additional liquidity to the listed cash market for derivative securities based upon well known market indexes, such as those described above. The market price of these securities is based upon transactions largely effected in markets other than the Amex. The specialist in such securities has no unique access to market sensitive information regarding the market for the underlying securities or closing index values. The Exchange, therefore, believes that specialist participation in the AHT facility in PDRs and investment trust securities in the manner described above does not raise any market integrity issues. In addition, should a customer not care for an execution at the closing price, the rules of the Exchange's AHT facility permit cancellation of an order up to the close of the AHT session at 5:00 p.m. (orders in the AHT facility are not executed until the 5:00 p.m. close of the after-hours session.) A customer, therefore, will have approximately 40 minutes to determine if an execution at the closing price suits its needs, and may cancel its order if it believes that the closing price does not suit its objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange also proposes to eliminate the migration of limit orders for PDRs and investment trust securities from the specialist's limit order book to the AHT facility to eliminate any concern with the handling of such orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange proposes that the Commission approve the Exchange's application to permit specialist participation in the AHT facility for PDRs and investment trust securities on a pilot basis, during which time the Exchange will study the operation of the facility to determine if there are any additional issues that need to be addressed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote just and equitable principles of trade, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

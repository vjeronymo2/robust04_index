			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE LAST day of an otherwise busy week in the derivatives turned out volatile as political worries and optimism about a cut in UK base rates each took their turn in a session where volume returned to more modest levels, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at 2,681, the December contract on the FT-SE edged higher before political worries led to a brief retreat. When talk of an interest rates cut once again started to appear, buyers sent it upwards to reach the day's high of 2,724 mid-morning. Late morning profit-taking was followed by renewed demand and the firm early performance on Wall Street helped to underpin buying in the afternoon when December traded in a range 2,700 and 2,720. As has been the case through out the week, the contract traded at a good premium to cash for the whole session though dealers said arbitrage was reduced. December finished at 2,721, on turnover of 7,334. Traded options remained dull with volume reaching only 24,902 lots. Around 10,830 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 contract, while HSBC was the most active stock option.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Upturn hits overseas earnings Britain's economic recovery had an unexpected side effect last year - it reduced overseas earnings from the financial services sector. Overseas earnings from activities such as banking, insurance and share dealing fell to Pounds 15.6bn last year from Pounds 16.1bn in 1992, figures released by British Invisibles, a trade group, show. The main reason for the fall was an improved performance by overseas banks based in London. During the recession bad debt problems caused many banks based in the UK to record losses, which count as a positive item in Britain's accounts. Last year economic recovery in Britain meant bad debt problems were reduced. With improved profits from securities dealing this meant overseas banks could report and remit surpluses to parent companies. These count as a negative item on Britain's accounts. The result was that the UK's income from direct investment, which recorded a surplus of Pounds 1.14bn in 1992, registered a deficit of Pounds 1.66bn last year. Mrs Alison Wright, director general of British Invisibles, said the increase in overseas banks' profits 'augurs well for London's continued pre-eminence as an international banking centre'. The decline in earnings from direct investment was partly offset by two improvements in the financial services accounts. Strong capital markets meant that the net overseas earnings of UK securities dealers rose to Pounds 3.47bn last year from Pounds 2.53bn in 1992. Secondly, underwriting at Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, having recorded losses in 1990-1992, managed a small Pounds 76m surplus in 1993. Such figures for Lloyd's are calculated on a cashflow basis, rather than on the traditional basis under which results are not announced for three years. British Invisibles splits the overall figures for financial services earnings into two components: services, including fees, commissions, insurance and share dealing profits; and investment income, including portfolio investment by pension funds and direct investment. While net earnings from services increased to Pounds 9.36bn last year from Pounds 8.35bn in 1992, earnings from investment fell to Pounds 6.24bn from Pounds 7.72bn over the same period.</p>

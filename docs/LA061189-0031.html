			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS AND ETHICS  </P> <P> Beatty is right on target when he states that the Democratic Party "is losing  its soul." For too long, Democrats have been feeding from the trough of big  business in a futile attempt to keep up with the Republican Party. In a  two-party system in which both parties are beholden to corporate America, who  is left to speak up for the common people?  </P> <P> The Democratic Party needs to return to its roots, and start to represent the  vast majority of Americans who haven't profited from the prevalent greed,  corruption and selfishness of the Reagan-Bush years.  </P> <P> ARLEN GROSSMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

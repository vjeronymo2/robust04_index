			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: IBM Japan and Canon unveil notebook PC PRICE competition in the previously sheltered Japanese personal computer market intensified yesterday with the unveiling by IBM Japan and Canon, the office equipment maker, of a jointly- developed, notebook-style computer with built-in printer. Earlier this week, NEC, the Japanese electronics company which has about 53 per cent of the PC market, announced a cheaper model range that was seen as a response to a fast-increasing flow of lower-priced imports from Compaq and Dell Computer, the US makers. At the same time, PC demand is falling in Japan, with sales down an estimated 15 per cent last year, putting extra pressure on makers to discount products. Industrial companies are cutting their capital spending budgets, while domestic users appear reluctant to trade-in existing models, particularly as there are expectations of further price cuts later this year. The IBM-Canon machine, which will have a list price of Y298,000 (Dollars 2,374), has a 32-bit central processing unit and built-in bubble-jet printer capable of holding 10 sheets of paper. The companies are hoping for annual sales of about 50,000 units, arguing that its price compares favourably with that of existing Japanese notebook PCs.</p>

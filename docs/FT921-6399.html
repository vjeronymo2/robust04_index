			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity sector recovers its confidence THE HOPE of a generous Budget speech on March 10, probably accompanied by a cut in base rates, pushed the UK stock market ahead yesterday. With unfavourable developments on both corporate and political fronts apparently discounted for the present, the market resumed its advance towards the top of its latest trading range, gaining 18.2 on the FT-SE Index scale. Trading volume picked up after a slow start and strengthened significantly towards the close when US buyers appeared in force for BP, continuing the transatlantic tug-of-war in the share price. Equities opened uneasily after the latest UK opinion polls had indicated a three-point lead for the opposition Labour party. However, shares quickly turned higher, helped again by a strong opening in the stock index futures. At the day's best, the Footsie was more than 24 points ahead at just over 2,571. The pace in London slackened, however, when Wall Street made a slow start to the new session. At the close of trading, the FT-SE Index was 18.2 ahead at 2,565. Barclays de Zoete Wedd yesterday reiterated its view that the London market has established itself in a trading range of FT-SE 2,450 to 2,600 ahead of the UK general election, which is widely expected to be held early in April. Confidence in the prospect of a cut in base rates appeared to strengthen, and there were widespread gains among the interest rate-orientated stocks. Across the broader range, the market continued to take potentially upsetting company results in its stride, with analysts pointing out that the bad news from the financial sector, which has dominated this week, had been fully expected. Shares in Barclays Bank fell smartly on disclosure of Pounds 1.7bn write-offs last year and a warning of further substantial provisions ahead. The rest of the UK clearing banks, however, remained firm and apparently undismayed as the sector awaited news today on dividend plans at Midland Bank. Commercial Union brushed aside news of a Pounds 68.6m loss for the year. The picture was a little less confident among the merchant bank and securities house shares after SG Warburg issued a bearish trading statement and Kleinwort Benson reported profits below market expectations. Heavy turnover in Barclays, and also in BP after Wall Street opened, was reflected in an increased Seaq trading total for the day of 548.6m shares, against 511m on Tuesday. Trading in the blue chip leaders was expected to boost volume of customer, or retail, business yesterday; on Tuesday, retail business in equities totalled Pounds 970.8m, a return towards the improved business levels of the previous week. Some equity strategists expressed surprise at the resilience of the stock market yesterday, commenting that a half-point cut in base rates must now be fully discounted in share prices. While the market may have been fully braced for this week's bad news from the financial sectors, there could still be shocks ahead as Britain's industrial companies report trading progress. The first test could come today when ICI and British Gas report. With Midland Bank's dividend decision also likely to provide a test of investment confidence, market analysts were wary of sounding over-confident last night.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HOLY BATTLES' DETAILS FIGHT BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE  </P> <P> Allowing the viewing public to come to terms with the Constitution is rare  enough, but "The Supreme Court's Holy Battles" (tonight at 9 on Channel 28)  goes further.  </P> <P> On one level, it is a study of how the United States became the first nation to  institute a separation between church and state, and how that institution has  been attacked and defended ever since. But on a more subliminal level, host  Roger Mudd -- sounding and looking better than ever -- helps us explore how the  Constitution is a living document, and why it must remain so.  </P> <P> Most hourlong programs of this sort give history the short end of the hour,  driven by the fear that we will turn the channel. Mudd and producer-director  Karen Thomas obviously feel differently. The groundwork of today's legal  battles over school prayer and other church-state clashes begins with James  Madison's and Thomas Jefferson's pre-Revolutionary War efforts to allow a  measure of liberty to non-Anglican worshipers in the Virginia colony. What Mudd  and historians Thomas Buckley and Martin Marty explain so well is the  profoundly radical and simple nature of what became the Virginia Statute of  Religious Freedom: A person's beliefs, or non-beliefs, are a personal matter.  It was Madison who inserted the essence of this into the First Amendment.  </P> <P> Mudd tosses in some curious, uncited "facts," as when he says that "90% of us  believe in a Supreme Being." True or not, it does point out that the social,  church-organized pressure to break down -- in Jefferson's famous phrase -- "the  wall of separation" persists. In the past 50 years, the program reports, more  than 90 religious cases have been heard before the Supreme Court, with half of  those since 1980.  </P> <P> As the report cuts between the crackling intelligence of historian Leonard Levy  -- who thinks it's unconstitutional for congressional chaplains to be on the  payroll -- and the born-again teens of Renton, Wash. -- who see nothing wrong  with having their services on public school property -- the viewer can only be  amazed at the frightening ignorance of the Constitution rampant in the land.  </P> <P> We can also understand how constitutional language is deliberately vague,  patched together and debated over by human beings. Why it's so vague is best  summed up by Marty, quoting the Jesuit priest John Courtney Murray: "A republic  is people locked in civil argument. When the argument ends, the republic ends."

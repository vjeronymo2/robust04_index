			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCOPE: ATHLETIC LEAGUE DIVERTS GANG YOUTHS INTO RING  </P> <P> A couple of months ago, 11-year-old Eric Davis was fighting and bullying his  classmates at St. Lawrence Brindise Catholic School in Los Angeles. The  fighting got so bad that school officials were on the verge of expelling the  sixth-grader.  </P> <P> Then Eric's mother, Felicia Bellows, discovered a release for her son's energy.  After school each day, Eric, who lives in Watts, can be found punching the  heavy bags at the Sheriff's Athletic League in Lynwood.  </P> <P> "I appreciate the program so much that I pay my sister to pick Eric up from  school and take him to Lynwood. I pick him up every evening after I get off  work," said Bellows, a secretary with the Automobile Club of Southern  California.  </P> <P> Several youths from Lynwood and other nearby cities lace on the gloves five  days a week to participate in athletic league activities.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department started the league more than two years ago to try to  curb street gang activity and to serve as an outlet for troubled youths or  bored youngsters looking for something to do.  </P> <P> "We wanted to show them the soft side of the badge, and they are responding,"  said Sgt. Elmer Flye, a league coordinator and one of the founders of the  Lynwood program. Flye and five other deputies from the sheriff's Lynwood  substation are assigned to handle the league activities.  </P> <P> The Lynwood substation provides law enforcement services for the city of  Lynwood and the unincorporated county areas of east Compton and Willowbrook,  with a combined population of 85,000.  </P> <P> "The department was interested in engaging in some character-building," Flye  said.  </P> <P> The program has been set up in a 20,000-square-foot building that once housed a  Montgomery Ward automotive center. Montgomery Ward closed its retail store  nearby in March, 1987, and donated the automotive building at 3100 E. Imperial  Highway to the city.  </P> <P> The program has been financed by a combination of city and state grants,  fund-raisers and donations. The center has received about $126,000 the last two  years from the state Office of Criminal Justice Planning and nearly $50,000  from the city.  </P> <P> As Flye spoke, two youths sparred in a $20,000 boxing ring donated by an El  Monte businessman who wished to remain anonymous. Ray Vasquez, 17, and Juan  Cabrera, 16, belonged to rival Lynwood gangs but have become good friends since  participating in the boxing program, said boxing coordinator Mike Ramirez.  "These two guys are good examples of people learning to get along," Ramirez  said.  </P> <P> Vasquez said he still is a member of his gang but enjoys coming to the gym to  spar. Cabrera said he no longer participates in gang activities.  </P> <P> "This is like college. I'm learning things and it keeps me off the streets,  keeps me from getting shot. I don't drink or smoke. I'm in shape," said  Cabrera, who weighs 106 pounds.  </P> <P> As Vasquez and Cabrera feinted and jabbed, several other youths, some as young  as 8, hammered punching bags. An aerobics class was in progress nearby. About  45 women were dancing, panting and sweating to the rhythm of "Let's Go Crazy"  by rock star Prince.  </P> <P> Aerobics teacher Evelyn Davis, like most of the people who help the sheriff's  deputies run the center, is a volunteer. She conducts the class three nights a  week.  </P> <P> "I enjoy it. I would be doing aerobics (at home), but this way I have a lot of  company," said the energetic Davis, 28, who works with welfare families for the  Department of Public Social Services. Her 7-month-old daughter, Dwanna, plays  with her toys off to the side while her mother leads the class.  </P> <P> "This is a family affair," said Deputy Fred Shaw, pointing to several parents  waiting in an adjoining room while their children took part in a karate class.  "We teach the kids discipline. We also stress education," added Scott Wiseman,  the karate teacher.  </P> <P> The youths must maintain a C average in their school grades to participate in  the karate exercises, and they must bring their report cards to Wiseman, he  said. "We have youths who were once D students now on the honor roll," said  Wiseman, the holder of a black belt.  </P> <P> Flye said it is difficult to measure the impact that the center has had on the  more than 50 youth gangs in the area served by the Lynwood substation.  </P> <P> But he said, "I think we have accomplished a great deal. We have had some  subtle influences. "We don't hear reports of kids who come here continuing to  get into trouble. They also bring other troubled kids to the center who we  help."  </P></p>

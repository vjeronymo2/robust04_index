			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "OECD: Martino Illustrates Rome </F> Policy"]    [Text] (ANSA) Paris, June 8 -- The Italian Government is  determined to push forward and accelerate the liberalization of  its economy and boost the number of jobs with a policy which  coincides with global trends, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio  Martino, a trained economist, said here Wednesday [8 June]  during the ministerial session of the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD).    Speaking to the diplomatic chiefs and ministers for budget  and foreign trade from the 25-nation OECD, Martino stressed how  the commitment of the Rome government was "for greater economic  freedom, not limited to just Italy, but one which will develop  on an international level."    Yesterday, during the first day of the OECD ministerial  session, Italy was singled out for its budget problems and told  the best way out was through a reduction of taxes for lower  level employment and greater flexibility in hiring regulations  with the eventual suppression of a minimum salary.    Today, the OECD economic policy committee revised its  economic growth forecast for Italy for the 1994-1994, predicting  a 1.5 percent increase in the GDP for this year, close to its  earlier forecast, while in 1995 the GDP is expected to climb by  2.5 to 2.6 percent.    Unemployment in Italy was forecast to remain "just below" 12  percent this year, while there should be a slight reduction in  store for 1995.    In his address to today's session, Martino went on to  underscore how "the program of the Italian Government expresses  in an explicit way the readiness of Italy to operate for the  enlargement of the European Union towards East Europe and to  increase world trade relations, first of all with North America  and the Pacific regions."    The Italian foreign minister then went on to add how premier  Silvio Berlusconi believed that "nothing, in Italy's  international trade relations, should be done which in any way  fuels the protectionist spiral."    Martino also voiced his satisfaction for the agreement  reached with Russia, also in view its agreements with the  European Union, as well as the participation of Russian  President Boris Yeltsin at the July G-7 Naples summit.    In order to help support the transformation of the Russian  economy, Italy last week took part in the renegotiation of the  Russian foreign debt, taking on costs of close to a billion  dollars.    Looking also at other countries which are evolving towards a  free-market system, the Italian foreign minister said the  current situation was difficult and was one to which the OECD  had to adapt, by moving cautiously.</p>

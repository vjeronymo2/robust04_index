About 100,000 ANC supporters from all over Venda attended  the  rally. Mr Mandela answered their numerous questions on ANC  policy. He was asked what would become of uneducated Venda  government office cleaners -- who earn R140 [rand] a month -- if  the ANC came to power. "All temporary government workers,  unregistered labourers and low wages will come to a halt," Mr  Mandela replied. Males and females with the same qualifications  would get equal pay, he added.    On education, Mr Mandela said there would be free and  compulsory education for all children for the next 10 years.  Parents denying children their right to education would be  prosecuted.    On the Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] issue, Mr Mandela said  Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] leader Gen Constand  Viljoen and Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg would  never see it.    "As long as I live there will never be a volkstaat and I  assure you that the National Party [NP] will be buried after  April 27. Vote for the ANC as the NP and F. W. de Klerk have  been rejected by white voters, because when he calls a rally  only 30 people attend."</p>

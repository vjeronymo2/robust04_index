			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Japan hits at targets for US car parts MR Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association, yesterday criticised the US for trying to correct the trade imbalance between the two countries by setting targets for purchases of US vehicle parts by Japanese carmakers. 'The US is trying to seek a solution to a macro-economic problem at the micro-economic level,' he told a group of foreign correspondents in Tokyo. By doing so, it was delving into business matters in a way that condoned managed trade, could impede business activity and could be detrimental to consumers' interests, he said. His comments follow talks last month between the US and Japan involving US vehicle parts purchases by Japanese companies in a new framework of trade talks agreed between the two countries this summer. A second meeting is planned for this month. The US side, Mr Kume said, appeared to be asking for purchasing targets in 1995 and 1996 but 'targets should be set by the seller'. Japanese car companies would be glad to purchase US-made vehicle parts as long as the quality and prices were right but it was up to the seller to make the effort. Mr Kume also cast doubt on US claims that the Japanese market was closed to foreign cars, saying European car makers were doing very well in Japan. The problem was rather that the Big Three US carmakers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - did not make cars that were suited to the Japanese market. For example, about 80 per cent of cars sold in Japan had an engine displacement of less than 2,000cc but no US carmaker had introduced a car with engine displacement of less than 2,000cc into Japan. Mr Kume pointed out that Japanese carmakers had offered to open their dealers to US cars but had received no proposals from the US side on that offer. 'We can only conclude that that must be because they have no cars to sell in the Japanese market,' he said. Better marketing efforts were also needed, as shown by a survey conducted last year by the Japanese Consumer Research Institute which showed that 89 per cent of respondents either 'do not want to purchase' or 'do not want to purchase at all' cars made by the Big Three. This compared with 54 per cent which responded negatively to European cars.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In our newscasts yesterday, we reported the  creation in Mali of a movement called (Ganda Koi), a Songhai  word meaning masters of the land. The movement was created in  reaction to acts of violence perpetrated by Tuareg rebels  against members of the black community in northern Mali. The  community has, therefore, decided to assume responsibility for  its own security. Boubacar Guidado Toure, a spokesman for  (Ganda Koi), elaborates on the objectives of the movement:    [Begin recording] [Toure] The movement is not meant to  harass  or harm the people, but to restore peace in northern Mali  because the government is incapable of restoring peace there.  Since the signing of the national pact, no day has gone by  without attacks taking place or vehicles being taken away from  their owners. Each time we are told that the perpetrators of  those acts are armed groups. We know that plans for these  attacks are hatched here in Bamako. We have, therefore, created  the movement to stop such attacks. We will use the same means  the rebels are using.    [Unidenfied correspondent] What do you mean?    [Toure] I mean that we are prepared to take up arms and  fight  them.    [Correspondent] So, do you have weapons?    [Toure] Yes, we have weapons. [end recording]    Meanwhile, officials of the Unified Movement and Front of  Azaouad [MFUA] say they do not understand the real motivation  behind the creation of (Ganda Koi), but stress that they are  prepared to fight those who will attack them. Speaking to our  correspondent Djibrill Mbodj, MFUA spokesman Ag Alhassane  denounced any attempt likely to plunge Mali into civil war.  [passage omitted]</p>

The source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the prosecutor of the  Jordanian State Security Court, which handles cases affecting  state security, expected the number of the detainees to  increase, and that a number of Kalashnikov machine guns,  explosives, and pistols were found in the posession of the  accused and in some hideouts in Amman.    Disclosing some details about the detainees, the source said  that they had all gone to Afghanistan via a third state, that  some of them received training there for three months on various  types of weapons, and that the detainees did not know one  another but they did know their leader and commander who is also  now under detention with them.    The source added that they operated in small cells with one  secret official in charge and that they did not give their  organization any name because they did not want such a name to  circulate and eventually lead to their exposure.    He said that they had confessed that they all belonged to  one  group which had one leader who is now detained with them, and  that they used to arrange their travel to Afghanistan through  individuals returning from Afghanistan who would supply them  with air tickets and addresses to go to in other states, and  that they would stay at some relief home [Bayt i'ashah] until  someone came to provide them with the necessary information and  requirements after which they would go to Afghanistan.    They emphasized in their confessions that had worked for the  elimination of vice which, to them, meant movie theaters, video  cassettes, bars, and shops which sell alcoholic drinks. They  also confessed that they had planned to assassinate Jordanian  and Palestinian prominent civilian and military figures, and  that their actions were also aimed against the current peace  process and geared toward preventing the conclusion of peace  agreements with Israel. The Jordanian source expected the  investigation to be completed and the entire case to be referred  to the Jordanian State Security Court around the middle of this  current month.    The recent explosion in the Salwa movie theater in the town  of al-Zarqa', in which Egyptian citizen 'Id al-Jahhalin (the man  who planted the bomb) was injured and had his two legs and one  finger in his left hand amputated, enabled the Jordanian  authorities to lay their hands on the first strings of the case.    Al-Jahhalin confessed that his task was only to plant the  detonator in the timer of the explosive device which included  four coconut-shaped bombs.    Al-Jahhalin, who is now at al-Zarqa' government hospital,  said that he regretted what he did.</p>

At  one time, Romero claimed to be a member of a rightist death squad in their  homeland.  </P> <P> Garnica-Vargas faces a maximum 12-year prison sentence. His sentencing is  scheduled for May 15.  </P> <P> Last week, a jury acquitted Garnica-Vargas and a fellow immigrant, Julio  Arriaza, 27, of first-degree murder in the case. After four days of  deliberation, the jury failed to reach verdicts on lesser charges of  second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter. Garnica-Vargas was being held  pending the prosecutor's decision on retrying the case when he agreed to plead  guilty to the lesser charge.  </P> <P> Arriaza is in jail, pending a plea hearing scheduled for 9 a.m. today.

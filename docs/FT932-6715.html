			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government to announce committee of privy council THE government plans within days to announce proposals to set up a committee of privy councillors to monitor the security services, a Labour MP said yesterday, writes David Owen. Mr Donald Anderson, the MP for Swansea East, made the claim while expressing concern the announcement might come during the Whitsun recess. He was supported by Mr David Winnick, the Labour MP for Walsall North, who said confining membership of such a body to privy councillors would be 'a form of apartheid'. Cabinet ministers agreed earlier this month to proceed with legislation to put MI6, the overseas security service, on a statutory basis in the next session of parliament. However, it is understood that plans to increase the accountability to parliament of the security services have not yet gone to cabinet.</p>

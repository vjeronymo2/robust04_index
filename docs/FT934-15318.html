			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (4): No friend to sacred cows - Profile / Sir David White SIR David White is tired of waiting for Britain's politicians to reach agreement on Europe. The industrialist, regarded by many businessmen in Nottingham as the city's corporate champion, puts his frustration bluntly: 'We have spent the last 20 years in Parliament arguing about Europe and it's getting in the way of business. Most companies recognised years ago that we couldn't screw around, we had to get on with the market.' Companies faced a clear risk by waiting for parliamentary approval: their overseas competitors would proceed without them - forging alliances to pave the way for orders worth millions of pounds. If businessmen regarded the European Community with the same suspicion as the Euro-sceptics at Westminster, lucrative contracts would have been lost and thousands of jobs threatened, says Sir David. Speaking in his oak-panelled office at Nottingham Health Authority (which Sir David has added to his clutch of chairman-posts, along with Nottingham Trent University and Mansfield Brewery), he says that securing such contracts depends on creating a climate of mutual trust between trading partners. As an initiative to foster that trust, the Four Cities Partnership is a valuable asset - albeit a delayed one - for companies operating out of Nottingham, he adds. 'It may be that we've got away with it because other countries such as the US have not taken advantage of the EC market while we've been faffing around.' Now that the partnership has been formed, Sir David - a former deputy chairman of National Freight Consortium and founder chairman of Nottingham Development Enterprise - says companies should waste no time in exploiting the opportunity to establish a greater presence in Europe. Citing the success of the Mansfield Brewery in winning export orders to Russia, he warns companies to develop a keen sense of customer tastes if they are to win the kind of contracts that secure jobs at home. 'It's not just about getting your feet under the boardroom table but under the kitchen table. We must make every effort to understand our customers - if we get to know them culturally then we can judge their foibles and moods.' Winning the trust of companies and politicians overseas demands flexibility among executives and councillors in Nottingham. Sir David says businessmen may have to give up some sacred cows if they are to establish that trust - primarily the adherence to sterling rather than a single European currency. Sir David sees the Four Cities Partnership's main role as changing perceptions over links with Europe. 'If it creates closer relations that would be helpful, but it's really just setting the scene rather than producing jobs.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Kazakhstan's Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko, who  is visiting Tehran at the head of a senior delegation, had  positive and constructive talks with our country's economic and  political officials and signed a number of agreements on various  fields of cooperation. The visit has removed many obstacles in  the path of expanding relations between the Islamic Republic of  Iran and Kazakhstan.    In his travels the Kazakh prime minister also visited  Esfehan's steel mill and historic sites and travelled to the  Kish free trade zone.    The visits were aimed at familiarization with the actual and  potential capacities for cooperation between the two countries  in the fields of industry, trade, services, and communications  and could lead to new fields for cooperation.    The Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan is connected to  Iran  through the Caspian Sea but relations between the two people  supercedes geographic borders because the two nations enjoy  common historic sources of religion and culture, the roots of  which are of great interest for Kazakhs.    Now, following independence, Kazakhstan like other Central  Asian republics has an opportunity to give new dimensions to  these ancient ties and to expand them into economic and trade  cooperation.    Since Kazakhstan's independence the Islamic Republic of  Iran,  too, has welcomed and been a vanguard, together with other  Central Asian Muslim republics, in improving various fields of  cooperation, so that cooperation will be beneficial to both  nations.    Kazakhstan is among the republics which have great potential  for cooperation with the Islamic republic of Iran in all fields.  And this is also true for our country because both countries,  as well as extraordinary underground riches, enjoy a strong and  relatively matching industrial and trade infrastructure and  could be close and reliable partners in special areas such as  oil, transfer of energy, land-air-sea transportation, and  industry.    In this respect our country's geographic position as a  bridge  linking the Kazakhstan republic to free international waters is  an important point.    The agreements reached between the high-level Kazakh  delegation and our country's political and economic officials  cover many areas of cooperation. It is hoped that cooperation  and ties between the two countries will enter a more advanced  stage with the implementation of the plans for cooperation which  have been the subject of the recent agreements.</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH URGES SEOUL TO OPEN TRADE  </P> <P> President Bush assured South Korean President Roh Tae Woo today that the United  States will stand by its security commitments, but said South Korea must open  its markets more to U.S. products.  </P> <P> With Roh standing at his side in the East Room of the White House after more  than two hours of talks, Bush promised that U.S. forces will remain in South  Korea "as long as there is a threat from the north." He expressed support for  Roh's efforts to reduce tensions on the peninsula.  </P> <P> But he said that while Korean workers and companies have benefited from access  to open markets in the United States, "American workers and companies deserve  equal access to Korean markets."  </P></p>

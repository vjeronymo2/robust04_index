			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The Bangkok vernacular dailies NAEO NA,  SIAM RAT, and MATICHON publish on 9 June editorials commenting  on the political situation and the handling of activist Chalat  Worachat's hunger strike by the Democrat Party of Prime Minister  Chuan Likphai.    NAEO NA's 400-word editorial on page 3 and headlined "The  Democrat Party Must Be Responsible" points out that all hopes  for improving the political atmosphere were ruined when Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai declared that his Democrat Party  disagreed with the idea of forming any committees to redraft the  Constitution. The abrupt change in the Democrat Party position  has rapidly brought various pro-democracy groups together  nationwide to voice their opposition to the Democrats and the  coaltion government. The discontent can lead the country to a  "chaotic and violent situation which can be ignited by either  pro-democracy groups or other ill-intentioned and power-craving  factions."    The editorial says: "We respect and admire the courage and  sacrifice of Chalat Worachat, but we do not support his hunger  strike, peaceful as it is. We also praise the government of  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai for its strong adherence to correct  principles in running the country. The Democrat Party's  decision to reject the establishment of the committee to compile  and reword the Constitution, however, is suicidal, excessively  rigid, and unrealistic."    In conclusion, the editorial says: "While everything was  about to be settled peacefully, the arrogant resolution adopted  by the Democrat Party has worsened the situation. We,  therefore, appeal to the Democrat Party to take full  responsibility over whatever may happen from now on."    SIAM RAT's 300-word editorial on page 5 headlined "It's Time  For Political Reform" says that the hunger strike has had both  positive and negative repercussions. "The positive impact is  that more people have come to realize that it's time to reform  our democratic form of politics. Professor Prawet Wasi earlier  offered this reform proposal, which he claimed would further  improve the quality of life."    The editorial adds: "We agree with Professor Prawet Wasi's  statement on his disagreement with the hunger strike and call  for efforts to save Chalat's life through correcting or  improving our political system even beyond what Chalat calls  for. This is one way to solve the political crisis and maintain  our cultural value that never lets anyone die without doing  something to save him."    "The negative aspect of the issue is that if we simply stand  idle and let Chalat die with the hope that nothing will happen,  general feelings in society will certainly be affected." This  is also against the traditional ethical values and heritage of  the nation.    The editorial concludes by saying: "We hope that under the  present circumstances, all political parties and politicians  must act prudently and free themselves from old biases and  principle in making judgements. If they cannot accept Chatlat's  demands, they must come up with something superior, such as the  proposal for political reform of Professor Prawet Wasi."    MATICHON's 400-word editorial on page 2 headlined: "The  Democrat Party...Watch Out," notes that the Democrats, as the  core of the coalition government, can do lots of things to  tackle the problems in dealing with Chalat's hunger strike if it  is not too hardheaded and pessimistic.    The editorial notes that the hunger striker has gained more  and more supporters because his flexible demand was received  aggressively by the government. "As a result of the  government's aggressiveness and indifference in dealing with  Chalat's demands, more and more democracy-loving people are  supporting Chalat... The masses are agitated. All sorts of  untoward incidents could happen."    The paper says: "The Democrat Party, up to this point,  should  realize that it has to compromise with the people's call for  democracy and join the movement to bring about changes for  improvement. The assumption that the other side intends to  topple the government has placed the Democrat Party in the  position of opposing the aspirations of the masses. The  continuing obstinacy of the Democrat Party can jeopardize the  prime minister's chair."</p>

About one million local residents need to be moved out of  the  area where a reservoir will be built on the middle reaches of  the Chang Jiang River, according to experts involved in the  project.    Preparations for the resettlement of local residents in the  province started in 1985, and the pace of evacuation was  quickened last year.    The local government has also paid close attention to the  rebuilding of the towns and major enterprises that have to be  relocated.    The present stage of resettlement has focused on land  development. A total of 1,865 hectares of land was used for the  resettlement in 1993 and about 2,000 hectares of arid land was  turned into irrigated farmland.    And now in the province, a range of newly-built cities and  towns with good roads, housing, sufficient drinking water and  electricity are being built for the resettled to enjoy a better  life there.</p>

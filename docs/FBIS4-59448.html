			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement" issued by the General Committee of the General </F> People's Congress in Sanaa on 12 May]    [Text] Masses of our Yemeni people: The serious historic  and national challenge facing the unity requires all of us and  all of the homeland's well-intentioned unionist forces and the  masses of our Yemeni people in all sectors to confront the grave  conspiracies. These conspiracies are led by the forces of  apostasy and secession from among the leaders of the Socialist  Party against unity and constitutional legitimacy and against  the people and their will, as expressed on 27 April 1993.    Defending this land is defending the honor and dignity of  this homeland, its independence, sovereignty, and national,  democratic regime. This is being done today by our Armed  Forces, the forces that protect constitutional legitimacy and  democracy, on all battlefields. This is also being done by the  masses confronting the forces of apostasy, treason, and  secession led by the leaders of the Socialist Party, who have  for nine months -- since 19 August -- been maneuvering under  various contradictory and misleading pretexts in the hope of  buying more time to prepare for achieving their objective of  secession, planned by the gang of apostasy and treason, led by  the butcher 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Al-Bid has savored maneuvering.  He also wants to satisfy his lust to serve the objectives of  his masters, who plot against and betray the homeland to  slaughter its unity.    The best evidence of this is the firing of destructive Scud  missiles against defenseless citizens in the cities of Sanaa,  Ta'izz, al-Rahidah, and other cities by the gang of criminality,  apostasy, and secession. This claimed the lives of many  victims, including women, children, and elderly people, and  terrorized defenseless citizens in their homes and cities.    The criminal, cowardly actions of the forces of apostasy and  secession represent terrorist, savage, and brazen actions and  reflect a vindictive Nazi [as heard] sentiment and destructive,  adventurist mentality that has ignited the fire of sedition all  over the homeland. Thus, they started firing missiles  indiscriminately at cities and secure residential quarters in  Sanaa, Ta'izz, and other Yemeni cities.    The General Committee of the General People's Congress [GPC]  shares with the masses of our people their pain over these  inhuman, immoral crimes. The General Committee strongly  denounces these criminal, savage acts that are carried out by  the gang of apostasy, secession, and treason in the Socialist  Party leadership. It appeals to public opinion, political  forces, parties, and organizations and national unions,  societies, and figures to adopt a clear, frank, and responsible  position by denouncing these reckless, criminal acts carried out  by the gang of destruction, death, treason, rebellion, and  terrorism in the Socialist Party leadership.    The General Committee of the GPC urges the sons of our  people to stand firmly by the side of the Armed Forces, the  forces of unity and legitimacy that are storming the dens of  treason and apostasy and secession. It calls on the masses of  our Yemeni people to demonstrate even greater unionist cohesion  to face this secessionist gang and oppose its criminal actions  and misleading propaganda.    The General Committee of the GPC also urges the members of  the Armed Forces, including officers and troops who were misled  by the leadership of apostasy and secession in the Socialist  Party leadership, to side with legitimacy, defend unity and  democracy, and respect the national principles of society.    The General Committee also appeals to all unionist forces in  political parties, organizations, unions and associations,  particularly the unionist elements within the Yemeni Socialist  Party, to spell out their position toward this gang and the  destructive results of its actions on the homeland, society, and  national unity. The homeland is paramount to everyone and is  the property of all; the responsibility of protecting it from  destruction and sabotage, along with its achievements and  projects over three decades, is the responsibility of all  citizens, regardless of their political persuasion.    The reckless, criminal acts carried out by the spiteful,  secessionist gang, as well as its hysterical, stupid,  irresponsible acts, will only increase our people's  determination to go ahead and make more achievements for unity  and constitutional legitimacy and to provide security and  stability all over the homeland.    The General Committee reasserts what was said by the brother  chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of  the GPC, in his speech yesterday: We are not against the  Socialist Party but against the separatist, apostate elements  within the Socialist Party leadership that are waging a losing  war and shedding innocent blood. The unionists in the Socialist  Party should spell out their position clearly toward this  criminal gang and should rally around unity and constitutional  legitimacy and reject the decisions of the secessionist gang  that declared war. They should spell out their position for the  sake of bridling war and ending more bloodshed.    The General Committee of the GPC also stresses what was said  by the brother chairman of the Presidential Council and  secretary general of the GPC: We reject war in all its aspects  and forms and do not want to have a victor or vanquished. The  war was imposed on us. We are fighting so that the will of the  people for security, stability, and social peace will triumph  and bring constitutional legitimacy.    The General Committee of the GPC holds the criminal al-Bid  and his treasonous gang that conspired against the homeland,  democracy, and constitutional legitimacy fully responsible and  asserts that the shelling of residential quarters in Sanaa,  Ta'izz, al-Rahidah, and other cities will not go unpunished.  Our people will take to task all those adventurers and traitors  who have departed from the ranks of the people, its unionist  will, and democracy.    And soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes  their affair will take. [Koranic verse]    Issued by the General Committee of the GPC</p>

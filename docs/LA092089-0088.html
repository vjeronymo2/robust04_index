			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A Bayonne, N.J., bulk chemical storage facility operator was ordered to pay a  fine of more than $3 million for continued dumping of oil-fouled waste water  into New York Harbor, a penalty described as the highest ever levied in a  private suit under the Clean Water Act. U.S. District Judge Nicholas Politan  blamed "lethargic enforcement" of environmental regulations by the federal  Environmental Protection Agency and the New Jersey Department of Environmental  Protection for allowing Powell Duffryn Terminals Inc. to pollute the Kill Van  Kull for 11 years. Politan's ruling arose from a suit by the Public Interest  Research Group and Friends of the Earth.  </P></p>

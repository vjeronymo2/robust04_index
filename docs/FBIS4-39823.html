			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Care for Veterans"] </F>   [Text] On the recommendation of Ruslan Aushev, president  of Ingushetia and chairman of the Council of the CIS Heads of  Government Committee for Internationalist Troops, the  Interparliamentary Assembly Council adopted at its session  yesterday a decree in which the attention of the parliaments of  the Interparliamentary Assembly's member states is drawn to the  necessity of providing internationalist troops and their  families with a full degree of social and legal protection.    "The Interparliamentary Assembly Council adopted this  decision affecting the future of more than 700,000 people with  practically no discussion," Vladimir Shumeyko said in an  exclusive interview for an ITAR-TASS correspondent. He  emphasized that, unfortunately, questions of state social  assistance and legal protection for veterans of wars and  military operations in various countries are being resolved with  difficulty in the CIS, and advocated improving the system to  implement interstate legal acts on assistance to veterans  adopted within the framework of the CIS, including the  monitoring of their execution by the sovereign states' supreme  legislative organs. Shumeyko expressed the hope that the  programs for material and everyday and medical provision for war  veterans agreed by the CIS countries will be backed by budgetary  finances.</p>

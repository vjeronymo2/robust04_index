			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Upton &amp; Southern sues Reject directors - Proposals to save the stores business from collapse Upton &amp; Southern Holdings, the stores group, is launching a Pounds 5.5m share placing and open offer to rescue its business, and is suing five former directors of the Reject Shop, the home furnishings retailer it acquired in February. Upton warned that Reject Shop would have to cease trading without the new funds, leading to withdrawal of support from Upton's bankers and the collapse of the business. Upton acquired Reject Shop in a Pounds 2.5m all-paper offer in February. In August it said that its financial and trading position had turned out to be worse than represented at the time of the deal, resulting in a Pounds 2.75m cash shortage. Mr Jeffrey Gould, Upton's chief executive, said he was confident the placing and offer, which is fully underwritten, would provide enough funds to turn the chain round. 'We wanted to raise sufficient to give the company absolute security, but not more than we needed,' he said. 'There is now light at the end of the tunnel - hopefully quite a bright light.' Middlesbrough-based Upton raised Pounds 4.5m in a rights issue in March, largely to reduce debt and provide working capital for the Reject Shop. However, it later discovered lower levels of stock in Reject Shop than expected, which hit sales in May and June and forced the group to acquire more stock. When talks with an unnamed overseas investor over taking a stake fell through, Mr Gould said Upton had been forced to make its August statement. It has since taken legal advice and yesterday issued writs for damages against five former Reject Shop directors. Writs were issued for breach of fiduciary duty to Reject Shop, breach of warranty and misrepresentation against former co-chairmen Mr Anthony Hawser and Ms Anna Vinton, and former managing director Mr Geoffrey Frost, who is additionally being sued for fraudulent misrepresentation. Writs were also issued against former non-executive directors Mr David Barker and Mr Clive Strowger, for breach of fiduciary duty and for misrepresentation. The former directors said they would vigorously contest the actions, which Mr Hawser said in a statement were without foundation. Mr Hawser added that Upton had been given full access to Reject Shop's systems and accounts for three months before the acquisition. He said Upton's cashflow problem had been caused not by shortage of stock but by 'the abandonment of The Reject Shop's well established policy of offering obvious value for money'. Both Mr Hawser and Ms Vinton are suing Upton's board for libel over its comments in August. The magnitude of Mr Gould's task was highlighted by results announced yesterday for the 18 months to July 31, Upton's new year end, showing a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4m on turnover of Pounds 18.1m, which included Pounds 685,000 from discontinued activities and Pounds 5.95m from acquisitions. In the previous 12 months losses were Pounds 635,000 on turnover of Pounds 10.7m, including Pounds 2.79m from discontinued activities. Losses per share were 20.7p (4.12p). There is again no dividend. Upton plans a placing and open offer by MeesPierson and Townsley and Company of 120.3m shares at 5p each, representing about 72 per cent of the enlarged share capital of the company. The shares lost 1p to 5 1/2 p. Some 30m shares have been placed firm with a new institutional investor, with the balance subject to the open offer on a 49-for-20 basis. The company said it had chosen this route rather than a rights issue, as originally planned, in order to accommodate the unnamed new investor, which had demanded 25 per cent of the new shares. Mr Gould said about Pounds 2m of the proceeds would be used to obtain stock, and the rest for working capital and store improvement. He added that after improving product range and buying and strengthening management, current trading in Reject Shop was encouraging, with sales in the first 10 weeks of the financial year substantially ahead. By refurbishing stores and offering 'reasonable quality products at very good prices' to a target audience ranging from 'students to 30- to 40-year-olds' Mr Gould is banking on Reject Shop increasing sales at a faster rate than the rest of the retail sector.</p>

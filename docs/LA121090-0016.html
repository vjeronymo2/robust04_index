			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A live-in caretaker convicted of stealing from her elderly patients has been  sentenced to two years in state prison.  </P> <P> Vivian Underwood, 39, was sentenced by Superior Court Judge William J. Howatt  Jr., who also ordered her placed on probation for five years and to pay $15,000  in restitution.  </P> <P> Underwood pleaded guilty to grand theft for the unauthorized use of a patient's  credit card in a plea-bargain agreement in which another charge was dropped.  She also pleaded no contest to grand theft in a case in which an $11,500 ring  was stolen from an invalid woman at Mercy Hospital.  </P> <P> According to the victims' family members, Underwood used the credit cards to  pay for things such as a home entertainment system and a television satellite  dish.  </P> <P> "In all my years as a prosecutor, I don't think I've seen a case of theft just  like this," Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Pettine.  </P> <P> The judge demanded that Underwood inform any future employers of her  convictions, and ordered her not to pursue work that involved the care of an  invalid.  </P> <P> Pettine said Underwood is wanted on eight outstanding warrants in Florida,  where she has been convicted of grand larceny and passing bad checks, leading  to a 2 1/2-year prison sentence.  </P> <P> "She's been a thief all of her life. . . . I think she's earned her (prison)  time in the state of California," Pettine said.  </P></p>

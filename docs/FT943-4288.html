			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Plantsbrook advances 8% despite fall in death rate Plantsbrook, the funerals group which is subject to a Pounds 193m takeover bid by Service Corporation International of the US, yesterday reported an 8 per cent rise in interim profits. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 5.96m to Pounds 6.44m in the six months to June 30 while a Pounds 845,000 contribution from acquisitions lifted turnover from Pounds 26.3m to Pounds 27.1m. Mr Peter Hindley, chief executive, said the sales increase was achieved despite a 2 per cent reduction in the death rate over the comparable period last year. He said the fall was expected following the unusually high rise in the death rate last year. Fully diluted earnings per share rose from 3.83p to 4.11p. An interim dividend will not be paid following the directors' decision to recommend SCI's offer. The company ended the period with net cash of Pounds 488,000, against Pounds 995,000. The interest charge fell from Pounds 460,000 to Pounds 292,000. Mr Hindley said Plantsbrook had taken advantage of opportunities in the property market and extended its branch network. Its geographical base was extended with the acquisition of a business in York in January and a further 15 branches were added to its Scottish network with the purchase of DB Henry in February and Potts in Glasgow in June. Four more branches were opened. SCI, the largest funeral operator in the US, has also established itself as the biggest UK operator, securing 15 per cent of the market through its purchase of both Plantsbrook and its only listed competitor, Great Southern Group. SCI is paying 175p a share for the 46.3 per cent stake held by Plantsbrook's largest shareholder, Pompes Funebres Generales, the French funerals group. The board of Plantsbrook has recommended the offer to shareholders.</p>

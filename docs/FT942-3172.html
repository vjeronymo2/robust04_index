			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Ford chief warns on Japanese competition Mr Alex Trotman, chairman of Ford of the US, the world's second largest car maker, warned yesterday that weak currencies would not protect European and North American car makers for long from Japanese competition, writes Kevin Done. Despite the deep recession in the Japanese vehicle market Toyota, the leading producer, still had cash reserves of Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.6bn), he said. 'They are planning to be competitive with a yen at about Y55 to the D-Mark or Y90 to the US dollar,' he told the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris. 'Protectionism lives in Japan,' claimed Mr Trotman, but the protection had come at the cost of the Japanese consumer. Japan's economy was run primarily for the benefit of its producers. He warned that 'Japan either must open its market, or the yen will open it up for them'.</p>

Members of the HVO who were held in Bugojno have  arrived in Mostar as well. Zdenko Vranjes reporting.    [Begin reporting] [Vranjes] In today's exchange the Croat  side released 500 captured members of the Muslim army from the  prison in Rodoc near Mostar. This afternoon they crossed over  to the [Muslim-held] eastern part of Mostar, some of them went  to Jablanica, and 20 went to their homes in the [Croat-held]  western part of Mostar.    The Muslim side released 72 captured HVO members from  prisons  in the eastern part of Mostar and 294 from the prison in  Bugojno. The former prisoners crossed from the eastern to the  western part of the town this afternoon. Released prisoners  from Bugojno have also arrived in Mostar this evening.    Berislav Pusic, the representative of the Herzeg-Bosna  office  for the exchange of prisoners and searches for the missing,  assessing that today's exchange fully honored the agreement on  the exchange reached yesterday, noted that the exchange  according to the all-for-all principle would continue as early  as 21 March, and that it would go on until the last captured or  imprisoned person of either side is released.    [Pusic] We still want 53 residents of Bugojno who are on our  list of missing people. We have managed to locate some of them  in prisons in Travnik and Zenica. I cannot give their names now  because I do not know them, but they will be [word indistinct]  in the next 10 days. We will continue searching for other  Croats who were arrested in Bugojno when the town fell. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

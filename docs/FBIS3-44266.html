The organizations, which form the "Unified Djibouti  Opposition Front," said in a statement that participants  analyzed international and regional conditions as well as  Djibouti conditions, which are characterized by "the continued  liberation war against a dictatorship that is sacrificing the  nation's present and future through forcible domination."    They added that the Djibouti regime has always rejected the  peace and democracy proposals adopted by the Front's first  conference, which was held in Paris in June 1992. They stressed  that peace and democracy are still the Front's basic aims and  that Gouled's regime represents the main obstacle to their  achievement.    The organizations added that "Gouled insists on continuing  the war despite the deterioration of the national economy and  while government militias continue to commit inhumane practices,  such as massacres and the daily torture of civilians."    They said that, on this basis, the "Unified Opposition  Front"  has decided to work to achieve the following aims:    "1. To topple Hassan Gouled Aptidon's dictatorship on the  grounds that this is the only way to restore peace and  democracy. It can be done in the following manner:    "To continue to reinforce armed struggle, which should  expand to cover all national territory.    "To reinforce all forms of political and social struggle  in the capital by mobilizing all groups of national society.    "2. To work -- after the dictatorship is toppled -- to form  a  transitional government, achieve national reconciliation, and  set up the institutions of a rule-of-law state in Djibouti based  on integration with the region's states."    The statement bears the signatures of Ahmed Dini Ahmed,  leader of the "Front for the Restoration of Unity and  Democracy"; Omar Khair, leader of the Democratic Forces Front;  Mohamed Hussein Hassan, leader of the Djibouti National  Movement; Djalal Abdel Rahman Ahmed, leader of the Movement for  Salvation and Rebuilding; Mahdi Ibrahim Goud, official in charge  of foreign relations in the Djibouti Democrats Union; Kamil Ali  Mohamed, spokesman for parliamentary opposition; and Abdellahi  Disingor, leader of the Democratic Socialist Union.    Meanwhile, the "Society for the Defense of Human Rights" in  Djibouti has said that government forces have arrested 50  civilians at random and put them in a prison situated some 60 km  from the town of Tadjoura, north of the country.    The society said in a statement that Djibouti authorities  are  keeping silent about the fate of these detainees, who are  suffering from the dreadful conditions in prison.</p>

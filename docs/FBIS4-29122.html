			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, June 14 KYODO -- The United States on  Tuesday [14 June] appeared ready to submit a graduated sanctions  resolution to the UN Security Council over North Korea's  continued rejection of demands for inspections of its nuclear  facilities, UN diplomatic sources said.    The sources said the initial phase of sanctions will include  a freeze of UN Development aid for North Korea's free economic  and trade zone project in the Tumen river basin along with a  halt on economic, scientific and cultural assistance. If North  Korea continues to refuse to cooperate with the inspections  required under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), a  second phase of sanctions would be imposed. These would include  an embargo on military exports to Pyongyang, a freeze on North  Korean foreign assets, and a ban on the flow of hard currency  into North Korea from overseas, the sources said. A third phase  of sanctions would include a comprehensive trade embargo and  travel ban on North Korea, the sources suggested.    Meanwhile, South Korea's YONHAP NEWS AGENCY reported North  Korea's envoy to the United Nations Pak Kil-yon has warned that  North Korea will leave the NPT if sanctions are imposed on  Pyongyang. North Korea threatened to pull out of the NPT in  March 1993 over demands that it grant inspectors access to two  undeclared nuclear sites. It later suspended its withdrawal  decision after high-level walks with the U.S. Pak met with  representatives of the 10 nonpermanent members of the Security  Council on Tuesday and informed them that North Korea has  formally notified the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  of its decision to withdraw from the monitoring agency. Pak  also acknowledged that two IAEA inspectors are still in North  Korea. The U.S. State Department on Tuesday confirmed that it  has received North Korea's notification that it was pulling out  of the agency.    YONHAP, quoting Pak, reported Pyongyang will not allow any  further IAEA inspections since it has withdrawn from the agency,  although the nuclear checks are still required under the NPT.  Pak said a resolution to the nuclear stalemate depends on the  U.S., insisting that Washington should change its attitude and  return to negotiations, according to YONHAP.    UN Spokesman Joe Sills said North Korea is still subject to  inspection provisions of the NPT despite its withdrawal from the  IAEA. According to Sills, North Korea is the third nation to  have left the IAEA, following Honduras and Nicaragua. Nicaragua  later rejoined the IAEA. There are 164 signatory nations to the  NPT, and 121 members in the IAEA, Sills said.    U.S. Government officials said the two IAEA inspectors in  North Korea were continuing with their activities of monitoring  and adjusting IAEA observation equipment at North Korean nuclear  facilities. The officials said that it is essential that the  inspectors carry out their activities beyond just being in North  Korea. They reiterated their concern that the situation could  become worse if the inspectors are asked to leave.</p>

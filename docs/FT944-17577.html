			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Echoes of Tory voices The attractive face of conservatism was presented at the Labour conference in Blackpool this week. We may see its unattractive face on display at the Tory conference in Bournemouth next week. This has nothing to do with personalities. Mr John Major is no less decent than Mr Tony Blair, but, as to policy, the prime minister is constrained by circumstance. He has little choice but to trundle along the ideological tram-lines set in the later 1980s. The leader of the opposition is free to try to tug his party towards the gentler form of conservatism that better suits the English temperament. He calls it social-ism, but its values have often been prescribed by Tories from Disraeli onwards. My primary text today is therefore not the stunning speech delivered by Mr Blair on Tuesday, evocative as that may be. It is, rather, The Right Approach, a statement of Conservative aims agreed in 1976 by a conclave representative of all wings of the party, with the 'wets', as they were called, predominant. The resulting document constituted the intellectual inheritance of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher, a new, young, energetic leader of the opposition. 'It is the task of the Conservative party today to restore hope and confidence to a disillusioned British people,' the authors began, nearly two decades before Mr Blair's 'we meet in a spirit of hope'. Some readers may remember the 1976 paper as an assertion of rightwing hard-headedness, and a rejection of the corporatism of the later Heath years. It does not read like that today. It notes that Tories 'are not blinkered by a socialist ideology that assumes the omni-competence of the state . . .', a claim that Mr Blair might make on behalf of 'new Labour'. More helpfully for my thesis, The Right Approach states that 'man is both an individual and a social being'. If all society had to do was provide a framework of laws within which individual opportunities could flourish, the paper acknowledged, then other things in which Conservatives believed - patriotism, loyalty, duty - would be meaningless. The corollary is clear. 'Man is an individual, answerable to himself,' as our pre-feminist authors put it. 'But he is also a citizen, the member of a complex network of small communities which go to make up society - family, neighbourhood, church, voluntary organisation, workplace and so on.' There you have it. The essence of The Right Approach is compatible with what Mr Blair had to say on Tuesday. 'It is not this or that minister that is to blame,' he told the Labour conference, 'it is an entire set of political values that is wrong. They fail because they fail to understand that a nation, like a community, must work together in order for individuals within it to succeed.' Zip back to 1976. 'What we have to set out, and it is in the main stream of Conservatism . . . ,' our social Tories wrote, 'is a political philosophy that goes beyond the state and the individual, and begins to express in human terms the complex network of reciprocal rights and duties in an orderly society.' I do not propose to stretch this piece of elastic further than it can stand. The Right Approach is echoed by Mr Blair in many places, including the passage in which it calls for devolution of legislative powers to Scotland, but much of it is dated, suitable to the preoccupations of the 1970s. Large chunks of it would stick in the gullet of even the most modernist Labour leader. The point, described by Mr Blair as 'fundamental', is that today's Conservative ministry has trapped itself on the shores of free-market minimalism, which is not where the electorate could have imagined it was heading when it fled from socialism and trade union thuggery in 1979 and not where it wants to be stranded today. Some voters may have been influenced by a second Tory paper, The Right Approach to the Economy, which was prepared under the chairmanship of the then Sir Geoffrey Howe. It is sharper, less 'wet' than its predecessor of the similar name, but its principal begetter, now Lord Howe, might not wholly disagree with my theme. 'No turning back,' he has said, referring to the Conservative hard-right, 'should not be mistaken for bash on regardless.' He will doubtless repeat the sentiment at next week's conference in Bournemouth. The way Mr Blair sees it, we are at a turning point in political history, just as we were in 1979. The party that took office then may have won the three subsequent elections, but the adventure upon which it led the nation has run its course. His story-line is that we are now ready for a different administration, whose social and political strategies are based on the proposition that the individual and the community are mutually supportive. There has to be a 'constructive voluntary partnership' between government and industry. Oops] Sorry. Took that last sentence from The Right Approach, not Mr Blair, but either will do. If there are doubts, they lie not in the nuances of philosophy, but in the pitfalls that await anyone who has to learn on the job. Mr Blair has been leader for less than 80 days, so judgments of his managerial abilities must be premature. He and his team are adept at caressing the media, and he appears to have cemented a useful working relationship with his deputy, Mr John Prescott. It is not, however, clear that he has found time to soothe the sensibilities of all his senior colleagues; perhaps, as Labour's last best hope, he has no need to. His assistants and advisers are untested in battle. Many of them are outstandingly intelligent, bright and very young. As head of policy, the 29-year-old Mr David Miliband will be in charge of an apparently more formidable team than any available to previous Labour leaders of the opposition. Most of its members, like others in the Blair entourage, are 20-somethings or just-turned 30s. These cherubim will have to produce the Labour version of The Right Approach. They will be expected to outplay Mr Major's policy unit, headed by Mrs Sarah Hogg, plus half Conservative central office and an army of civil servants whose advice is never party-political but always helpful. Yet the young are powered by optimism. It is the Tories who have to explain why, having been in office so long, they should be given another lease.</p>

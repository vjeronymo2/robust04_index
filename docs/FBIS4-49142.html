			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Susie Weldon and Rachel Clarke in Hanoi] </F>   [Text] The Vietnamese consulate-general in Hong Kong says  it has received an assurance that Hong Kong will not use force  again in transferring Vietnamese detainees. The assurance came  after Vietnam issued a formal rebuke over the violent transfer  of 1,500 boat people from Whitehead detention centre to High  Island on April 7.    In Hanoi, the United Nations refugee chief, Sadako Ogata,  said forced repatriation of Vietnamese boat people from Hong  Kong had been suspended after the raid.    The Vietnamese vice-consul, Nguyen Thanh Thuy, said his  country had expressed its concern in a diplomatic message  delivered on Saturday over the level of force used. "We told  them we don't think the use of force to transfer these refugees  is necessary," he said. "We think it is better next time to  inform the Vietnamese side."    Thuy said the Hong Kong government had not formally replied  to the rebuke but had "sent a message". "The Hong Kong  government told us this would not happen again," and "they would  not use force" Thuy said.    The Hong Kong government's refugees co-ordinator, Brian  Bresnihan, last night refused to comment on any assurance given  to Hanoi over the use of force. Nor would he comment on the  suspension of forced repatriations.    Speaking earlier in the day, Bresnihan said the Government  had explained the reasons for the Whitehead raid. "We have had  an expression of concern from the Vietnamese government about  the use of force in this operation," he said. He said Hong Kong  officials were "carefully considering" this message.    More than 200 Vietnamese were injured during the raid by  1,200 police and prison guards. The Whitehead raid prompted the  Governor to order an independent inquiry after Eastern Express  revealed the number of injured was far higher than the single  casualty originally claimed by officials.    Pam Baker, the chairwoman of Refugee Concern, said Vietnam's  rebuke showed how far matters had deteriorated in the camps.  "Treatment of the Vietnamese boat people is now so bad that even  the country from which they are fleeing is complaining about  it," she said.    A Security Branch spokeswoman yesterday confirmed it had  briefed Vietnamese consular officials on the "events surrounding  the Whitehead incident", and the recent appointment of two  justices-of the peace to investigate it after receiving the  rebuke. The spokeswoman declined to comment on the assurance  that force would not be used in future operations, saying: "We  can't go into the details of an exchange between the  consulate-general and the Security Branch."    Security Branch officials would not comment last night on  whether they had changed their policy on handling transfers of  boat people in the light of the Whitehead violence.    In Hanoi, Ogata glossed over criticism of the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees' inaction on the day of the  Whitehead raid. She refused to speculate on what measures would  become necessary once the dwindling supply of volunteers for  repatriation dried up. "It will be a very difficult choice for  all of us who have given very, very special attention to  Vietnamese refugees," she said.</p>

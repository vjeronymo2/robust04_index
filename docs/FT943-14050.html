			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Future of farm body in doubt The government has deferred a controversial decision on the future of the Agricultural Wages Board, which sets pay and conditions for 180,000 farm workers. Labour says the board's existence is threatened by government plans to repudiate two international conventions that would protect farm wages. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture minister, told parliament she had received advice from employers in the industry that Britain should not recognised the two International Labour Organisation conventions as they would restrict flexibility in the farm labour market. Mr Gavin Strang, Labour's agriculture spokesman, called Mrs Shephard's move 'a shocking attack on some of the lowest-paid workers in the land'. The two conventions, which are accepted in most countries, require the setting of minimum wages for farm workers as well as the guarantee of an annual holiday. But the National Farmers' Union said the conventions would mean there could be no changes to arrangements for the next 10 years. The NFU strongly supports the continuing existence of the wages board. During the consultation exercise, Mrs Shephard has received calls from all corners of the industry for the board's preservation. But she said recent developments had forced her to rethink. This year's high pay settlement by the board, which awarded a 4.9 per cent wage increase to farm workers - double the average settlement for manual workers - had led many employers to question the value of the board, Mrs Shephard said. In addition, employees' representatives were seeking a judicial review of the board on the grounds that it discriminated against part-time workers. Mrs Shephard said that in view of these developments 'I believe we must pause and take stock'. Mr Strang said the abolition or weakening of the wages board would drive down farm workers' wages, which were already 30 per cent below the industrial average.</p>

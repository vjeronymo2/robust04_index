The Service also requests proposals from Indian Tribes that wish to establish special migratory bird hunting regulations. These regulations will permit the taking of the designated species during the 1994&hyph;95 season. The Service annually prescribes outside limits (frameworks) within which States may select hunting seasons. The Service has also employed guidelines to establish special migratory bird hunting regulations on Federal Indian reservations and ceded lands. These seasons provide hunting opportunities for recreation and sustenance; aid Federal, State, and Tribal governments in the management of migratory game birds; and are designed to permit harvests at levels compatible with migratory bird population and habitat conditions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Tribal proposals and related comments should be submitted by June 3, 1994.

For the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season, regulations will be proposed for certain designated members of the avian families Anatidae (ducks, geese, and swans); Columbidae (doves and pigeons); Gruidae (cranes); Rallidae (rails, coots, moorhens, and gallinules); and Scolopacidae (woodcock and snipe). These proposals are described under Proposed 1994&hyph;95 Migratory Game Bird Hunting Regulations (Preliminary) in this document. Definitions of waterfowl flyways and mourning dove management units, as well as a description of the data used in and the factors affecting the regulatory process, were published in the March 14, 1990,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (55 FR 9618). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Schedule for 1994&hyph;1995 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This is the first in a series of proposed and final rulemaking documents for migratory game bird hunting regulations. Proposals relating to the harvest of migratory game birds that may be initiated after publication of this proposed rulemaking will be made available for public review in supplemental proposed rulemakings to be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Also, additional supplemental proposals will be published for public comment in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as population, habitat, harvest, and other information becomes available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the late dates when certain portions of these data become available, it is anticipated that comment periods on some proposals will necessarily be abbreviated. Special circumstances that limit the amount of time which the Service can allow for public comment are involved in the establishment of these regulations. Specifically, two considerations compress the time in which the rulemaking process must operate: the need, on one hand, to establish final rules at a time early enough in the summer to allow resource agencies to select and publish season dates and bag limits prior to the hunting seasons and, on the other hand, the lack of current data on the status of most migratory game birds until later in the summer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the process is strongly influenced by the times when information is available for consideration, the overall regulations process is divided into two segments. Early seasons are those seasons that generally open prior to October 1, and include seasons in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Late seasons are those seasons opening in the remainder of the United States about October 1 and later, and include most of the waterfowl seasons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Major steps in the 1994&hyph;1995 regulatory cycle relating to public hearings and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notifications are illustrated in the accompanying diagram.

Both hearings will be conducted in accordance with 455 DM 1 of the Departmental Manual. On June 23, a public hearing will be held at 9 a.m. in the Auditorium of the Department of the Interior Building, 1849 C Street NW., Washington, DC. This hearing is for the purpose of reviewing the status of migratory shore and upland game birds. Proposed hunting regulations will be discussed for these species plus regulations for migratory game birds in Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands; special September waterfowl seasons in designated States; special sea duck seasons in the Atlantic Flyway, and extended falconry seasons. On August 4, a public hearing will be held at 9 a.m. in the Auditorium of the Department of the Interior Building, address above. This hearing is for the purpose of reviewing the status and proposed regulations for waterfowl not previously discussed at the June 23 public hearing. The public is invited to participate in both hearings. Persons wishing to make a statement at these hearings should write to the address indicated under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Requests for Tribal Proposals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Beginning with the 1985-86 hunting season, the Service has employed guidelines described in the June 4, 1985 Federal Register (50 FR 23467) to establish special migratory bird hunting regulations on Federal Indian reservations (including off-reservation trust lands) and ceded lands. The guidelines were developed in response to tribal requests for Service recognition of their reserved hunting rights, and for some tribes, recognition of their authority to regulate hunting by both tribal and nontribal members throughout their reservations. The guidelines include possibilities for: (1) on-reservation hunting by both tribal and nontribal members, with hunting by nontribal members on some reservations to take place within Federal frameworks, but on dates different from those selected by the surrounding State(s); (2) on-reservation hunting by tribal members only, outside of usual Federal frameworks for season dates and length, and for daily bag and possession limits; and (3) off-reservation hunting by tribal members on ceded lands, outside of usual framework dates and season length, with some added flexibility in daily bag and possession limits. In all cases, the regulations established under the guidelines would have to be consistent with the annual March 10 to September 1 closed season mandated by the 1916 Convention Between the United States and Great Britain (for Canada) For the Protection of Migratory Birds (Convention). The guidelines are capable of application to those tribes that have reserved hunting rights on Federal Indian reservations (including off-reservation trust lands) and ceded lands. They also apply to the establishment of migratory bird hunting regulations for nontribal members on all lands within the exterior boundaries of reservations where tribes have full wildlife management authority over such hunting, or where the tribes and affected States otherwise have reached agreement over hunting by nontribal members on non-Indian lands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tribes usually have the authority to regulate migratory bird hunting by nonmembers on Indian-owned reservation lands, subject to Service approval. The question of jurisdiction is more complex on reservations that include lands owned by non-Indians, especially when the surrounding States have established or intend to establish regulations governing hunting by non-Indians on these lands. In such cases, the Service encourages the tribes and States to reach agreement on regulations that would apply throughout the reservations. When appropriate, the Service will consult with a tribe and State with the aim of facilitating an accord. The Service also will consult jointly with tribal and State officials in the affected States where tribes may wish to establish special hunting regulations for tribal members on ceded lands. As explained in previous rulemaking documents, it is incumbent upon the tribe and/or the State to put forward a request for consultation as a result of the proposal being published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Service will not presume to make a determination, without being advised by a tribe or a State, that any issue is/is not worthy of formal consultation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the guidelines provides for the continuation of harvest of migratory game birds by tribal members on reservations where it is a customary practice. The Service does not oppose this harvest, provided it does not take place during the closed season required by the Convention, and it is not so large as to adversely affect the status of the migratory bird resource. For several years, the Service has reached annual agreement with tribes (for example, in Minnesota, the Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians) for hunting by tribal members on their lands or on lands where they have reserved hunting rights. The Service will continue to consult with tribes that wish to reach a mutual agreement on hunting regulations for on-reservation hunting by tribal members. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guidelines should not be viewed as inflexible. Nevertheless, the Service believes that they provide appropriate opportunity to accommodate the reserved hunting rights and management authority of Indian tribes while ensuring that the migratory bird resource receives necessary protection. The conservation of this important international resource is paramount. Use of the guidelines is not required if a tribe wishes to observe the hunting regulations established by the State(s) in which the reservation is located.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Details Needed in Tribal Proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Tribes that wish to use the guidelines to establish special hunting regulations for the 1994-95 hunting season must submit a proposal that includes: (1) The requested hunting season dates and other details regarding regulations to be observed; (2) harvest anticipated under the requested regulations; (3) methods that will be employed to measure or monitor harvest (mail-questionnaire survey, bag checks, etc.); (4) steps that will be taken to limit level of harvest, where it could be shown that failure to limit such harvest would impact seriously on the migratory bird resource; and (5) tribal capabilities to establish and enforce migratory bird hunting regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A tribe that desires the earliest possible opening of the waterfowl season should specify this in the proposal, rather than request a date that might not be within the final Federal frameworks. Similarly, unless a tribe wishes to set more restrictive regulations than Federal regulations will permit, the proposal should request the same daily bag and possession limits and season length for ducks and geese that Federal regulations are likely to permit the States in the Flyway in which the reservation is located.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposal Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pertinent details in proposals received from tribes will be published for public review in later  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  documents. Because of the time required for Service and public review, Indian tribes that desire special migratory bird hunting regulations for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season should submit their proposals as soon as possible, but no later than June 3, 1994. Tribal inquiries regarding the guidelines and proposals should be directed to the appropriate Service Regional Office. Tribes that request special hunting regulations for tribal members on ceded lands should send a courtesy copy of the proposal to officials in the affected State(s). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments Solicited <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practicable, to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.

Consultations under section 7 of this Act may cause changes to be made to proposals in this and future supplemental proposed rulemaking documents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This document was reviewed under Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These regulations have a significant economic impact on substantial numbers of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Therefore, in accordance with Office of Management and Budget instructions, a Final Regulatory Impact Analysis (FRIA) was prepared in 1981 and revised in 1990. Although a FRIA is no longer required, the economic analysis contained in the FRIA has been reviewed and the Service has determined that it meets the requirements of Executive Order 12866. This analysis was updated for 1994. The FRIA update included waterfowl hunter and harvest information from the 1992&hyph;93 season. The summary of the 1994 update follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``New information which can be compared to that appearing in the 1990 Final Regulatory Impact Analysis (FRIA) includes estimates of the 1992 fall flight of ducks from surveyed areas, and hunter activity and harvest information from the 1992&hyph;93 hunting season. There was essentially no change in the total fall flight of ducks, regulatory frameworks, hunter numbers, number of hunting days, or total duck harvest between the 1991&hyph;92 and the 1992&hyph;93 seasons.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of the updated analysis are available upon request from the Office of Migratory Bird Management.

Unless otherwise specified, no change from the final 1993&hyph;94 frameworks of August 23 and September 24, 1993, (58 FR 44590 and 50188) is proposed. Specific preliminary proposals that vary from the 1993&hyph;94 frameworks and issues requiring early discussion, action, or the attention of the States or Tribes are contained below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

The Service encourages a reopening of dialogue in order to resolve this problem as soon as possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Special seasons/species management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> i. Canvasback Management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During 1983-92, annual sport-harvest regulations for this species were guided by provisions in the environmental assessment ``Proposed Hunting Regulations on Canvasback Ducks, 1983''. That document acknowledged separate eastern and western populations and set breeding-population threshold levels for each, below which all possible actions, including season closure, in the respective regions, would be considered for canvasbacks. In 1993, after completing a review of canvasback databases, the Service determined that currently there is not sufficient evidence to warrant managing canvasbacks as separate eastern and western populations. However, the Service did not adopt a new harvest strategy to regulate the overall harvest of canvasbacks and the allocation of that harvest. Rather, it continued to follow guidelines set forth in the environmental assessment for a continental population. Because the most recent 3-year average (482,000 birds) was below the threshold identified in the assessment (500,000 birds), the Service determined liberalizations were not warranted during 1993-94; no changes in regulations from those which occurred during 1992-93 were enacted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Service delayed implementation of a revised harvest strategy, the Service is not satisfied with an indefinite continuation of the 1983 guidelines. The Service desires to build consensus on an improved harvest-management strategy which ensures the welfare of the canvasback population and preserves the historical emphasis on Flyway-based management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has circulated to the Flyway Councils and Technical Sections a draft harvest-management strategy to be considered for the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season and continues to welcome suggestions for improving our capabilities to manage the harvests of this important species. Copies of the draft harvest-management strategy are available at the address indicated under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> ii. September Teal Seasons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluations of shooting hours for teal seasons were initiated in several Mississippi and Central Flyway States in 1993, and more than 1 year likely will be required to achieve needed sample sizes. Provided methods being employed are acceptable and the amount of progress being made indicates a good-faith effort, we would recommend continuation of presunrise shooting hours conditional upon satisfactory progress toward completion of evaluations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> iii. September Wood Duck/Teal Seasons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluations of shooting hours for wood duck/teal seasons forwarded to Service in 1993 were sufficient to allow continuation of presunrise shooting hours in Florida, Kentucky, and Tennessee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Canada Geese.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1993, the Service announced that the administrative process for setting hunting seasons does not permit the setting of regular seasons that open prior to the Saturday nearest October 1 during the late-season regulations-development cycle. Those portions of seasons that open earlier must be established during the early-season regulations-development cycle in June. The Service is concerned about setting seasons in the absence of current status information. Because of this, requests for regular Canada goose seasons that open earlier than the Saturday nearest October 1 must include full justification of the need for the early opening, which will be weighed against the risk of establishing seasons prior to the time status information is available. The Service proposed to implement these procedures beginning with the 1994-95 hunting season in order to allow those States desiring early-season dates for regular Canada goose seasons sufficient time to prepare their proposals and to provide an opportunity for flyway council review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Snow and Ross's (Light) Geese. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1993, the Central Flyway Council recommended a review of framework closing dates for light geese. The Service indicated it would work with the Flyway Councils during the coming year to review its policy of framework dates for light geese. At this time, the Service requests that the States and Flyway Councils submit any pertinent information for joint review and that the Service, States, Flyway Councils, and other interested parties accelerate discussions regarding closing dates for light geese in migration-terminus and other areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Sandhill Cranes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has clearly indicated that it does not believe it is appropriate to increase harvest on the Mid-continent Population at this time, and that there should be no increase or shift in harvest toward the Gulf Coast Subpopulation, especially the greater-sandhill-crane component. In recent years, the Central Flyway Council has requested changes in the frameworks which would increase harvest pressure on this population. The Service recognizes the desire of the Central Flyway Council to liberalize regulations in certain areas, but concern for greater sandhill cranes would preclude any increase under the current approach to establishing frameworks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because there is an east-west gradient in the distribution of the 3 subspecies managed as the Mid-continent Population, the Service would be willing to consider an approach that would, in the future, provide the ability to establish frameworks by geographic areas within the Central Flyway. Such an approach of setting differential frameworks would provide the ability to shift harvest toward the western portions of the flyway, while limiting harvest in eastern portions. The Service requests comments regarding such an approach. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 15. Band-tailed Pigeons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Evidence from three separate surveys suggests that the long-term decline experienced by the Coastal Population may have subsided; and, in fact, the overall and individual State population estimates appear to have stabilized at low levels. Also, the status of the Interior Population is not well understood. Efforts are underway to gather more information about both populations. In 1993, all States having band-tailed pigeon hunting seasons either participated in the nationwide Migratory Bird harvest Information Program or required band-tailed pigeon hunters to obtain mandatory State permits to provide sampling frames for obtaining more precise estimates of band-tailed pigeon harvest. Those States issuing permits were required to conduct a harvest survey and provide the results to the Service by June 1 of each year. In addition, all States with band-tailed pigeon hunting seasons are participating in a wing-collection survey to provide information on annual recruitment. The Service will continue to closely monitor population and harvest information from both populations and will evaluate this information in June prior to making any decisions regarding the 1994-95 seasons. Indian Tribes also should consider this situation when proposing harvest regulations for this species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;55&hyph;F <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d630 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSep07ap94.015 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8318 Filed 4&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;55&hyph;C <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Arts: Our premier theatrical fruitcake - Ian Shuttleworth talks to Ken Campbell, the lunatic genius of the fringe It is easy to deduce which of the new houses by the River Lea in North London is inhabited by Ken Campbell: it is the one with the plaque of a flying pig by the front door. The interior decor is similarly outre, consisting largely of items of set from his various stage shows. How can he bear to live in the same room as an enormous portrait of John Birt, director general of the BBC? 'Well, I have a set of darts . . .' Less straightforward, though, is the task of explaining in measured, comprehensible terms just why Campbell has become so cherished as Britain's premier theatrical fruitcake. His series of surreal one-man stage shows rummages through the bottom drawers of culture, science and an assortment of bizarre notions has endeared him to audiences and critics alike. Since staging what was then his trio of solo rambles at the National Theatre last year (he dubbed it 'the Bald trilogy' to compete with the theatre's concurrent Hare trilogy), Campbell has discovered that 'I don't get writer's blocks, I get writer's flux,' and the trilogy is now a quintet-going-on-sextet. If you have ever felt the need of a batch of easy-to-digest, psychotically seductive crash courses in Fortean phenomena, to name but a few of the topics covered, Campbell is the weirdo you have been looking for. This may all sound uncomfortably like the man who sits heavily beside you on the bus and begins to complain loudly that 'They' are spying on him with rays, but Ken Campbell has ploughed his particular curlicued furrows over many years and in a number of theatrical fields. From beginnings in repertory theatre (recalled in his show Mystery Bruises with a learned analysis of why the other characters in Macbeth ignore the Thane of Angus - 'Do they not see him? Is he a dwarf?'), he went on to do a stint as stooge to Dick Emery on a stage tour, then to 'the baths: I was director of the Bournemouth Aqua Show . . . well, of the shallow-end acting bit. 'The writing took off in the mid-60s when I was understudying Warren Mitchell. I showed him a play I'd written for kids called Events Of An Average Bath Night, and we put it on in the RADA theatre. They had a notion at the time of putting professional shows on there and it didn't work, and that one particularly didn't work. But then I wrote a number of TV plays within a year, and they all got done.' A period at the Royal Court was followed by the first outbreak of virulent, infectious Campbellian idiosyncrasy: the Ken Campbell Roadshow. 'The first show was with Bob Hoskins, and was notable for being based on urban folk-myths, vanishing grandmother, ghost hitch-hiker, all that stuff - and the second was notable for putting my ferrets down Sylvester McCoy's trousers. Bob had so much talent; he could have been a great comic, you know, like Jerry Lewis, Norman Wisdom, proper crap comedy, but he decided to go and be gangsters. He's been rather successful at it, so I can't knock the decision.' The Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool (1976-80), under Campbell's artistic direction, provided the opening show for the National Theatre's Cottesloe space in the form of a nine-hour stage adaption of the Illuminatus novels, and took the world record for longest continuous play with The Warp at 22 hours: 'It consisted of ten separate dramas, each with its own title, but they were so weird that nobody ever knew them; The Winds Howling Through Tiflis was one, I don't know why it was called that but I didn't want to look thick so I never asked.' SF activities continued into his tour of duty at the helm of Liverpool's Everyman Theatre. Add to this cv a clutch of acting roles as diverse as Alf Garnett's neighbour Fred Johnson in BBC sitcom In Sickness And In Health, a man who shoves a rotting prawn down comedian Jim Davidson's throat in Peter Greenaway's A Zed And Two Noughts and a crooked solicitor in A Fish Called Wanda, and Campbell would appear to possess a formidable array of talents. He denies it: 'I can write a bit; I can direct, but I only really enjoy directing something that nobody else will, I don't want to join the who-can-do-The-Cherry-Orchard-best competition.' The solo shows began by chance when he asked to plug a scheduling hole in Camden's Offstage Downstairs studio theatre in 1988, and 'all I could think of was an evening of reminiscence, nattering about things that had happened to me. Then I went onto Robert McKee's storycraft course, and there's a moment where he says, 'A story is a bigger thing than life itself, way beyond mere reminiscence,' so I thought, 'Oh well, I'd better make a story, then,' and bunged a fib or two in.' And the rest is history, albeit a distinctly unorthodox version. Work in the pipeline includes a commission from the National Theatre for solo show number six, which apparently concerns 'mystic geography: sometimes out of the blue somebody will way something like, 'You must go to Kathmandu,' or somewhere you'd never really thought of going - well, I've got a few I have to follow up. 'But I think (the solo work) might be coming to an end. I've got a faint feeling this one might be a bit different: a one-man show with some other people in it.' In February Channel 4 screens Reality On The Rocks, a three-part popular science series in which narrator Campbell explains matters such as 'the expanding universe, how time is curved, and listening to the echoes of the Big Bang through this gramophone horn thing.' He also gives elocution tips to Professor Stephen Hawking: 'I said, 'That voice they've given you's rather good, it's got some humour in it,' and he said 'YES', and I said, . . . 'except when you say yes, they ought to give you the option of a campy yes or an ironic one,' and he went, 'MAYBE'.' But what aspect of his work gives him most satisfaction? 'Well, there's a party on Friday I'm looking forward to . . .' Ken Campbell's solo shows are performed consecutively next week at the Cockpit Theatre, NW8.</p>

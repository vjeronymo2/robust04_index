A pilot scheme of this program will be implemented this year  in eight provinces, said Vice-Minister of Labor Zhu Jiazhen.    The provinces for the try-out are either populous but less  developed inland provinces such as Sichuan and Anhui, or coastal  provinces of Guangdong and Jiangsu, which are short of labor  because of rapid economic development, Zhu said.    The scheme focuses on the development of small rural  industrial districts and rural towns -- enlarging the existing  ones and establishing new ones -- to take in extra laborers from  their own regions, he added.    The move will also narrow the gap between rural and urban  areas, said the vice-minister.    Other laborers could migrate to more developed coastal  regions, he said, noting that an inter-provincial labor  migration plan started last year has achieved initial successes.    China now has 130 million surplus rural laborers, and in  eight years the rural areas will have 70 million new laborers,  the vice-minister said.    The employment program was designed by the Labor Ministry,  the Agriculture Ministry and the State Council Development and  Research Center.</p>

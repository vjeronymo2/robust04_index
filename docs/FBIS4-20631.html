			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sadakazu Shindo, Chairman, Japan Industrial </F> Technology Association]    [Text] Happy New Year!    Taking this opportunity, I wish to say a few words.    The year 1993 saw the collapse of bubble economy, a huge  wave  of the rising yen which almost swept us away, a continuing  recession, and it ended without showing any sign of recovery  from the recession. What we are seeking in the year 1994 is what  will free us from this recessionary economy. The conditions in  the United States, on the other hand, are very different from  those of Japan and the European countries. It has come out of  the recession and is currently showing steady economic growth.  One of the factors which has contributed to the U.S.'s economic  recovery is that the country is attaching great importance to  the technology learned from Japan. This is especially evident in  recent improvement evident in the quality of the U.S.-made  automobiles, and it is the automobile industry which made it  possible for the U.S. economy to achieve growth. This tells us  that emphasis on technology will be essential especially during  recessionary times.    Needless to say, development of industrial technology  changes  not only industries and economic activities, but also our mode  of living. These changes, conversely, will become a motive power  necessary for the development of industrial technology. Demand  for industrial technology will grow not only as a part of the  means of dealing with the recession, but also as a means of  dealing with the problems of environment on a global scale, of  energy, and of resources.    After viewing the future prospects, the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry has revealed its own visions in  various areas. In order to meet the challenge of the future, the  Agency of Industrial Science and Technology has also reorganized  its research institutes and put into effect its various plans,  such as starting the industrial science technology development  system and the New Sunshine Project. In order to give this idea  a form, our association is devoting its effort to fulfill our  role as "a technological bridge linking government and industry"  since its establishment.    As the noteworthy topics of 1993, we would like to mention  that a party of the English House of Common (a Science  Technology Commission mission) and a survey committee from  Malaysia and Mexico came to us seeking the answer to the  question of "How the technology owned by the country is  transferred to the private sector." These people were  interested in the problems associated with state-owned  technology transfer, especially that of patents; technical  exchange among the industrial, academic, and governmental  sectors; and transfer of state-owned technology to small- and  medium-sized businesses. The visits of theses overseas parties  made us aware of the importance of the tasks assigned to the  association.    As expectations to industrial technologies grow bigger, we  feel that we must make every effort to achieve our mission as a  bridge linking government and industry while reviewing the  association's work and its systems.    I shall be grateful if all of you, members and associates,  will give us your guidance and support, and with this I wish to  conclude my speech and wish you all a very happy New Year.</p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Greens' bogus science: Bronwen Maddox argues that some environmentalists' claims should be treated with caution Public mistrust of science was lamented once again by the British Association for the Advancement of Science at its jamboree last week in Keele, Staffordshire. Should the association then welcome the way that environmental issues are popularising science? Enrolment on 'environmental science' courses is growing, warnings about the ozone layer abound in suncream advertisements, and seven-year-olds tyrannise their parents about recycling kitchen rubbish. For their part, the 'green' pressure groups are increasingly couching their campaigns in scientific language. Their traditional 'rubber suit' brigades, who made their reputations through direct action such as plugging the outlet pipes of chemical companies, have been joined by squads of PhD holders. The better-funded groups such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace now issue sheafs of closely analysed reports on the impact of toxic chemicals or radiation. That research has helped the credibility of the groups' campaigns. But many of the claims made by environmentalists in the name of science should be treated with caution. The arguments put forward often lack intellectual rigour, and they indulge the pressure groups' worst vice: the reluctance to rank some environmental threats as more significant than others. One of these misleading arguments is the suggestion that it is impossible to prove that any substance is 'harmless'. Just because no ill-effects have been spotted, say some environmentalists, does not mean there are none: they may have been overlooked, or may not emerge for decades. This uncertainty, the argument runs, stems from the way that scientific knowledge is built up. Knowledge constantly evolves, as hypotheses are tested against evidence and retained, modified or rejected. Therefore, because accepted theories may be amended in the future, no scientific 'proof' of the safety of a substance can be certain. As a result, they say, a new 'green' approach to science is needed. In an article entitled 'How science fails the environment' in the New Scientist magazine in June, Ms Sue Mayer, director of science at Greenpeace UK, and Mr Brian Wynne of the University of Lancaster said that 'greener science' would force the polluter to prove a chemical was safe, not make the environmentalist prove it was harmful. They demanded that science embrace the 'precautionary principle' that 'the environment must not be left to show harm before action is taken'. This position is nonsense. Science is inescapably an empirical exercise, but that does not mean that scientific knowledge is impossible. Some theories have persistently shown themselves effective at explaining why things happen. Mayer's and Wynne's proposals do not 'shift the burden of proof' to the polluter - they simply destroy any notion of proof. The unfortunate consequences of this approach are considerable. It allows anything to be described as a pollutant, even if damage has not been observed. It also makes it impossible to call one pollutant less damaging than another - what about the as-yet-unknown long-term effects? For this reason, many leading environmental groups were reluctant to acknowledge that the Shetlands oil spill in January might be less damaging than the Alaskan one in 1989, even though storms dispersed the Shetland slick quickly. The approach can also cause 'legal mayhem', in the words of one leading City solicitor. The precautionary principle is incorporated in a treaty on sea pollution signed by North Atlantic governments and in parts of UK food law. But the 'green science' approach makes it hard for governments and companies to demonstrate that they have taken 'enough' care. There is a legitimate place for the precautionary principle - as part of policymaking. The principle, which was endorsed by last year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and is part of UK policy, recognises that scientific proof often takes time to establish. For example, it is not yet clear whether recent changes in the earth's temperature should be attributed to emission of 'greenhouse gases', and scientists may take several decades to work out whether more warming is likely. Governments, however, have judged that it is worth acting now because the effect of warming on climate and agriculture would be unwelcome. That decision stems from political judgment about the risk that society will tolerate - it is separate from the science of establishing whether theories are correct. The green groups are right to point out that research into the environmental impact of chemicals could often be more thorough. But the approach that 'you never know what the long-term effects might be' gives undue weight to the pessimists. It is certainly not scientific, and it does little to help people distinguish needless worries from real threats.</p>

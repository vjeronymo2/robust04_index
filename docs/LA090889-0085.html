			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE OKS FAVORED TRADE STATUS FOR HUNGARY  </P> <P> The House on Thursday attempted to reward Hungary's democratic reforms by  voting to grant the Communist nation most-favored-nation status for three  years.  </P> <P> The measure was adopted on a 221 to 169 roll-call vote despite Republican  protests that it would hamper President Bush's conduct of foreign policy. The  bill's prospects for passage in the Senate are considered good.  </P> <P> It would extend for three years U.S. government credits and loan guarantees and  continue until 1992 the lower tariffs on imports from Hungary.  </P> <P> Hungary has enjoyed most-favored status since 1978 by presidential decrees. The  House action thus was largely a symbolic reward for Hungary's dramatic shift  away from Soviet-influenced Communist rule and toward a Western-oriented  economic and political system.  </P> <P> "There has been a historic surge toward freedom," said California Rep. Tom  Lantos (D-San Mateo), who was born in Budapest. "Americans should be rejoicing  that our values are sweeping through Eastern Europe."  </P> <P> But foes of the bill, such as Rep. Philip M. Crane (R-Ill.), argued that  Hungary is still under Communist control and influenced by the Warsaw Pact. He  added: "An open and democratic Hungary is a long way off."  </P> <P> Passage of the bill came as Hungary hosted thousands of East German refugees  who crossed the East German-Hungarian border in hopes of receiving asylum in  West Germany. The decision to tear down barbed wire on Hungary's border with  Austria -- literally tearing down the Iron Curtain -- also figured in the House  debate.  </P> <P> The symbolism of the action was diminished, however, by the sizable  Republican-led opposition.  </P> <P> During a visit to Budapest last spring, Bush promised to grant Hungary  permanent most-favored status -- putting it on a par with nearly all of  America's other trading partners -- if its Parliament approved a series of  measures dealing with immigration and other reforms at a coming session.  </P> <P> Aside from Hungary, the only Communist governments to gain most-favored status  have been Romania, from 1975 to 1988, and China, from 1980 to the present.  </P> <P> Although some members argued for continuing the annual presidential extensions  of most-favored status to Hungary, most argued that the Hungarians deserve a  reward that would encourage other East Bloc nations to follow their lead.  </P></p>

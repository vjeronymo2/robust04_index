			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Land Securities Having basked in glory throughout recession thanks to its defensive virtues, Land Securities has seen its halo dim as the property sector has revived. Although its shares have shot up from 355p to 734p since sterling's ejection from the Exchange Rate Mechanism, Land has still underperformed the sector by 12 per cent. Its weighting of the quoted property sector has dropped from 35 per cent of the total to 27 per cent over that time. Nevertheless, Land should not be ignored altogether until the next recession looms. Its great rent collecting machine keeps rolling and its balance sheet strength makes it one of the precious few property companies capable of sustaining aprogressive dividend policy. Moreover, while property shares remain so far ahead of underlying market fundamentals, Land will continue to provide a relatively safe haven against economic setbacks. The company, however, remains cautious about prospects. Recovery is fragile, with occupational market rents continuing to fall in central London. But Land will have to step up its acquisition programme if its shares are not to be left behind when recovery grips. It was a pity, therefore, that it was unable to commit more than Pounds 70m in the first half when the opportunities appeared greatest. The flood of institutional investors into property has now damped yields, making it difficult to buy on good terms. Nevertheless, Land's expertise may yet enable it to unearth some nuggets and it can easily gear up to spend Pounds 500m. That scale of spending may be required, though, if Land is quickly to re-ignite its rental and earnings growth.</p>

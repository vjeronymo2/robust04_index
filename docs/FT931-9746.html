			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Citibank designs index for US corporate loans CITIBANK has designed a US corporate loan index to provide an effective means of performance measurement, in a market which is becoming more actively traded. Around Dollars 350bn is raised through the US corporate loan market every year, while turnover in the secondary market currently totals around Dollars 14bn per year. Trading volume is estimated to be growing at an annual rate of 15 per cent, according to Mr Rod Ballek, managing director of portfolio management at Citibank, who helped design the index. However, unlike other types of corporate debt, such as commercial paper and bonds, corporate loans have not been seen as part of a fund manager's investment portfolio until recently. In the last few years, banks have become more active in their management of loan assets, sometimes as a result of efforts to offload distressed debt or to control credit risk. The Citibank Loan Index comprises 1,000 floating-rate revolver and term loans to over 600 companies, representing commitments of around Dollars 400bn.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: EVN wins new Austrian power deal ENERGIE-Versorgung Niederosterreich, one of Austria's largest utilities, has been authorised by the government of Lower Austria to take on electricity distribution in the part of the province surrounding Vienna. Acquisition of this territory would boost EVN's annual revenues by about 25 per cent to Sch12.5bn (Dollars 1.07bn) and significantly reduce its unit distribution costs. The city of Vienna, which operates Wiener Stadtwerke, a utility which now supplies the area, said it would appeal against the decision, a process which could take up to two years. EVN has long sought to serve the territory, which is the most densely populated part of Lower Austria. It claims it could provide services at lower cost than Wiener Stadtwerke. 'We know that the city of Vienna uses electricity tariffs to subsidise other things,' EVN said recently. Mr Rudolf Gruber, chairman, said he would now invite Wiener Stadtwerke to begin negotiations on the transfer. 'I think the decision is very positive and will put us in a very good position if they appeal,' Mr Gruber said. EVN shares gained Sch14 to Sch795 on the Vienna Borse yesterday.</p>

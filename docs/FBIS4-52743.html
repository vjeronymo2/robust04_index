			<p>BFN     [Text] Matsue, May 13 KYODO -- Forty-seven Chinese who  were arrested early Friday [13 May] for allegedly entering Japan  illegally aboard a freighter, hoped to find jobs in the country,  police said.    One of the illegal Chinese immigrants, who were aged between  17 and 38 and all from Fujian Province, has told police he  wanted to work in Japan. The 22-year-old man also confessed  that his friends in Tokyo were to provide him with a residence  and a job, they said.    Maritime Safety Agency investigators arrested the 47 Chinese  remaining aboard the freighter off Shimane Prefecture on  suspicion of sneaking into Japan illegally, thus bringing the  number of foreigners apprehended in the case to 61.    On Thursday, 14 out of 94 people aboard the ship were  arrested for allegedly violating Japan's Immigration Control Law  after a fishing boat discovered the vessel entangled in a fixed  fishing net in the Sea of Japan, 4 kilometers off the town of  Taki, Shimane Prefecture, on the coast of the Sea of Japan early  the same day.    Thirty-three people, who had gone ashore, are still missing,  police said.    A 46-year-old Indonesian man who claimed to be the captain  said the ship left Hong Kong on April 20 and later took 81  Chinese on board the vessel while standing offshore, they said.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Steichen backs 'mini-CAP' for eastern Europe Mr Rene Steichen, the European Union's agriculture commissioner, set the scene yesterday for a heated debate on the future of the common agricultural policy when he endorsed a 'mini-CAP' to help eastern European farm industries. He told a conference that he favoured extending some farm price support mechanisms to countries in eastern Europe to revive their agricultural sectors and enable them to join the EU. But Mr William Waldegrave, UK agriculture minister, said that such a plan 'would be flying in the face of reality'. He said it would be unwise to encourage eastern European countries to take decisions based on the fact that the EU's pricing policy would eventually be extended to them. Mr Steichen said that by fixing price supports at fairly low levels, a so-called 'mini-CAP' for eastern Europe could be accommodated within the EU's current farm budget guidelines. This could involve fixing support prices at Dollars 5 a tonne above world rates - lower than EU internal prices. Speaking at a conference organised by Reading University's Centre for Agricultural Strategy, Mr Steichen said that price supports would allow farm industries in eastern Europe to converge with those in the EU over the next 10 years. 'Without a certain price stabilisation, there is no certainty that it would be possible to create a stable environment allowing farmers to plan for the long term or to encourage them to invest and produce for the market,' he said. Mr Steichen does not believe the EU will ever find the political will to abandon the CAP in order to enlarge to the east. But he suggested that there could be a progressive lowering of internal EU price support over the next decade as EU farms become more efficient and increase in size. This would allow convergence between east and west within the framework of the CAP. However, his suggestions are unlikely to satisfy some of the CAP's harsher critics. Even within the commission there are differing views over the evolution of agricultural policy in a larger union. Mr Waldegrave called for a 'root and branch' reform of the CAP to make it possible to extend a slimmer version of the current policy to eastern Europe. 'We need to establish the right framework for a CAP which would be appropriate to the needs of an enlarged EU. The pressures are compelling. And the status quo is not an option,' he said. Mr Steichen said that a 'mini CAP' for eastern Europe would not cost much more than Ecu700m. This could be funded by the existing Phare programme, which channels around Ecu200m a year in aid programmes to eastern Europe. It could also be met from money saved on the current Ecu36bn farm budget, which Mr Steichen said will be underspent by around Ecu3.6bn this year. 'If we pay for the whole plan, the EU would have to increase its aid, but I can imagine a joint venture with these countries with a lowering of our support and a raising of theirs,' he said. He implied that cost objections were short-sighted: 'If we want to have peace in the East, it has to cost us something'. Mr Waldegrave agreed that if price support for eastern Europe could be met without additional spending, it might be possible to agree it, but he said it would be extremely difficult to justify any increase in spending in coming years. Mr Waldegrave said there would be extreme pressures for reforming the CAP again over the next five to 10 years. 'It is likely the current MacSharry reforms won't automatically run into the buffers in the next 18 months.' But he said mighty pressures for reform would be building in 1996. Mr Steichen also wants the EU to advise eastern European countries on setting up land banks in order to establish a proper market for farmland as a way of modernising their agriculture industries.</p>

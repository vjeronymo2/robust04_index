			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Bad omens for UN Bosnian relief effort: Troops trying to protect supply routes are finding the going tough THE FOUR Nato countries providing full battalions in the latest deployment of United Nations forces for Bosnian relief must all think they have drawn the short straw. The little skirmish which made a party of British army Land Rovers abandon a route-finding mission some way short of its destination in northern Bosnia on Saturday morning was a foretaste of hazards ahead. It was thought to be the first time in Bosnia-Hercegovina's seven-month -war that UN soldiers had been involved in an exchange of fire. Brig Andrew Cumming, senior UK commander, said yesterday it was 'not entirely unexpected'. Armoured British, French, Canadian and Spanish infantry units all face difficulties - although of different kinds - along the supply routes they are detailed to protect this winter. The UN force of about 6,000 is in addition to 14,000 UN troops already in Croatia and in Sarajevo. The French and Canadians were allotted areas adjacent to ones where they already had peacekeeping battalions in Croatia. For the French, whose 1,360 troops have already moved in with more than 100 armoured vehicles, this means a stranded Moslem pocket in Bosnia's north-west corner. The 'UN protected area' surrounding the enclave on the Croatian side is Serb-controlled territory secured in last year's fighting. On the Bosnian side the main French base at Bihac faces out onto Serb front lines. The Canadians, who will have about 1,100 troops in Bosnia, are destined for the Serb stronghold of Banja Luka. The omens are not good. When the UN chose Sarajevo as its first headquarters in former Yugoslavia (it has since moved it to Zagreb), it used Banja Luka as a forward transport base. The local Serb authorities now say the UN has bills outstanding and have obstructed the initial Canadian deployment. But the trickiest tasks are probably those confronting the British and Spanish, working initially from the Croatian coast. Of all the planned convoy operations, British troops have to cope with the longest lines of communication. With a main base being set up at Vitez, 40 miles northwest of Sarajevo, their main target is the northern town of Tuzla, where the pre-war population of 130,000 has been swollen by 50,000 refugees. Representatives of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) class a further 50,000 there as destitute. The first plan was to get there by a short route from Loznica over the Serbian border, but that made no allowance for having to cross the lines of Serb forces who are unlikely to take kindly to foreign troops providing succour to their enemies. Tuzla now lies in a northward-pointing salient of the remaining block of Moslem- and Croat-controlled Bosnia, which is gradually melting like ice enclosed by a warm hand. The main road up to it from the south is in Serb hands. Cutting off the salient would be an obvious military target for the Serbs in their effort to widen and secure a corridor across northern Bosnia. The Spanish have an equally daunting task protecting the principal road from the coast towards Sarajevo, with the aim of reaching Kiseljak, the small town just west of Sarajevo where the UN is setting up its Bosnia headquarters. The main body of the 740-strong battalion was arriving by sea yesterday, the largest Spanish force sent to a foreign land since the volunteer Blue Division went to fight for Hitler. Like the Canadians, they have had problems setting up. Croatian authorities would not let them go to the obvious location at Ploce, which is reputed to be the country's main entry port for clandestine arms shipments. They have had to join the British in Split instead, an extra drive of 75 miles. More serious is that the road past Mostar comes within Serb artillery range. It is the best route north, essential for the volume of aid that will be needed. According to aid officials lorries could make Sarajevo and back in a day. Held up by Bosnian Croat militia checkpoints and by a treacherous two-hour detour near Sarajevo - the local Moslem commander is refusing to remove mines - it is now a two- to three-day turnaround. Routes are having to be redrawn to take account of Serb advances. Convoys will be at risk not only from Serbs but also from Moslem gunmen. The UNHCR in Split says 770 tonnes of supplies will be required daily for central Bosnia, western Hercegovina and Sarajevo. At present, with too few lorries and too many security problems, it is managing about half.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Isaacson] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg May 29 SAPA -- Self-Defence Units  (SDUs) would be disbanded and their members disarmed, according  to an African National Congress proposal put to SDU  representatives at a meeting in Kathlehong township on the East  Rand on Sunday. ANC regional deputy secretary Obed Bapela said  SDU members between 13 and 18 years old would go back to school.    A special catch-up programme for these youths was being  negotiated with PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]  education authorities, he said. Those between the ages of 19 and  24 should be accepted as police reservists in a neighbourhood  watch. Other members should join the police force.    Mr Bapela said these two proposals were still being  negotiated with regional police authorities. Those who did not  want to go back to school should join what he called the police  academy.    He said SDU members were being debriefed to inform them of  recent political developments.    The disarmament programme, he said, was in line with the  ANC's policy of strict gun control limiting firearm ownership to  one per person. All illegal weapons would have to be taken from  criminals, SDUs and armed hostel residents, Mr Bapela said.    He said he hoped a law on gun control would be passed in the  regional Parliament by September.</p>

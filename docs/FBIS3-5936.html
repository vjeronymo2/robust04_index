Ochirbat to discuss the present situation in the  country and possible crisis in the parliament, but they did not  come to any decision and mutual consent.    But the opposition the Mongolian National Democratic Party  (MNDP) and the Mongolian Social Democratic Party (MSDP) are not  going to abandon their decision to recall their representatives  from the parliament of the country, informs the MONTSAME  correspondent, referring to the official sources.    The opposition has been waiting for the end of the official  visit of President P. Ochirbat to the four countries of Asia to  discuss with him the present situation in the country and the  issues of recalling its representatives from the State Great  Hural. P. Ochirbat has been elected to the post of president  from the bloc of the MNDP and the MSDP. If, in the end, the  opposition recalls its representatives, 70 out of 76 members of  the parliament will represent only one party of the ruling  Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP).    This responsible decision has been made recently by the  opposition, with taking into consideration the present situation  in the country, considering that the opposition can not work in  the parliament later on preserving the party representative.</p>

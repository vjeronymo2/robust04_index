			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ends the year at record high Wall Street US EQUITIES paused for breath on New Year's Eve after six days of strong gains, yet in spite of some profit-taking and computerised program selling, Wall Street managed to end the day and year firmer at a new record high. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.92 at 3,168.83, making an advance of 535 points or 20.3 per cent for the whole of 1991. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 1.95 at 417.09, also a new all-time high, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks joined in the record-making, climbing 6.59 to 586.34. Turnover on the New York Stock Exchange amounted to 248.5m shares, exceptionally heavy for the last day of the year, while advancing issues outnumbered declines by 1,244 to 600. Although the market opened in confident mood, the Dow climbing more than 20 points in the first hour of trading, there were plenty of investors willing to take profits on some of their recent gains, and by midday the main indices were showing modest losses. A round of program selling also contributed to the downturn, but by the end of the session the losses had been clawed back and the market finished slightly firmer on balance. This enabled the Dow to register its fourth record in as many days and brought the curtain down on the best-ever December for US equities. Among individual stocks, SmithKline Beecham moved ahead Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 79 5/8 after the group won approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to market Relafen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used in the treatment of ulcers. On the way down were two big banking issues. Chemical Bank relinquished Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 21 7/8 and Manufacturers Hanover receded Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 24 3/4 after the two groups formally completed their merger and revealed that the new combined holding company would be taking a bigger than envisioned fourth-quarter charge of Dollars 625m to cover the costs of the link-up. Carolco slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 1 7/8 as investors sold the stock after news that the troubled film-making group had offered to buy back all of its 14 per cent senior notes at a discount. Profit-taking took its toll of some of the leading stocks which have enjoyed big gains in the year-end rally, with Philip Morris surrendering Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 79 3/4 in a volume of 2.6m shares, IBM losing Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 89 and Coca-Cola shedding Dollars 1 to Dollars 80 1/4 . On the over-the-counter market, very heavy demand lifted Amgen Dollars 6 3/8 to Dollars 75 3/4 in turnover of almost 6m shares. Canada TORONTO mirrored the Wall Street movements in thin trading, with the market fluctuating as participants worked to square positions ahead of the end of the session and the year. The composite index was finally a net 6.5 firmer at 3,512.4, leaving a rise for 1991 of 255.7 points or 7.8 per cent. Advances led falls by 386 to 224 after a volume of 19.5m shares. The gold sub-group index stood out with a gain of 4.59 per cent. Gold bullion was quoted at USDollars 354.25 an ounce in New York, up Dollars 1.25 from Monday's close.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Handshakes and sambas: Nancy Dunne rides with Ron Brown's Latin American roadshow Ron Brown's eyelids were drooping. After five days of tireless campaigning on behalf of US exports to Latin America, the exuberant US Commerce Secretary was drained of energy. He was seated on his sixth dais of the day on his six-day business mission, when he was seen to nod off for a second or two. The trip offered a snapshot of the US's new, aggressive export-promotion strategy which, under President Bill Clinton, has become a cornerstone of US foreign policy. It also provided an opportunity for Mr Brown to raise the profile of his department and make it more effective. Mr Brown began Thursday in talks with Argentine President Carlos Menem, who was pleased that the US had decided not to bring a trade case or threaten sanctions over Argentina's 'inadequate' patent protection. This was because, according to US officials in an elegant display of straw-grabbing, of 'the accelerated effort of the Menem administration' to obtain passage of measures which would update Argentina's 120-year-old patent laws. Mr Brown, for his part, was pleased with progress on an agreement between the US and Argentina to expand US airline services to the capital Buenos Aires. The two moved to the president's newly restored reception area, a blinding white, gold and mirrored room lit by hundreds of naked light-bulbs. It was here that Mr Menem informed the 22 company chief executive officers on the trade mission, and senior US administration officials: 'We have given this trip high value.' From there, Mr Brown moved to the press room of the president palace, the Casa Rosada, where the pop song True Love was inexplicably being piped in. After a meeting with the Argentine foreign minister, Mr Brown proceeded to a lunch promoting tourism, a round-table on environmental technology, a keynote address to bankers, another press briefing and a meeting with American and Argentine students. 'This is a marathon, an endurance test,' he shouted to his aides as they slowly mounted the steps of their aircraft on the way to the next stop, Santiago. A few minutes later, Mr Brown was meandering around, shaking hands, an ebullient and imposing figure. He wanted to make sure his CEOs were happy. They were there because Latin America is the fastest-growing market for US exports, and they were hoping to line up joint venture partners and to pitch for government contracts. At the start of the trip Mr Brown met them one by one in his aircraft compartment; he later met them as a group to plot strategy throughout the mission. For all the trappings of government power, the inter-action between Mr Brown and the CEOs is what most impressed his hosts. He opens the door to senior government officials in Latin America and brings the concerns of top businessmen to the attention of officials. One company chairman said he would now consider manufacturing in Brazil despite the country's onerous domestic content regulations. These require foreign investors to make some of their products locally, rather than simply selling them. 'A trip like this helps you to refocus on what you're doing,' he said. 'This is still a relatively closed market.' The presence of officials from the US Export-Import Bank, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, both trade finance bodies, indicated that the delegation meant to do serious business - and it did. One of its first actions was the improvement of financing terms for Raytheon corporation's bid to build a multi-billion-dollar radar system for surveillance of the Amazon. The other contestant was France's Alcatel/Thomson. Mr Brown said the Brazilians recognised the 'superiority' of the US technology, but the French could still win with the generous financing package they are offering. Behind all the trappings of power, US officials understand that American clout was not what it was. Since the Latin Americans began to agree free trade pacts with each other, 'Argentina is more interested in Brazil as a market than the US,' a senior US official said. 'They used to sell the industrialised countries raw materials in exchange for manufactures. Now they can sell manufactures to each other. They have diversified their trade; they are less dependent on us.' Mr Brown had two other tasks: to build momentum for the hemispheric summit in Miami in early December, the Summit of the Americas, at which the US might announce its strategy after the completion of the North American Free Trade Association deal, and to stress a shift towards traditional Democratic party liberalism in US policy, which he did most starkly in a speech to Argentine bankers. One consequence of the latter is that the Inter-American Development Bank is raising the amount of funding it allocates to social programmes to 40 per cent of total disbursements. On Thursday, the bank announced a Dollars 170m loan to Argentina to train 200,000 workers in the private sector. The economic resurgence now under way in Latin America is, however, threatened by social and economic inequities. 'Economic growth is not enough if the fruits continue to go to only the top 5 per cent of society,' Mr Brown told the Argentine bankers. The message was clear: if the benefits of liberalisation do not trickle down, the US fears for the stability of the new democracies in Latin America. His reception was warm. If the trip's co-ordinators made one mistake it was to schedule the trade offensive during the World Cup competition. However, in Buenos Aires, when Maradona was eliminated in disgrace from the competition, Argentina's national tragedy passed without mention. It seemed to be business as usual for President Menem and pre-game traffic congestion was as heavy as ever.</p>

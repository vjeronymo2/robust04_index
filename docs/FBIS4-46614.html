			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Viktor Stepanovich </F> Chechevatov, commander, Far East Military District, by Valeriy  Usoltsev, place, date, and occasion not specified, under rubric:  "A Military Leader Has the Floor": "These Will Not Be `Poteshny  Troops'"]    [Text] Far East Military District Commander Colonel  General Viktor Stepanovich Chechevatov is a person of  indisputable authority for the region's Cossacks. They consider  him one of them. And I think now it is understandable why the  Cossack atamans of Far Russia unanimously chose Chechevatov as  their "nakaznoy ataman" [Translator note: name given a Cossack  ataman appointed by Czarist authorities in prerevolutionary  Russia]...    [Usoltsev] Viktor Stepanovich, many political figures  of the most varied calibers and ranks are flirting with the  Cossacks today and trying to get into their good graces, i.e.,  to be in your position--love, esteem, respect... What do you  think? What is moving these politicians toward the Cossacks?    [Chechevatov] Well, you turned out to have a whole  "bouquet" of questions. So from my own experience I am to  analyze the goals of people who, I assume, are simply using the  Cossacks to achieve their own interests and advantages in  politics? My experience will not serve. All my heart and soul is  with the Cossacks. These are the kind of bright people which our  homeland needs today! This is strength. That is why people stick  to them. This is a special spiritual world order of our  excellent ethnic "mix." And to "play" with the Cossacks today,  to "flirt" with them, I believe, is to ruin, deliberately ruin,  the sprouts of our state rebirth. They wish to use them, but for  destructive purposes. And the Cossacks... They are an open  people; they often trust those who lead them not at all where  they should be going, where our Russia herself should be going...    Today so much "dirt" and "garbage" has attached itself to  the  Cossacks, and there are so many "masqueraders" among them...  "Masqueraders" not just outwardly, but also inwardly, defective  in their thoughts...    And it seems to me that there is practically no fight going  on against all this that is false, counterfeit, and superficial  in the Cossack environment. I often say this to Cossacks at  meetings. For this compromises the whole movement and generates  mistrust in the Cossacks among those around them in the best  case, if such an expression is apropos in the given instance,  and generates caustic gibes and open jeers in the worst case.    But I believe that the Cossacks still will not give up their  banners and their military glory to the dirty hands of others.    Recently I returned from an official trip along the Amur and  Ussuri. I spent time in Cossack stanitsas. Traditions are alive,  and traditions are like roots for a tree. There are roots, they  "pump" the earth's strength, allowing everything else to have  knowledge and to exist.    Hereditary Cossacks again are here among us--the Kalmykovs,  Nazarovs, Poluyanovs, Byankins. They know how to teach sense to  Cossack "saplings," how to kindle love for the Motherland in  their hearts, how to develop a sense of Duty, Honor and a  soldier's self-sacrifice for the sake of the land on which they  were born.    And the Cossack stanitsas themselves? It is as if you are in  another world. Take Mogilevka, for example. Wise, strong  Cossacks live and create here. The houses are a feast for the  eyes, always with a good harvest, no despondency, and the people  believe in tomorrow because they are preparing this tomorrow for  themselves, without indulging in vain expectations. You know,  after meeting with such people, you feel an absolutely spiritual  uplift and the world seems brighter...    All in all, it turns out that the district commander has  become sentimental. And as one of Aleksandr Kuprin's main  characters noted, this is contraindicated for us military  people. No? Has the time come to talk about Cossack soldiers?    [Usoltsev] Do you mean establishing Cossack subunits in  the district?    [Chechevatov] You just now used the concept of  "subunit." Some Cossacks and atamans are offended if we use this  word and not "formation," let's say, or "unit" at worst. It is  humiliating, they say. We, they say, are ready to field corps  and armies today. You are not ready, I respond. Why do you begin  to compromise a good thing? And then, what kind of new game in  "gigantomania" is this? Don't make the first steps painfully  wide, you can sprain an ankle. And who needs the lame? Not all  of them understand the jokes and they take offence... As a rule,  the ones arguing about "corps" are those who are not thinking  about the job itself, but about themselves in the job so as to  be in the public eye and be an important figure. In general, of  course, many have appeared today who wish to command "corps" and  be resplendent in a general's shoulderboards, considering that  for some Cossacks, I notice, it is a rather simple matter with  ranks--whatever I like, is okay, I will appropriate it.    By the way, there already has been a discussion about all  this.    My opinion is that the time has come to begin serious work  on  a program for military training of young Cossacks "locally" in  their native stanitsas. For previously how was it? A Cossack  would come to serve after being already sufficiently trained  professionally.    We began to undertake something in this direction. Classes  are held in military affairs in a number of Cossack stanitsas  under the direction of the atamans and with the help of officers  and NCO's discharged to the reserve. The district command  element makes available its training grounds and firing ranges  for these purposes and allocates weapons and ammunition. Many  active-duty officers also work with young Cossacks and prepare  replacements for themselves--as a rule, on days off and on  off-duty time; on personal time, as we say. This already is the  most genuine, selfless devotion. It turns out that despite  everything, genuine officers have not become extinct here.    Today Cossacks living along the border already know where  they are to go in case the situation is exacerbated and a threat  arises for Russia, where to draw weapons, and in what weapon  emplacement to perform the combat mission.    We have begun making it a practice to involve Cossacks in  security of military depots and other Army installations. By the  way, security and defense of Big Ussuri Island even now has been  assigned to Cossacks. A Cossack company has been established  there and young Cossacks are serving worthily.    As district commander, I would like to name the best by  first  and last name. All are "hereditary stanitsa inhabitants":  privates Aleksandr Chernyshov, Konstantin Mamontov, Vladimir  Ivanov, Sergey Petaltsev.    The district command element views Cossacks as a real  military force, as its reliable reserve, and of course we will  not leave them one on one with problems.    [Usoltsev] Cossacks complain of the absence of a  uniform and gear. All this now costs much money. And where to  get horses? Can the district help here?    [Chechevatov] We will help the Cossacks with  uniforms and gear. Consider this matter taken off the agenda.    With respect to horses, they have begun to be raised in  stanitsas which are being revived. In that same Mogilevka. While  he was a sovkhoz director, present Ataman Vladimir Torkhov  founded a horse-breeding farm there, built a gallop-course, and  involved dozens of boys and girls in classes in equestrian  sport. It was from here for the first time in the region, and  probably in the entire former Soviet Union, that young boys  began leaving with their own horses to serve in the Border Guard  Troops. No, any problem can be solved--if, of course, there is a  desire to solve it. If there are people who dream of making  Russia great and bringing up a new generation of her true sons,  reliable defenders of native borders.    These will not be "poteshny troops" [Translator note: refers  to the boy-soldiers of Peter I]. These troops will be the pride  of our Armed Forces.    I believe this.</p>

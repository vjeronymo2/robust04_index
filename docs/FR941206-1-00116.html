It is issued in accordance with Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, which requires agencies to periodically review their significant regulations to determine whether they should be modified or eliminated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule will make a number of changes to the FIRMR. Among the more significant changes, are the following: add, change, or remove FIRMR definitions and acronyms including redefining ``outdated equipment'' to mean FIP equipment over six years old that is no longer in current production; revise provisions pertaining to accessibility by individuals with disabilities to implement the new focus in Pub. L. 102&hyph;569 on information rather than equipment; permit agency heads to grant exceptions to the mandatory use of a Federal Standard (FED&hyph;STD) after notification to GSA; clarify the intent of the FIRMR requirement for agencies to conduct requirements analyses ``commensurate with the size and complexity of the need''; allow agencies to substitute similar documentation prepared in response to programmatic needs for requirements analyses; establish a threshold below which agencies do not have to prepare a requirements analysis or analysis of alternatives; clarify that agencies should only perform an analysis of alternatives for those alternatives most feasible to implement; raise the threshold from $50,000 to $1,000,000 for doing an analysis of alternatives limited to demonstrating that the benefits of the acquisition will outweigh the costs; require agencies that conduct telephone monitoring to use some form of oral notice or a beep tone at the beginning of a call; remove the reporting requirements to GSA for listening-in to or recording telephone conversations and toll-free telephone service; clarify procedures for economical capability and performance validation; revise the scope of obsolescence reviews to include equipment that may be obsolescing; expand the exception from $300,000 to $1,000,000 for award based on lowest offered purchase price; clarify that agencies must submit post delegation information to GSA for specific acquisition delegations; clarify procedures for evaluating outdated and obsolete information technology; and remove an antiquated clause concerning warranty exclusion and limitation of damages. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments are due: February 6, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments may be mailed to GSA/KMR, 18th &amp; F Streets, NW., Room 3224, Washington, DC 20405, Attn: Margaret Truntich, or delivered to that address between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret Truntich, GSA, Office of Information Resources Management Policy, Regulations Analysis Division (KMR), 18th &amp; F Streets, NW., Room 3224, Washington, DC 20405, telephone FTS/Commercial (202) 501&hyph;0837 (v) or (202) 501&hyph;0657 (tdd). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Explanation of changes being made by this issuance are shown below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Sections 201&hyph;1.003(a), 201&hyph;3.000, 201&hyph;3,001(a), 201&hyph;3.101, 201&hyph;3.201(d), 201&hyph;3.3 and the title to part 201&hyph;3 are amended by deleting references to the FIRMR system. The FIRMR system was established to permit agencies to issue regulations that implement or supplement the FIRMR as part of the CODE of Federal Regulations (CFR). GSA has determined that agencies have not issued such regulations in the CFR since the establishment of the FIRMR, and that a FIRMR system is therefore, unnecessary. Removal of this provision does not mean that agencies may not issue internal agency directives or orders to implement or supplement FIRMR provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Section 201&hyph;1.003 paragraph (d) is amended by deleting responsibilities of the Archivist of the United States. It is the intent of the FIRMR to only implement GSA's authorities and responsibilities. Including the Archivist's responsibilities in the FIRMR is, therefore, unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Section 201&hyph;2.001 paragraphs (a) (1) through (6) are removed. The original text was taken from the Paperwork Reduction Act. However, not all provisions were excerpted. This resulted in some confusion. Accordingly, the text is being removed so that agencies will refer to the Paperwork Reduction Act to learn the specific responsibilities of the designated senior official. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Section 201&hyph;2.001 paragraph (b) is amended by removing the last sentence which pertained to agencies not subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. This information is adequately covered in &sect;201&hyph;2.002. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Section 201&hyph;2.002 is amended by changing the sequence of paragraphs (a) through (c). The revised sequence more accurately aligns the responsibilities of the agency designated senior official (DSO). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Section 201&hyph;3 discuss the organization of the FIRMR, how it is supplemented with other guidance issuances, and its relationship to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Section 201&hyph;3.001 is amended to remove unnecessary details which pertain to circumstances giving rise to interim rules. This information is more appropriately discussed in &sect;201&hyph;3.203. Section 201&hyph;3.203 paragraph (c) replaces the term ``termporary change'' with the words ``interim rule'' to standardize terminology pertaining to revising the FIRMR. Also removed for brevity is a redundant sentence that lists the various types of guidance material already described. For consistency, the enumeration of the types of guidance issuances contained in the FIRMR (&sect;201&hyph;3.001(b) (1) through (3)) is changed to small roman numerals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Section 201&hyph;3.001 paragraph (b)(1) is amended to reflect the current availability of the FIRMR on CD&hyph;ROM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway oil costs seen rising steeply OPERATING expenditure for oil companies in Norway is set to rise steeply to NKr53bn (Dollars 7.7bn) in 1998 from a current forecast of NKr40bn this year, or 44 per cent of total industry expenditure, according to a report soon to be issued by Edinburgh-based oil analyst Wood Mackenzie. The increase comes at a time of weak oil prices, declining production from mature fields and increasing pressure on operators from their partners to contain operating expenditure. According to the analyst, average operating costs in Norway are higher than for other North Sea sectors at around Dollars 5.30 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) compared with Dollars 4.50 in the UK and Dollars 3.80 in both the Netherlands and Denmark. WoodMac says the imposition in 1991 of Norway's carbon emissions tax had a significant impact on operating costs and is estimated to have accounted for about 5 per cent of total operating expenditure in 1993, raising about NKr2bn for state coffers. The analyst forecast average operating costs in the short-term to remain at the current level of NKr40 per boe, contained by a steadily rising production profile, rising to NKr46 by the late 1990s, which WoodMac says is a source of concern. 'From the mid-1990s the rising cost of production from declining mature fields will not be compensated for by output from new field developments,' the analyst warned.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES FOR THE NINETIES;  </P> <P> WHO WILL BE THE FACES TO WATCH IN THE PERFORMING ARTS IN THE 1990S? NOTHING'S  FOR CERTAIN, OF COURSE, BUT BASED ON THEIR PREVIOUS WORK, CALENDAR'S CRITICS  AND WRITERS HAVE SELECTED THESE INDIVIDUALS IN THE AREAS OF MUSIC, STAGE AND  DANCE, AND PERFORMANCE:;  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> CLAUDIO ABBADO  </P> <P> Herbert von Karajan may be dead, but the cornerstones of his musical empire are  intact and have fallen into the hands of 56-year-old conductor Claudio Abbado.  </P> <P> The next decade will see if another Generalmusikdirektor for Europe is in the  making.  </P> <P> As something of a dark-horse candidate, Abbado last October succeeded Karajan  as chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic -- only the fifth in the 107-year  history of the orchestra. He was already music director of the Vienna State  Opera, a post once Karajan's and one which Abbado intends to hold  simultaneously with Berlin. He was previously music director of La Scala (as  was Karajan) and chief conductor of the London Symphony (Karajan had led  London's Philharmonia Orchestra).  </P> <P> There the similarities may end. By all accounts, Abbado is a quiet, private  person and patient in rehearsal. He has championed new music and liberal causes  -- a close friend of Italian Communists such as composer Luigi Nono, Abbado has  publicly campaigned against Italian fascists and taken the La Scalaorchestra  out to factories for inexpensive concerts.  </P> <P> It is unlikely that Abbado will -- or would want to -- lead the Berliners and  Viennese down avant-garde paths, but musicians who had spurned association with  Karajan because of his previous Nazi ties -- or whom Karajan had barred -- may  return to the Central European fold.  </P> <P> Although he was the principal guest conductor of the Chicago Symphony for three  years and reportedly had agreed to take over the New York Philharmonic before  he was offered the Berlin position, Abbado is largely known in this country --  particularly on the West Coast -- through recordings. His discography lists  well over 100 recordings, most on Deutsche Grammophon, and most of standard  Germanocentric symphonic fare and Italian opera. John Henken  </P></p>

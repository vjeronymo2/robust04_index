			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze </F> by correspondent Nato Oniani; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Oniani] Good morning, friends. We are offering you  a radio interview with Eduard Shevardnadze, the chairman of the  Georgian State Council and head of state.    Batono [Georgian polite form of address] Eduard, the first  question, of course, refers to your visit to the United States.  In your opinion, how fruitful was it for the Georgian  delegation? I am asking you this because having returned to  Tbilisi, we heard rumors that the delegation had received a bad  reception, and the attitude toward Georgia [words indistinct]  and so on.    [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. The issue  pertaining to gossip and rumors, I think that what you mean as  gossip and evil rumors really exist. I do not think it is  reasonable to keep proving the contrary. Those who closely  watch TV programs and listen to the information we provide our  population with, they do not need proof of whether the reception  was good or bad. Some say that Georgia was well received rather  than Shevardnadze. Some, vice versa. I would maintain that  malice should also have limits. Let us assume that the  delegation received a bad reception. Who should be happy over  this? Why should he be happy?    To speak seriously, this has been a moral and political  success and I would say a victory. This is a success of a  country that has invariably chosen a road of democratic  development. In case Shevardnadze betrayed democracy, [words  indistinct]. True fighters for real democracy, all true  reformers within the space of the former Soviet Union can be  considered real heroes and they are persecuted as [words  indistinct].    As for gossip and malicious rumors and the venom that  certain  newspapers spit out, they will eventually eat themselves up. I  do not pay much attention to them. Therefore, I even pity them  because of their wretchedness and maliciousness. [words  indistinct] This is from the point of view of polemics.    Now, about the success. First of all, this is a result we  gained from a dialogue with the U.S. Administration. We got  support for the issue pertaining to deploying peace-keeping  forces in Abkhazia. Support has been clearly expressed.  Commitments have been voiced in financing this action.    Second, we have the full right to say that we have a legal  basis for relations with this great country. I mean that a  Washington declaration has been signed, an agreement on mutual  [word indistinct] has been signed. Although we cannot feel the  effect of this, all this is extremely important. These are  documents, which open large channels for economic and other  kinds of cooperation between Georgia and the United States.  This is very essential.    Third, I view it as very important that in the course of our  dialogue with the president and his associates, as well as in  the Congress and the Senate, we managed to familiarize leaders  and legislators of this great country with what Georgia is, what  we have, what the Abkhazian problem is, who is right and who is  wrong. This is of essential importance because this conflict has  been viewed with different attitudes at various spheres and  levels. The truth of the issue has been demonstrated. The next  result, I can say that this has been expected. I regard my  meetings with leaders of the World Bank and the International  Monetary Fund as very important. This will not bring immediate  results today but an agreement I brought, the promises that they  agree to support us in case we retain stability and strengthen  it further mean that in future, we will not have to wander from  one country to another in search of kopecks or dollars. All  this will happen on a different basis. The financing of our  programs, the development of certain spheres and so on will be  based on the norms other states have been using. This is also a  significant result.    I regard as very important the result of my meeting with  Ivan  Rybkin, the head of the Russian State Duma, with whom I had an  excellent conversation, and I am now even more sure that we will  overcome all difficulties that still exist after signing all  agreements. [words indistinct] I frankly welcomed the meeting.    The next result -- this may be the most important -- I mean  the meeting of the UN Security Council, where I was given an  opportunity to say what a state leader is supposed to say in  connection with the Abkhazian conflict. Not just because this  is a high podium and one uses this podium, but we want the world  to know the truth, we want the Security Council to know the  truth. I think that Georgia's position was so explicit and so  easy to understand that it was a rather rare case when the  meeting of the Security Council proceeded without confrontation  and the position of the Georgian delegation received unanimous  support and unanimous recognition, especially on issues of the  country's integrity and unity, the immediate return of refugees  and the necessary guarantees for the deployment of peace-  keeping forces. As you were present there you must have noticed  that all speeches were almost unanimous on these three basic  issues and clearly supported Georgia, which has taken a  democratic way of development.    Yet another thing: It seems like an issue of minor  importance now, although it is not of minor importance that we  received very serious material support, financial support.  Incidentally, without request from me, President Clinton  announced of his own accord that the United States of America  was allotting $70 million [to Georgia]. This is humanitarian  aid rather than credit. I have to say that without this aid we  would not have other sources after the EC credit had been  exhausted.    Thus, I do not know whether we could have thought of gaining  more than we did during the three days materially, financially,  politically and morally, including the issue that is of major  concern to us at the moment, the issue of Abkhazia.    [Oniani] Speaking of Abkhazia, you have said, and it was  emphasized in the United Nations too, that such unanimous  support was almost unprecedented for the United Nations. No  remarks were made regarding our side. It was really amazing  that the Russian representative's speech was almost one of the  most constructive ones. In addition to the UN Security  Council's support, the U.S. President's support, and the support  by the U.S. congressmen, we know that no financing of the  peace-keeping operation is possible without Congress' opinion.  You had a meeting in the Pentagon where an opinion was voiced  that the Pentagon would help Georgia. The Secretary of Defense,  Perry himself, said that a U.S. military attache would arrive  [in Georgia], that they would assist us in the formation of a  new army, and this is what we really need in Georgia.    What way do you think will remain if a political settlement  of the Abkhazian issue over which you have spoken so long and  toward which the Georgian policy has been moving cannot be  arranged? Are we capable of resolving this problem in a  different way if we are not left any other way out?    [Shevardnadze] I would answer the question in this way. We  have received very strong support at the UN Security Council.  Before that, when the Russian president was in Georgia, we  talked, signed agreements, and made mutual commitments over the  peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian conflict. Now that all  this has happened in Washington and New York and a platform has  been established for the peaceful settlement, notwithstanding  what the resolution will say, we have to speak about using every  path leading to that major road and act respectively. It can be  said that we would not dream of a better opportunity. Now,  everything will depend on the art of using this opportunity and  our vigor. Much will depend on the complete implementation of  the agreements.    Now, about the Pentagon's attitude. I do not think that the  Pentagon is able to exert a strong influence on our military  potential. We have not asked for this either. It is not  practical to think of, say, getting armaments, getting warlike  stores and so on from them. In this issue we will still depend  on Russia, on the Russian Army. The commitments the Russian  leadership has made -- at least verbally -- should be a  guarantee that the process of the Georgian Army's formation will  be accelerated.    As for the military way [to resolve the Abkhazian problem]  you have asked me, I would give you an answer like this. We  must always be ready to defend the territorial integrity of our  country. No one should have any doubts of our readiness to do  this. When I say that our army is in the process of formation,  I do not mean that it lacks combat abilities today. So, all  branches of our Armed Forces are ready to fight for Georgia's  independence, freedom, and the preservation of its territorial  integrity.    [Oniani] Batono Eduard, before leaving for the United  States you spoke about the danger of a revival of the Cold War.  There, in the United States, I think at the meeting with  American politicians, the Americans asked a question about it.  They were interested in this issue. They recalled your words.  I wonder how your American visit strengthened or, on the  contrary, eliminated this feeling in connection with recent  events in Russia, a feeling that the danger of a return to the  Cold War period could become a reality.    [Shevardnadze] As for the danger of a Cold War, of which you  have just spoken, and there were quite a lot of questions  referring to this issue there [in the U.S.], a danger of  recurrence is real. Confrontation between the United States and  Russia could become the major feeding source of the recurrence  if this were allowed to happen.    I spoke about the inadmissibility of this sort of  confrontation at every level in the United States. This was  during a dialogue with the President and his associates. I  spoke about it at the Congress, at the Senate, at meetings with  political and other figures. The idea was indirectly expressed  in my speech at the Security Council meeting and other speeches  I made in the United States.    The next phenomenon that could push mankind toward Cold War  is a rather widely spread aggressive separatism that grows into  conflicts. You may remember that I spoke about it [words  indistinct]. At that time I had the impression that this pained  some people's ears.    Today, the world has realized that this aggressive  separatism, that cost Georgia so much, may grow into a grave  threat for the whole planet. Yugoslavia is a good example.  This is an explosive triggering device, which is present in a  number of countries. I am afraid that if this is not stopped  and these current conflicts are not settled, the danger of cold  and hot wars will become reality.    I am pleased that conversations in the United States touched  upon this issue and Georgia's opinion, an opinion of its leader  that evoked everyone's interest, not because we were inventors  but because we have been in the middle of events of this kind  and, therefore, we feel this in a more acute way than others,  and see the scale of the threat. But the main thing is to rule  out any serious confrontation between these two countries and  this will be a guarantee for peace.    [Oniani] The situation in Georgia is rather critical today.  [Word indistinct], transport is not working and so on and so on.  You had very interesting meetings at the World Bank, with the  Monetary Fund, OPEC, you have already mentioned. Regarding the  significant and good plans drafted for Georgia, how deep and  lasting do you think our economic crisis will be?    [Shevardnadze] I have to say in this connection that our  economic crisis is additionally [words indistinct]. During  talks with an expert from the World Bank and the executive  secretary, it was emphasized that our country, with its  situation in western Georgia, differs from many other countries  in a critical situation by complexity and difficulties. But, at  the same time, it was said that if we stuck to the course we had  taken toward establishing and strengthening stability,  establishing order in the country, and if we stirred up the  potential we possessed, these immense international  organizations would be ready to help Georgia. If this happens  the length of the crisis will become shorter and chances will  increase to escape from the crisis sooner.    The way out depends on how well we manage our own country.  In the first instance order is essential and at the same time  it is necessary to use all the potential we possess. We have to  harvest tea, to harvest grapes, to harvest fruit, we have to  plow soil, we have to run industry as it can be run. I think  that in such conditions we will be able to come out of the  crisis [word indistinct].    [Oniani] It often happens that your foreign trips are  echoed in Georgia. It may be an explosion, it may be a murder  or something like that. The same happened this time. There  were explosions in the buildings of the Rescue Corps and the  Chamber of Control. How would you comment on these events? I  would not want to say this, but the explosion in the Rescue  Corps building has a flavor of terrorism, while the explosion in  the Chamber of Control looks more like a political act. We  remember that last year you said at parliament that documents  connected with [words indistinct] activities would be sealed and  the Chamber of Control would be starting work on the issue  having collected certain materials.    [Shevardnadze] It seems to me the same way. When we speak  about terrorist acts, some deputies speak at parliament and  throw stones into the state's garden, I mean they blame the  state. They speak of state terrorism. Did the state blow up  the headquarters of the civil defense [the Rescue Corps is  occupying this building]? Or can a man of reason think of  causing an explosion in the Chamber of Control?    Ruling out any interference and influence, I would like to  say the following: We are facing unruly banditry. These are  acts of banditry, acts of subversion. I have to emphasize one  thing. We have had a lot of good words to say to the Ministry  of Security and the Interior Ministry. But now we have to say  that neither the Ministry of Security nor the system of interior  affairs fight against crime as they are expected to.    A system of raiding criminal groups is a very good job and  it  is very efficient. [sentence as heard] But now it is time for  a decisive say from the Ministry of Security, and the whole  system of the ministry has to demonstrate its professional  skills in fighting terrorist acts. It is in the state's  interest, the whole state structure's interest, to have all  criminal cases revealed and have criminals punished. I will  tell you openly that we have to make and we will make the law  enforcement bodies reveal all terrorist cases.    Georgia's authority as a civilized, cultural, and normal  country should be restored. This is the republic's cause. I  can say that this is a national cause, a state cause, and we  must do this.    [Oniani] The final question: A regular working week for  parliament begins tomorrow. Have you introduced any alterations  into your plan of parliamentary activities?    [Shevardnadze] The parliament will apparently be working  according to planned subjects. There are certain ideas but I  would say one thing; during my visit to the United States and  especially when I had meetings with representatives of business  and financial circles and so on, the main questions pertained to  legislature. What laws have the Georgian parliament managed to  pass that would help develop the economy. What fate will  foreign investments have in Georgia. They are interested not in  generalized laws but in details. In this respect our parliament  is lagging behind. It is significantly lagging and it should be  admitted that the chairman [Shevardnadze] and the speaker with  his deputies cannot manage well. Many laws, over 60 laws are  ready and we are not able to pass them.    I should also say that our parliament is not keen on passing  laws. They would rather be active in the political sphere than  economic. This is not a fault. We must be involved in every  sphere. Today however, overcoming the crisis is a major task  and many deputies demand that economic reforms be implemented as  soon as possible. But no reforms will be implemented if  legislative activity is not properly directed. In this respect,  if there is any draft law, then parliament must work on it.  Parliament must work on drafting laws and their soonest  possible implementation. For instance, the law on land. There  were a lot of debates on this law but we could not reach consent  and then we abandoned the law. Now, I am asked to issue a  decree on it. I cannot do this. Land is such a problem, such a  painful and delicate problem [words indistinct].    This sort of alteration, or rather turn in the activities of  the parliament, especially in the economic sphere is a must.    [Oniani] Thank you for the interview. You have been  listening to Eduard Shevardnadze.</p>

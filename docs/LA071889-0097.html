			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRUDENTIAL-BACHE DEAL ON AGAIN FOR THOMSON OFFICES  </P> <P> Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. salvaged a deal Monday that had fallen through  last week by agreeing to acquire the branch offices and customer accounts of  brokerage firm Thomson McKinnon Inc. for about $60 million.  </P> <P> Prudential-Bache, subsidiary of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, announced  Friday that it was terminating its agreement to buy all of Thomson McKinnon  because of balance sheet problems.  </P> <P> Under the agreement announced Monday, Prudential-Bache would acquire Thomson  McKinnon's 154 branch offices, 2,000 brokers and customer accounts.  </P> <P> By adding the retail network to Prudential-Bache's 6,000 brokers and 302  offices worldwide, the company would become Wall Street's fourth-largest firm,  behind Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Dean Witter  Reynolds Inc.  </P> <P> A Prudential-Bache spokeswoman said "there may well be some branches that will  be closed" after the merger is completed, and she noted that there would likely  be some attrition among former Thomson brokers. Prudential-Bache, however, will  spend an additional $60 million over three years for incentives to encourage  the brokers to stay.  </P> <P> In addition, Prudential-Bache said it would acquire about 5% of Thomson  McKinnon Asset Management, a limited partnership that manages the brokerage's  money and investment management business.  </P> <P> Prudential-Bache and Thomson McKinnon announced their intention to merge June  13. But the agreement was canceled after Thomson McKinnon liabilities were  revealed in a "due diligence review."  </P></p>

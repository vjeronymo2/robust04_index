			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / They play it again as time goes by that is how American critic Ms Pauline Kael described Casablanca, and for six days from today London cinema-goers will have the chance to judge for themselves. The black-and-white classic is to be screened at the Empire cinema in Leicester Square, and Turner Entertainment, which bought the MGM film library in 1986, has gone into marketing and public relations overdrive to promote one of its most famous assets. In the UK, United International Pictures has the marketing rights for Casablanca - and certainly one of the best marketing moves is to try to convince the public that they are being offered some kind of exclusively special deal. Thus between today and July 8 only some 35,000 people - four daily shows plus late nighters today and tomorrow in the 1,300-capacity cinema - will be able to see Casablanca at the Empire, paying either Pounds 6.50 or Pounds 8 a seat. Turner is unwilling to say how much it has spent on marketing Casablanca - 'we don't discuss financial figures' - but United is running a thorough advertising campaign on the London Underground. That is just the tip of the iceberg - the public relations promotion of the film has been massive, with a glossy 24-page pack of everything you could possibly want to know about the movie, media interviews and other hype. If, after all that, you still don't make it to the Empire - where ticket staff say 'there are still plenty of seats available' - then you could always pop along to the National Film Theatre and spend Pounds 10.99 on a video version.</p>

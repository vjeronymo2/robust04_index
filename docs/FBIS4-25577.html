			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Qu Yingpu: "Urban Pay Stays Ahead of Inflation"] </F>   [Text] China's non-agricultural employment has shrunk this  year while urban wages have outpaced double-digit inflation.    By the end of April non-farm employment stood at 147.41  million, according to the latest statistics released by the  State Statistics Information and Consultancy Service Centre.    Comparisons with the beginning of this year were not  available, but employment in November stood at 147.716 million  and in October it was 147.533 million.    State industries' employment in April stood at 108.69  million, compared with 108.833 million in November.    Of the workers employed in State industries, 25.63 million  were working under contract, the report said.    Collective enterprises employed 33.69 million people,  compared with 35.524 million in November, while foreign-funded  and private firms had 5.02 million workers, up from 3.36 million  in November.    Meanwhile, the wages paid out in the first four months  totalled 169.14 billion yuan ($19.44 billion), which was 28.1  percent more than the same period last year.    Of that payroll, State industries accounted for 132.38  billion yuan ($15.22 billion), up 28 percent, collective  enterprises paid 28.2 billion yuan ($3.24 billion), up 14.7 per  cent; and foreign- funded and private firms paid 8.56 billion  yuan ($1 billion), up a hefty 111.6 percent.    In another development, April's retail price index -- the  country's most important inflation indicator -- rose 19.5  percent over the same month last year.    At the same time, the cost-of-living index gained 21.7  percent and the price index of agricultural products soared 24  percent.</p>

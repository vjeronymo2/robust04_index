			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Companies healthier than in previous recovery Industrial and commercial companies are considerably more profitable now than at the equivalent stage in the previous recovery, Philip Gawith writes. A study by the Bank of England has found that pre-tax return on capital in the non-North Sea sector was 9.5 per cent in the first quarter of 1994. This is almost double that of the equivalent stage in the previous recovery of 1982-84, and compares to a trough of 6.3 per cent in the first quarter of 1992. The study - by Mr Kieren Wright of the Bank's structural economic analysis division - found that differences in profitability, investment and financial decisions were partly attributed to the relative shallowness of the recession. Retained earnings increased by more than a third last year when companies made net repayments of debt to banks equivalent to 1.8 per cent of gross domestic product. In 1982, the comparable year in the previous cycle, companies made net borrowings of 2.4 per cent of GDP. The study also found companies making increasing use of capital markets for external finance. Gross capital issues by industrial and commercial companies rose 51 per cent to Pounds 23.9bn last year, representing 30.3 per cent of total funding. Dividend payments continued to grow, by 9.3 per cent to Pounds 22.7bn in 1993. Fixed investment has been higher than during 1982-84, but this reflects a higher base rather than investment rising as the recovery has progressed.</p>

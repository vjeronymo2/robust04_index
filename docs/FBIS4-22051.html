			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Osvaldo Navas V.] </F>   [Text] Osorno -- Investigative Police have put under the  jurisdiction of a court four members of a Movement of the  Revolutionary Left (MIR) faction called the National Liberation  Army who are reportedly responsible for, among other crimes, the  murder of retired General Renato Varela Correa.    The police report indicates that one year ago the arrested  people created a criminal terrorist group based on the  military-political concepts sustained by the old MIR. They are  currently in the formative stage, seeking resources for their  infrastructure and recruiting militants, mainly in area  universities.    The arrested, who have been identified as university  students, are Pedro Enrique Rozas Aravena, 29, alias "Comandante  Puren or Sebastian" who is in charge of the group's political  leadership in the southern zone; Marcelo Alejandro Gaete  Mancilla, 22; Eric Ulises Maichin Naipan, 27; and Agustin  Ricardo Pena Aguilera, 28. Subversive literature and hand  weapons were found in their possession.    The crimes committed by the group include: On 30 July 1993,  the group held up the Inglesa foundry plant in Santiago's Maipu  districts, stealing 8 million pesos and shooting the security  manager, retired General Renato Varela, who was director of the  Famae [Army Ordnance] and minister vice president of Corfo  [Production Development Corporation], and who died on 7 August.  The group also held up the Condell finance company in Osorno and  set a bomb in the Christian Democratic Party's headquarters in  Osorno.    The arrested were put under the jurisdiction of the First  Criminal Court of Osorno.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> PARAPET SIGNS LIMITED  </P> <P> The Redevelopment Agency on Monday voted to cut by half the number of skyline  parapet signs recommended by the Planning Commission for the Corporate Pointe  business park on Slauson Avenue near Fox Hills.  </P> <P> Responding to complaints from Culver Crest neighborhood residents who said the  signs would ruin their view, the agency voted 4 to 1 to decrease from 14 to  seven the number of illuminated corporate signs allowed. Each of the seven  buildings that are at least five stories tall will be allowed one parapet sign  that must be turned off at 10 p.m.  </P> <P> Agency member Steven Gourley, who pushed for more restrictive requirements,  voted against the measure.  </P> <P> Robert B. Farrell, vice president of commercial development for Bramalea  California Inc., the project's developer, opposed the reduction in the number  of signs. He said signs are needed to draw tenants to Corporate Pointe and are  vital to its success.  </P> <P> He claimed that cutting the number of signs is a breach of the development  agreement between the agency and Bramalea, which says that restrictions on the  project must be commercially reasonable. Bramalea is considering whether to sue  the agency, he said.  </P></p>

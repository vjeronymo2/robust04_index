			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao] </F>   [Text] The government and National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] are staying put on the question  of whether the Electoral Law should be revised. There are still  differences about this issue. UNITA wants the government  negotiators to make an undertaking that once a peace accord is  signed in Lusaka, the Electoral Law can be reviewed. UNITA does  not want a gentleman's agreement, but one in black and white.    The government negotiating team is facing a difficult  situation because in order to make such an undertaking it has to  have the green light from the National Assembly.    This morning, the government and UNITA delegations met  without the mediator. In the afternoon, the negotiating teams  called Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special representative in Angola  to join them. Sources close to the mediator said this afternoon  that Beye today presented the government and UNITA delegations  with a document that contains points advantageous to the two  sides. The document deals with the Electoral Law.</p>

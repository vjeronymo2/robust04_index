Dr. Nabil Kawkali, a Hebron University researcher, said that  the economic losses cover all productive, consumer, social,  cultural, and tourist sectors. If the military closure  continues for a longer period, the losses will increase. He  added that the labor and commercial sectors have suffered the  most, because transfers of goods between the Palestinian  occupied territories or with Israel have stopped. The  agricultural sector comes next, as the military closure has  compounded the losses of farmers, who have been suffering from  consecutive losses. [passage omitted]</p>

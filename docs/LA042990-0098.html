			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BORDER PROTESTERS SEEK END TO VIOLENCE AGAINST MIGRANTS  </P> <P> Frustrated by a perceived trend toward the militarization of the U.S.-Mexico  border, protesters gathered Saturday at a major undocumented crossing zone in  Tijuana and called for an end to violence against immigrants.  </P> <P> The group, which numbered more than one hundred and included many migrants  waiting along the border, initiated its protest in reaction to the  well-publicized "Light Up the Border Campaign" in San Diego.  </P> <P> The "Light Up the Border" group, which held its sixth protest Friday evening in  San Diego, seeks greater enforcement along the border and has drawn  considerable support.  </P> <P> "We want everyone to know that more lights and border patrol officers will do  nothing to solve the problems of the border area, but will only make things  worse, " said Maria Erana, who helped organize Saturday's protest.  </P> <P> The emergence of the protesting groups underscores the increasing division in  Mexico and the United States about the thorny issue of illegal immigration,  which U.S. officials say is increasing.  </P> <P> Saturday's protest took place along the southern levee of the Tijuana River, in  an area known as El Bordo, or the edge. The area has long been a major illegal  crossing zone, and on Saturday evening, scores of migrants were amassed atop  the concrete levee.  </P> <P> The protesters placed flowers in front of hand-crafted crosses named in honor  of dozens of deceased immigrants -- some shot by U.S. authorities, others  killed by border thieves, and others who perished in accidents en route to the  north.  </P> <P> While condemning alleged abuses by U.S. authorities, the protesters also  criticized what they say is extensive extortion of would-be immigrants by  Mexican authorities, who have long solicited bribes from those attempting to  cross the border.  </P> <P> Saturday's protest was the second by the Tijuana-based community group, which  has criticized the "Light Up the Border Campaign" as racist and anti-immigrant.  </P> <P> Representatives of the "Light Up the Border" group have denied allegations of  racism, contending that their aim is merely to stop illegal immigration and  drug smuggling.  </P> <P> But to the Tijuana protesters, the solutions offered by the "Light Up the  Border" activists are simplistic and shortsighted and will only result in more  violence against migrants. Some protesters Saturday called for an open border,  which would allow free flow between Mexico and the United States.  </P> <P> "All workers have a right to seek jobs across the border," said Carmen Valadez,  one of the leaders of Saturday's protest.  </P></p>

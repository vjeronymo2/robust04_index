			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Arts: Fair trade in Madrid - A healthy British contingent at ARCO THIS YEAR Madrid has unobtrusively taken over the baton from Dublin and is the 1992 European City of Culture. It is a fair choice given the willingness of Madrid, and Spain, to spend big money on the arts, both to raise national prestige and to encourage a creative eye among the people. That is why the public gallery to house Baron Thyssen's picture collection, probably the last great private collection, is nearing completion opposite the Prado rather than the National Gallery in London, and why the International Contemporary Art Fair, ARCO, has established itself, against considerable competition, as one of the world's great contemporary art fairs. ARCO, which has just ended, hides its charms well. The fair has moved to a brand new industrial exhibition centre in the dustlands north of the city and occupies a succession of hangars which would shield a small airforce. Once inside your prejudices disappear. There is undoubted over-kill, with almost 200 galleries showing off art, but the plain white walls and feet-friendly carpet make viewing manageable. The recession, and lobbying by local dealers, cut down the room available for overseas dealers, and almost half the space is consumed by the Spanish trade, but the British contingent seemed happy enough with business. Waddingtons was particularly pleased. It sold works by Flanagan and Sean Scully, as well as by Spanish artists like Tapies (whose work was everywhere) and Barcelo. It even disposed of a sculpture by the Catalan artist Leiro which had lingered in its stock for years. Annely Juda met good demand for Christo and Hamish Fulton, among others, and Flowers East was glad to have finally made the fair, which has a long waiting list of exhibitors. Its abrasive work by Peter Howson was too tough for local taste this year but Angela Flowers expects to do well at ARCO in future. In the meantime she took Pounds 500 on Saturday just selling badges, postcards and catalogues. Jill George was another London dealer finally allowed in. She also was happy with the reaction to her mainly figurative work which she took to stir up the locals with their fondness for minimalist art. A vast wall, 10 feet square, by Ricardo Cinalli, composed of twelve giant faces, certainly stopped the crowds in their tracks. George was hoping for one buyer at around Pounds 25,000 but on the last day she was persuaded to divide it up into four separate pieces, one of which has already sold. Judging by the paucity of red spots ARCO is not so much a fair for selling but for celebrating art. By far the most encouraging feature is the size of the crowds. Over 150,000 made the difficult journey out to the fair during the week and on Saturday it was like a carnival, with the place thronged by young Spaniards taking a serious interest in everything. They are not buyers now but they will be in a decade's time. The quality of art on show was variable, but most of it, unlike at London fairs, was begging to be bought. It had a 'look at me' appeal, especially the displays on the Spanish stands which often had a flashy, bright, heat of the sun directness - and little depth. There was little sculpture, and also a welcome absence of the installations which make London art school shows look like an engineering workshop. With the profusion of conceptualist art on view ARCO held on to its reputation of being the most avant-garde of the contemporary fairs. ARCO finds room for video nuts; for photographers, with the highlight a display of the work of Philip Jones Griffith including harrowing shots from Vietnam; for holography; for philosophers keen to discuss 'the new aesthetic paradigm'; even for lawyers, with a seminar on legal issues. But the biggest crowds were around the stands, especially that occupied by ACA Galleries, which flaunted ARCO's 'contemporary only' rules by displaying paintings by Picasso and Ernst, even a Pissarro landscape. The crush was for the work of John de Andrea, who produces life size polyvinyl models, one of a nude, warts and all, and another of an ethereal dancer. Almost as popular were the technology based creations at Carl Solway, personified by 'Rocket to Virtual Venus' by Nam June Paik in which 36 TV screens spiral upwards within an aluminium framework with a serene small head of Buddha nestling among the hardware. Big names - Miro, Twombley, Ben Nicholson  - jostle with the unknown and the bizarre. There were throngs around everything, although Botero's portrait of Franco, showing the general as just another puffed up tinpot Latin American dictator, attracted few glances. There was greater interest on Marlborough's stand in a large Bacon, the antithesis of Spanish taste, but an object of keen comment. ARCO is certainly bigger than the sum of its parts. This is mainly due to financial priming from the Spanish Government. Not only does it transport over journalists, but it also pays for major collectors to come across. Watching the really rich exploiting their unexpected freebie to the limit was performance art of the highest order.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Khamrayev, Gleb Cherkasov in the </F> "Compatriots" column: "Dmitriy Rogozin Issues an Ultimatum to  the Kazakhstan President. And Advises the CIS Countries to  Agree on Single Citizenship"]    [Text] The Congress of Russian Communities [CRC] has  presented President Nazarbayev with an ultimatum following an  illegal arrest and detention of Boris Suprunyuk, a Russian  Federation citizen who heads the Russian community of the  Northern Caucasus. This was announced at a news conference  yesterday by CRC Executive Committee Chairman Dmitriy Rogozin.    Reproaching the Russian authorities for inaction, Mr.  Rogozin  said that unless Mr. Suprunyuk is set free by 1 June and the  Kazakhstan leadership provides a reasonable explanation about  Mr. Suprunyuk's confinement, the CRC will reserve the right to  use "its own options" to secure the release of the political  prisoner. The ultimatum, by Mr. Rogozin's admission, is a  forced step because the search for other acceptable answers has  led him "into a deadlock" and proved futile. The CRC leader  noted that the Semirechensk Cossacks have already tried rescuing  Suprunyuk with their own forces and that in principle mass  protest action is possible any moment.    Passing from the particular to the general, Mr. Rogozin  described Crimea, Belorussia [Belarus] and Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan]  as former USSR regions most favorable for Russians. In all  other regions, according to Mr. Rogozin, the Russian population  is subjected to indirect or direct discrimination. Sharp  criticism for inaction in protecting the compatriots who have  found themselves abroad against their will was meted out to the  Russian Government, its foreign policy department, and  especially the Nationalities and Regional Policy Ministry,  which, according to Dmitriy Rogozin, has done virtually no work  under Sergey Shakhray.    On the positive side, Mr. Rogozin made several proposals on  CRC behalf. Russian lawmakers were invited as a matter of  urgency to adopt a law on repatriates and also draft and approve  "10 to 15 principles," guided by which, Russia could fulfill its  duty before the Russian people living in the CIS countries. At  this point the Russian communities' leader asked not to confuse  Russians with "Russian speakers" among whose number Messrs.  Nazarbayev and Shevardnadze were included. The Russian  Government was advised to expand contacts with Russian  communities, in particular work toward "most favored regime"  being granted to Russian businessmen in the CIS countries. The  CIS heads of state were urged to adopt a joint pact on dual  citizenship or single citizenship for all CIS countries.</p>

The spokesman for  the association, Yang Zhou, who was also detained, said he had  spent three consecutive nights at police headquarters in  Shanghai and was set free at midday Monday.    "It's become a routine," Yang said by telephone. "They come  to get me in the evening, I take my cigarettes and my tea, I  sleep there and come home again in the morning." "They want to  keep up the pressure, and they're not arresting me to show how  human they are," added Yang, 50, who is a veteran human rights  campaigner and one of nine founders of the Charter for Peace  movement begun last November.    Wang, 39, has also been campaigning for human rights for  many  years, spending three years in prison for his activity during  the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement. The detentions of both men  were part of a massive offensive against dissidents to coincide  with the current session of the National People's Congress,  China's rubber-stamp parliament, and the visit of United States  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, which ended Monday.    Bao Ge, another Shanghai dissident, said Monday police had  instructed him to "keep quiet" during the upcoming visit to  China of Japan's prime minister, Morihiro Hosakawa. He will be  in China March 19 to 21. Xu Liangying, 74, a professor at  China's National Academy of Sciences, said Monday he was still  under heavy surveillance and was not allowed to receive foreign  visitors. Xu and six other intellectuals wrote a letter to the  government last week, asking it to release political prisoners.</p>

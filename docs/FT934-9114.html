			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Deregulation helps farmers and industry ARGENTINA'S industry and farmers emerge as the main beneficiaries of the sweeping deregulation programme the government started four years ago, says a recently-published study, writes John Barham. The report found that the elimination of taxes, fees and red tape has saved the traded goods sector, principally industry and agriculture, some Dollars 495m (Pounds 335). Far from suffering from the elimination of taxes, government revenues should rise slightly, by about Dollars 322m over the next three years, due to increased economic activity. The study, by Mr Eduardo Sguiglia of the Economy Ministry, and Mr Ricardo Delgado, an economic journalist, is the first attempt to quantify the impact of deregulation. Deregulation began with the first emergency measures taken to halt hyperinflation in 1989, shortly after President Carlos Menem took office. The programme took on greater impetus following Mr Domingo Cavallo's appointment as economy minister in January 1991. It is one of the main features of Mr Cavallo's policies, which include privatisation of all state companies, trade liberalisation and tax reform. Mr Cavallo scrapped dozens of rules, regulations and statutory bodies that had grown up over the past 60 years. Excessive bureaucracy was one of the causes of Argentina's economic decline and had led to widespread corruption. Deregulation benefited exporters, struggling with an overvalued fixed exchange rate, with a 3 per cent improvement in competitiveness. Charges at the port of Buenos Aires, once among the most expensive and least efficient in the world, have fallen by up to by one-quarter. Farmers, combatting low commodity prices as well as the exchange rate, saw a 5-8 per cent increase in income. Deregulation is attracting investment to industries such as mining and fishing that were once off-limits to foreign capital. Financial markets boomed as tax and regulatory burdens were removed. Last year, corporate bond issues hit almost Dollars 2bn - about 16 times more than in 1990, before deregulation. The insurance industry grew by half in 1991-92. The authors recognise it is hard to tell exactly how much of this growth is due specifically to deregulation and how much is to wider economic liberalisation. The macroeconomic impact of deregulation measured by the study appears relatively slight, in spite of its big impact on individual sectors. The Dollars 495m transfer to the traded goods sector is equivalent to just 0.2 per cent of gross domestic product. However, Mr Sguiglia says the effects of deregulation are only just beginning to be felt. Experience in other countries indicates it takes about six years to take full effect. The authors warn the deregulation process is still far from complete. Argentina's competition, bankruptcy and consumer protection laws are archaic. Remaining regulatory bodies must be strengthened. Informal oligopolies are successfully resisting competition. The report criticises the often improvised nature of the deregulation plan and poor sequencing. This forced the government to retreat in some cases, such as its attempt to limit the privileges of the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

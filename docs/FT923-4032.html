			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Security training call for Tube LONDON Underground staff should be trained at inspecting suspect packages to curb the number of delays caused by false alarms, according to a report published yesterday. The study suggests that passengers should be made more aware of the need to keep belongings with them. The report was commissioned after an incident in Bethnal Green, east London, 18 months ago in which six Central Line Underground trains were stuck in tunnels when two suspect briefcases were discovered. It was five hours before all 6,000 passengers were evacuated. That incident came at a time of soaring security alerts on London Underground and British Rail. Between 1990 and last year anonymous calls rose from 446 to 1,683, suspect packages from 270 to 1,961 and devices found from five to eight. Mr Brian Appleton, the report's author, paints a generally favourable picture of the work being done by British Rail, British Transport Police and London Underground to reduce the disruption caused by security alerts. He rejects suggestions that the balance of risk involved in bomb threats should be recognised by continuing to run train services in the face of the threats. The report says that the degree of risk can shift wildly from month to month depending on the political environment. The report suggests that the risk to Underground passengers from fires has shrunk to the point where London Underground and the London Fire Brigade should be working to reduce the disruption caused by their reaction to fire reports.

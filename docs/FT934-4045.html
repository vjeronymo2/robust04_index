			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Goldman profit shares top Dollars 5m Partners of Goldman Sachs, the US-based global investment bank, will all receive a minimum profit share of Dollars 5m this year, according to a bank insider. The record profit shares - which are added to each partner's capital account at the firm and can only be withdrawn at retirement - reflect the dramatic leap in Goldman's profitability this year. The Canadian Bond Rating Service estimates that Goldman made Dollars 2.3bn pre-tax profits in the first three quarters of 1993, up from just Dollars 940m in the same period the year before. As a result, even the most junior partner will receive Dollars 5m and those higher up will receive far more. The 161 partners, of which 26 are based in London, can withdraw their capital from the firm over a phased period after they retire or quit. While they remain at the firm, they can receive interest at a fixed rate on their capital. Separately, it emerged that up to 70 Goldman executives working in the London office - including the 26 partners - would receive total remuneration this year in excess of Dollars 1m, making it one of the most generous UK payers. London-based employees below the level of partner were recently told they would receive annual bonuses equal to at least 30 per cent of their basic salary. The big increase in earnings and bonuses at Goldman is the latest evidence that Wall Street's long profit boom shows no sign of slowing. For the past three years, US securities houses and investment banks have earned record profits, thanks primarily to extremely low interest rates in the US and overseas. Like many of its competitors, a significant portion of Goldman's profits have come from its proprietary trading activities, in which the firm uses large amounts of its own capital to bet on the short- and long-term direction of securities, currencies and interest rates. Goldman's need for capital to conduct proprietary trading explains why it cannot allow its partners to withdraw profit shares in cash.</p>

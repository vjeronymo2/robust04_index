			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The Korean people have  effected a new upsurge in socialist construction upholding the  reovolutionary banner of self-reliance.    Workers and other labouring masses in different parts of the  country have registered palpable successes in production and  construction by displaying the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance even under the circumstances where the  imperialists and reactionaries were trying hard to isolate and  stifle Korea.    On the occasion of the April fete, many construction  projects, including the May 18 mine in Songchon, the Undok  garment factory in Pyongsong, the South Pyongan provincial  dental preventive hospital and the Kaechon-Sunchon railway  electrification project, have been completed and put into  operation.    The workers of the Kim Chong-tae general electric locomotive  works manufactured new-type tram cars and subway cars in  February last.    The revolutionary spirit of self-reliance is the traditional  fighting spirit of the Korean people.    The history of the Korean people building a powerful  socialist country of independence, self-sustenance and  self-reliance in defence on this land is a history of brilliant  application of the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance.    In the first six months of 1954, less than one year after  the  ceasefire, the Korean people built and rehabilitated more than  one hundred factories and enterprises, including the Nampo  smelting complex, the Pyongyang textile combine and the Huichon  general machine tool works, and built dwelling houses with a  total floor space of 620,000 square meters in towns and workers'  residential quarters and schools with a total floor space of  300,000 square meters, under the difficult circumstances where  everything was destroyed by the war.    In the latter half of the 50s when the raw and other  materials and funds were in short supply and technical force was  weak the Korean people made by their own efforts such machines  as trucks, tractors, bulldozers and water pumps, and the workers  of Kangson produced 120,000 tons of steel with a blooming mill  with a rated capacity of 60,000 tons.    The machine industrial sector witnessed such an amazing  success as producing more than 13,000 machine tools a year  outside the state plan.    The builders of the Haeju-Hasong (80 kilometers) railway  section completed in only 75 days the gigantic project involving  a 880,000 cubic meters earthwork, the construction of a 5,600  square meters retaining wall, 38 bridges, 19 station buildings,  a railway section and section gangs and dwelling houses for 200  families.    The Korean people who carried out the historical task of  socialist industrialization in a matter of 14 years (1957- 1970)  built many factories and enterprises, including the Sunchon  vinalon complex, the Namhung youth chemical complex and the  Taechon general hydro-power station, and produced such modern  machines as a 10,000 ton press, an extra-large oxygen plant and  numerical control machine tools in the 70s and 80s, too, by  their own efforts by displaying the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance.    More than 11,000 projects were completed in the industrial  sector during the 3rd seven-year plan (1987-1993).    Korea now has a solid independent national economy not  affected by any economic fluctuation.</p>

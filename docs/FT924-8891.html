			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Spectre of water privatisation haunts Lang IN THE next few weeks Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, will have to reveal his thinking on what has become the most controversial issue facing him since the general election - the possible privatisation of Scottish water. In July Mr Lang said the government was looking at 'alternative ways' of organising water and sewerage services, including 'ways in which the private sector might contribute enterprise and investment'. The following month he appointed Quayle Munro, the small Edinburgh merchant bank, to advise on the options. Although Mr Lang did not use the terms 'privatisation' or 'sell-off', the very mention of the words 'private sector' immediately led to accusations that the Scottish Office was proposing to privatise Scotland's water and sewerage services, which are operated by the regional and island councils. Opposition parties have had a field day since Mr Lang's announcement. Lord Ewing, formerly Mr Harry Ewing, Labour MP for Falkirk East, said privatisation might mean that the water added to a dram of whisky could cost as much as the whisky itself. Church ministers, he said, would have to conduct mass baptisms of babies to save water bills. The Scottish National party newspaper quoted an unnamed professor as saying privatisation could lead to the first outbreaks of cholera in Scotland for 160 years. Anxieties have even been voiced by prominent Conservative councillors, while a System Three opinion poll early in September showed only 4 per cent in favour of water services being privatised. Only 9 per cent of Tory supporters polled favoured privatisation. Mr Lang says water and sewerage in Scotland will have to be restructured for two reasons. First, local government is to be reorganised with the introduction by 1996 of a single-tier system to replace the nine regional councils, 53 district councils and three single-tier island councils. Mr Lang has suggested that between 15 and 51 new authorities would be set up. Second, very heavy expenditure will be needed over the next 10 to 15 years to comply with EC directives on drinking water, sewerage and beaches. Meeting those requirements will cost Pounds 2.5bn in Scotland, and maintenance, upgrading and improving unsatisfactory sewage discharges could cost a further Pounds 2.5bn. Local authorities are already investing Pounds 703m over the three years to 1994-95. Given the spending required, says Mr Lang, it is only sensible to see how the private sector could provide capital, and thus avoid swelling the public sector borrowing requirement. But he must be aware that he has stepped into a hornet's nest. Scots believe that the water which rains down from their skies and creates Scotland's lochs is a gift from God. Furthermore they are mostly unaware that they pay for it to be supplied to their homes as the water charge is incorporated in their poll tax payments. Privatisation is in any case regarded with suspicion in Scotland, and most Scots are aware that the flotation of the 10 water companies in England and Wales has been followed by much higher water bills - the average annual water charge in England and Wales is Pounds 169 compared with Pounds 108 in Scotland. Furthermore at least 22,000 households south of the border have had their water disconnected for not paying their bills, and many directors of the new water companies have had vast salary increases. In Scotland, Lord Ewing points out, it was the installation of water and sewerage services that led to the creation of the first municipal councils in the mid 19th century. 'Ever since those days no local authority could disconnect water supplies to collect a debt - even with poll tax debts.' It is hard for the government to defend its position because its water policy has yet to be decided. Quayle Munro, which advised the Scottish Office on privatising the Scottish Bus Group, recently delivered its report and a consultation document is being prepared. One option is likely to be the creation of around three water companies for different areas to run water and sewerage and to finance investment. These could be floated on the Stock Exchange, and a quango equivalent to England's National Rivers Authority could be formed. Another option would be to keep ownership of water services under council control, albeit with restructuring because of the reorganisation of local government. The operation of water services could be franchised to private companies which would finance investment. Another possibility would be to allow businesses such as construction companies to finance and build new installations, and charge fees to the public-sector water authorities for their use. Mr Henry McLeish, a Labour frontbench spokesman on Scotland, argues that water is a natural monopoly which ought to be left in the hands of local authorities. 'We don't dispute the need for Pounds 5bn investment over 10 to 15 years,' he says. 'We accept that water charges will have to rise to help pay for it. But we don't want the higher charges to swell the profits of private companies. The Treasury should allow the councils to borrow the extra money needed.' For Mr Lang the problem is that if he rejects privatisation outright it will look like capitulation to the opposition, even though he did not propose a sell-off in the first place.</p>

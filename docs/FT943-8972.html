			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Baby boomers and the counter-culture: A Grateful Dead concert took Barry D Wood's thoughts back to Woodstock. He asks why the optimism vanished Glenn and Ira Goldfarb were not yet five when I attended my first Grateful Dead concert in Berkeley 24 years ago. Typical of new generation Dead-heads, the Goldfarb brothers go to several of the band's concerts each year. Months ago they identified two nights in Washington as the time to escape from wives and children and commune with a past they have romanticised but never experienced. The brothers ordered concert tickets. When we met, Glenn and Ira were already in the de rigueur brightly coloured tie-dyed T-shirts that hark back to psychedelic Haight Ashbury, where the Grateful Dead were already a legend by the late 1960s. Few would have guessed the Glenn is a chef and Ira a tax accountant. On a hot summer night, Jerry Garcia, Grateful Dead vocalist, guitarist and song writer, wore purple shorts and T-shirt. He arrived back stage in a golf cart, overweight, tired and looking older than his 51 years. His frizzy hair is white. There were deep creases behind his dark glasses, a legacy of too much hard living. The band began to play. Any lingering reservations about whether I wanted to be there disappeared. The tilting country rock melodies invited movement and response. When Garcia sang cheers welled up from the crowd of 60,000. 'Come hear Uncle John's band, down by the river side, he's come to take his children home.' The voice still projects the sweet, mournful high notes. It was like the old days and remained so for two hours through a gentle rain willingly endured by the young and not so young alike. Pipes were passed. The pungent aroma of marijuana was pervasive. People swayed to the music. Beautiful girls with long hair and flowing skirts danced in the stadium corridors and sidelines just as their mothers may have done. I realised that I am like the Goldfarbs, reaching out to connect with something authentic that has been lost. Garcia called the Grateful Dead performance at the original Woodstock in 1969 miserable. That is one reason these Bohemian troubadours were not invited back for the 25th anniversary extravaganza Woodstock 94: 'Two More Days of Peace and Music.' But they would not have gone anyway. 'You can't put lightning in a bottle twice,' said Dennis McNally, a PhD in American history and long-time Grateful Dead publicist. The year 1969 stands out for two reasons: the landing on the moon and Woodstock. The vision, ingenuity and tenacity that culminated in Apollo 11 have turned into indifference and cynicism towards space exploration. Moonwalker Buzz Aldrin said on the 25th anniversary that 'an eerie apathy now seems to inflict the very generation who witnessed and were inspired by' the moon landing. But 'for one crowning moment,' said Aldrin, 'we were creatures of the cosmic ocean, a moment that 1,000 years hence may be seen as the signature of our century.' They are words that might have been uttered at Woodstock. It was billed the Woodstock Art and Music Festival. The promoters optimistically dreamt that 200,000 might attend. Twice that many appeared. Woodstock became a defining moment, a generational conclave of music lovers, hippies and war protesters. Few paid the Dollars 18 price of admission. Now, 25 years later, the successors of the people Joni Mitchell called the 'children of God', have paid Dollars 135 (Pounds 87) to attend the bigger of two planned rival Woodstock anniversary concerts. The smaller event was cancelled earlier this month after poor ticket sales. At the remaining event, the one that may have cost Dollars 100m, there is an inter-active video theme park. Tickets were delivered by overnight express to prevent counterfeiting. The event had big-company sponsors. There are licensed T-shirts and logos. The music is available on pay-per-view cable television. The cancelled event, which would have been held 50 miles away in Bethel, New York, had attracted fewer of the original performers, would have cost only Dollars 95, and was to have taken place on the authentic sacred ground. What used to be called the counter-culture has triumphed. Baby boomers live in the White House. And yet the problems that that brash, over-confident youth hoped to overcome have become more intractable and pervasive. Only on the environment is there discernible progress. Smokers and polluters are on the defensive. The concept that planet earth is something to be protected is standard liturgy for school children everywhere. While America is no longer polarised by Vietnam, civil rights, or capitalism, the social contract is more frayed than ever. The optimism, joy and vision of 1969 have vanished. The American radicals of the late 1960s looked to rock music for salvation. It was as if Grace Slick and street-fighting Mick Jagger would lead an assault on the capital. These implausible heroes are as embarrassing from the perspective of 1994 as Che Guevara or Ho Chi Minh. The Grateful Dead survive and prosper 25 years later at least in part because they resisted the temptation to be more than a band.</p>

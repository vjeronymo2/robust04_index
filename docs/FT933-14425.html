			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch posts 53% rise to Dollars 345m at halfway THE BIG Wall Street securities house Merrill Lynch yesterday announced a 53 per cent jump in second-quarter profits to a record Dollars 345m, on total revenues of Dollars 3.97bn. The strong second quarter took the firm's six-month earnings total to Dollars 687m, well ahead of the Dollars 443.7m reported in the first half of 1992. Over the past two years Wall Street has enjoyed an unprecedented boom in stockbroking and investment banking business because of low US interest rates and heavy demand from investors for stocks and bonds. The firm is the largest retail broker in the US, and in the second quarter its commission revenues (including commissions from the sale of mutual funds) totalled Dollars 666m, up from Dollars 568.8m in the same period a year ago. Merrill also leads Wall Street in stock and bond underwriting with an 18.4 per cent share of the domestic market, and earnings from investment banking climbed 4 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 414m, due primarily to higher revenues from corporate debt underwritings. As one the country's largest asset managers, with Dollars 148bn of client assets under fee-based management and more than Dollars 500bn in total client assets in the firm's custody, Merrill earned Dollars 240m in asset management and custodial fees, up 11 per cent from a year earlier. Its largest source of income, however, remained principal transactions - the trading the firm does for its clients and its own account - which brought in Dollars 734m in the quarter, up 33 per cent on 1992 thanks to strong revenues from the trading of corporate equities, swaps and derivatives, corporate bonds and currencies. The final component of earnings, net interest and dividend income, rose 20 per cent to Dollars 279m, due partly to higher levels of interest-earning assets and favourable interest rate spreads. On the cost side, Merrill's non-interest expenses climbed 13 per cent to Dollars 1.97bn following an 18 per cent jump to Dollars 1.28bn in compensation and benefits payments, which are tied to the firm's profitability. Although the news of strong second-quarter earnings provided an initial lift to Merrill's stock, when the share price reached a new 52-week high of Dollars 86 1/8 mid-morning, investors began to sell and take profits, so by the close the stock was quoted at Dollars 84 5/8, down Dollars 1.</p>

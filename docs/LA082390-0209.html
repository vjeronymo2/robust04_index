			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> BROWN'S SENTENCING SET BACK TO SEPT. 17  </P> <P> The sentencing of convicted murderer David Brown, who faces life in prison for  orchestrating his wife's 1985 killing, was postponed Wednesday following a  death in the family of one of the lawyers in the case. The court date was  rescheduled for Sept. 17.  </P> <P> The delay gives the 37-year-old Brown additional time to work with a sentencing  specialist whom he has apparently hired in an attempt to dissuade Judge Donald  A. McCartin from sending him to prison for life without the possibility of  parole.  </P> <P> "I'm really curious to hear what (the sentencing specialist) is going to say,"  said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey Robinson.  </P> <P> In order to give Brown any lesser sentence -- such as life with the chance for  parole -- McCartin would have to reject the jury's finding that Brown had his  wife Linda killed in part for financial gain, according to prosecutors' reading  of the law.  </P> <P> The former computer businessman collected $835,000 on his wife's life insurance  while his teen-aged daughter -- whom he persuaded to commit the murder -- sat  in prison for nearly four years before implicating her father in the plot.  Brown was convicted in June.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chandan Mitra] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, 8 Jan. -- External Affairs Ministry  officials are surprised rather than disturbed over the US-Pak  joint military exercises for high altitude warfare training.  The five-week-long programme involving crack commandos of the  U.S. Army has just begun near Peshawar.    "It is ironic that the U.S. is participating in this high  altitude warfare training programme, which can only help the  Pakistani Army gain more experience regarding the ongoing  conflict over Siachen," a South Block source said. The irony is  that the U.S. had quite recently urged India and Pakistan to end  their stand off, offering even to underwrite a mutual withdrawal  from the glacier.    It is learnt that the Clinton Administration had been  pressing India to withdraw its forces from Siachen and come to  an agreement with Pakistan. This was part of Washington's move  to promote "confidence building measures" between the two  countries.    Sources here revealed that the U.S. had gone so far as to  say  that it would provide the "necessary underpinnings" for  de-escalation of the stand-off in Siachen. In plain terms, this  meant that Washington was prepared to even monitor compliance to  any agreement between New Delhi and Islamabad.    But any monitoring of the demilitarisation of Siachen by the  U.S. would have involved the presence of foreign military  personnel in Kashmir. This was not something India was prepared  to accept. Interestingly Pakistan, too, is believed to have  rejected the U.S. plan, making it clear that the problem would  have to be resolved bilaterally.    MEA [Ministry of External Affairs] sources revealed that  contrary to media reports, the Siachen dispute came up for  discussion when India's Foreign Secretary Mr J.N. Dixit, met his  Pakistani counterpart, Mr Shahryar Khan, in Islamabad earlier  this month. It has been agreed that discussions would continue  for the resolution of the problem, but both countries are  against foreign intervention.    Indian officials say that although Kashmir itself is  probably  not high on Washington's diplomatic agenda worldwide, a series  of statements and actions emanating from the U.S. Capital  indicate that President Clinton has adopted a more activist  posture with regard to South and Central Asia.    This has caused concern in the neighbourhood, which is clear  from the recent Chinese statement opposing a "third option"  (that is, independence) for Kashmir. Clearly, Beijing feels  that the U.S. has some interest in floating the "third option"  idea.    There is also considerable bewilderment here regarding the  reasons for the U.S. Army to train itself for high altitude  warfare. Indian officials are of the view that while the Central  Asia angle cannot be ruled out, Americans would be foolhardy to  even contemplate a military role, now or in the future, in this  region.    At the same time, American intelligence agencies are learnt  to be deeply involved in the Central Asia region, comprising  former Soviet Republics. In a real life enactment of a John Le  Carre type scenario, a former chief of the KGB in Afghanistan  was murdered in mysterious circumstances recently.    Close on its heels, a CIA operative in Ukraine was shot dead  allegedly by a drunken guard. Later it was discovered that the  CIA man had been neatly shot through his neck at point blank  range, which ruled out the "drunken guard" explanation.    Experts here say that despite the end of Cold War, the U.S.  and Russia are currently engaged in a tussle for control over  the Central Asian region. Russia's strategy is to ensure that  any future military conflict, or even civil strife on its  peripheries does not spill over into the Russian mainland. To  achieve this aim, it wants to exercise some degree of control,  through military presence is necessary, over its former  republics. The CIS system has been designed precisely for this  purpose.    The Americans, on the other hand, want to undermine Russian  influence, first over the East European States and then on  Central Asia. As part of this strategy, Washington is trying to  rope in the East European States under the NATO umbrella. This  has been strongly opposed by the Russians who fear that Western  forces would be on their doorsteps if the NATO expansion plan  succeeds.    Thus, the mounting American interest in Kashmir needs to be  viewed in the larger global perspective, analysts in Delhi feel.  The increasingly interventionist posture of the U.S., however,  is putting immense pressure on India which is keen to resolve  its problems with Pakistan through bilateral discussion.    "We understand each other's compulsions. For example, we  realise that Ms. Benazir Bhutto has certain domestic reasons for  her current belligerence. The Pakistanis, in turn, know that no  Indian Government can possibly negotiate the status of Kashmir.  It is, therefore, in our mutual interest to de-escalate  conflict situations, so that no third party can seek to  intervene," an official explained.    MEA officials also say that the recent Foreign  Secretary-level talks in Islamabad have not been as much of a  failure as initial reports suggested. They point to a statement  by the Pakistan President, Mr. Farooq Leghari, in Karachi this  week which commended the resumption of the dialogue and stressed  that this must continue.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / The Braer Disaster: Conventions may restrict amount of clean-up funds FUNDS to meet the cost of cleaning up the oil spill from the Braer, and for compensating Shetland islanders, are likely to be limited to Dollars 83m (Pounds 54.60m) under two international conventions to which the UK is a signatory. Mr Jean Gaulin, chief executive of Ultramar, the north American oil company that chartered the tanker, said insurance cover up to a maximum of Dollars 700m was available. In order to win awards of more than Dollars 83m, claimants will need to prove gross negligence - breaching the terms of the conventions limiting the owners' liability. Civil liability for oil pollution damage is governed by a 1969 international convention and another in 1971 which set up a compensation fund. Under the first convention, tanker owners are strictly liable for oil pollution limited to 133 special drawing rights per tonne of oil carried, up to a maximum of 14m SDRs. Shipping lawyers said yesterday that in the Braer's case the liability of the owners would be just over Dollars 8m, much less than the estimate of Dollars 17m offered by marine insurers on Tuesday. Skuld, the Norwegian protection and indemnity club that covers the Braer's liability risks, would pay the first Dollars 2m, with the international group of P&amp;I clubs paying the remainder through a mutual reinsurance arrangement. That would leave just over Dollars 74m to come out of the London-based international fund for compensation to meet the remaining costs of the clean-up and any claims for damages. The fund was set up by the oil industry to supplement compensation available under the the 1969 convention up to a maximum of 60m SDRs (Dollars 80m). It is financed by levies on oil companies. Yesterday Mr Mans Jacobsson, executive director of the compensation fund, said he believed the fund would be sufficient to cover all claims. Insurance cover for pollution clean-up and some other related pollution costs is carried over and above the convention limits. The international group of P&amp;I clubs has a reinsurance policy placed mainly with Lloyd's syndicates and London market companies by Miller Insurance Group, the brokers. The policy provides cover up to Dollars 500m, with an additional policy taking cover up to a limit of Dollars 700m. For claimants to tap that extra source of funds, they would have to show that the owners were directly to blame for the spillage or that they had some knowledge of a defect in the tanker that was likely to result in pollution. Lawyers likened that to wilful misconduct by the owners and said it was extremely difficult to establish.</p>

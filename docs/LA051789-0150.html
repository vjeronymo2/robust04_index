			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LUJAN DELAYS SALE OF ALASKAN OIL-GAS LEASE  </P> <P> Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. today ordered the postponement of an oil  and gas lease sale in the Gulf of Alaska and the Cook Inlet, pending further  study of the damage caused by the spill of the tanker Exxon Valdez.  </P> <P> Lujan, scheduled to make the announcement in San Francisco, said in a prepared  text that because the proposed sale "is near an area directly affected by the  spill in Prince William Sound, I have asked the Minerals Management Service to  delay preparation of an environmental impact statement until more is known  about the impact of the spill."  </P> <P> The environmental study was originally scheduled for completion in September of  this year, with the leasing sale scheduled for August, 1990.  </P> <P> The proposed drilling area, known as Lease Sale 114, encompasses about 16.7  million acres located between 3 and 400 miles offshore in the Gulf of Alaska  and between 3 and 38 miles offshore in Cook Inlet.  </P> <P> Minerals Management Service spokesman Thomas C. DeRocco said that if Lujan  decides next year to proceed with issuance of the environmental impact  statement, the issue will first be reopened for public comment.  </P> <P> Lujan's statement said, "In particular, we will be working closely with the  governor and local communities to ensure that new issues arising from changed  circumstances in the region are identified before we proceed."  </P></p>

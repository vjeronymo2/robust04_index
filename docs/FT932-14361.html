			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (18): A natural market - Hubs / Iberia's Links Iberia, Spain's national carrier, has betted strongly on what it likes to call its natural market. During the 1990s it intends to make the airline synonymous with travel to and within Latin America. Iberia is traditionally the most frequent European flier to Latin America and it has stolen a march on its European rivals by establishing a hub in Miami that distributes passengers arriving on the daily flight from Madrid to seven destinations in Central America. In Buenos Aires and Caracas Iberia has created distribution services to the southern cone and to the Andean countries respectively. These hubs are being built on the back of an ambitious attempt to establish associations with as many Latin American airlines as fit in with Iberia's growth strategy for the continent. Iberia currently has management control of Aerolineas Argentinas, in which it has a 30 per cent stake, and of Venezuela's Viasa where it now owns 45 per cent of the equity. The airline also has a 35 per cent stake in Ladeco, the Chilean airline; is negotiating the purchase of the Dominican Republic's Dominicana de Aviacion to boost its Caribbean presence; and has explored potential acquisitions in the Andes, specifically in Bolivia. A measure of Iberia's designs on the Latin American continent is provided by its recent creation of a subsidiary in Argentina called Inter Austral to provide a commuter service linking the cities of Salta, Mendoza and Cordoba as well as Buenos Aires. The airline believes that it is worth exploiting the large-scale cutbacks that are being implemented in Argentina's railway system. Already Iberia is working on plans for a corporate image that will bind its Latin American offshoots together. The individual airlines that are now associated to the Spanish carrier are proud of their identities and wary about losing them. In Madrid, Iberia executives say the image is necessary in order to foster client recognition but that it will be introduced gradually. At present the general framework of Iberia's Latin American operation consists of transporting passengers from Europe and then quickly spreading those that are in transit to further destinations around the continent. From Miami they are flown on a daily basis to Cancun, Mexico, for example; from Caracas to La Paz in Bolivia and from Buenos Aires to Santiago de Chile or to Asuncion, Paraguay. From such Central and South American locations, travellers are pooled together in the three hubs for the transatlantic flight. Iberia refers to its base at Madrid Barajas airport as Latin America's gateway to Europe; Spain is the continent's main European destination, followed by Italy, France and the UK. Iberia's ultimate aim, however, is to gain a substantial quota of the lucrative Latin America traffic to the US. Other European airlines approach North America across the Atlantic; Iberia, as it sets down roots in its 'natural market', has chosen to enter it primarily from Central and South America. The Spanish company has few rivals in its transatlantic routes to Latin America but its attempt to capture a significant stake of the North-South market brings it into direct competition with the US carriers, notably with American Airlines. Continuing disputes with American Airlines over reservations and the possibility of a developing price war illustrate the extent of the competition. The Miami hub is the key to Iberia's North American ambitions. Under a 1991 agreement with the Department of Transportation, Iberia is entitled to fly on from Miami - with US pilots and with US-registered aircraft - to 18 US destinations. In return for Iberia's Miami facilities, the Spanish authorities have awarded Delta, United and Continental, as well as American Airlines, transatlantic routes to Spain. Iberia has effectively given away a big share of its North Atlantic traffic - it is likely to maintain links only to New York, relinquishing Chicago and Los Angeles - in order to build up the North-South trade in America and the Miami hub. So far, Iberia has put a pilot scheme into operation that is based on an agreement with Carnival, the US luxury pleasure cruise conglomerate which is based in Miami. The Spanish carrier has hired two aircraft from Carnival airlines which it has decked out in Iberia colours and with which it flies both its own passengers and the pleasure cruise clients from Miami to Chicago, New York, Houston, New Orleans and Los Angeles. This is the embryo of what Iberia's Miami hub should become. With a further 13 US destinations available to it, the airline seeks to establish a secure niche as a primarily Latino carrier distributing passengers across the US. American Airlines does not like the prospect one bit. It is at present filing against Iberia which it claims is monopolising computerised reservation and information systems in Spain. Iberia, which has in the past made similar accusations about American Airlines, says the suit is a disguised attempt to force the transportation authorities to reduce or even withdraw the operational permits it enjoys in Miami. The Spanish carrier had these facilities confirmed last year when the transportation authorities disregarded a set of allegations by American Airlines that were not unlike the present ones. Iberia can expect a lot more acrimony in the future from US rivals. This will be in direct proportion to its success in building up its Latin American presence. The Spanish carrier has nevertheless chosen the market that it wants to operate and it is unlikely to be deterred from it.</p>

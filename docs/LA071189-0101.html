			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECURITY GUARD HELD IN POLICE-IMPOSTOR INCIDENTS  </P> <P> A security guard suspected of posing as a police officer in order to rob or  assault at least seven lone female drivers along or near the Pomona Freeway was  arrested Monday, 12 hours after the most recent incident, authorities said.  </P> <P> David MacGregor, 18, who worked as a security guard in the City of Industry,  was arrested for investigation of robbery, attempted rape, assault with a  deadly weapon and assault with a caustic chemical, Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Sgt. Terry Judge said.  </P> <P> Detectives began an investigation of MacGregor on Sunday and arrested him  shortly before 6 p.m. after a brief surveillance, Judge said. He declined to  provide any details of evidence developed against the suspect, who was being  held at the sheriff's Walnut substation in lieu of $100,000 bail.  </P> <P> A woman motorist driving alone near the Pomona Freeway escaped unhurt after she  was pulled over early Monday by a man investigators believe was MacGregor  posing as a police officer, bringing to seven the number of similar incidents  reported recently in the eastern San Gabriel Valley and Pico Rivera,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Six of the incidents occurred in the last two days, with the earliest known  episode in the string of attacks taking place July 1, sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> The most recent incident occurred in Pico Rivera about 4:45 a.m. Monday,  capping a weekend in which an impostor either robbed, battered or attempted to  sexually assault five other women motorists.  </P> <P> In the latest incident, as in the others, the assailant wore a security  guard-type uniform and used a white spotlight to stop a 33-year-old woman  driving on the San Gabriel River Parkway near Rose Hills Memorial Park. He  fled, however, when she questioned him about his car, which has been described  as a dark, possibly rust-colored, Pinto or Nissan.  </P> <P> On Monday, deputies reported an assault on July 1 that they believe is  connected to the string of other attacks. In that case, a 22-year-old Hacienda  Heights woman was pulled over in Pico Rivera and was punched in the face by a  man wearing what appeared to be a police uniform.  </P> <P> Police said the assailant in all the incidents was dressed in a dark uniform,  with a dark cap and a jacket with a badge-like emblem.  </P> <P> The weekend incidents occurred near the Pomona Freeway in Hacienda Heights,  Rowland Heights and West Covina. The assailant attempted to rape two of the  women and pushed one of them down a 30-foot embankment. But he fled when the  women fought back. Another woman was robbed at knifepoint of $100.  </P> <P> The impostor aimed tear gas spray at another of the women. In addition, another  victim was struck four times in the face with a flashlight.  </P></p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Names win in court as Lloyd's unveils fall in capacity Hard-hit Lloyd's of London members notched up another court victory yesterday - theoretically worth Pounds 80m - as the insurance market unveiled figures showing still more Names ceasing active participation and a fall in underwriting capacity. The High Court ruling on damages for Names on the Gooda Walker syndicate 387, which reported some of the biggest losses in Lloyd's history, coincided with figures showing the market's underwriting capacity will fall to Pounds 10.2bn in 1995 compared with Pounds 10.9bn this year. The number of Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the insurance market - actively underwriting will fall by about 15 per cent to 14,804, the biggest percentage fall for three years. However, Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, said this was in line with the market's requirements. 'Lloyd's underwriters are still being selective in the business that they write. Present market conditions indicate that there are good opportunities for underwriting profitable business in 1995,' he said. Much of the shortfall in capacity resulting from Names seeking to resign has been made up by new corporate capital, which will account for about 23 per cent of capacity next year, compared with 15 per cent in 1994. New corporate investors raised Pounds 331m for investing in 1995, largely in 'dedicated' companies which invest in only a few syndicates and are regarded as embryonic insurance companies. Lloyd's leaders hope corporate capital will provide a long-term source of capacity, and forecast that the number of traditional Names may fall to a few thousand over the next few years. But fears about outstanding liabilities and litigation, which may make it hard for the market to pass regulators' solvency tests, has put off many investors this year. Many Names are expected to convert from trading on the basis of unlimited liability to limited liability, though only four have done this in time for 1995. Another 19 people are entering as traditional Lloyd's Names. The Gooda Walker 387 judgment puts the approximately 300 Names who brought the case at the head of the queue of those seeking to tap the pool of 'errors and omissions' insurance cover available for negligence awards. Separately, the Court of Appeal yesterday overturned an earlier court decision which had barred about 1,000 Names suing for losses incurred on Merrett insurance syndicates because they did not lodge the claim in time.

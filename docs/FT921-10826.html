			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: King move to defuse Trident issue - Defence IN AN effort to deflect criticism that it is dragging its feet over nuclear weapons, the government is set to spell out that it would not acquire the maximum number of warheads for the Trident deterrent. Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, is expected to make clear over the next couple of weeks that the government would order fewer warheads than the maximum 512 the Trident boats could carry. In the wake of the disarmament talks between the United States and Russia, ministers are sensitive to charges that the UK is getting left behind. Mr Douglas Hogg, a foreign office minister, reminded MPs in a debate on nuclear non-proliferation that 128 warheads was the maximum each of the four Trident boats could carry. 'Trident is a minimum deterrent. We will employ the minimum that is required. That may - in certain circumstances - be substantially less than the 128 warheads that is the maximum,' he said. Mr John Major, the prime minister, vigorously defended the government's refusal to approve a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. In a statement to MPs on President Yeltsin's visit to London and the United Nations summit he said: 'For as long as it is necessary for us to have nuclear weapons, we require the ability to test, and we propose to keep the ability to test.' There was a welcome from Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, for the government's enthusiasm for a rouble stabilisation fund. He expressed concern, however, that the conditions for the proposed Pounds 280m export credit cover would be so strict as to make the cover unusable. Mr Major said the export credit guarantee cover was dependent on Russian membership of the International Monetary Fund, and an IMF programme being in place, and also on the Russian republic continuing to meet its debt obligations. The prime minister faced concerted pressure from Labour MPs for the UK to meet in full its commitments to UN funding - and some Tory concern lest the UN might not have enough funds to carry out its enhanced peace-making and peace-keeping role. Labour said the UK had cut its financial commitment to the UN by 38 per cent since 1979. Mr Major emphasised that he had drawn attention at the summit to the need to ensure the UN had the funds it needed, and said that the UK was one of the UN's foremost supporters.</p>

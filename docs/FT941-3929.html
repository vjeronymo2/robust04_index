			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Observer: White lightning How many prosperous English entrepreneurs ensconced in California would give a microchip about the future of under-educated British youth? The Prince's Youth Business Trust has found one in Jeremy White, who takes over as chief executive next month. John Pervin, who led the trust through its first successful decade of helping under-privileged youngsters set up in business, was a career Unilever man. White, 38, had a rather different start. He may now boast an MBA, and an MA in education and psychology, but White loathed school and, had it been around then, would undoubtedly have been a candidate for PYBT funds when he started his electronic securities company aged 20. Within ten years he had merged with Britannia Security Group, at which point he crossed to the US. After an acquisitions spree he sold his stake and moved to California. There he bought Data Safe, a disaster-support business, of which he is still chairman. He inherits a charity that is basically in good shape - two thirds of its charges are in business after two years, compared with a roughly one in ten survival rate for new ventures across America. For this, the new boss credits the system of attaching advisers to grant recipients, but their wisdom is no substitute for training, and it is with short, non-academic business management courses that White hopes to broaden the trust's reach. He certainly returns home unencumbered by his past life - six hours after deciding to go for the job last November, his house was burnt to the ground.</p>

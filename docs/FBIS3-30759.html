			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Representatives of the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak National Party [SNS] held  coalition talks in the Slovak Parliament today. Answering  journalists' questions regarding what happened at the roundtable  meeting, [SNS Chairman] Ludovit Cernak said, and I quote, you  will be informed by the well-tested pair [Meciar-Prokes].  Afterward, journalists were addressed at a short news briefing  by [HZDS Chairman] Vladimir Meciar and Jozef Prokes [SNP  honorary chairman and deputy speaker of Slovak parliament].    [Begin Meciar recording] The main issue we addressed was  whether Mr. Cernak, as SNS chairman, still feels personally  committed to the coalition agreement between the HZDS and SNS.  The other issue was whether he was willing to coordinate  actions at the [parliament's] plenary session on 16 February so  as to ensure our [SNS and HZDS coalition] joint behavior and  actions. He answered that the only thing he was willing to  follow was purely his conscience.    I personally urged him to step down from the post of deputy  chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic because  the only reason for his holding this post is that, as a  coalition, we agreed to render political support to him. In  this situation, the HZDS is unable to support Mr. Cernak's  remaining in the post of deputy chairman of the National  Council. He replied that [word indistinct] if we think we have  enough votes to recall him, we should go for it.    We also asked whether it [Cernak's faction in the SNS] was  ready to respect the unity of the deputies' club, thus  specifying our willingness to talk only to those representatives  delegated by the SNS. We received a negative answer.    Given these circumstances, the HZDS will continue to ensure  that agreed coalition undertakings are fulfilled. It pledges to  support the SNS as [?a whole]. We are interested in the SNS  being a strong partner. We will be coordinating our actions in  the National Council with all those who want to coordinate their  actions with us. [end recording] [passage omitted]    [Begin Prokes recording] It is questionable at the present  time whether Mr. Cernak, as deputy chairman of the National  Council, represents the SNS because the SNS Central Council  clearly voiced a lack of confidence in him. That is one aspect  of the matter.    The other aspect is that all of the deputies, including  those  siding with Mr. Cernak, were asked to take part in joint talks  with the HZDS and the SNS [deputies'] club. None of them took  part in these talks, however. Thus, the issue of whether this  group actually intends to respect coalition agreements was the  correct issue to raise. I think that the SNS assembly scheduled  for 19 February will unequivocally resolve this question. After  all, SNS district conferences have indicated a certain solution  to this issue. But, in any case, I think that once there is a  partnership, problems should be discussed internally rather than  passing them to the mass media. [end recording]</p>

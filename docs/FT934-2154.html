			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 425m rights rebuilds Trafalgar The Pounds 425m rights issue and placing announced yesterday by Trafalgar House underpins the new management's efforts to rebuild the group's battered balance sheet, and demonstrates its determination to fund the expansion of the core engineering and construction businesses. Trafalgar's existing shareholders are being asked to provide Pounds 355m in new capital through a 1-for-3 rights issue of convertible preference shares at 100p each. A further Pounds 70m is being sought through a placing of shares on the same terms to bring more institutional shareholders back on to the register. The new shares are expected to begin trading on January 10. They will pay an annual 6p dividend beginning in January 1995 and will be convertible into ordinary shares at 112 per cent of the average share price over the next three days beginning today. Once converted they will represent up to 36.3 per cent of the group's enlarged capital. Hongkong Land Holdings, which owns a 25.3 per cent stake in Trafalgar, has confirmed it will take up its rights in full. The issue and placing, underwritten by Swiss Bank Corporation and Flemings, will raise about Pounds 404m. This will help transform Trafalgar's balance sheet and considerably strengthen its negotiating position with its banks. Under the terms of its banking covenants, the group, which had net borrowings of Pounds 395.1m on November 12, including guarantees of associates's borrowings of Pounds 51.7m, is required to maintain net worth in excess of Pounds 500m. Yesterday's write-downs would have caused the company to breach that condition. However, the banks have suspended the covenants until the end of February, subject to the rights issue being completed. Following the rights issue the group will have pro forma consolidated net assets of Pounds 694.2m In the meantime Trafalgar's board has negotiated a new Pounds 200m facility and additional bonding facilities of Pounds 100m from Midland Bank - a subsidiary of Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank; Jardine Group, of which Hongkong Land is a part, has banked with Hongkong Bank for more than a century. With the benefit of these facilities and the support of its other lenders, Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Trafalgar and Hongkong Land, said the group intends to further restructure its borrowing and bonding facilities on more favourable terms. 'Our negotiating position will be very strong,' he said. In addition to strengthening the balance sheet and repaying some of the group's more costly debt, the proceeds of the rights issue will be used 'to provide a strong equity and liquidity base to support the engineering and construction businesses'. These operations were identified in the group's recently completed strategic review as being 'central to long term profitable development'. In the year to September 30 the engineering and construction businesses reported a 'good performance' although operating profits before exceptionals were down for both divisions. Operating profits from the engineering division fell to Pounds 67.6m (Pounds 90.3m) on turnover of Pounds 2.36bn (Pounds 2.37bn). The order backlog stood at Pounds 2.22bn at end-September, ahead Pounds 178m. The construction division reported operating profits of Pounds 8.3m (Pounds 11.3m) on turnover of Pounds 850m (Pounds 847.9m), and the order backlog was Pounds 75m ahead at Pounds 1.13bn. Mr Allan Gormly, chief executive, said no progress was envisaged in the engineering and construction businesses before 1995 because they benefit late from any economic recovery. Property operations bore the brunt of the year-end asset write-downs. They reported full year losses before exceptionals of Pounds 9.6m, compared to a Pounds 200,000 operating profit last time. Turnover was flat at Pounds 332m (Pounds 333.1m). As a result of the strategic review the group said it intends to remain in the UK commercial property business, but to continue to change focus from speculative development to creating income producing assets. Trafalgar also confirmed its decision to 'disengage' from the US commercial property market, for which further provisions have been made. Because of uncertainties over the value of long term developments such as Paddington Basin and Chiswick Park in London, their value has also been written down. The group made Pounds 87.2m of provisions to cover the write-down of wholly owned developments and Pounds 48.9m for its share of associates's developments. The group also made a year-end provision of Pounds 22.3m to cover write-downs in the value of property it occupies itself, together with a Pounds 14m provision to cover its interests in investment and development properties and a Pounds 5.4m provision to cover its share of associates' investment property portfolios. The value of the group's hotels, which were carried in the balance sheet at Pounds 124.1m a year ago, has been written down by Pounds 51.5m, of which Pounds 11.7m was charged to the profit and loss account and Pounds 39.8m to the revaluation reserves. The division had, as expected, a better second half, but the year as a whole was disappointing with operating profits of only Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 27.6m) on turnover of Pounds 322.7m (Pounds 316.7m.) Trafalgar said the recent level of passenger bookings for the Cunard fleet was encouraging. Part of the proceeds of the rights issue will be used to fund a substantial refurbishment programme. A provision of Pounds 16m was also made to cover fleet disposals and Pounds 4.6m to cover cargo aircraft.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS OUST KEY COMMITTEE HEADS IN HOUSE  </P> <P> In one of the biggest shake-ups since the "Watergate Congress" of 1974 dumped  several key committee heads, House Democrats Wednesday toppled two senior  committee chairmen accused of being ineffectual and out of touch with  rank-and-file members.  </P> <P> Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro), the 77-year-old chairman of the Public  Works and Transportation Committee who championed development of the ports of  Los Angeles and Long Beach, was rejected by a 152-100 vote of the Democratic  Caucus. Rep. Robert A. Roe of New Jersey was chosen to succeed him.  </P> <P> Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), 75, was ousted from his post as chairman of the  House Administration Committee by a far narrower 127-125 margin. To succeed  Annunzio, Democrats elected Charlie Rose of North Carolina, the panel's  third-ranking member, who defeated second-ranking Joseph M. Gaydos of  Pennsylvania on a 158-64 vote.  </P> <P> The ousters, which came as a shock to the two veteran lawmakers as well as to  the House Democratic leadership, followed last-minute challenges mounted by  disgruntled, leading members of their committees.  </P> <P> Their downfalls appeared to send a strong reminder to other Democratic chairmen  that they must respond to rank-and-file concerns and not run their committees  like the all-powerful House barons of the past.  </P> <P> "The outcome reflected a combination of frustration within the committees and a  sense that the caucus had to assert itself for change," said Rep. Leon E.  Panetta (D-Carmel Valley) after Anderson and Annunzio were rejected.  </P> <P> Another reason was offered by Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), who led the effort  to defeat Anderson and Annunzio on grounds that they were not able to lead  their committees properly.  </P> <P> "These committees handle our extremely important efforts to rebuild America's  sagging infrastructure and to fashion a much-needed reform of the campaign  finance system," Obey said. "We need to have people running these committees  who are up to the challenge."  </P> <P> In a close race to succeed Anderson, Roe defeated Rep. Norman Y. Mineta (D-San  Jose) by a vote of 121 to 107. Mineta, backed by a majority of the Democrats on  the public works panel, had led the fight to unseat Anderson.  </P> <P> Roe, who was second in seniority on the public works panel, will have to give  up his chairmanship of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee when  he replaces Anderson.  </P> <P> In a departure from tradition, the Democratic Caucus leadership decided to  choose replacements immediately in a night session Wednesday rather than wait  until the new Congress convenes in January.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a third chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), 74, of the House  Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee, was seriously challenged but  retained his office on a 163-89 vote.  </P> <P> Rep. Bruce F. Vento (D-Minn.), who organized the losing campaign against  Gonzalez, said that he was acting on behalf of himself and other Banking  Committee members who believe that the chairman has dominated the panel but  failed to develop a legislative agenda.  </P> <P> "Chairmen are not on a personal ego trip but have to run the committee well,"  Vento said. "Members of the caucus are not going to sit back and take it. This  should send a message to all House chairmen."  </P> <P> In another sign of apparent desire for turnover among aged or ailing  leadership, House Democrats cast 47 negative votes against Rep. Morris K. Udall  of Arizona, the 68-year-old Interior Committee chairman who suffers from  Parkinson's disease. They also cast 46 negative votes against 77-year-old  Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee  chairman who has been ill frequently and uses a wheelchair to move through  congressional corridors.  </P> <P> The defeat of Anderson and Annunzio was the biggest caucus revolt since the  Watergate class of incoming congressmen joined with incumbent Democrats in 1974  to remove three long-entrenched chairmen from the Agriculture, Armed Services  and Banking committees.  </P> <P> Before Wednesday's votes, Democrats had not removed a committee chairman since  1985, when Rep. Melvin Price (D-Ill.), who was then 80 years old, lost his job  as head of the Armed Services Committee and was replaced by Rep. Les Aspin of  Wisconsin.  </P> <P> "The message is: If you're a committee chairman, don't limp," said Rep. Pat  Williams (D-Mont.).  </P> <P> Anderson, whose Republican opponent in November accused him of slowing down and  growing stale, declined to comment on his defeat as chairman of the committee  he has headed since March, 1988, when he moved up because of seniority to  succeed the late Rep. James J. Howard (D-N.J.).  </P> <P> Some fellow Democrats said privately that advancing age and quadruple-bypass  heart surgery in 1988 seemed to have taken their toll on Anderson's mental  alertness and physical vigor. Others said he relied too heavily on staff aides  to do his work.  </P> <P> In a letter to Democratic members of the House before the ouster, Anderson's  challengers said that nothing could be more difficult than to seek his removal,  adding: "Nevertheless, we . . . have reluctantly and regretfully reached the  conclusion that we need new leadership."  </P> <P> Anderson, a quiet politician, has built a reputation for hard work on behalf of  home-state projects, including the Los Angeles and Long Beach port complexes,  the Harbor Freeway and the expansion of Los Angeles International Airport.  </P> <P> In another change, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) was elected to a seat on  the House Appropriations Committee.  </P> <P> Staff writer Paul Houston contributed to this report.  </P></p>

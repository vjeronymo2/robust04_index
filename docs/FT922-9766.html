			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank plans DM1.5bn hybrid issue DEUTSCHE BANK, Germany's biggest bank, is planning to launch an issue of profit-participating certificates with options attached. These 'Optionsgenusscheine' will have a nominal value of DM1.5bn (Dollars 937m) and the pricing and other details will be announced later this month. The bank said yesterday that the proceeds would be used to refinance the bank's long-term business at the same time as strengthening its capital base, already the strongest in Germany with pure equity capital standing at around 6 per cent of total assets. Each new Genusscheine will have a nominal value of DM1,000. The issue will have a maturity of 12 years and a coupon of 8.75 per cent, and the option will entitle the holder to buy two new Deutsche Bank shares. Genusscheine are a hybrid between debt and equity which are treated as Tier Two Capital by the Bank for International Settlements and Regular Liable Capital by German regulatory authorities. They are a popular with German banks as no tax has to be paid on the interest, and Commerzbank said last month that is planning a similar issue as well as a full equity rights issue later in the year.</p>

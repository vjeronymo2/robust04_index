			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Foreign Minister  Koji Kakizawa and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiakuan  agreed today that Tokyo and Beijing should strengthen bilateral  relations with a view to the future and thus ensure that they  served to make a contribution to the Asia-Pacific region and the  world at large.    During a 15-minute meeting, Kakizawa told Tang that the  Japanese Government would work hard for the development of  Sino-Japanese relations, while reflecting on and atoning for  Japan's past atrocities.    He referred to the resignation of Justice Minister Shigeto  Nagano who publicly denied last month that the former Imperial  Japanese Army committed the 1937 Nanjing Massacre in which many  Chinese were killed.    Tang said the Chinese Government appreciated the "wise  attitude" adopted by the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  over its perception of the past. Hata criticized Nagano for  making the remarks and said Japan "inflicted unbearable pain and  suffering on many people" in Asia during the war.    The visiting Chinese delegation headed by Tang is here for  the 13rd round of regular consultations between the Foreign  Ministries of the two countries.    On Wednesday [1 June], Tang and his Japanese counterpart  Hiroshi Fukuda, who is leading the Japanese team, at a working  level meeting discussed the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula and other international affairs.</p>

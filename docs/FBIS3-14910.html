The latest reports from the NKR indicate that the situation  along the front line is tense. Regardless of the many  casualties they have suffered, the Azerbaijan National Army  [ANA] units have maintained their intermittent attacks in  various parts of the front line. A report we received from the  NKR Defense Army Press Service a short time ago said that the  situation in a large part of NKR's front line was relatively  peaceful last night and this morning, that is after the violent  clashes in the southeastern sector yesterday. Only intermittent  positional fighting took place in various areas. The NKR defense  forces destroyed three armored vehicles and dozens of ANA  soldiers. One of the NKR freedom fighters was killed and eight  others were wounded.    The NKR intelligence units have established that Azerbaijan  is massing reinforcements and armored vehicles in the eastern  sector of the front line.    Several newspapers in Moscow have quoted the Azerbaijan mass  media organs as saying that the NKR Defense Army Headquarters  has established additional punitive units. The reports said  that the punitive units have been assigned to prevent the  retreat of the Armenian troops. S. Oganyan, chief of the NKR  General Staff, has disclosed that only NKR's disclosures  represent the true state of affairs. Oganyan asserted that the  NKR has not felt the need to organize punitive units since the  NKR military forces were established. However, such units have  been used in Azerbaijan to fire on the retreating Azerbaijani  military forces. It is no coincidence that Azerbaijan's  military servicemen prefer to surrender to the Armenian forces  to avoid being fired on by those units. Some 60 officers and  men have surrendered to the NKR defense forces during the past  two months. Citizens of several foreign countries were among  them.    The relatively peaceful situation on the border between  Armenia and Azerbaijan during the past week, has been disrupted  once again. The Armenian Ministry of Defense Press Service has  disclosed that the defense positions around Berkaber and Kirants  in Armenia's Idzhevanskiy Rayon were fired on from Azerbaijan  with various types of arms on 24 February. Armenia's border  guards took retaliatory measures. No one was hurt on the  Armenian side.    The occasional provocative activities in Azerbaijan do not  allow the establishment of peace and security on the border.</p>

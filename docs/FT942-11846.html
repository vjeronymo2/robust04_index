			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Syndicates to offer added value: Richard Lapper reports on the details of the market's radical plan 'A mountain of complications' to lead Lloyd's to the 'greenfields of simplicity' was how Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, described yesterday's package of reforms at the insurance market. The reforms, outlined in a 64-page document entitled Value at Lloyd's, are designed to allow Names to obtain value from their long-term interests in syndicates - the one-year annual joint ventures that conduct insurance business. Names currently share only in the annual profits or losses of their syndicates but Mr Rowland said he wanted them to be able to 'realise any capital value or goodwill of the syndicate business'. The document starts by giving the Names who continue to underwrite next year pre-emption rights over the syndicates they support. These rights - similar to those typically available to a shareholder in a listed company - would allow Names to maintain their existing shares in syndicates from year to year or increase them in proportion to the syndicate's increase in capacity (the amount of business it can underwrite). Names will also be given voting rights, allowing them to have more influence in any decision by their agent to increase capacity. Names are also to be given the right to transfer a participation for future years of account to another member, through the introduction of 'assignment', a reform described as a 'fundamental building block' for any system of value. The Lloyd's agency agreement - which governs the current relationship between a Name and his agent - is to be modified this year with the changes also coming into effect in 1995. On the basis of these initial steps, Lloyd's will then examine ways in which a market can be set up, allowing Names to 'realise' the value of their syndicate participations. Here - for the moment at least - Lloyd's has been less proscriptive. Three basic routes forward are outlined but each of them will require further work. 'It is better to let outside brains work on how we should do it best,' explains Mr Robert Hiscox, the deputy chairman who headed the team which prepared yesterday's report. Separately, Lloyd's also announced measures designed to secure a more efficient allocation of capital. A system of risk-based capital, in which the funds required by investors to back insurance business will vary according to the risks underwritten and exposures, is to be introduced. Lloyd's is also committed to intervening to prevent excessive increases in the capacity of the market. A new system will be introduced for reviewing significant increases proposed by managing agents, who administer syndicates. All this should mean Lloyd's will be better equipped to prevent another period of disastrous losses as in the 1980s, when excessive capacity led many underwriters to accept risks for too little premiums. But that will be little comfort for the thousands of Names already ruined.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     How Names might cash in  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Creation of a market administered by Lloyd's where Names could buy and sell their participations in syndicates while maintaining their existing status. The report reviews a number of ways that this might be achieved. It concludes that a one-off auction-based tender system, in which all sellers of a particular syndicate receive the same price, is the most likely option in the short term.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Corporate pooling arrangements: members would 'assign' all their syndicate participations to a corporate member in exchange for shares, other securities or cash.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Corporate syndicates: in which members of one syndicate would 'assign' future participations to a corporate member, again in exchange for shares, other securities or cash.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

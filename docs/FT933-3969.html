			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Blow to Lorenzo airline plan A JUDGE has dealt a serious blow to plans by Mr Frank Lorenzo, the controversial former head of Continental Airlines, to start up a new low-cost airline serving the US east coast. The administrative law judge, charged with deciding Mr Lorenzo's fitness to run an airline, said that while his company, ATX, had the financial backing and management skills required, it lacked the 'proper compliance disposition'. The judge's view, which could be overturned by the Department of Transportation, was welcomed by two airline unions, the Airline Pilots' Association and the International Association of Machinists, which have campaigned against Mr Lorenzo's return to the airline business. Mr Lorenzo, who stepped down from active airline management in 1990, was the industry's most controversial figure in the 1980s. As head of Continental and Eastern Airlines he fought a succession of bitter battles with labour unions. After his departure, Eastern Airlines went into liquidation and Continental into bankruptcy proceedings, from which it recently emerged. The judge said ATX had shown a pattern of 'disobeying orders and filing frivolous and vexatious pleadings' during his proceedings. 'It certainly cannot be trusted to comply with federal law regulating the transportation of passengers and cargo in scheduled air service,' he said. ATX said it was confident the decision would be overturned.</p>

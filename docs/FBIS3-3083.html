			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter Chen] </F>   [Text] Brisbane, March 16 (CNA) -- Australia and the  Republic of China [ROC] are scheduled to hold talks in Melbourne  later this month to discuss expansion of the current air links  between the two countries, the Taipei Economic and Cultural  Office (TECO) in Canberra said Wednesday [16 March].    TECO Representative Francias Li said the ROC delegation  would  be led by Sun Chao-liang, director-general of the Civil  Aeronautics Administration, and his Australian counterpart would  be Australia's representative in Taiwan.    Officials from the Australian Transport Department,  Australian Asia Airlines (AAA), Eva Air and Mandarin Airways  will take part in the two-day meetings on March 24 and 25.    Li said the ROC delegates are expected to arrive in  Melbourne  on March 23.    "The purpose of the meeting is to discuss bilateral  expansion  of the current air links between our two countries," he said.    He said the issue was first raised by the officials of AAA,  a  subsidiary of Qantas Airways, last year.    Australia signed an aviation agreement with the ROC in early  1991.    AAA inaugurated its flights to Taipei from Sydney and  Brisbane on October 11 the same year.    Mandarin Airways followed suit a week later with direct  flights between Taipei and Sydney. Eva air started flying to  Sydney and Brisbane from Taipei in September 1993.    Under the 1991 agreement, airlines from the two countries  are  allowed to provide four weekly flight between Taipei and Sydney  and Brisbane. Additional flights on this route have to be  approved first by either Taipei or Canberra.    AAA has maximized its services with four weekly flights  while  Mandarin and Eva provide two weekly flights each.    But a faster-than-expected tourist flow from Taiwan to  Australia last year has called for more flights and the airlines  operating the route are very profitable, airlines officials said.    Eva Air has been forced to offer an extra flight to meet  growing demand, company representative in Sydney Peter Kwoh said  in an interview.    "All airlines operating between Taipei and Sydney and  Brisbane are making profits thanks to a surge in the number of  tourists from Taiwan," he said.    The number of tourist arrivals from Taiwan going to  Australia  hit a record high of nearly 109,000 last year, up from 63,500 in  1992, according to the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC).    Tourists from Australia going to Taiwan totalled more than  20,000, up only slightly from a year earlier.    "The Taipei route has been known as the golden route for  many  years," Kwoh said, adding "because more and more affluent Taiwan  residents like to travel overseas."    "They are big spenders in Australia," an ATC official said.    China Airlines, a parent company of Mandarin, said this  month  that its subsidiary would expand its current Taipei-Sydney  flights to Brisbane later this year.    "I believe all the airlines operating between the ROC and  Australia will cash in on the growing tourist flow to share a  bigger market pie," TECO's Li said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Request for Comment on Petition From Chemical Manufacturer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Association Regarding Deep Well Injection of Ignitable and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Corrosive Characteristic Wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule solicited comments on a request from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemical Manufacturer's Association (CMA) that EPA develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate treatment standards intended for those wastes disposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Class I deep injection wells. CMA requested a separate set of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standards for ignitable and corrosive wastes managed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deep well injection that, in view of the unique circumstances of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deep well injection, meet the statutory ``minimize threats''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard. Many comments received by EPA urged the Agency to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop so-called UIC-specific treatment standards in light of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this petition. However, EPA received virtually no technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to support these comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Agency is not issuing a final response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CMA's request in today's rule. EPA continues to solicit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information necessary to enable EPA to act on this petition in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the future. These requests are documented in the rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> docket for today's rule. In particular, the Agency particularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests data concerning waste volumes, waste transport,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injection system integrity or the fate of disposed pollutants throughout the course of the injection procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Modifications to Hazardous Waste Recycling Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's rulemaking finalizes the proposed changes to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous waste recycling regulations, thus slightly broadening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the scope of an existing exclusion (and related variance). This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification of the regulatory framework will allow for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmentally beneficial recycling to occur without unnecessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory consequences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA wishes to note that the changes to the definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solid waste being promulgated today are narrow in scope and will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have minor impact. A more broad-ranged evaluation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations applicable to the recycling of hazardous waste is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being conducted by EPA's Definition of Solid Waste Task Force.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Task Force has been administering a public dialogue process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to examine the overall impacts of the RCRA program on recycling,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and will consider broader changes to the definition of solid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste as part of that process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Modification of the Existing ``Closed-loop'' Recycling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Exclusion and Related Case-specific Variance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. ``Closed-loop'' Recycling Exclusion and Related Variance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the January 4, 1985 final rule, the Agency promulgated an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusion from the definition of solid waste at &sect; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 261.2(e)(1)(iii) for secondary materials that are recycled in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``closed-loop,'' (i.e., returned to the original production process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in which the material was generated (see preamble discussion at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50 FR 639)). To be considered such a ``closed-loop'' process,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three conditions must be met. First, the secondary material must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be returned to the original process without undergoing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant alteration or reprocessing (i.e., it must be returned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without first being reclaimed. See 261.2(e)(3) and Table 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the production process to which the unreclaimed materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is returned must be a primary production process (i.e., a process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that uses raw materials as the majority of its feedstock, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposed to a secondary process that uses spent materials or scrap  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metal as the majority of its feedstock). And third, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secondary material must be returned as a feedstock to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original production process and must be recycled as part of that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process (as opposed to an ancillary process such as degreasing).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that these conditions characterize a material that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is part of an on-going production process, and as such, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management of the material should not be characterized as waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management (i.e., the material is not part of the waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management problem).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's action addresses the second condition_that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production process to which a secondary material is returned be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primary process. This condition was part of the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusion due to considerations regarding jurisdiction, as it was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understood in 1985, rather than to an evaluation of the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts on the environment from such ``closed-loop'' recycling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving secondary processes. This condition thus was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established without a consideration of whether such secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials would be part of the waste management problem. By  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition, a secondary process uses waste materials as its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal feedstock. The Agency therefore concluded that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process residue, which is returned to the original process as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute for feedstock that is itself waste, is no less a waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the waste material originally introduced (see 50 FR 639).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (The Agency notes that with few exceptions, this condition has no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual impact on the recycling of residues from secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes because such residues that exhibit a characteristic of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous waste (i.e., characteristic by-products and sludges)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are likewise excluded from the definition of solid waste if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclaimed.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Although the Agency continues to believe that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jurisdictional logic behind this condition is sound, the judicial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opinions regarding RCRA jurisdiction allow more weight to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given to environmental considerations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> API  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA (API),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 906  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F.2d at 740&hyph;41;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> AMC  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA (AMC II),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 907 F.2d 1179, 1186 (D.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cir. 1990). Thus, EPA has reevaluated this condition of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusion from the definition of solid waste due to its impact on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the recycling of residues from secondary processes, in particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secondary lead smelters, and has determined that the condition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a closed-loop involving only primary processes is not legally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compelled, and that this condition is less relevant as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental consideration, assuming that the secondary material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is well-managed prior to reprocessing in the primary or secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process that generated it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

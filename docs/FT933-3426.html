			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Observer: City biker Peter Middleton, the chief executive of Lloyd's of London and renowned motorbike enthusiast, has been making good use of biking jargon. The attachment of stabilisers to a motorbike, he argued yesterday, was comparable to the introduction of corporate capital to Lloyd's; corporate capital would add both confidence and security to the beleaguered Lloyd's market as it attempts to claw back profitability. Middleton, who regularly commutes from his west London home to the City, had good reason to be thinking along those metaphorical lines. On Friday night his 800cc Suzuki skidded in front of an oncoming car, depositing the Lloyd's chief into Gracechurch Street. Fortunately he was only bruised, and not so badly as Lloyd's.</p>

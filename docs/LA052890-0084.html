			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> 254 TRUCKS CITED IN SURPRISE CHP CHECK  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol said it gave tickets to 74% of the trucks pulled  over in surprise inspections last week.  </P> <P> The Highway Patrol inspected 342 trucks on heavily traveled California 118 near  Tierra Rejada Road in Moorpark on Wednesday and Thursday, a CHP spokeswoman  said Friday.  </P> <P> Authorities said tickets -- primarily for brake, suspension, steering and other  mechanical violations -- were given to 254 trucks. The CHP ordered 141 of the  vehicles out of service.  </P> <P> Authorities estimate that about 1,200 truckers use the highway between Moorpark  and Somis daily. The CHP chose California 118 as a checkpoint site because many  truckers use the highway to avoid the Conejo Weigh Station on the Ventura  Freeway, authorities said.  </P> <P> The CHP holds about eight surprise inspections per year at that location, the  spokeswoman said.  </P></p>

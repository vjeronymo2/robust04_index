Wu Yi, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation  (Moftec), said China has virtually met the demands of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).    Speaking at a ministerial-level seminar in Beijing over the  weekend, Wu urged different ministries to speed up preparations  for rejoining Gatt.    China should resume its Gatt contracting party status before  the final package of the Uruguay Round of Gatt agreements --  which curb protectionism and expand world trade -- takes effect  next year.    By then, all Gatt members will become founding members of  the  World Trade Organization (WTO), the free-trade successor to Gatt.    Being a founding member of WTO will benefit China's foreign  trade, Wu said.    The service trade, the investment field and intellectual  property rights will be major concerns of WTO, Wu said.    She added that issues concerning the service trade will be  key items for discussion at the 16th meeting, to be held in  Morocco.    Compared with the US, 80 per cent of whose trade stems from  the service sector, China's service industry is still in the  initial stages.    The service trade is included among the conditions for  China's re-entry into Gatt. Others involve tariffs and  non-tariff duties.    China's re-entry into Gatt will help stabilize its overseas  markets and help it tap new ones, Wu said. It will also help  reduce trade discrimination and its regulations on multilateral  trade will help put developing countries on a more equal footing  with Western countries.    Although rejoining Gatt will challenge some domestic  industries, Wu said, the government will try to help them.    Long Yongtu, a director general in Moftec, said that the  meeting in Morocco will confirm the rules on reentering Gatt as  well as on joining the WTO.    A WTO administration commission will be set up at the  meeting, Long said. He added that about 20 countries and  regions are applying for entry into the world trade body.  Besides the Chinese mainland, they include Russia, Bulgaria,  Taiwan and Saudi Arabia.    Nearly 40 ministers attended the weekend forum in Beijing.  The Venezuelan trade minister described Venezuela's entry into  Gatt and representatives from the United Nations explained the  influence WTO will have on China.    Gatt, together with the International Monetary Fund and the  World Bank, are the three pillars of the world economic system.  The volume of trade among its 115 members accounts for more  than 90 per cent of the world's total.    China, on the other hand, is a fast-rising economic force.  Its 1993 trade totalled 195.7 billion yuan ($22.5 billion). In  the past 15 years China has received $60 billion in foreign  investment and has been one of the fastest growing economies in  the world.</p>

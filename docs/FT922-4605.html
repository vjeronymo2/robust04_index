			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / GE wins Dollars 150m contract to equip Medway power plant GENERAL Electric of the US has won a contract worth more than Dollars 150m (Pounds 82m) to equip the new Medway electricity generating power plant at the Isle of Grain in Kent with gas and steam turbines. The company will supply two gas and one steam turbine generator for the 660MW plant owned by Medway Power, a joint venture between Seeboard and Southern Electricity - two of the regional electricity companies - and AES Corporation of the US. The plant is due to start operation in 1995. GE said yesterday that the Medway contract was its first independent power plant project in Europe. It was also its first direct European sale of its 9F model, the world's most powerful gas turbine. Previous European orders have been through GE's network of business associates. GE and its partners claim to be world leaders in the gas-turbine generation business. But Westinghouse of the US teamed up this week with Rolls-Royce, UK aero-engine and industrial power group, to challenge GE's leadership. Rolls-Royce yesterday announced its first order for an environmentally friendly combustion system for the industrial derivative of its RB211 jet engine. Pacific Gas, the US pipeline operator, has ordered three of the systems for engines being installed in Idaho and Washington for service in 1994. The new Rolls-Royce process, using a system to reduce oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide emissions, is designed to meet environmental legislation expected to be introduced soon in many of the company's power markets.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Phone companies in US allowed to transmit TV A US government agency yesterday gave the go-ahead for telecommunications companies to transmit television programmes to homes over their telephone lines, a move which could eventually mean strong competition for the monopolistic American cable television industry. However, the ruling by the Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the communications industry, is only a first step towards encouraging competition in the potentially vast market for television-based home information services. First, the FCC has maintained a ban on the telephone companies' owning a significant stake in a producer of the programmes transmitted through its communications networks. Its ruling prevents the phone companies from owning more than 5 per cent of a programmer, a slight relaxation from the previous 1 per cent limit. Second, the telephone companies are in no position to offer immediate transmission services, since video signals do not travel well on the copper wire lines which currently connect nearly all American homes to the telephone network. Video signals require either coaxial cable, which is used by the cable industry, or the new technology of fibre-optic cable, which can transmit vast amounts of data of a high quality. However, the telephone companies are expected to rewire much of their local networks with fibre-optic cable over the next 20 years, and they have long argued that the FCC move was vital to encourage them to make this investment. The cable television industry, which is under attack in Congress for the sharply rising price of its service and fears the financial muscle of the phone companies, opposed the FCC move. However, the cable industry is also protected from competition under a 1984 act which prevents telephone groups from owning cable operators in areas where the phone companies operate. Mr Bob Levetown, vice-chairman of Bell Atlantic, a large regional phone company serving part of the eastern seaboard, said the FCC move was 'an important first step' but consumers would only realise 'the true benefits of competition and choice when telephone companies have complete freedom to provide video programming'. He urged Congress to remove the remaining entry barriers.</p>

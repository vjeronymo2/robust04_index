			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / No easing of general's grip in 'free' Chile: The coming 20th anniversary of Pinochet's coup THERE IS a little copper coin in Chile, the 10 peso piece, which depicts the angel of liberty snapping the chains of repression that for so long have bound her wrists. It does not commemorate Chile's return to democracy in 1990, after 17 years of military rule, but the coup of 1973 that brought the generals, led by Augusto Pinochet, to power. As Chile approaches the 20th anniversary of the coup of September 11, the coin remains a small but significant reminder of the fragile balance that exists between the civilian government and the military forces. The authority of the transitional administration, led by President Patricio Aylwin, is still strictly circumscribed by the armed forces and by Gen Pinochet's 1980 constitution which remains largely intact. Relations with the military, alternately civil and strained during the democratic transition, have become tense over the past few months. The low point was May 28 when the military took advantage of President Aylwin's absence abroad to put on a show of strength on Santiago's streets. Troops appeared in full combat gear, sporting automatic weapons and rocket launchers, as the generals - still headed by Gen Pinochet - held a meeting. The sabre-rattling of May was largely provoked by the one issue that has dogged civilian-military relations since the 1990 handover - the matter of human rights abuses committed during the military regime. Most leaders of the armed forces believe that the issue has dragged on for too long. Many still argue that during the 1970s the military was engaged in a legitimate war against Marxism, and that their actions should not be criticised. Furthermore, since few, if any, torturers and assassins are to be punished - because of an amnesty promulgated in 1978 - most in the military feel that to pursue trials is a waste of time which can only further sully the armed forces' reputation. President Aylwin's recent attempt to bring the trials to a conclusion ended in disaster last week when divisions within the governing Concertacion coalition killed off the president's bill. The so-called 'Aylwin Law', presented to the nation in an emotional speech last month, had sought to appoint special judges to hear human rights trials in secret. The hope was largely to unearth fresh information that might have led to the discovery of bodies 'disappeared' by the military. The president was last week forced to halt the bill's progress through Congress after parties within his own coalition voted against the secret clause which they argued denied the nation its right to know. It seems clear that, during months of discussions with Gen Pinochet, the president had reached agreement with the military, but had not squared the deal within his own government. His retreat, seen in Santiago as a personal political defeat, shows the difficulty of trying to appease politicians and soldiers when they are pulling in different directions. The bickering within the Concertacion mirrors the no less public debate over commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the 1973 coup, still a public holiday after the government's failed attempt to shift it to a less controversial day. The failure to do so in itself highlights the restrictions imposed by the 1980 constitution which, among other things, enabled Gen Pinochet to stack the Senate with nine of his non-elected supporters. The Concertacion has insisted that the military not conduct its celebrations within four blocks of the Moneda presidential palace, the building which was bombed during the final stages of the 1973 coup that overthrew the left-wing government of President Salvador Allende. Mr Aylwin has called on the armed forces to show restraint and to remember the families of those who suffered repression. He has also urged Chileans not to organise demonstrations in favour of or against the coup, but instead to strive for reconciliation. Traditionally, government employees have demonstrated their disapproval of the holiday by refusing to take the day off work. But this method of protest has been denied them this year since September 11 falls on a Saturday. The possibility of clashes between opponents and supporters of the coup remains, in spite of the president's attempt to defuse matters. Gen Pinochet feels the nation has forgotten what he sees as the service performed by the military in overthrowing Mr Allende's Marxist government. 'Everybody in this country has forgotten,' he said in a recent speech. 'It is as though a shadow of amnesia has passed over the minds of the people.' He remains a combative defender of the new role carved out for the armed forces under what has been called a 'protected democracy'. He cannot be dismissed by the government and is guaranteed to remain commander in chief until 1998. The president also has no power to reduce the huge armed forces budget which is inflation-proofed and supplemented by 10 per cent of the state copper company's earnings. Mr Eduardo Frei, the presidential candidate of the Concertacion almost certain to win December's general election, has pledged to tackle what he regards as the military's excessive power. After the armed forces' recent flexing of muscles, it seems his task will be far from easy.</p>

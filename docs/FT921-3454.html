			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / W German slowdown hits confidence THE WEST German economy put in its weakest quarterly performance since mid-1987 in the closing three months of 1991, the federal statistics office said yesterday. Business confidence is suffering as a result and growth in capital spending has slowed dramatically. Gross national product grew only 0.6 per cent in 1985 prices compared with the last quarter of 1990, the office said. After seasonal adjustments this translates into a 0.5 per cent fall ' the third quarterly decline in succession. Spending on plant and equipment rose only 0.5 per cent, in sharp contrast to double-digit increases recorded in the first three quarters, when capital spending rose by a quarterly average of 13 per cent. Growth in exports and imports of goods and services also decelerated sharply in the period under review and private consumption, in 1985 prices, rose only 1 per cent. The slowdown in internal economic development was highlighted by the second consecutive quarterly fall in gross domestic product, the measure which excludes income from abroad. Seasonally adjusted growth fell quarter-on-quarter throughout last year. Aggregate growth in GDP for the year was 3.4 per cent, compared with 3.1 per cent (adjusted from the 3.2 per cent reported last month) for GNP. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, said the figures should remind trade unions and employers that excessive wage deals could threaten the economic upswing expected later this year. The IfW economic institute attached to Kiel University, said earlier this week that it did not now foresee recovery before 1993, and calculated that overall GNP growth this year would be only 1 per cent. Although the steady decline in growth rates and business activity technically indicates a recession, output and employment are still at historically high levels. As the statistics office noted, the number of people employed in west Germany at the end of last year was 563,000 higher in the last quarter of 1990, and numbers registered as unemployed were down 84,000. Plant capacity utilisation, including use of extensive new equipment installed since unification in October 1990, still stood at 87 per cent in December. Levels of below 80 per cent have been a characteristic of past German recessions. The Bundesbank reported a marked fall in German overseas investment in January. Direct investment fell from DM5.9bn (Pounds 2bn) in December to DM1.3bn (Pounds 455m). Strong overseas interest in German government bonds, meanwhile, helped attract DM14.1bn of long-term foreign funds compared with DM5.8bn a month earlier. The country's overall current account deficit widened during the month from DM1.7bn to DM6.4bn. The Russian government has agreed to provide counter-guarantees for German exports, clearing the way for export contracts blocked since the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the German Economics Ministry said yesterday, writes Quentin Peel from Bonn. Hermes, the German export credit insurance agency, will now provide export cover up to the annual ceiling of DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) already agreed by Bonn, in an effort to control its trade exposure to the former Soviet republics.</p>

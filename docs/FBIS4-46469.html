			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Book: "Secrets of Unrepulsable Attacks" by A.B. Krasnov, </F> Voyennoye izdatelstvo 1991, 6,000 copies, 271 pages]    [Text]  <H5>  Forward </H5>   The great importance of fighter aviation under present-day  conditions is determined by the essence of Soviet defensive  doctrine. Fighter aviation must reliably protect the troops and  installations of the nation's rear from air strikes and support  the combat actions of other arms of aviation. New-generation  aircraft are entering the fighter aviation armament with high  tactical performance and powerful weaponry, and its command  posts are being equipped with increasingly sophisticated  automated control systems. It is impossible to fully utilize the  high combat capabilities of the new equipment without knowledge  of tactics, however.    Tactics teach how to vanquish the enemy in the most  difficult  situation, to execute combat actions with the least forces by  virtue of surprise, strategem, and a creative approach to the  task.    However it often happens that aviation commanders and pilots  do not bother either with cunning calculation or bold original  maneuver, and the importance of tactics as the art of waging  battle is belittled. These defects are an inheritance of those  times when display and show were in honor, when directives and  instructions suppressed initiative and combat activeness, and  the monotonous background of exercises taught the men not so  much to think as to execute.    Perestroyka in Soviet society is changing all aspects of its  life. Now as never before air commanders and all flight  personnel are expected to show flexibility of tactical thinking,  especially in sharp tactical situations, the ability to form and  to defend one's position, to discard outmoded tactical devices,  and to look toward the future. For this it is important to  understand those changes which have occurred and are occurring  today in tactics, in practice air-to-air battles distinguished  by more resolute goals, high effectiveness, and diversity of  tactical techniques.    This book reveals the basic problems of tactics of fighter  aviation and the components of tactical mastery of fighter  pilots (the author calls them the secrets of irresistible  attacks). From all the variety of these questions the book cites  the most important and interesting. They are discussed in  accessible form and at the same time without excessive  simplification. The author introduces us to the history of  tactics, ably drawing on the experience of air battles of the  Great Patriotic War.    The development of the tactics of fighter aviation and its  problems are discussed as they apply to the combat missions of  fighters, improvement of aviation equipment, tactics of the  adversary, and the place of fighters in air defense systems.  Explaining the law-governed regularities in the evolution of  combat missions, in the relations of tactics and equipment, in  the confrontation of tactics of friendly and enemy fighters, in  their interaction with ground air defense systems in the past,  present and future is a difficult task, but I believe that the  author has accomplished it. The theoretical material, combined  with lively instructive examples never before cited in our  literature, and the necessary commentaries will help the reader  to understand the essence of specific phenomena of tactics.    Questions of tactical training of aviators are discussed  with  the same completeness and soundness. Here the reader will also  find much that is interesting. Recommendations for planning of  air-to-air battles and developing tactical techniques, the use  of stratagems in battle, and rational use of the time factor,  command and control of the battle, on morale and psychological  preparation of the flight personnel, and other advice gives this  part of the book a practical bent. The author does not limit  himself to demonstrating only the positive in combat training of  fighter aviation; he also explains the causes of negative  phenomena in tactics, and the ways of making combat training  nearer to combat reality, and cautions aviation commanders,  pilots, officers of command posts, and students in VVUZ  [military higher educational institutions] (namely, those to  whom this book is addressed) against possible errors.    The author of this book, professor and doctor of military  sciences, participant in the Great Patriotic War, A.B. Krasnov,  now working in the field of tactics, has managed to trace the  paths of its development quite fully, to make broad  generalizations and interesting conclusions. His book, which is  in harmony with the times in terms of content and the logic of  his arguments, promotes creativity in tactics, and leads one to  think. Without a doubt it will interest not only aviators of our  generation; veterans and youngsters preparing for service in  military aviation will also enjoy it.    I recommend this book to the readers with pleasure.    Col.-Gen. of Aviation A. Borsuk  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   The intermittent howl of the engines carries down from the  skies. The tight flows of air strike the blades of turbines,  sending the winged craft forward to where the adversary has  prepared for a frontal attack, his airborne weapons in full  readiness for battle. Two opposing groups of fighters face a  heated skirmish. Another moment and the aircraft flash into  view, cascades of maneuvers merge into an unending chain  executed at the limits of capabilities of man and machine, now  and again the smoky trails of launched missiles rip the limpid  blue. The dogfight begins, a confrontation of human intellects,  a competition of the courage, endurance, and self-control of the  participants in each attack.    In short attacks are concentrated the experience and  knowledge of the pilots, displaying the ability to resist the  enemy with their will and mastery. The strength of the elements  is even, tactical performance and the conditions of joining  battle approximately the same. Whose side will prove to have the  invincible attack? Whose missiles will more quickly find and  destroy their assigned targets?    In the book, the tactics of fighter aviation reveal the  secrets of irresistible fighter attacks. Its title requires  explanation. What secrets are we talking about? Those which are  part of the tactical proficiency of flight personnel. How may we  foresee the actions of the adversary and model the battle, how  many tactical techniques must be held in reserve, how best may  we use the high capabilities of our weapons, how can we outsmart  the enemy and ably control the battle? All these are the secrets  of irresistible attacks, or components of tactical proficiency,  which the pilot cannot do without.    In order to grasp these secrets, however, one must first  turn  to the factors which determine the development of tactics. The  dynamism of the changes occurring in tactics will depend on the  changes in the content of combat missions which are performed by  fighters. The improvement in aviation equipment leads to the  development of tactics and the replacement of some tactical  techniques by others. Obviously the corresponding demands are  imposed on tactics by an active adversary, forcing abandonment  of the prevailing stereotypes. Without the adversary there can  be no tactics, just as there can be none without the ground air  defense systems which interact closely with the fighters and  share the success of battle with them.    The influence on tactical development of these factors,  which  are not identical and at times even contradictory, is traced in  the first part of the book. They are closely connected to one  another, and only for convenience of discussion are they  examined separately. The second part of the book relates  successively the activity of commanders, pilots, officers of  command posts in preparation for battle, during battle, and in  command and control of battle, and addresses the inculcation of  high morale and aggressiveness.    It should be stipulated at the outset that the book is not  intended for specialists who know all the subtleties of aviation  equipment. We are far more interested in the tactical aspect of  the matter than the specific tactical performance of even the  latest models of equipment and design features. Because of this,  some things have to be simplified, some things mentioned in  passing.    However the reader will look in vain in the book for  ready-made prescriptions of irresistible attacks, i.e., tactical  recommendations. There are too many of them, and situations in  battle are such that only a specific tactical technique must  correspond to each of them. But on the other hand, that which is  good the first time, is worse the second, and the tenth time  even harmful -- this is a typical lack of originality. Thus  identical tactical technique, even if optimal, does not help  when repeated again and again. This is what they have in mind  when they say that there are no prescriptions in tactics, so it  is important not to "write prescriptions" but to have the entire  "pharmacy" available, in order to have the necessary tactical  technique on hand at any moment. This is tactical proficiency,  proficiency of the commander, the pilot, the command post  officers, as necessary to him as air, in order to quickly and  appropriately select those very "prescriptions" which allegedly  do not exist in tactics, and to use them steadfastly and  precisely in battle.    Today tactics are developing especially quickly. The marked  defensive nature of our military doctrine and the obligations  undertaken by the Soviet Union not to initiate military actions  objectively may give certain advantages to the attacking side in  the surprise delivery of air strikes. We cannot but take this  into account. In such situations, when the initiative belongs to  the adversary, many traditional ideas regarding the role and  place of fighters in the repulse of aggression, and the modes of  combat action they utilize will change. The most urgent need for  changes in tactics, and the old thinking, the outmoded  leadership style, born in the time of stagnation, come into  conflict. How could one reveal here the cause and effect links  of phenomena and discard prevailing stereotypes, if at the time  triumphant reports from exercises and sham were considered more  important than creativity in tactics, if any maxim uttered from  above, arising now from ambition, now from "intuition," was  substantiated and scientifically confirmed?! Of course when the  issue is voluntarism in tactics, the word "intuition" must be  taken in quotes. And here, strange as it may seem, our readiness  to immediately react to various sorts of directives,  authoritative instructions and recommendations, was not averted  even by the sad lessons of the past, the tragic consequences of  distortions concerning the role and place of fighter aviation,  and justification of the "sole correct" provisions of tactics.    The world of tactics is complex and contradictory. Gradually  expanding its borders, it today offers fighters many new and  unexpected paths, not even guessed at just a few years ago.  Sometimes answers to them, albeit incomplete, may be found in  the experience of the past, and in the practice of the best  pilots, others are soundly answered by military theorists. But  how many problems there are to which no one has yet found an  answer!    Thus if neither accumulated experience nor simple and  reasonable discussion suggest how to proceed in order to achieve  victory in battle, the secrets of irresistible attacks must  remain unrevealed for some time. But is this surprising? It has  happened in the history of tactics more than once. We shall  peruse the pages of the long-ago and recent past, examining  those events which became turning points in the development of  tactics, accelerating or slowing it, and then we shall examine  the present, and try to look at the future of tactics.    The goal of the book is to prompt the reader to reflect, and  to offer food for thought. So the reader will not always find  unequivocal assessments in the book, and some problems of  tactics are analyzed in it from different, sometimes paradoxical  viewpoints. Study and pondering of these problems will allow one  to see and better understand the novelty of the current tactics,  to overcome any established dogmas, and to conduct a quest for  the new in tactics. In other words, we are all the creators of  tactics.  <H5>  PART I. FIGHTERS IN BATTLE </H5> <H5>  Chapter I. What Missions Should Fighters Perform? </H5>   The fighter was developed for battle. Its basic purpose is  to  destroy the adversary in the air. Air-to-air combat began  immediately with the appearance of aircraft over battlefields of  the First World War, which conducted reconnaissance and  delivered strikes and ground troops. Initially the lighter and  faster aircraft were used as fighters, and then special planes  were developed with airborne machineguns. Thus did fighter  aviation [FA] begin its existence.    In a short time fighter aviation was faced with many combat  missions. It protected the troops and important rear  installations from attack of enemy aircraft, safeguarded the  security and freedom of action of friendly bombers and scout  planes. The basic missions of Soviet fighter aviation, which  grew up from separate aviation detachments of the czarist army,  remained essentially missions which were accomplished in the  First World War. However, the October socialist revolution  breathed new life into the content of these missions and fighter  tactics.    What did the first red military pilots hand down to their  descendants? Massing of fighter aviation forces in decisive axes  of action of troops, protecting cavalry elements of the Red  Army, highly mobile for the times, in critical situations on the  fronts, were developed and used widely in the fire of the civil  war. Secrets of irresistible attacks of Soviet fighter pilots  consisted of able maneuver, the use of concealment in the sun,  haze, "dead" zones of observation and fire of enemy aircraft,  rapid and surprise closing and commencement of fire. They  conducted resolute and active combat actions, set up ambushes on  raiding routes of enemy aviation, and bravely attacked even a  numerically superior enemy.    After the end of the civil war, the missions and tactics of  FA were formed on the basis of developing views of its combat  utilization. It was considered the basic means of fighting for  superiority in the air, and had the main mission of repelling,  jointly with antiaircraft artillery, the raids of aviation  attacking friendly forces. In the skies of Spain and China, over  the Khalkhin-Gol river and in the war with the White Finns, the  role of missions assigned to FA gradually increased. From the  standpoint of improving tactics, air-to-air combat was  characterized by the development of fire and tactical  coordination in groups of fighters of different types. Usually  the fast I-16 (fig. 1) [not reproduced] fighters joined battle  first and forced the enemy to maneuver, then he was attacked by  the I-15 (fig. 2) [not reproduced] maneuver aircraft.    The tactics of fighter aviation in these battles were  enriched by diverse techniques of multiple-aircraft air-to-air  combat, but many questions still awaited solution. Too few  air-to-air battles were conducted, and in addition they were  marked by some uniformity and usually broke up into battles of  small groups or individual aircraft. With such uncoordinated  actions it was hard to coordinate the efforts of pilots to  achieve success. The division of fighters into fast and  maneuverable aircraft ceased to be justified. For battle with  new aircraft of the probable adversary, fast, highly  maneuverable, well-armed machines were needed, but, from the  experience of two years of war in Europe, no reasonable  conclusions were drawn, and FA tactics were not revised.    Such are only a few fragments of the prehistory of FA  tactics  before the start of the Great Patriotic War. No one yet knew  what the tactics of the coming war would be, the tactics which  later more than one generation of pilots would turn to.    The basic tasks of fighter aviation when the war started  were  destruction of enemy aviation in air-to-air battles for air  superiority, protection of troops and rear installations,  support of combat actions of other arms of aviation, aerial  reconnaissance, and actions against ground targets. Each of  these missions had its own organization and its own modes of  combat action, its own group of original tactical techniques.  Since those days many generations of fighters have come and  gone, but they all even now perform these tasks. Only the  tactics have changed. Without considering these changes in  strict chronological order, let us just follow how the content  of combat missions of fighter aviation was improved at the  turning points in the development of tactics.  <H5>  1. In Battles For Air Superiority </H5>   Air superiority became a necessity with the June dawn of  forty-one, when the airplanes pelted by enemy bombs burned at  our airfields. It was as vital as air to the troops, navy, and  aviation, in order to halt the fascist invaders, to create for  the attack planes and bombers the opportunity to deliver fighter  strikes on the enemy.    The fighter pilots displayed mass heroism and unprecedented  courage in the very first battles for air superiority. They  resolutely attacked the enemy even when they were in the  minority, sought to draw from their equipment everything which  it could give, to gain victory at the cost of life itself. But  the fascist "Messerschmitts" had a maximum speed of 500-550  km/hr, and our I-15s and I-16s only 360-460 km/hr. There were  still only a few new planes. Therefore, our fighters lacked the  advantage of speed and consequently of vertical maneuver, and  fought the air-to-air battles by maneuvering in the horizontal  plane (banked turns).    I believe I am not revealing a secret when I say that the  bravest pilot in a bad plane will be able to overcome an enemy  ace whose machine is technically more sophisticated only on the  condition that the latter misses the attack or makes mistakes in  the battle. The battle cannot be won by heroism alone. It is  hurtful and sad to recall how many of our pilots, brave boys,  perished on those battles because their equipment was outmoded.    However, the military and technical advantages of the enemy  were not the only reasons for the failures of the fighters.  However paradoxical it might sound, one of the reasons for the  situation that was created turned out to be the tactics  themselves. Whose fault is it that the dense combat formations  of fighters, the chief of which was the "wedge" of a three-plane  flight, was detected by the enemy a long way off, and, most  importantly, hindered the actions of the pilots? Whose fault is  it that in such combat formations the pilots were forced to stay  close to one another, to pay a lot of attention to keeping their  place, which led to a reduction in vigilance? These tactical  shortcomings were taken advantage of by the Hitlerites for their  surprise attacks.    But why did this happen? The force of tradition made itself  felt. For many years pilots had been taught to wage battle in  banked turns, actions in battle formations that were not  echeloned by altitude. The war dictated immediate and radical  changes in tactics. In the harsh existence of the front, the  enemy actions were studied closely, combat experience was  accumulated, and there was an intense search for more effective  tactical techniques.    We will not delve into all the ups and downs of development  of tactics in the course of the war, but will mentally shift  from these dramatic events to their concluding period.    Air superiority, which was first won in individual areas,  then in larger ones, finally tended in our favor in air-to-air  battles at Kuban, the battle of Kursk (1943), and subsequently  was held firmly by Soviet aviation. Mass influx of new fighters  to the front -- "Yakovlevs" and "Lavochkins" (fig. 3,4) [not  reproduced] stripped the enemy of his former advantages. The  dense formations of three-aircraft flights became a thing of the  past. The pair was affirmed as basic fire and tactical unit . A  battle formation of larger subunits was structured on the basis  of pairs and usually consisted of a strike force and escort  element or holding force (fig. 5). In an air-to-air battle the  strike force played the role of the "sword" (search and attack),  and the escort element was its reliable "shield." However small  the fighter force was, it would always adhere to the division  into "shield" and "sword." If the pilots encountered bombers  escorted by fighters, the escort element sought to engage them  in battle, and if there were none, they would attack the bombers  along with the strike force. The strike was always delivered by  those flights and pairs which proved to be in an advantageous  position.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-04A>      Figure 5. Battle formation of fighters in expectation of battle </FIG>     The tactics of fighter aviation received further development  and were displayed most graphically in the concluding Berlin  operation. Air superiority was assured through vigorous actions  of fighters in the three main zones (fig. 6). Fighter forces,  "hunters" operating in the first zone, reached the fascist  airfields and destroyed the scrambling aircraft, sought out and  destroyed small groups in the air, and upon encountering large  groups would radio information about them, which would be used  by fighters in other zones when they joined battle. The massing  of forces, good organization of command and control, and high  combat activeness of the flight personnel bore fruit: more than  half of the combat aircraft belonging to the two German air  fleets protecting Berlin were destroyed in air-to-air battles.  The effectiveness of each combat sortie rose sharply. Thus the  number of sorties of fighters per downed fascist aircraft in  1945 was cut to a third in comparison with 1943, and on the  average was 53 as opposed to 156. (TsAMO [Ministry of Defense  Central Archives], F. 112, op. 158791, d. 1, l. 65.)   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-05A>      Figure 6. Fighter aviation battling for air superiority (from experience in the Berlin </FIG>    Fighter aviation fought for air superiority along with  attack  and bomber aviation, which delivered massed strikes on aircraft  at airfields, destroyed fuel and ammunition depots; long-range  aviation operated against facilities of the aviation industry in  the deep enemy rear. However, in those years air superiority was  won primarily by fighters. It was in air-to-air battles that the  greatest harm was inflicted on the enemy and fascist pilots  perished or were captured. The advent of nuclear weapons soon  after the end of the war radically changed views of the methods  of attaining air superiority. Using nuclear missiles it became  possible in mere minutes to deliver a strike of enormous  destructive force against the most remote airfields. As a  result, aviation will suffer losses which may lead to an  immediate and sharp change in the correlation of forces. In this  regard, many foreign specialists believe that the battle for air  superiority may be fought without the active participation of  fighter aviation.    Such views have long existed, but since they have not been  tested in practice, the battle for air superiority has continued  in numerous local wars, which were waged using only conventional  weapons. And here the role of fighter aviation proved far  different from that predicted by the skeptics. Despite their  opinion, air-to-air battles developed with new force, and in  each subsequent war they acquired new traits. Let us examine how  fighter tactics changed from war to war.    The first air-to-air battles occurred in the skies of Korea  seven years after the end of the Second World War. There the  first-generation jet fighters MiG-15 (fig. 7) [not reproduced]  and F-86 "Sabre" (fig. 8) [not reproduced] which possessed great  subsonic speed, met one another. These battles were marked by  the great scope of altitude and the sharply increased speeds of  the aircraft, and demonstrated significant changes in tactics in  a short time.    The fighters of the Korean People's Army (KPA), using the  advantages of their aircraft over the "Sabres" in rate of climb,  sought to fight using vertical maneuvers, while the American  pilots preferred horizontal maneuvers and tried to shift the  battles from high altitude to medium and low, where the  advantages of the MiG-15 over the "Sabre" were reduced somewhat.  However the KPA fighters attacked the adversary from above, from  a steep dive, and then, using their exceptional rate of climb,  gained altitude sharply and departed into the sun. Combat  formations in groups became more and more dispersed, for  otherwise they could not provide freedom of maneuver, the  parameters of which increased sharply in jet aircraft. (See:  Stuart, J. Vozdushnaya moshch -- reshayushaya sila v Koreye [Air  Power -- the Decisive Force in Korea], Izd. inostr. lit., 1959,  pp 67-68)    Another ten years passed. The Vietnam War broke out. The  MiG-17 and MiG- 21 (fig. 9,10) [not reproduced] fighters fought  air-to-air battles with the F-3 "Phantom" (fig. 11) [not  reproduced] under conditions of air superiority for American  aviation, and this left an imprint on their tactics. Due to the  low numerical strength of the fighter aviation opposing the  aggressor, there were no large multiple-aircraft battles. The  tactics of the Vietnamese pilots were structured on rapid and  surprise attacks by pairs against the most vulnerable American  aircraft. Air-to-air battles as a rule consist of one attack,  which was performed following commands from ground control  points, at maximum speed using the conditions of natural  concealment. Such attacks added confusion and bewilderment to  the actions of the American pilots. They tried to counter the  Vietnamese fighters with various tactical techniques, but  nothing new was thought up to evade the attacks except for  energetic maneuver.    The battles for air superiority in the Arab-Israeli wars  took  a different course. In comparison with past wars, they were  characterized by extensive use of feints and decoy actions, more  dispersed combat formations, and increased tactical coordination  between fighter subunits.    The light maneuver aircraft "Mirage"-3C and the heavier F-4  "Phantom" took part in the air-to-air battles on the aggressor's  side. The combat formations, as before, were dispersed and  echeloned by altitude. However the disposition of forces had  changed (fig. 12). The "Mirage"-3C fighters comprised the group  luring the enemy to commit to battle, or decoy element. But the  difficulty was that no one could say if this was a decoy or  strike element. The tactics were reminiscent of a game of "cat  and mouse," except that its outcome was different. The decoy  element would approach the battle area at medium altitude, where  they were quickly detected by ground radars of the Arabs,  fighters were scrambled to intercept, while the strike was  concealed at low altitude. When the Arab fighters tried to  attack the decoy element, through feints the latter would create  favorable conditions for a surprise attack of their strike  force, which was invisible to the radar.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-06A>      Figure 12. Air-to-air battle using diversional maneuver </FIG>     In the war in Lebanon (1982), when the Israeli air force was  augmented with the more sophisticated American F-15 and F-16  aircraft (fig. 13,14) [not reproduced], the tactics of  air-to-air combat received further development (fig. 15). The  light F-16 fighters would attack first. Armed with short-range  "Sidewinder" missiles, they would covertly join with the Syrian  fighters at low altitude from their rear hemisphere. The F-15  fighters, which had intermediate-range "Sparrow" missiles, would  strike from long range (25-30 km). Instead of "Mirages," the  role of decoy elements would be played by drones, and command  and control (target designation, retargeting, buildup of  efforts) was provided from airborne command posts, whose role  was played by the E-2C "Hawkeye" AWACS aircraft (fig. 16) [not  reproduced]. Electronic warfare aircraft also operated in the  interests of the fighters.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-07A>      Figure 15. Air-to-air battle of fighters in Lebanon (1982) </FIG>    Today the battles of past years no longer fire our  imagination.    Much has changed in the disposition of forces and in the  tactics themselves of fighter aviation. What is the role of  air-to-air battles in the struggle for air superiority today and  in the future? Important military leaders and specialists abroad  polemicize in their search for answers to this question, and the  works of military science institutions are published. No one  dares to question the importance of the problem, but all stress  its complexity and contradictory nature.    In carefully studying the course of air-to-air battles in  local wars and comparing their effectiveness with strikes  against airfields, some western specialists conclude that under  present-day conditions aviation on the ground is still the most  vulnerable. This is explained by the fact that the power of  strike elements possessing new systems of precision weapons has  increased sharply, and modern aircraft are in the limited area  of airfields and cannot get along without a runway with a hard  artificial pavement, which is easily visible from the air.    And if we look at the problem from another aspect? After  all,  putting aviation at airfields which are in the depth of the  enemy territory would be more difficult. The increase in the  combat readiness of aviation units and subunits on the one hand,  and the increase in the range of detection of the offensive air  weapons on the other, has the result that now the time of  scrambling the main aviation forces from the airfields is less  than the flight time to target of the assault elements of the  attacking aviation after their detection. Therefore aircraft can  take off from the airfields and escape from the strike before it  occurs. It has become more difficult to hurt aviation on the  ground, since the planes are generally in quite reliable  shelters, and it is more difficult to penetrate the air defense  SAM barrier.    How should the battle for air superiority be waged so as to  bring the greatest success? The final word on this has not been  spoken, but clearly, on the basis of the contradictory nature of  the problem, one cannot unequivocally approach its resolution:  strikes on airfields or air-to-air battles? Too many factors  influence the answer. There is basing, composition, and  capabilities of aviation to achieve surprise, escape from a  strike, the disposition of forces of the sides, and much else.  Therefore the specific weight of strikes on airfields and  air-to-air battles under various conditions and in different  periods of combat actions may change over rather broad limits.  But the interrelation and the interdependence of strikes and  battles are strengthened under present-day conditions. Thus  strikes on airfields, aviation command and control posts, and  air defense create favorable conditions for actions of fighters  over the adversary's territory and attainment of air superiority  in strength, and successful air-to-air battles exert direct  influence on the results of strikes on airfields, since the  strike aviation is given the opportunity to operate under  conditions of weakened enemy resistance.    There is another characteristic feature in the combat  mission  of fighter aviation in the battle for air superiority: its very  concept is being expanded. Instead of a battle with the  adversary's combat aviation, it includes destruction of early  warning aircraft, airborne command posts, and elements of  reconnaissance-strike complexes. If all of them patrolling in  the air are not quickly destroyed, the enemy will be able to  warn his aircraft in time and pull aircraft at airfields away  from the strikes, then commit his fighters to battle. And this  means that air targets which are diverse in type and nature of  actions, the fighters must utilize different tactical techniques  in battle. Therefore the battle with such targets is often  included among the independent missions of fighter aviation.    Thus the battle for air superiority is inevitable,  unavoidable, and does not depend on the type of combat action or  our wishes, so consequently the air space in the foreseeable  future will continue to be the arena for fierce battles and  engagements. However, the battle for air superiority could be an  independent mission for fighter aviation only in individual  local wars. It performs this mission in repelling a surprise  enemy incursion, protecting friendly forces, and supporting the  combat actions of other aviation arms. Winning and holding air  superiority will create favorable conditions and is this a kind  of key which opens the way to accomplishment of other tasks?  <H5>  . Fighters and Protected Troops </H5>   A squadron over a battlefield. The ground heaves from the  bursts of shells and mortars. Black columns of smoke from  burning tanks rise heavenward. The pilots watch our infantry  move forward through the fire, penetrating the smoke, to meet  the enemy. Behind it are visible the artillery positions and  concentrations of troops -- the targets of strikes by fascist  bombers. The fighters race to the attack against nine "Junkers"  about to drop their bombs on the protected troops. Then one  after the other the enemy bombers burn and fall before the eyes  of the infantrymen.    The Soviet soldiers had occasion to witness many such  battles  in the years of the Great Patriotic War. But it was also  otherwise, especially at the start of the war, when friendly  troops retreated under the onslaught of powerful enemy assault  elements. Ask former soldiers if they often saw our fighters in  the sky. All would answer "hardly at all." They remember the  inordinate load which the unprotected troops experienced, the  losses they incurred under the strikes of the fascist aviation  because their protection from the air was not reliable enough,  or was altogether absent. And this at a time when the  adversary's aviation, interacting with ground troops,  concentrated its efforts in the axis of their strikes and so  "processed" our defense that it could no longer deter the enemy  offensive.    Significant fighter aviation forces were required to  accomplish the most important task of protecting troops, but  there were obviously not enough. There were no reliable command  and control systems, or the necessary experience. Combined-arms  commanders were not sufficiently competent in effective use of  the combat capabilities of the fighter aviation. After all,  planes in the air are not tanks on the ground. The desire to  protect as many targets as possible and uniformly disperse the  forces of fighter aviation over the entire front led to their  scattering, and hampered massing and maneuver.    But now imagine that the pilots had to detect and attack the  enemy before he delivered strikes on the protected troops.  Although the easily based fighters of those years were disposed  on small dirt airfields, at times right next to the front line,  they by no means always had time for the sortie. For timely  interception of the adversary, airborne alert duty was  organized, but it was necessary to protect the troops for long  periods, and the time the pilots were in the zones was 40-50  minutes. Requiring great expenditures of forces, motor operating  time, and fuel, this mode of combat action condemned the  fighters to passivity. Taking advantage of the fact that they  were tied down to specific areas, the enemy could keep them busy  in battle, or simply bypass these areas.    So what was left for the commanders to do who were  responsible for protecting the troops? Either intercept from  alert status on the ground, which did not allow a timely attack  on the enemy, or airborne alert duty, by which you also gain  little. There remained the sole correct way in the prevailing  circumstances: improve resources and the system of command and  control.    Meanwhile actual effectiveness at times did not correspond  to  best intentions. Only later, when radar entered the air forces,  did this way bring perceptible results, and make it possible to  abandon the continuous airborne alert duty. Commitment of  fighters to battle from alert status on the ground became the  basic method of combat action in protecting troops. Control of  the fighters was implemented using radars, which in 1943 were  introduced into the equipment tables of air armies and assigned  to the fighter aviation corps. In 1944, 2,102 fighters were  vectors to aerial targets from radar data, and 1,262 enemy  aircraft were shot down. (See: Timokhovich, I.V. Operativnoye  iskusstvo Sovetskikh VVS v Velikoy Otechestvennoy Voynye  [Operational Art of Soviet Air Forces in the Great Patriotic  War], M.: Voyenizdat, 1976, 283 pages.)    In addition, in order to beat the adversary to the punch in  actions, the most proficient pilots began to enter his territory  to areas where flights of fascist aircraft had been noted. Thus  appeared, or more precisely was reborn, another method of combat  action well known in Russian aviation, which was dubbed the  "roving patrol." This method was very effective, but not the  main one. Actions of the "hunters" were not tied to specific  protected installations, and of course could not ensure  reliability.    The "hunters" were free in their choice of time, routes, and  mission profile. Operating in individual pairs, they  inconspicuously crossed the front line at sectors where troop  actions were less vigorous, encountered enemy aircraft at remote  approaches to the protected installations, closed with them  covertly, and launched surprise attacks. Actions of the  "hunters" kept the Hitlerites in a constant state of tension,  and sowed panic. High tactical proficiency was required of our  pilots. The renowned aces recounted how carefully they prepared  for each flight on the "hunt, and developed tactical techniques  for search and battle in the depth of enemy territory.    By the end of the war the fighter aviation possessed  adequate  forces to protect troops, and a well-organized system of warning  and command and control of fighters had developed, thanks to  which the enemy aircraft were detected 12-15 minutes before the  approach to protected troops. Command posts were able to commit  new forces ahead of time, create numerical superiority over the  adversary in decisive axes, and in the necessary time.  Systematically and consistently the fighter aviation protected  troops in areas of concentration, in staging areas for attack  with breakthrough the enemy defense, and then shifted efforts to  protection of mobile groups with their commitment to battle, and  actions in the operational depth. Interception of the adversary  from a ground alert status was intelligently combined with  interception from airborne alert status and "roving patrol."  Each of the modes of combat action of fighter infantry was  necessary in its own way, convenient, and supplemented the  others.    These modes have been retained to this day. Which of them  should be preferred today? I do not believe this is an easy  question, or that many of us could give a detailed answer to it.  There are reasons for this:    --the troops as an object of protection have changed, the  stability of their defense, the depth of disposition of combat  formations, the mobility and fire power of air defense weapons,  the capacity to quickly shift from defensive to counteroffensive  actions, have changed;    --the range of protected targets against which the air  adversary may deliver strikes, in the most remote areas using  long-range precision weapons, has grown;    --dimensions of airspace surveyed by modern ground radars  and  airborne weapons radars have grown.    And now let us consider how these three essentially  contradictory circumstances affect the choice of modes of combat  action of fighter aviation. Obviously the first of them entails  an increase in the dimensions of the required areas of  protection of troops, a more dynamic situation than in the past,  and the need to allow for the capabilities of ground air defense  weapons; the second makes the troops more vulnerable, increases  the importance and complexity of the given combat mission of the  fighter aviation; and the third widens the capabilities of  intercept of the adversary at remote perimeters. The latter  circumstance demands clarification: at what distance from  protected targets must fighters need to and have to intercept  air targets?   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-09A>      Figure 17. Required points of engagement of fighters when protecting troops </FIG>    Let us begin with the obvious (fig. 17). If enemy aircraft  deliver a strike on targets with conventional uncontrolled  bombs, then distance from the targets is characterized by the  amount of carry of the bombs A, which all things being equal  increases with increased velocity and altitude of their release,  reaching values of several tens of kilometers. But the range of  launch of air-to-ground missiles is already measured in hundreds  of kilometers. Now we add these ranges to the dimensions of the  targets to be protected rb, add radius of effect with nuclear or  precision weapons Rp, and we determine the required range of the  line of engagement of the adversary by the formula    Sp = A + rb + Rp    The lines thus calculated are essentially the final lines of  destruction of the adversary. And this means the fighters must  be committed to battle at a range (Sb) which ensures they can  fight before the adversary reaches the lines we have calculated:    Sb = V x tb.    Now let us proceed to determine rational modes of combat  action of fighter aviation from the other aspect. We will  formulate two very important questions. The first is, will the  fighters have time to meet the adversary at such remote lines?  And second, what should be done all the same, if the answer to  the first question is negative?    Clearly the points of engagement shown in fig. 17,  guaranteeing safety of protected targets, are closely associated  with the lines of detection of the adversary. They are separated  by a distance which he covers in the time spent by the fighters  on commitment to battle from the ground alert duty status or  while in the air.    Now let us turn to the circumstances noted above, and solve  the following problem. Let us assume that you are the commander.  You have fighters at an airfield in full readiness to take off.  The dimensions of your area of troop protection are large, and  the adversary can use long-range missiles, but the range of his  detection is adequate for timely interception. Clearly there is  nothing to mull over, and you will make your decision for  simultaneous or successive commitment of fighters to battle from  ground alert status at predetermined lines.    Yet another exercise. You are the commander. The conditions  are the same, but the adversary has been smart, and taking  advantage of low altitude and tactical tricks, has been able to  reduce the range of his detection. What should be done? You  would like to intercept him with fighters on airfield alert  duty. Of course you will estimate their capabilities to reduce  the takeoff time, you may be saved by commitment of fighters to  the battle in the forward hemisphere of the targets (a  180-degree turn and pursuit will become unnecessary), but you  might not too. Clearly you cannot manage without airborne alert  duty here.    A final example. You are a pilot who detects a target at a  given line, but it is maneuvering and using jamming. Can you  shoot it down before it uses its long-range weapons? After all,  the depth of the air-to-air battle is growing.    Is there a solution? There is. As before, it consists of a  reasonable combination of modes of combat action. This does not  allow us to ignore airborne alert, although its cost continues  to be very high: sortie requirements are quickly expended, and  the flight personnel rapidly exhausted.    What is the attitude of fighter aviation today to the  "roving  patrol?" Does this mode have a right to life, or is it an  anachronism? After all, present-day control equipment and  systems provide for vectoring of fighters from ground and  airborne command posts against a quite large number of targets.  The needs for "roving patrols" are not limited, and it is  scarcely necessary to use them in the same value as in the years  of the Great Patriotic War. But anything can happen in a combat  situation: the adversary may deliver a strike on command and  control posts, apply electronic jamming, infiltrate decoy groups  of aircraft at different altitudes. And then the fighters will  again resort to the old but tested mode, which has been called  "independent search and destruction of aerial targets (hunt)."    The area of application of this mode is quite great. It  makes  it possible to intercept the adversary not only in a difficult  situation but also at maximum distance from the protected  targets, at low altitudes, where the best radars are helpless.  Fighters with weapons radars and powerful long-range weapons  will become a serious hazard to enemy aircraft in the depth of  his territory. Therefore. independent search and destruction of  targets is a mode of combat action which has not become a thing  of the past, has not become outmoded. It continues to be  relevant and is provided for in the combat regulations of the  air forces of many countries.    As in the past, pilots search in the assigned areas in  likely  directions of flight of the adversary, using weapons radars and  visual sighting. They are given complete freedom of action, but  such fighter tactics encounter a number of problems: how to  achieve secrecy of action over enemy territory, if it is covered  by a continuous radar field; how to overcome the resistance of  enemy air defense, and to avoid the destructive fire in  continues zones of engagement of SAMs; how to be the first to  detect high-speed targets and assume a favorable position for  their attack without using ground or airborne command posts.    Alas, these problems have not been resolved even today. But  then, the solution also depends on us. Thus, without laying  claim to specific conclusions regarding the role and place of  modes of combat action of fighter aviation in protecting troops  under different conditions, let us try to imagine the following  picture.    Fighters are assigned the mission of protecting troops. In  making his decision, the commander, of course, allows for the  expected nature of enemy actions, the possible range of his  detection, the dimensions of the protected area, and marks off  the points of engagement and zones of alert duty of the fighters  (if they are not determined by the senior officer). He will not  forget to also asses the composition of his own forces, and the  capabilities of the system of command and control, i.e.,  everything on which his choice of modes of combat action will  depend.    Upon receiving information on an impending mass raid, in  accordance with his decision the commander puts the fighters in  immediate readiness for takeoff, and if timely interception of  targets at the planned lines is not assured (for example at low  altitudes) he scrambles some of his forces to alert zones. Some  minutes later, the other subunits begin to take off according to  plans. They are given the mission of building up efforts of the  earlier-scrambled fighters, concentrating them to destroy the  most dangerous targets in the enemy grouping. Here there may be  various surprises (unfavorable correlation of forces, unforeseen  maneuver of individual targets, unsuccessful attacks of friendly  pilots), and the command cannot manage without a reserve, which  may be on the ground or in the air.    Leaving their airfield behind them, and then even their  troops, the pilots go further to the set lines. They know that  now the main thing is not to permit enemy strikes with  long-range precision weapons against the protected targets. Then  the first aircraft appear. The air-to-air battle begins.    Protection of troops continues. The enemy aircraft approach  the zones of destruction of the SAM systems. The fighters must  fight the battle in close coordination with them. How can their  joint efforts be coordinated? How can fighters ensure their  safety in zones of engagement of SAM complexes? We will return  to these questions in chapter IV.    The raid is repelled, but the threat remains. You see, the  enemy will shift to echeloned actions with small groups and  individual planes. Here is just the place for independent search  and destruction of air targets. The main forces of fighters will  restore combat readiness for repeat sorties, but at this same  time pair after pair of "hunters" will take off and proceed to  the enemy rear.    However, our commander has not allowed for one serious  circumstance, which escapes him in the earlier prevailing  stereotypes. You see, protection of troops today is one of the  components of accomplishing the general mission of foiling an  enemy invasion. Here fighter aviation faces a completely new  contradiction, arising from the essence of defensive military  doctrine. On the one hand, fighters must intercept the air enemy  at the far approaches to the protected targets, in order to  prevent their launch of air-to-ground missiles, and, on the  other, the points of engagement are bounded by the state border  until the fact of attack becomes obvious. But this is still not  all. For some amount of time the protected troops will be forced  to repel the attack of the adversary, and then shift to  counteroffensive actions. Thus organization of protection and  modes of combat action of fighter aviation vary according to the  conditions of the ground situation.    How can we compensate for these unfavorable factors? They  confront commanders of all levels with the urgent need to have  significant forces of fighters in the optimal combat readiness  to protect troops, to execute maneuvers along the front and in  depth to create the necessary correlation of forces in areas  where destruction of enemy aircraft before their launch of  missiles is still possible. Proceeding from the NATO concept of  "engaging second echelons (reserves)" troops must be protected  to the entire depth of their disposition.    Thus protection of troops remains a most important combat  mission of fighter aviation, which it accomplishes with diverse  modes of combat actions. The use of flexible tactics makes it  possible for the fighters to intercept the adversary at any  altitude, in any portion of the protected region, to quickly  concentrate efforts in remote approaches to the targets, and to  act beyond the limits of the continuous field of friendly radar.  <H5>  3. Supporting Other Aviation Arms </H5>   "I receive the mission with a group of pilots accompanying  the `Petlyakovs' (Pe-2 -- diver bomber). We fly to the region of  Belgorod to bomb the enemy airfield, where his `Junkers' are  based. The commander warned us that the airfield was strongly  defended by antiaircraft artillery, and there were  `Messerschmitts' on patrol aloft. Soon the group of bombers  approached the airfield. We took off at their signal. I had to  attentively watch the sky and structure the combat formation so  that the German AA gunners could not separate us from the  `Petlyakovs.' The main goal was to hit the airfield. Now it was  ahead of us. At the edge was a group of Junkers. The Pe-2  dropped their bombs on the move. The smoke from the explosions  covered the airfield. The Junkers took off in disarray. And our  bombers and fighters attacked them at takeoff, destroying them  in the air. The commander of the group of Petlyakovs radioed me  that the mission was accomplished, it was time to go home. I  ordered the fighters to cover the group of Petlyakovs with  special care from the flanks, where the bombers were more  vulnerable. We left the airfield quickly, disappearing as  suddenly as we had appeared." (Kozhedub, I.--"Vernost Otchiznye"  [Loyalty to the Fatherland], M.: Voyenizdat, 1975, pp 202-204.)    This excerpt from the memoirs of three-time Hero of the  Soviet Union I. Kozhedub uses the example of just one frontline  episode to show the content of the main method of combat actions  of fighters in supporting other aviation arms in the Great  Patriotic War, direct escort to the target and back. In those  years subunits and units which required protection flew  themselves to the fighter airfield or met them at a set line,  and then flew together, repelling attacks on the fighters by  enemy fighters. In turn the crews of the protected aircraft used  radio, signal flares, or tracers to inform the fighters of the  appearance of the enemy, and jointly with them delivered fire on  the enemy aircraft with their onboard weapons.    In preparing for a sortie to protect bombers, lines were  determined for the start and stop of the escort, formation of a  common battle formation, procedures of action when encountering  enemy fighters. At the same time, in order to raise reliability  of protection at the approach of the bombers to the targets,  where they usually encountered intensive resistance from enemy  fighters, provision was made for timely arrival of some of our  fighters at these targets, racing ahead of the protected  aircraft.    In addition to bombers, attack aircraft, which delivered  strikes on enemy troops, also required reliable protection from  enemy fighters. Coordinating units often were deployed at the  same airfield or were neighbors. This offered broad  opportunities for personal contacts to clarify details of the  coordination.    When protecting attack aircraft, the fighters usually formed  two groups: a strike force, which followed behind and above the  protected aircraft at the limits of visibility, and a local  protection force, which was on the flanks and behind the attack  aircraft (fig. 18). Upon approach to the target, the strike  force repelled attacks by enemy fighters trying to impede the  strike, and engaged them in battle if they patrolled over the  target. The local protection force drew away the attack of those  fighters which broke through to the attack aircraft through the  barrier of the strike force, and if possible jointly with the  attack aircraft they suppressed the fire of the enemy  antiaircraft battery.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-12A>      Figure 18. Fighter cover of Il-2 ground-attack aircraft during the Great Patriotic War </FIG>     These tactics of fighters in protecting bombers and attack  aircraft were retained through the entire war. The details might  change, but the characteristic features remained joint combat  formations, close coordination with protected aircraft,  attachment of the fighters to them, and defensive battle.    Joint combat formations strengthened crew confidence in  safety of their actions, promoted successful repulse of enemy  attacks, and allowed them to concentrate attention on searching  for targets and striking at them. But although fighters over  enemy territory could not count on information about the air  situation from the ground, and the buildup of forces in battle,  they operated ably and resolutely, bravely closed with the  enemy, and swiftly attacked him, not allowing him to get through  to the protected aircraft.    Later on, with an increase in the numerical strength of  fighter aviation, it began to practice a combination of modes of  combat action. In addition to forces allocated for escort,  groups were created to clear away enemy fighters, which left for  the target region 10 to 15 minutes before the start of the  strike and joint battle with them (sweep of air space). Groups  were also formed to blockade airfields of enemy fighters, and  reserve groups. They all operated according to a single plan  during delivery of massed strikes by aviation.    However, the main mode of combat actions remained direct  escort of attack aircraft and bombers, which achieved a high  level of sophistication. Preparation of fighters to perform the  missions was carried out jointly with the crews of supported  aircraft and ended with a joint rehearsal of the combat flight,  and after landing a similar general critique was conducted. If  possible the fighters were based with attack aircraft at the  same airfield.    In the postwar years, the importance of such effective  escort  decreased. As early as the Korean war, despite the allocation of  a significant amount of fighter aviation forces, the U.S.  bombers escorted by it suffered heavy losses. Thus in just one  raid (30 October 1951), in which eight B-29 bombers and 90  escort fighters participated, pilots of the Korean People's Army  destroyed all the bombers. (NEWSWEEK, 1961, 30 November).  Subsequently, the cases of high bomber losses became more  frequent. Not without surprise, foreign military specialists  conclude that this was not a regrettable exception from the  law-governed regularities of tactics, but rather a law-governed  regularity itself: direct escort had not justified itself.    The prevailing situation had two causes: the growth in  speeds  and parameters of maneuver was making itself felt more and more  in joint flight. Analyzing frontline examples (fig.18), one can  see that fighters executing an energetic maneuver did not lose  visual contact with the protected group. They had a great  advantage in speed over them, could shift freely from one flank  to the other, and concentrate forces in the threatened axis.    With the decrease in speed differences and increase in  maneuver parameters, the situation changed. In addition it  became more difficult for the fighters to be at intervals and  separations of certain visual observations of the protected  aircraft. Therefore, they were forced to pay more attention to  visual contact with them than to the search for the air enemy.  But most importantly, being tied down in this way deprived the  pilots of the initiative, the choice of the favorable moment to  join battle, and freedom of maneuver.    Indeed, just as a sentry cannot leave his post and go away  from the protected installation, an escort fighter cannot  abandon his place in the battle formation. But even a simple  turn of 180 degrees would separate the fighter from the group.  The pilots were told to join battle only in the event of urgent  necessity, to execute short maneuvers in order to be able to  resume their place in the combat formation. Any decoy actions,  feints and other tactical techniques were ruled out, but all  this did not solve the problem.    A little later the capabilities for direct escort were  narrowed even more. This time the reason was the entry of  air-to-air guided missiles into the armament of the enemy  fighters. They had a range of launch much exceeding the range of  visual contact of the fighters with their supported aircraft.  For timely repulse of attacks by an enemy using such missiles,  it was necessary to dispose the escort fighters beyond visual  contact with the strike forces. But the advent of all-aspect  missiles led to the need to defend them from all directions.  Direct escort was transformed into patrol escort.    The transition to patrol escort somewhat broadened the  capabilities of the fighters, but the basic drawbacks (being  tied to their place in the battle formation, constricted  maneuver) remained. In addition, in order to control a common  battle formation, in which the separations and intervals  significantly exceeded the range of visibility, required the  assistance of control points from the ground, which became  impossible over enemy territory. Therefore, hopes for patrol  escort proved to be vain, but leaving bombers without fighters  following them was even worse.    What next? Before answering, let us trace how conditions  change for providing protection of subunits and units of strike  aviation with fighter forces. New aircraft entering its armament  had higher performance in terms of speed and altitude, and  adequate power plant. This allowed them to fly to targets at  high speed and maneuver in a great range of altitudes. But  fighters protecting bombers continued to be restricted in  maneuver; in particular it was necessary to repel attacks of  enemy aircraft armed with guided missiles, from great range.  Therefore some aviation commanders, assuming that high speed,  maneuverability, and a great range of flight altitudes had  become the basic protection from enemy fighters, wondered if  protection of strike aviation by the forces of fighter aviation  was necessary at all.    It is not hard to see that the proponents of such views in  fact were denying not the need for protection of strike  aviation, but only one of the modes of combat action of  fighters, escort.    The traditional mode of fighter escort of aircraft of  tactical and strategic aviation convincingly demonstrated it  weak points back in the Vietnam war. The American press reported  that these aircraft, flying with a high bombing payload, could  not maintain a speed of more than 890 km/hr, and, despite their  escort by fighters en route and in the target region, were very  vulnerable to North Vietnamese fighters. Diving through the  battle formations of escort fighters at supersonic speed, they  confidently downed the protected aircraft. Although the American  pilots knew about this tactical technique, they had a difficult  time countering it. (ORDNANCE, 1976, No 11-12).    Later on the Americans changed to supporting strike aircraft  not only by an escort but also by sending out screening  elements, through patrols of long-range intercept forces in the  axes of possible appearance of enemy fighters, and also by  bottling up their airfields (fig. 19). All tactical groups move  initially in a common battle formation, and then, moving ahead  of the strike forces, they assume a position shown in the figure.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-14A>      Figure 19. Fighter support of other aviation arms (from experience of Vietnam War). Tactical </FIG>     I know that in analyzing figure 19, some readers will smile  skeptically: could we use the experience of Vietnam today? There  an aggressor possessing a significant superiority over the North  Vietnamese air forces could so lavishly expend his own fighter  forces. What place is there for escort, even patrol escort, if  there is no such superiority?    For an answer to these questions, let us turn to more recent  events. Ten years later in the Lebanon conflict of 1982, Israeli  F-15 and F-16 fighters abandoned their joint flights and any  contact with strike groups. In place of the traditional escort,  so inconvenient for the fighters, interaction with them occurred  in the time and along lines at the boundaries of the strike  region. Before arrival of the strike forces at the targets, the  fighters moved forward and formed multi-tiered screens. There  was one other factor promoting such actions. This entire region  was under radar surveillance from an airborne command post (E-2C  Hawkeye), which monitored the air situation and corrected the  actions of the strike forces and fighter cover.    Today those problems which were resolved in protecting  strike  forces in local wars, are history, are partially forgotten and  overshadowed by new problems. The increase in capabilities of  strike aviation, but mainly the changed conditions of combat  action due to the demands of defensive doctrine, have exerted a  definitive influence on their onset. While complying with the  principle of defensive sufficiency, which provides for the  minimal necessary amount of military equipment and personnel to  repel a possible aggression, despite the high performance of the  aircraft, the proficiency and vigilance of the commanders, one  cannot count on superiority of forces. In addition, when  delivering a retaliatory-meeting strike or retaliatory strike,  aviation will meet the resistance of an unsuppressed or weakly  suppressed enemy air defense system and its fighters.    So what today is the role of fighter aviation, given the  current level and quality of aviation equipment, what modes can  ensure successful protection of strike aviation operating en  masse in dispersed battle formations, using long-range precision  weapons and powerful EW equipment?    The growing danger to strike aviation from enemy fighters on  the one hand, and the high combat properties of  fourth-generation fighters on the other, undoubtedly will raise  the role of fighter aviation, but depend on further improvement  in the modes of its combat action. One can scarcely assume that  all is evident here. After all, the search for new ways in any  sphere of activity is always associated with resolution of a  number of problems. In the sphere of protection of strike  aviation by fighter forces, today one can discern at least three  primary problems:    - How to eliminate the element of "delay" inherent in the  nature of defense, and ensure adequate readiness of fighter  aviation (and of strike aviation) for protection in multivariant  conditions? Unreadiness, slowness to make decisions or to  scramble fighters may lead to a loss of combat capacity even  before the start of a retaliatory strike.    - How to ensure electronic compatibility of onboard  electronics of the protected aircraft and the weapons radars of  the fighters? The weakly perceptible interference to weapons  radars in protecting individual small groups of bombers proves  significantly stronger in massed strikes of aviation, when it  operates in large groups, and [such interference] may seriously  complicate the air situation for the covering fighters.    - How to protect aircraft of strike aviation, and  particularly those of long-range aviation, delivering strikes on  remote targets deep in the enemy rear?    The first of these problems is resolved in the general  context of raising the combat readiness of fighter aviation to  repel aggression, the second is a field for military engineer  solutions, the third deserves detailed discussion.    We know that until recently protection of long-range  aircraft  was possible only when they were flying through the pre-frontal  zone. The reason for this was the comparatively small tactical  radius of action of the fighters. Then the bombers had to  overcome the enemy air defense independently, relying on their  onboard EW equipment and defensive armament.    With the advent of Su-27s, which one can rightly call  long-range fighters (maximum flight range 4,000 km), in the  fighter armament, the situation has now changed. Potential  opportunities have appeared for protection of aviation en route  to the targets to the launch lines of air-to-surface missiles  and back. To a significant degree the capabilities designed into  different aircraft systems to observe the air space, determine  the relative coordinates of the fighters and the protected  aircraft at long range, and the capabilities of commanders to  control wingmen in a multiple-aircraft air-to-air battle have  been enhanced.    However, potential opportunities are still not reality. In  order to realize them, it is necessary to develop the most  beneficial modes and variants of fight at various altitudes, and  in the future to assimilate airborne refueling of fighters, and,  no less important, high proficiency and training of pilots,  their ability to take full advantage of the new capabilities of  the equipment.    But this is only one aspect of the problem. There is  another.  The increase in range and the duration of flight has a negative  influence on the functional state and working capacity of the  crews of all aircraft, especially one-seaters. It becomes ever  more difficult to "conquer space and time." But the literature  devoted to such questions still modestly avoids this aspect. But  can one fail to allow for such negative factors as hypodynamia,  long hours spent in the flight gear and special equipment in a  constricted working posture, the impossibility of meeting  natural needs, etc. After all, this leads to muscle fatigue, the  onset of painful sensations, reduction in activeness of mental  processes. And this in the depth of enemy territory, where the  air situation is filled to the limit with critical, stressful  situations, and where complications cannot be avoided without  maintaining the work capacity of the pilots at the very highest  level!    Further automation of the processes of aircraft and weapons  control, development of combat decision-making algorithms in  standard situations, the inculcation in the pilots of high  morale, aggressiveness, and psychological qualities, prevention  of discomfort -- compliance with the preflight regimen of rest  and nourishment, the choice of size and adjustment of the flight  gear, creation of special medications, urinals... one can  enumerate and enumerate such measures for escape from a critical  situation. But we are more interested in the development of  modes of combat action of fighter aviation in protecting strike  aviation.    Indisputably we cannot discard the experience of the past,  and of exercises conducted in our times. This experience, with  allowance for the capabilities of modern fighter aircraft, shows  that a concentration of efforts of fighter aviation on the  protection not of individual groups, but of the entire aviation  element in the air, in accordance with its operational-tactical  structure, with strict delimitation of actions in terms of time  and lines, is most preferable. Here, within the framework of the  air strike to be delivered, and for its entire depth, the  fighter groups can move in an echelon to break through the air  defenses, sweeping the air space, and combine this mode of  combat action with screens in the air. The latter can move in  the direction of the airfields from which the appearance of  enemy fighters is expected. Such a combination of modes of  combat action to some degree promotes economy of fighter forces,  and consequently corresponds to the principle of defensive  sufficiency.    As for patrol escort of strike forces, although it is being  improved on a new basis, it requires the recruitment of large  fighter forces, and can be adequately effective when there are  reliable resources for observation of the air situation and  control of the fighters (e.g., AWACS planes), and also when good  electronic compatibility of avionics of the protected aircraft  and fighters is achieved.    It goes without say that along with improvement of these  traditional modes of combat action of fighter aviation, the very  conditions of protection force a new look at the capabilities of  fighters, and a quest for other modes. One of them might be  decoy (distracting) actions of small forces (pairs, flights) of  fighters over a wide front, in order to complicate the enemy's  air situation and scatter efforts of manpower and resources of  his air defense. Routes, altitudes, and time of flight of the  fighters should be chosen so that the enemy cannot retarget his  fighters, scrambling to intercept decoys, against strike forces.  Maneuvering energetically, they will also help aviation to  overcome SAM resistance, which constitutes no less of a threat  to it. But it is important that fighters operating as decoy  elements also have equipment to generate active and passive  jamming.    So what combination of modes of combat action should we  consider to be rational? It all depends on the specific  situation. Let us assume that the fighters are given the mission  of supporting the combat actions of a subunit or unit in  delivery of a strike against a target in the depth of enemy  territory. Will the protected aircraft operate at high altitude  or low outside the zones of visibility of ground radars, over a  region with strong enemy air defense, or in a zone where it is  suppressed? What resistance is expected from enemy fighters,  will friendly forces be enough for a patrol escort? All these  and other factors of the situation must be taken into account by  the commander making the decision. However, in all cases he must  precisely coordinate the actions of his different tactical  forces with the actions of the supported subunit or unit,  clarify the route, the mission profile, the time of takeoff and  arrival at the target of the strike, procedures for flight to  the target and over the target. Otherwise, even the best modes  of combat action of the fighters will have little effectiveness.    Here one should allow for one other circumstance. One has to  be a great optimist to assume that by attacking first the  aggressor will not be able to put out of commission the great  part of the fighter control posts, create gaps in the continuous  radar field of the defending side. Therefore, while in the past  integrated use of modes of combat action were planned for over  the enemy territory, now it becomes necessary also over friendly  forces, with minimal participation of ground posts in command  and control.    Further development of the modes of combat action of fighter  aviation is a continuous process, reflecting complex, largely  contradictory and still unsettled tendencies in the nature of  use of strike aviation, in the improvement of the air defense  system opposing it, and in the growth of combat capabilities of  the fighters themselves. I will not take the risk of making such  predictions. The influence of many factors still remains  unknown, and now only some of them can be designated, for  example:    - How to protect aircraft of strike aviation from  prospective  tactical fighters, armed with long and intermediate range  missiles, capable of launching them simultaneously against  several bombers.    - How to protect aircraft with reduced signatures, developed  by low- signature technology ("stealth" technology, as it is  called abroad), without giving them away by one's own position.    All this testifies to the fact that the modes of combat  action of fighter aviation in protecting strike aviation are  again on the eve of changes.  <H5>  4. In Aerial Reconnaissance </H5>   A pair of YaK-7 fighters took off for reconnaissance of  fascist tanks. The adversary was protecting the region of their  concentration with antiaircraft weapons, and his fighters  patrolled continuously in the air. Under such conditions, it was  hard for the multi-seat scout aircraft to penetrate to the  target. That was the way fighters were doing the reconnaissance.    The front line was crossed. The pair leader scrutinized the  winding ribbons of country roads and woods while the wingman  watched the sky. Steep climb, dive, turn left, right... There  were the block boxes, hiding at the woodline. There were many of  them, they were camouflaged and hard to see, but the leader made  a count. The air defense gunners were quiet, apparently so as  not to give away the position of the tanks, but the wingman saw  four Messerschmitts which were already turning for the attack.  The scouts could not get tied up in battle. Ably maneuvering,  the escaped their pursuit. However, back home quickly with the  valuable information...    Fighter/scouts conducted aerial reconnaissance in the  tactical depth of the enemy chiefly through visual observation.  They moved to their reconnaissance targets covertly and  unexpected. The proximity of basing to the front line, and the  flight speed, higher than that of the multi-seater scout planes,  allowed the fighters to rapidly perform the aerial  reconnaissance and return to their airfield, although even  before the war it was thought that fighter aviation could be  called on to perform aerial reconnaissance only if it did not  harm accomplishment of basic combat missions. At the start of  the war, when our reconnaissance aviation suffered heavy losses,  the reconnaissance data of the fighters was successively used to  deliver crushing strikes on the enemy.    "The scout himself has a hard time determining the value of  the information he brings sometimes," three-time Hero of the  Soviet Union A. Pokryshkin recalled one of his scouting sorties  in November 1941, when large forces of Hitlerites in Von  Kleist's tank group managed to evade surveillance of our  reconnaissance. "But the grouping of German tanks that I found  proved such an important `find' that they talked about it in the  staff for a whole week... Kleist's group did not succeed in  delivering the surprise strike on our troops." (Pokryshkin, A.I.  Nebo voyny [The Skies of War], M.: Voyenizdat, 1966, p 158.)    Many such episodes also occurred in the subsequent war  years.  Fighter/scouts of the 163rd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment in  the Belorussian offensive operation on 1 July 1944 detected  about 600 to 700 vehicles, more than 800 carts, and up to 20,000  hitleites at the crossing of the Berezina river in the region of  Shevernychi. This sortie had very important consequences. "I  will always remember the terrible pictures of our destruction,"  testified one imprisoned fascist soldier after they were  subjected to a fierce air strike based on reconnaissance data.  (TsAMO, F. 319, op. 4798, d. 186, l. 18; op. 4800, d. 71, l.  184.)    The development of tactics of aerial reconnaissance was  dynamic and at times unpredictable in the postwar years. Its  conditions and capabilities changed rapidly, but tactical  techniques of fighters were always aimed at resolving two  interrelated problems: uncovering the targets of reconnaissance,  which were becoming smaller and smaller, and mobile, and  overcoming the resistance of the enemy air defense, which was  growing swiftly with the advent of all-weather interceptors and  SAMs.    Uncovering small and camouflaged targets posed a special  difficulty for the fighters. In contrast to the specialized  scout planes, they did not have different kinds of  reconnaissance equipment on board, and therefore could not  detect objects from their IR radiation, operation or electronic  equipment, and other such tell-tale signs. As in the war years,  the basic method of aerial reconnaissance for the fighters was  visual observation. But with the transition of fighter aviation  from piston to jet aircraft, the time of possible observation of  targets, especially at low altitude, was sharply reduced, and  the maneuverability of the fighters was degraded. In the time  spent in executing turns, steep climbs, which now had  significantly greater spatial dimensions, the scouts drew  further away from their targets than they had previously.    Overcoming enemy air defense in aerial reconnaissance is  unavoidable, since the fighters have to enter enemy territory.  With distance from friendly forces, they were no longer observed  by command and control post radars, and therefore were deprived  of the opportunity of receiving specific commands for evasion of  antiaircraft fire and to avoid encountering enemy fighters.    Thus fighters did not have time to search for and identify  targets at low altitude, and switching to medium and high  altitudes increased their vulnerability to enemy air defense  assets. It was necessary to find a solution to the prevailing  contradiction, and it was found chiefly through the development  of new types of maneuvers. One of them is shown in figure 20.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-17A>      Figure 20. High-speed reconnaissance of small objective </FIG>     The fighters would approach the target at extremely low  altitude, concealing themselves in the terrain relief, and  conducted observation using a climbing turn, examining the  target in the direction of the turn (fig. 20a). The observation  time was increased, but if it was not possible to completely  uncover the target and "tie" it to the map, the observation was  continued in a climbing spiral (fig. 20b). This maneuver was  simultaneously an evasion of antiaircraft fire.    Let us move on to today. In studying the experience of local  wars, western military specialists believe that it is almost  impossible for aerial scouts to achieve surprise when flying in  a continuous radar field of the adversary, so they concluded  that maximal involvement of fighters in aerial reconnaissance  was necessary, due to their capablity of operating in a  difficult combat environment more successfully than other  aircraft. In their opinion, fighter/scouts could be assigned to  obtain data about the enemy on the battlefield, and in the  tactical depth in the interests of ground forces, and also  followup reconnaissance of targets before delivery of strikes,  and guidance of aviation strike forces to the targets they  detect. Here it was recommended that fighters be assigned  acquisition of reconnaissance data in those cases when great  precision of information was not necessary, or if it was  necessary to check dubious data, clarify information about  targets detected by other types of reconnaissance. (Signal,  1984, No. 1).    So what are the tactics of fighter/scouts today? They  generally operate in pairs. The basic method of reconnaissance  remains the traditional visual observation. However with the  increased complexity of conditions and targets of  reconnaissance, a tendency toward supplementing this method with  others has been noted: aerial photography and the use of  electronics. For this the fighters may carry suspended  containers with photographic, IR, and optoelectronic apparatus,  the makeup of which is determined before takeoff in accordance  with the content of the assigned reconnaissance mission.    Clearly the integrated use of methods of aerial  reconnaissance expands the possibilities of the fighters to  accomplish it, allows them to accomplish more difficult and  extensive tasks, but the search for targets has by no means  become less difficult. It suffices to put a canopy-type cover  over the target, to lay down a smokescreen, or simply to light a  fire nearby, and the target will become invisible to  photographic or IR equipment. The search for camouflaged targets  therefore still demands the appropriate tactical techniques and  a combination of them with techniques for overcoming enemy air  defense. The scouts are forced to constantly change course, to  execute maneuvers to avoid fighters, foil missile guidance, and  all this must not interfere with observation of the targets.    There are more than enough techniques of aerial  reconnaissance, but their general features include energetic  maneuvering in the horizontal and vertical planes, arrival at  targets from extremely low altitude, and from axes not expected  by the enemy, the use of the weak aspects of his air defense.  But this means that fighter/scouts must study the situation in  detail in which they must operate, know how to find their  bearings well in the terrain, know the tell-tale signs of  various targets, where they are located, their status and nature  of functioning.    These demands were also imposed on fighter/scouts in the  past, but today other and higher demands are imposed on them, as  on other aerial scouts. This is understandable. The problem of  providing complete and reliable information to troops and  aviation has become too difficult and multi-faceted, the number  of targets has grown sharply, and they must be observed with  great frequency.    It is not worth considering all the requirements affecting  aerial reconnaissance as a whole; I shall allow myself to dwell  only on one, the most important of them -- timeliness of  reconnaissance. Even the most complete and reliable data cannot  be used if they arrive late. Enemy missile complexes discovered  by scouts can fire their missiles, enemy aircraft can take off  from airfields before strikes can be made against them. And  indeed, other targets in the time from their detection until the  delivery of strikes against them can change their location, the  strike forces must spend a long time looking for them, structure  additional maneuvers for the strike, and this leads to loss of  surprise and the negative consequences that entails.    Aerial reconnaissance undoubtedly is a specific task  demanding special training of flight personnel, and it is  assigned chiefly to non-organic, pre-trained subunits of  fighters. However it would not be excessive for all pilots to  constantly train at the conduct of en-route aerial  reconnaissance.    Lofty responsibility is placed on fighters in the conduct of  reconnaissance. For the pilots' commanders organizing it expect  speed of action both in the acquisition and in the delivery of  data. Decisions are made on their basis, troops go into battle,  aviation is scrambled from airfields. The more dynamic and tense  the situation, the stronger the weapons, and the greater the  damage they may inflict on the enemy, the higher responsibility  of scouts for undelivered strikes, or strikes delivered against  decoy targets.    In order to reduce the time required for reconnaissance,  fighters are on alert duty at airfields, in constant readiness  for sortie, and in the most tense periods of combat action, may  pull alert duty in the air (zones). But even these measures may  prove insufficient. With further intensification of demands for  timeliness of reconnaissance, the issue will be combining it  with strikes against detected targets. This means that  fighter/scouts must know how to precisely and accurately destroy  ground targets.  <H5>  5. Fire Crowns the Reconnaissance </H5>   The mission was an urgent one: the squadron of Yak-7  fighters  was to deliver a strike on a column of Hitlerite vehicles and  infantry based on the data of aerial reconnaissance. The column  was a large one, no less than 120 units. Detected by scouts some  15-20 minutes earlier, it was moving swiftly westward. In  addition there were woods all around, and the fascists could  camouflage themselves. There was no time to lose, and the  squadron was already in the air. Its battle formation, according  to the commander's decision, consisted of a strike force and a  covering force. By relieving one another, they could take turns  attacking the target and provide mutual protection from enemy  fighters. The leader saw the target from far off, a long line of  vehicles on a narrow road. A steep turn and the pilots raced to  the attack against the vanguard of the column. Fire! The lead  vehicles blazed up and poured out smoke, an enormous "plug"  formed on the road, which had no detours, and more and more  vehicles drew up. The covering force replaced the strike force...    This episode occurred on 12 July 1944 in the Belorussian  offensive operation. (TsAMO, F. 319, op. 4798, d. 186, l.  19-20). At that time the Soviet air forces had long held air  superiority, the activity of the Hitlerite aviation had  diminished, and fighters were called on more and more for  delivery of strikes against concentrates of enemy personnel and  equipment.    The tactical techniques of the fighters largely were  identical to those of the Il-2 attack aircraft. The pilots  strove to attack the enemy unexpectedly from out of the sun or  from low altitude, in order that the fascists not have time to  scatter to the sides of the roads and open fire, and they  distributed targets in the strike objective beforehand. Most  convenient were attacks from a chandelle [boyevoy razvorot] (the  wing and fuselage of the aircraft did not cover the target).  Repeated attacks were made with additional maneuvers, which were  determined depending on the nature of resistance of the target  (return fire, dispersion, or camouflage).    Naturally time has left its mark on accomplishment of this  combat mission by fighter aviation. First of all, the speed and  maneuver characteristics have changed, the armament is more  powerful, and the range and accuracy of engagement of targets  has increased. Second, the area air defense has been  strengthened, but to use certain weapons' systems, after missile  launch, fighters require some time to continue flight toward the  target, and this increases their vulnerability to SAM fire.  Third, the ground targets themselves have changed. There are now  very many of them, ones which were unknown in the Great  Patriotic War. Missile launchers, radar, SAM, multiple rocket  launcher positions, helicopters on landing pads -- all these are  small, camouflaged targets which can change their position  quickly, and it is not so easy to identify and engage them. But  these targets are weakly armored, and can be destroyed by  fighter weapons.    These three circumstances cannot but influence the  development of fighter tactics. However, as in the past, the  fighters operate against ground targets when it does not harm  accomplishment of their basic combat missions. Otherwise, this  would contradict the basic purpose of fighter aviation. Whereas  during the conduct of aerial reconnaissance, pilots have to  combine this with delivery of strikes against moving columns of  enemy troops and combat equipment, when supporting other  aviation arms, air defense assets will be possible targets, if  there are no enemy fighters in the air. Here the pilots' tasks  are very limited: not to destroy, but to hold in place, restrict  maneuver or simply unmask the adversary, suppress his air  defense weapons for a short time in order to create favorable  conditions for subsequent air or missile strikes. But in all  situations the pilots must maintain constant readiness to fight  air-to-air battles.    However in considering only passing strikes on ground  targets, do we not understand the question too narrowly? After  all, modern fighters are also capable of independent actions  against enemy airfields. They can participate in air support of  troops, supplementing the strikes of fighter-bombers and combat  helicopters.    After this short recollection of present-day conditions of  action of fighters against ground targets, let us look at the  commander who makes the decision for precisely such an  independent strike. Here there is food for thought. Clearly the  commander, upon clarifying the received mission, will consider  the required deadlines for its accomplishment, assess the target  characteristics, their range, and the completeness of the  information about them. He will also allow for the expected  resistance of enemy air defenses, the capabilities of his  aircraft, the level of proficiency of the flight personnel, and  of course the terrain relief, the presence of characteristic  reference points, and weather.    In the search for an optimal decision to strike, the  commander is confronted by the following crucial questions: how  to rationally distribute the fighter forces among the assigned  or chosen targets and available time, what battle formation to  take, how to attack the targets? Let us try to answer these  questions with the commander. However, we must stipulate that  without knowing the conclusions that the commander made in  clarifying the mission and evaluating the specific situation,  the answers might not be unequivocal.    How should fighter forces be distributed to accomplish the  mission? We shall propose three different variants to the  commander. He can for example mass the efforts by delivering a  simultaneous strike against a preset target at a specific time.  If the situation demands long-term action against the same  target, or not so many fighter forces, the commander clearly  will find it more expedient to operate with individual flights  and pairs. In a complex and unclear situation, he will most  likely decide to perform the mission by operating with limited  fighter forces.    It goes without saying that there may also be other  variants.  In accordance with them, the commander distributes fighters  among tactical groups, i.e., shifts to solution of the second  crucial question -- determination of the battle formation. The  commander must consider the different variants for its  structure. If the strike objective is protected by a strong air  defense, and there are enemy fighters patrolling in the air, if  it is difficult to seek out and identify the target in the  terrain, it will be necessary to create the tactical troops  shown in figure 21. But analyze this distribution of forces: the  combat strength of the supporting groups is 1.5 times greater  than that of the strike force! Is such a ratio advisable? Here  is why the commanders strive to combine the functions of the  groups to the extent possible. For example, the group for  suppression of the air defense weapons may be given the  functions of followup reconnaissance of the target, and the  group providing cover against enemy fighter attacks may change  places with the strike force after it delivers its strike, as  was the case in the cited example.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-19A>      Figure 21. Battle formation of fighters operating against a ground target. Group tactical </FIG>     And the third crucial question: how to attack the target?  Attack on the move from extremely low altitude--1; or first  execute a vertical maneuver--2 (fig. 22)? In using the first  tactical technique, the pilots may simply not have time to  detect the target and aim at high speed, and the attack will be  unsuccessful. The second tactical technique reduces the surprise  of the attack -- the time spent by the pilots in executing the  maneuver is adequate for the enemy to fire on them with SAMs.  How can this contradiction be resolved?   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-20A>      Figure 22. Fighter attack of ground target. </FIG>     Just as in the answers to previous questions, one should not  expect ready-made recommendations. Rote prescriptions will not  work for all tactical situations. One must be able to make  independent and able decisions.    Here is one possible variant: if a flight delivers a strike  on a ground target, and the first pair cannot attack on the move  after the target is detected, it radios the target indication to  the second pair, and itself executes a vertical maneuver and  subsequent attack from a dive, as shown in Figure 22. The second  pair makes the necessary turn to target and attacks it on the  move, simultaneously suppressing the air defense weapons. A  different situation may also develop: the first pair after  detection of the target is capable of attacking it from the  move. Then the second pair can either execute a vertical  maneuver in order to better see the target, or also attack from  the move. Everything is determined by the specific features of  the target disposition, the enemy air defense weapons, and the  level of your proficiency.    What follows from our discussions? Actions against ground  targets is a combat mission of fighter aviation demanding  different modes of combat action, battle formations, tactical  techniques, and consequently also thorough training of the  fighter pilots for its accomplishment, in combination of  training in air-to-air combat, which occupies the main place in  the activity of fighter pilots. Thus for example the leaders of  the U.S. Air Force plan additional theoretical and flight  training for fighters to deliver strikes against ground targets.  Each pilot of an F-15 fighter makes 18 flights every six months  to practice the skills of fire on ground targets and, after the  fire, provision is made for the conduct of air-to-air battles.  (AVIATION WEEK, 1984, No. 12).  <H8>  * * * </H8>   Much has changed in the tactics of fighter aviation since  the  end of the Great Patriotic War, but all of its basic combat  missions have remained unchanged, have become classical, and  received further development. New ones have also appeared, for  example, destruction of airborne assaults, disruption of aerial  transports of the enemy, the battle with targets which  previously did not exist (early warning and detection aircraft,  reconnaissance-strike complexes, etc.) The tactics of fighter  aviation in accomplishment of these tasks have their own  specific features.    The development of fighter aviation tactics in  accomplishment  of combat missions occurs simultaneously with the improvement of  aviation equipment. This shall be discussed further.  <H5>  Chapter II. The Labyrinthine Links of Tactics and Technology </H5>   The development of tactics and technology occurs in a  dialectical unit and interrelationship. A qualitative leap in  technology calls to life new tactical techniques, and the  development of technology in turn engenders new types of  weapons. An experienced reader on reading these lines will  shrug: who is not familiar with this well-known theoretical  precept? This is so, but let us level deeper into the  labyrinthine links, and we will find many facts there which,  alas, contradict this precept.  <H5>  1. "Tactics Must Because Technology Can't"; "Technology Can </H5> So Tactics Don't Have To"  <H5>  Missiles or Cannon? </H5>   In the vivid blue sky, an air-to-air battle is under way,  one  can see the flash of silver wings, hear the booming thump of the  airborne cannons. First-generation jets, possessing only cannon  for now, are fighting. But the spatial dimensions of the battle  region of the new aircraft are no long the same (after all,  their speed is 350-400 km/hr faster than that of piston planes),  and the old weapons do not allow them to deliver fire from long  range. Therefore the air warriors, as during the Great Patriotic  War, still strive to close with one another to a range of  200-300 meters. As a result of intensive maneuvering in the air,  the same familiar "carousel" arose, but no irresistible attacks  resulted.    Tactics dictated its demands to technology, and this led to  the advent of air-to-air guided missiles. Of course the first  missiles were not sufficiently reliable in battle, but they had  a very valuable quality, the capacity to hit the adversary at  long range. So how did events develop further?    Guided missiles became the basic type of fighter weapon. The  arena of the air-to-air battle immediately expanded. The  adversary had only to enter any point in the possible missile  launch region at target engagement range unattainable by cannon,  and he was close to victory, even with the launch of a single  missile. And then the years-long monopoly of the cannon, which  knew no rivals, was destroyed, and with it collapsed all the  tactics of fighters based on cannon fire. Missiles fully  supplanted the cannon, which had been removed from the armament  by the end of the 50s. Fighters became "pure" missile platforms.    However, soon there was cause to regret this bitterly. It  turned out that missiles developed to engage targets from long  range, and possessing restrictions in minimal range and launch  aspect, G forces and altitude of utilization, could not replace  cannon in close combat. With the start of maneuver, missiles  would pass by. For example, in the first year of the Vietnam  War, of every 11 Sidewinder missiles fired by American fighters,  only one hit the target. (INTERAVIA. 1974, No. 12). After  unsuccessful missile launch, pilots closed with the targets, but  had nothing to engage them with, and the number of missiles on  board did not exceed two to four. And there were failures, still  not understood, which, despite the desperate attempts of the  pilots to execute the missile launch, led to break-off of the  attack. The unreliability of the weapons took away their  confidence in battle, a necessary condition for victory. Later  on, the influence of electronic jamming on the missiles added to  these shortcomings.    Thus it was found that missiles are far from being the ideal  weapon, especially to engage a maneuvering adversary at close  range. After expenditure of a limited number of missiles, the  fighter became virtually unarmed. But even cannon did not have  high effectiveness. No dialectical unit in the development of  technology and tactics was achieved. A paradox arose in the  labyrinthine interrelationship, which could be formulated as:  "Tactics have to -- technology can't."    What was to be done? It was necessary to again mount those  same cannon on fighters. Despite their inherent short range and  narrow sector of fire, they again demonstrated greater  simplicity of design and reliability than missiles, had no  limitations of minimal firing range, and in addition were slow  to become outmoded. To this day modern fighters have cannon, and  evidently they will stay on prospective aircraft.    However, the second birth of cannon did not lead to a  reduction in the role of missiles. Today fighters can launch  them from long and short range, at any aspects. The missiles  have significantly larger launch zones, high maneuver and  energy-ballistic characteristics, and this allows the pilots to  destroy air targets flying several kilometers higher than the  fighters. There are short-range missiles to engage visible  targets, allowing surprise attack from the most diverse  positions. The jamming resistance of the missiles is growing  constantly.    But then what is the point of the cannon? It is this: like  any other weapons system, missiles have their own restrictions  and their joint use with cannon allows the fighters to attack  the adversary under conditions when missiles are not effective  enough. One can even avoid all-aspect missiles if the  appropriate maneuver is made ahead of time, and not only avoid,  but in the process enter the field of fire of one's own cannon.  Cannon also remain invulnerable to electronic jamming.    Improvement of missiles forces the designers to search for  ways also to improve the cannon of fighters. How many models of  aircraft cannon have been devised by engineering thought!  Multi-barrel and single-barrel ones of the revolver type,  20-millimeter and higher caliber cannon. Tactics demand  increased fire density, and the rate of fire of the guns grows,  require that the range of fire be increased, and the initial  velocity of the rounds is increased, require that the accuracy  be improved, and rounds are designed which are guided in their  trajectory, with proximity fuzes, new sighting and computing  devices are devised, a system for display on the front of the  cockpit canopy, systems using holographic lenses and liquid  crystals -- all this in order to meet the demands of tactics.    As we see, ultimately the paradox of "tactics have to,  technology can't" has exhausted itself. However in the  labyrinthine interrelations one can also observe the opposite  paradoxes, "technology can, tactics don't have to."  <H5>  These Insidious Properties of Speed </H5>   The beginning of the jet era was marked by a great leap in  speed of aircraft, which immediately increased by 350-400 km/hr  in comparison with the speed of piston aircraft. Limited  capabilities of pilots to search for and destroy targets at such  speeds were compensated for by weapons radars and guided  missiles. The framework of battle covered the range of  supersonic speeds and penetrated the stratosphere. Command posts  with ground radars were included in command and control. An  unprecedented takeoff of design thinking, brilliant solution of  seemingly impossible problems in the tactics of fighter  aviation! Using the great flight speed, fighters could more  quickly assume a favorable position for battle and announce  their appearance with a crushing missile strike from long range  before the adversary could make a defensive maneuver or even see  the attackers.    By the end of the 50s, in the views of many military  theorists the logic of the air-to-air battle appeared as  follows: guidance of the fighter from the ground, closing with  the target in a straight trajectory, single lightning attack and  launch of missiles in flight at high speed in a straight line.  In order to vanquish the adversary, it was necessary to see him  first and have time to launch the missiles. Therefore the  success of battle was determined basically by the competition of  the sides in the range of detection of ground and airborne  radars. The close maneuver battle in the classical scheme of  intercept was not envisaged; what is more it was recommended to  the pilots that they avoid guns, since they lead to rapid loss  of speed.    To please the then-common concepts and demands of tactics on  technology, aviation designers of the leading countries of the  world were absorbed by the problem of achieving great speeds in  their development of prospective fighters. While fighters by the  start of the 50s had a speed corresponding to M = 0.8-0.9, in  the 60s it had already reached M = 2.2 and more. The triumphant  growth of speed was not halted either by technical difficulties  or by significant economic expenditures, but one other problem  was noted here, which had the most serious consequences: such  great speeds could not be used by the fighters in air-to-air  battles.    Here was cause for surprise: why had all fighters during the  Second World War resorted to maximum speed quite often, and  their descendants could not realize these speeds? The answer to  this question demanded serious examination of objective  processes of technologic development. If military theorists  could somehow predict the vicissitudes of air-to-air battle at  subsonic speeds, the absurdity of the arising situation put them  at an impasse. Yet another paradox? The fact was that high  supersonic speeds narrowed the field of possible attacks and  ruled out maneuvering at short distances. Indeed, the flight  itself of the fighter to interception, which was almost  programmed, presupposed straight-line movement of the air  target, and was not marked by great diversity of variants.  Arrival at the point of detection of the target was based on  standard, already practiced maneuvers. But it is much easier to  deceive a pre-entered program after it has been used several  times.    Reality confirmed this. Air-to-air battles of fighters in  local wars usually included not one but several attacks and  maneuvers between attacks. In these battles, speed in itself  meant little. It had importance only jointly with the  established G force, i.e., the capacity to maneuver. The pilots  sought as quickly as possible to turn and reach the area of  possible attacks, but the radiuses and time of the turns of the  fighters had increased so much that they went beyond the limits  of visual contact with the adversary and could not continue the  battle. Therefore, they had to deliberately operate only in a  range of subsonic speeds.    And now we again must ask ourselves: where here is the  dialectical unity in the development of tactics and technology?  Something unacceptable had occurred -- "technology can, tactics  don't have to." Speed or maneuverability? Which characteristics  should be preferred, if they are difficult to separate from one  another, if they are directly related and mutually caused?    In the search for acceptable answers to these questions,  military specialists largely reached the conclusion that to  conduct air-to- air-battles fighters were needed with flight  characteristics ensuring high angular velocities and  accelerations, minimal turning radiuses, and good  controllability in a broad range of altitudes. But the maximum  speed, in their opinion, must correspond to M = 2-2.5. (FLUG  REVUE, 1970, VII.) The way out of this paradox was not long in  coming. The tendency of continuous growth in speed continued  until the end of the 60s. In the last twenty years, however, the  speed of fighters has not vitally increased, but has not  diminished either. This tendency toward restriction of speed is  surprisingly stable.    It turns out that the well-known motto of aviation, "fly  higher, further, and faster" requires clarification for  fighters. It is not always necessary to fly fastest. Of course,  we cannot discard the former motto, but a supplement to it  suggests itself: fly fastest only before the start of battle.  The precept has not changed even today. Pilots of the F-15  fighter argue that upon detection of targets even at long range  (75 km) and in flight at maximum speed they do not have time to  lock on, track, and air, resulting in breakoff of the attacks.  <H5>  Single-Purpose or Multi-Purpose Fighter? </H5>   The high performance requirements on aircraft and their  armament, formulated in resolution of the first two paradoxes,  led to a third, confronting military scientists and designers  with a dilemma: single-purpose or multi-purpose fighter?    Initially a characteristic feature in aircraft construction  was the development of single-purpose fighters, specially  adapted for the conduct of air-to-air combat (in the foreign  press they were called air superiority fighters). The basic  demands on them: great thrust-to-weight ratio  [tyagovooruzhennost], exceeding flight weight; low specific load  on the wing; high strength of construction, intended for high G  forces; good acceleration characteristics and climb; sight and  weapons for long-range and close combat, making it possible to  detect and attack targets flying higher, lower, and to the side  against a background of clutter. (AVIATION AND MARINE. 1976, No.  29).    Colossal sums were spent to develop single-purpose aircraft,  many years were required, and such fighters (F-15 and F-16) were  constructed in the U.S. in the early 70s. Subsequently they  assigned them two equivalent tasks, so that they be used for  actions against ground targets, and called them multi-purpose  aircraft. However it was soon found that in contrast to former  generations such expensive aircraft were little suited for this.    The paradoxical nature of the prevailing situation lay in  the  fact that the narrowly specialized fighters were deprived of the  capability, as had been the case in past wars, of quickly  shifting from one mission to the other, building up efforts of  strike aviation in support of troops, or flexible use in  critical situations of the combined-arms battle. Nor were  economic assessments the least consideration. (The  single-purpose F-15C fighter costs 30 million dollars, and the  multi-purpose F-15E 2.5 million dollars more (INTERAVIA AIR  LETTER, 1986, 22 December). For this reason, in the countries of  Western Europe, which did not have adequate funds for  construction of specialized fighters, only multi-purpose  fighters were developed, intended for the accomplishment of both  tasks.    In this regard, a struggle of two contradictory tendencies  began in airplane construction. One of them continued to be  directed toward development of fighters for air-to-air combat,  and the other toward development of multi-purpose fighters  having the qualities of the fighter, the bomber, and the  ground-attack plane. The opinions of specialists were divided.  Some showed lively interest in multi-purpose aircraft, others  spoke ironically about the unrestrained fantasy of the latter.    Say the "pure fighter" proponents, Sure you can also fight  with multi-purpose planes, but combining in one plane such  contradictory characteristics as increased maneuverability and  the capacity to carry a good payload, to accommodate complex and  bulky equipment, inevitably leads to an increase in flight  weight of the aircraft. For example, that same single-purpose  F-15 fighter, after refitting to a multi-purpose aircraft,  weighed 34 tonnes instead of 20, and the F-16 fighter 22 tonnes  instead of 16. (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW, 1983, No. 2.) Can  this promote energetic maneuvers in air-to-air combat? And  strikes against ground targets? After all, in the Vietnam War  pilots of the multi-purpose F-4 Phantom, without adequate  professional training, suffered much greater losses than fighter  bombers. (AIR FORCE MAGAZINE, 1972, No. 8.)    Proponents of multi-purpose planes are charmed by the  universality of their use (the plane remains the same, but is  augmented with onboard equipment, arms, and programs entered in  the moment of the onboard computer), and also the  standardization of the technical maintenance and repair. And if  universal machines are not possible, then at least air-to-air  fighters must constitute a good basis for modification of them  into multi-purpose aircraft.    Different opinions, different approaches. Time will tell  which of the tendencies will be more developed, but for now we  are interested in the causes of the paradoxes, arising in the  labyrinthine relations of tactics and technology.  <H5>  The Burial Ground of Projects </H5>   It would of course be foolish to assume the relations of  tactics and technology consist only of paradoxes and  contradictions, but nonetheless... Technology provides fighters  with missiles, and the fighters demand their former cannon;  technology offers greater speed, and fighters abandon the  concept of a one-time missile attack, and halt before the choice  of single-purpose or multi-purpose aircraft. In this labyrinth  there is always something unpredictable, you never really know  what will happen tomorrow. From this aspect it seems to almost  be a riddle. And at the same time, vivid unusual findings which  are fated to move tactics forward!    The history of aviation also knows many other examples, when  the implementation of tempting, at first glance, projects ended  in failure. What projects have specialists not developed, what  predictions have they not made! It cannot be the case that they  did not know what they were about. On the basis of statistical  data by means of modelling, extrapolation, expert evaluation,  the state of the aircraft inventory was predicted decades in  advance, new types of air weapons were determined. Did it all go  right? By the logic of the designers, they were supposed to  achieve colossal successes. However let us return to projects of  10-15 years ago and what do we see? The time for adoption of new  models had come or was drawing near, but certain of them were  never developed. Here are a few examples of unfulfilled projects.    At the start of the 70s development was halted on seemingly  promising types of weapons for strategic bombers: Skybolt  ballistic missiles, defensive BDM missiles, and also "Scud"  decoys which were widely proclaimed in the press. Somewhat later  the same fate befell remote-controlled aircraft for various  purposes, and certain models of reconnaissance strike complexes  (SOTAS).    All these models remained just projects, although they had  been thought up, calculated, drawn on paper, and many even  incorporated in metal. However, although the engineers  participating in realization of these projects showed great  stubbornness, opposing the failures with their technical  inventiveness, they never reached serial production. The new  models died without being born. This at-first-glance illogical  phrase in fact very precisely reflects the logic of development  of one of the interacting sides. Can one be surprised? When  tactics are silent, technology creates new paradoxes.    But not only the designers erred. It would be wrong to  assume  that such paradoxes were not made by military theorists in the  field of tactics. One need only recall their serious  miscalculations in determining the role of fighter aviation with  the advent of SAMs and nuclear weapons, or the denial of  maneuver multiple-aircraft battles already mentioned above.    A 25-year-old prediction is recalled with irony. "There can  be no question of air-to-air battles in the far future," the  NATO journal REVUE MILITAIRE GENERALE announced categorically.  "Essentially the concept of air-to-air combat, which was a  necessary component of the early period of war, has already  become outmoded. We must repeat that the tactics of air-to-air  combat should be consigned to the archives." (REVUE MILITAIRE  GENERALE, 1964, February).    Some concepts put forward in the West shifted battle to the  stratosphere, it never reached there, but remained in the range  of high and low altitudes.    This sad catalogue of paradoxes and other most silly  proposals in the field of tactics is annoying and boring. It is  easy to judge events and persons from such a long distance, when  we look at the tactics and technology of long-ago years, but at  the same time it is not easy, if we do not note the causal  relationships of the phenomena. Alas they are not immediately  evident. To us, the errors in assessments, the limitation of  tactical thinking and engineering thought in understanding the  relations of tactics and technology are evident, at times  incomprehensible, and even laughable. But while possessing some  historical experience, strangely we at times repeat these same  errors and must speak ironically of ourselves.    Conflict situations, as a result of which joint or  uncoordinated efforts of tactics and technology do not achieve  the desired goals, and enormous resources are squandered, gave  cause for humorists to call the field of relations of tactics  and technology the "burial ground of projects and concepts."  Unfortunately, this sarcastic quip is not far from the truth and  sometimes appears as if a cruel fate pursues tacticians and  engineers, but it is not a matter of mysticism. Only one need  not take the easy path, that of endless rebukes of engineers and  tacticians: they didn't allow for this and didn't uncover that.    However there is a point to asking questions: whence these  unpredictable turns in the development of tactics and  technology, how can one find reasonable explanations to such  puzzling metamorphoses in technical projects and tactical  concepts? And finally, what is the way out of this impasse? Let  us try to look closely at this bundle of contradictions, and  then we might find some quite unexpected answers.  <H5>  2. The Search For a Way Out </H5> <H5>  An Equation With Many Unknowns </H5>   In pondering the relations of technology and tactics, and  the  unsuccessful projects, one willy nilly begins thinking about the  mistakes that were made. There are many grounds for believing  that they testify not to laziness of intellect, incompetence of  tacticians and engineers, or their ignorance of research being  done, and developments in the given fields, but rather  inadequate allowance for form conditions. In some cases they did  not pay heed to practical requirements of a tactical or  engineering idea, the justification for large economic  expenditures, some unfavorable factors, and, in others, they  raised the importance of secondary factors, or those which did  not receive further development. These circumstances are very  reminiscent of an equation with many unknowns. One can say with  confidence only that not one of its members (factors) should be  equal to zero.    How to resolve this equation, or in other words, how serious  are such circumstances? The fact is that with acceleration of  scientific-technical progress and the development of new  technologies, when the opportunity has arisen to create planes  and weapons at accelerated rates, less time remains for the  influence of technology on tactics. In addition, more vital and  vivid changes in combat properties of new models of technology  hinder consideration and allowance for all influencing factors.  The advent of guided missiles and radar weapons sights  influenced tactics incomparably more than the replacement of  aircraft machineguns with cannon.    The equation with many unknowns remains even today.  Therefore  one cannot rule out the possibility of unexpected  scientific-technical breakthroughs and surprise leaps in  development of technology, even in related fields, which might  be used in the interests of tactics. What is more, such an  unprogrammed innovation, coming into the world, often reveals  tactical properties which not even its creators foresaw. Of  course it at once consigns to second place the models which  existed previously. Such situations are a great rarity, and they  cannot immediately lead to radical changes in tactics.    For example, was it possible to program with adequate  precision the expected changes in tactics on the eve of creation  of guided missiles and weapons radars? Is it possible today to  anticipate such changes in the event, say, of the appearance of  laser or some other weapons of fighters with fundamentally new,  still unknown properties, which will immediately lead to the  outmoding of present missiles and sights? Would the tactics of  battle of jet aircraft not undergo immediate vital changes. Thus  the jokers again will have cause to make fun of the utterance  "technology can, tactics don't have to."    Here there is yet another quite weighty circumstance: the  number of technical alternatives for satisfaction of the  identical demands of tactics is growing swiftly. Look, reader,  at a far from complete list of these alternatives (Table 1). How  can we balance and ensure a rational combination of them,  without resorting to the experience of the tailor mending  Grisha's caftan. I will not bother you with superfluous  explanations, and offer them for your own comparison and  analysis.

Do not  forget to compare also the comparative importance of tactical  requirements. For example the range and duration of flight.  Behind these demands is the capability of intercepting the  adversary at remote lines, long air patrol time, basing at  airfields far from the front line, broad maneuver along the  front and in depth.    It goes without saying that the variety of technical  alternatives does not decide the fate of present or planed  developments, but it is directly related to them. This may lead  to unforeseen leaps in the development of technology, and may,  on the contrary, separate the efforts of designers and engineers  with incomplete allowance for all influencing factors. After  all, not every alternative variant can be immediately  implemented, but that which today is not feasible, i.e., does  not have the necessary conditions for realization, will tomorrow  become a real possibility.    And now, let us examine these questions from the standpoint  of tactics. Its needs at times exceed the capabilities of  technology. Although the changes themselves in it are a response  to some urgent problems of tactics, the lag of technology behind  the demands of tactics, as testified to by numerous examples, is  a quite frequent phenomenon in the history of fighter aviation.  One cannot discount also the subjective factors: the dictate of  engineering thought contrary to tactical considerations, and the  development of tactical demands without allowance for their  technical realization. If this occurs, the lack of understanding  between tacticians and engineers most often acquires a conflict  nature.    This is the logical chain which is established on the path  of  emergency from the labyrinth of relations and in the search for  right solutions. With the sharp acceleration in the number of  models of new weapons produced per unit of time, just as the  speedup of advances in tactics, these relations become  increasingly more complex and elusive. They are not always  stable and have numerous manifestations. Precisely in the  exceptional breadth and multifaceted nature of the relations of  tactics and technology, in their incomplete comprehension, in  the "volitional" voluntaristic solutions, when the development  of new tactical techniques and modes of weapons is conducted  without allowance for mutual capacities, finally in the absence  of a uniform criterion, one finds the causes of many paradoxes.  This is the essence of the equation with many unknowns.    Where then is the way out? Only in a profound understanding  of the dialectics of development of tactics and technology, in  an even more profound allowance for their relations.  <H5>  The Fields of Cooperation of Tactics and Technology </H5>   The reader has noted of course that he is again being nudged  toward a truism: under the influence of tactics, the technical  aspect of fighters is formed, their characteristics are  optimized, while the improvement of technology leads to changes  in the nature of battle. In tracing these relations, we have  seen that despite the contradictions, in response to every  critical situation (paradox), even if not at once, the pilots  had at their disposal both technical innovations and new  tactical techniques. Only this dialectic does not always yield  to the logic of scientific thinking. The aspiration of military  scientists and designers to penetrate the labyrinths of  relations of tactics and technology, as before, collides with a  whole group of contradictory and complex factors. Therefore, in  order that the "wonders of technology" planned for development  not turn out to be ultimately merely clever fabrications of  designers, one can say that the basis of design of new  technology and development of tactics should be long-term  forecasting and a systems approach.    What is a systems approach, what an integrated approach? The  total system of relations may be represented as the totality of  a number of functioning elements, as a strictly coordinated  group, including subsystems of the aircraft, weapons of one's  own and those of the enemy, the tactics of the opposing sides,  the means of supporting their combat actions, and more  fragmented components.    But we will not hold to strict scientific formulations. If  you, the reader, in delving into some technical engineering  problem, simultaneously weigh both of its aspects, allow for the  countering action of the probable adversary, assess and  coordinate the different combinations of characteristics of  speed, maneuverability, level of signature and survivability  with the weapons and support equipment, estimate the technical  risk of development, carefully formulate its goals, beforehand  "play out" the variants of their attainment, in short  comprehensively trace all relations in accordance with a uniform  program, and on the basis of uniform initial ideas, consider  that you are using a systems approach.    This is not easy to do. But if the reader keeps the desire  to  have his say in tactics, and receive responses regarding the way  of their further development, he must search for them in each  element of the system and on the basis of interests of the  system as a whole. To do this he needs to study all the fields  and directions, in which military-technical and  operational-tactical thought is operating today, and assess  which of them promises the greatest success. Only then can one  continue the noted tendencies tomorrow, and most importantly,  allow for the alternative combinations in selection of the  optimal variant from those shown in Table 1.    However, we must stipulate that this is practically feasible  only for large collectives of tacticians and engineers, crossing  traditional borders between the concepts of "tactics" and  "technology." They are the ones who form the "tactical order"  for technology, precise, clear, understandable, which might be  accomplished.    The "tactical order," or demands on technology, forms  literally all elements of tactics. Only after soberly and  judiciously weighing our "subsystems," can one find and justify  the inherent requirements. Otherwise one cannot emerge from the  numerous impasses.    If we again analyze Table 1, it is not hard to imagine many  fields of successful cooperation of tactics and technology  satisfying its needs. Now there are becoming more and more of  them. Without retelling and without assessing the ways of  satisfying all demands of tactics shown in the table with  technology, let us first turn to one, seemingly not the main  one, of minimal volume, time, and high reliability of technical  maintenance. But this requirement lays bare many other problems  as well, which one must ponder.    Who needs plans with a high volume of technical maintenance,  frequent failures and breakdowns, with high repair time? What  would be the level of combat readiness of subunits and a unit if  the preparation of aircraft for a sortie takes not minutes, but  hours?    Note that the increasing complexity of aviation equipment,  the difficulty in finding defects, errors in the computer  software which is part of present-day equipment, and also the  shortage of highly qualified specialists -- all this aggravates  the problem. How should aircraft designers proceed in order to  raise the reliability of operation of aviation equipment, reduce  the duration of preparation for sorties, and repair of damaged  aircraft?    Let's look at fourth-generation aircraft. They already  include many improvements of those shown in Table 1. The MiG-29  (Figure 23) [not reproduced], for example. Replacement of the  engines in them takes just a few dozen minutes without removal  of the fuselage, while before it took many hours. And the Su-27  aircraft (Figure 24) [not reproduced], equipped with  modular-design engines, consisting of individual units. If  damage occurs, there is no need to replace the whole engine. It  suffices to replace the faulty module. The reliability of  operation of the equipment in flight has also grown. On those  same Su-27s, the onboard systems operate with quadruple  redundancy, and there is also a maximum mode limiter.    Reliability of operation of the equipment, the deadlines and  cost of repair and overhaul of faulty aircraft to a significant  degree are determined by the capabilities of the monitoring and  testing systems. Using such systems, which record the readouts  of numerous sensors located in the required places, one can  automatically monitor the status of the onboard equipment  (functional monitoring) and also automatically identify arising  defects (functional diagnostics). For this the corresponding  programs are entered in the computers of the systems.    Imagine, after landing you taxi to the parking area. The  technician connects the mobile monitoring and testing station to  the aircraft, and switches on the equipment. And checking the  "health" of the plane, a tape is fed from the printer with  signs, numbers, and pulses incomprehensible to the layman.  Casting a penetrating glance at it, the technician (granted,  under your supervision) reads the "diagnosis" and takes the  necessary steps in accordance with it.    Provided there is high reliability of diagnostics, and  consequently of the technical maintenance itself, it will become  possible to reduce or do away with individual operations,  conduct complete preflight preparation right after conclusion of  the regular flight. All this crowds more into the time of  operation of the aviation equipment, and thus increases the  number of combat ready aircraft per hour, per day. But isn't  this tantamount to increasing the fighter aviation forces with  the same organic strength of fighters in the subunit and unit?  And a reduction in the numerical strength of the  engineer-technical personnel maintaining the aviation equipment,  the strength of the repair organs, reduces the needs for tools,  simplifying documentation? Such machines, so expensive to  produce, are becoming more and more economical in operation, and  make it possible to save many of the people's rubles. But this  is still not all. Leaving the technicians on the ground with  their infallible prognoses, you climb into the air to perform  the combat mission. In the air-to-air battle you of course do  not have time to systematically monitor the operation of the  engine and equipment. Here you are assisted by the onboard  monitoring and testing systems, which are based on  self-diagnosis of their operation. They sensitively pick up how  the engine is operating, how the temperature is holding, how  fuel is being expended. If a sensor signals danger, be it  failure, malfunction of some aggregate or other problem, the  onboard computer, after sorting through many variants, picks the  optimal one: redundant or reserve channels are switched on,  ensuring accomplishment of the functions of the failed  aggregate. Here the pilot is told what has been done on what and  why. It seems improbable that the system itself makes the  decision. This is how a seemingly secondary requirement of  tactics is realized. (The time for technical maintenance of  American F-15 fighters is one third less than for the F-4, and  was reduced even more for the F-16. The leaders of the U.S. Air  Force bluntly state their readiness to give up certain  performance characteristics of the fighters if this makes it  possible to reduce the volume and time and raise the reliability  of maintenance and repair capacity.) (AIR FORCE, 1985, No. 4)    In designing new planes, aircraft designers do not forget  other tactical demands either. In accordance with them, the  performance of fighters has been improved, the power of the  weapons grows, and reliability of technical maintenance (Fig.  25) is enhanced.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-27A>      Figure 25. Technology meets the demands of tactics. </FIG>     Multifaceted and complex fields of cooperation of tactics  and  equipment have many different aspects. The adversary's  electronic countermeasures are growing, prompting designers to  develop interference resistant weapons sights, and receivers to  warn of radar and IR radiation, automatic devices for ejecting  dipole reflectors and decoy targets. This diverse assortment of  EW means are quickly supplemented by built-in active jammers,  apparatus to counter electro-optical and laser weapons of the  adversary.    It is necessary to simplify the use of these numerous  equipments by the pilot of a single-seater fighter aircraft. In  response to this requirement of tactics, whole systems are being  developed which are based on integration of separately operating  onboard systems and automation of EW process. Here the designers  provide for onboard energy resources to support operation of  such systems, an expedient sequence of suppression of radars and  types of jamming, and the commanders are given the right to  clarify the control personnel of the EW assets before a sortie  in accordance with the data of electronic reconnaissance and the  assigned combat mission.    The need arises to control the battle from onboard the  fighters, and in the cockpits of the group commanders tactical  situation scopes have appeared (Figure 26) [not reproduced]. On  the multicolor display, without turning his head the commander  can see the location and heading of the aircraft, friendly and  enemy, determine their speed and altitude from a marker, know  which of the pilots of his group are engaging, and monitor their  actions.    All the areas of successful cooperation of tactics and  technology cannot be enumerated. The pilot-radar probably can  recall many such examples. But we are interested in examining  only those which are incorporated in the construction of  new-generation fighters, those which are to be assimilated on  the threshold of the 21st century. After all, the dialectics of  interaction of technology and equipment are such that in the  process of satisfying the demands of today, the demands of  tomorrow will be born.  <H5>  3. Fighters on the Threshold of the Twenty-First Century </H5>   The change of fighter aircraft, piston, jet, supersonic,  occurring in the second half of our century, is approaching its  next turn. What will the generation of fighters be like which is  about to replace the current generation? How are their  appearance, armament, and equipment envisioned? These questions,  on the eve of the year 2000, concern both the air veteran and  the new pilot. Take a look at the sketches of such fighters  (Figure 27) [not reproduced]. For the present they arouse only  our delight, do they not? Sharp-nosed, sharp-winged, and swift!  Let us take a closer look at this unknown that attracts us.    According to the performance requirements, developed by  military specialists abroad, the new-generation fighters must be  fast and maneuverable, have a low level of give-away signs, and  equipment to destroy a large number of targets simultaneously.  (AIR FORCE, 1988. No. 1)    Let us begin with speed. In contrast to present-day  fighters,  the new ones should have supersonic cruising speed in  non-afterburning operating modes. This quality is necessary for  more economical fuel expenditure, making it possible to expand  the region of effective coverage of installations against air  strikes and sharply raising the capabilities of the fighters in  terms of rapid intercept of aerial targets at remote lines  (Figure 28). (INTERAVIA, 1985. No. 6). From the figure it is  clear that the possible lines of intercept for fighters with  supersonic cruising speed may be extended by a factor of two or  more, all other conditions being equal, in comparison with the  American F-15 fighters without it (the fighters will head for  the interception from alert status at an airfield five and two  minutes after detection of the target, which is moving at a  speed corresponding to M = 1.5 at a height of 1,500 meters).  (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW, 1987. No. 5.) In addition, during  flight at such speed, the duration of pursuit of targets is  significantly reduced, and the threat of engagement of fighters  by ground AD weapons of the adversary is diminished.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-28A>      Figure 28. Possible lines of interception of aerial targets. </FIG>     At the same time, design thinking continues to search for  new  engineering solutions to expand the maneuver characteristics and  the field of combat application of fighters in a great range of  altitudes and speeds, including at low sub-sonic speeds. Success  can be achieved here, in addition to all else, through control  of the thrust vector of the engine using swiveling nozzles (for  vertical displacement of the aircraft, the nozzles are tilted  downward, and in horizontal flight backward) and the use of  systems to control aerodynamic forces (Figure 29, position 1).   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-29A>      Figure 29. Possible expansion of the field of combat application of fighters. </FIG>    The last point requires explanation. The fact is that  systems  based on direct control of lift and lateral forces allow the  pilots to change the attitude of the aircraft without changing  the flight trajectory, or vice versa, changing the trajectory  while retaining the position of one or several axes (flat turns  without roll, vertical displacements without a change in the  angle of pitch). Such fundamentally new maneuvers may be  performed using an automated system or manually. This system  also allows good controllability in flight modes close to  critical.    In addition, the field of new application of fighters with  respect to altitude and speed may be expanded through further  increase in the power of the engines and improvement in the  aerodynamic qualities of the airframe (Figure 29, position 2).  The altitude and speed characteristics of the American F-16  fighter are shown by way of comparison.    A most important characteristic feature in the development  of  new- generation fighters will be the reduction in their  tell-tale signs. This is not a new feature, to be sure. The  attempt has always been made to make fighters hard to detect by  the adversary. However in the past the campaign against  tell-tale signs was conducted only in some directions (masking  camouflage paint, radio silence) and never waged along the  entire front. But these trends were only half-measures; the  tell-tale signs remained. However no design solutions, even in  the form of controversial hypotheses, laying the formation for  further research, were considered for some time. As always in  such cases, many dilettantish, unsound arguments, about  noiseless aircraft, optically transparent, etc., arose. This was  like the idea of conversion of a beam of light into electrical  energy. Theoretically possible, but in practice...    Only the level of scientific and technical progress and  technology of the 70s made it possible to begin combatting  tell-tale signs of fighters in different ranges of the  electromagnetic spectrum, but the task proved to be more complex.    There are many directions in which work is under way.  Perhaps  the most important today is the reduction in radar cross section  of the fighters, in order to hamper their detection by radar  assets, for it is radar which at present has the best  characteristics in comparison with other means, and comprises  the basis of the air defense system.    In order to reduce the radar cross section, aerodynamic  shapes and configurations of aircraft are being improved --  everything to avoid right angles and reduce the area of plane  surfaces or replace them with a large number of flat edges,  which reflect the radio waves away from the direction of the  operating radar. In place of the traditional metallic materials,  the aircraft designs more and more use radio-absorbing composite  materials and coatings which scatter the electromagnetic energy  of the radar signals.    The second area of importance is suppression of thermal  radiation of fighters, chiefly from the propulsion systems.  Besides the radar range of electromagnetic waves, the IR range  is the only one in which aircraft may be detected beyond visual  limits. This is an even more difficult technical problem,  because no fighter can do without a powerful, afterburning  engine. In order to reduce the intensity of thermal radiation,  heat-absorbing and insulating materials are used, the most  heated parts of the engine are screened, their nozzles are  cooled, and various materials are injected into the stream of  exhaust gases to reduce the temperature of the gases or change  the radiation spectrum.    It is still unclear which of these directions will gain the  highest priority in the future, but most likely they will  develop in tandem, with a revision of the already traditional  priorities depending on the development of means of detection of  the opposing side.    The development of new models of arms and onboard apparatus,  which must not give away the fighters, also has its own  directions. It will be necessary to abandon external suspension  of many types of weapons, and mount them flush with the surface  of the aircraft in specially made recesses in the skin, do away  with suspended containers in favor of apparatus built into the  fuselage, and reduce the number of projecting antennas. All  specialists stress as one that if powerful radars remain on the  aircraft, which are incapable of operating in the short-term  radiation mode, and there are no other non-radiating means of  detection of air targets (IR sights, electronic reconnaissance  equipment, laser equipment), if outside fuel tanks and suspended  missiles are retained, then all the striving of the pilots to  achieve surprise in battle will be in vain, and they will be a  lucrative target for missiles guided to the operating radars.  More strict demands are also imposed on the dimensions of the  radar antennas, which may increase the radar cross section of  the aircraft. As a result of all these improvements, the  designers hope to develop a fighter whose radar cross section  does not exceed 0.1 meters squared.    In addition, in the interests of a close air-to-air battle,  it is still considered necessary for fighters of the new  generation to have a comfortable cockpit, which does not  restrict the view or pilot capabilities of constant visual  contact with aircraft of the opposing side. Foreign military  specialists, arguing the importance of this requirement, cite  statistical data according to which 80 percent of all losses of  fighters in combat actions since the Second World War have been  related to inadequate pilot knowledge of the surrounding air  situation.(FLIGHT, 1988. No. 4118.)    In the field of armament, despite the existing differences  in  designs and their determining concepts, the tendency of  equipment fighter aircraft with all-aspect long- and  intermediate-range missiles, and also short-range missiles and  cannon, has been rather precisely determined. Powerful weapons  are being developed, allowing engagement of air targets at  various ranges, from many tens of kilometers to tens of meters,  and at any aspect.    Autonomy of action after launch, i.e., guidance to target  without constant tracking by the onboard radar, is considered a  necessary property of future missiles. The fact is that the need  to hold the target in radar lock-on during launch of missiles  with radar semi-active guidance "ties" the pilot to a single  enemy plane for a rather long time (by the yardstick of an  air-to-air battle). According to data in the foreign press, this  time can reach 20-25 or 10-20 seconds, depending on whether the  target is inside or outside of visual range (for the Sparrow  medium-range missile). In this time another enemy aircraft can  suddenly attack the fighters. For example, the American AMRAAM  missiles have this property -- they are equipped with active  radar homing heads and a guidance system in the middle phase of  the flight trajectory. Having autonomous missiles, pilots are  able to begin any maneuver immediately after their launch. This  property is called "fire and forget" abroad. (INTERNATIONAL  DEFENSE REVIEW, 1987. No. 5.)    The capabilities of launching missiles in a direction away  from one's aircraft, and a changing the thrust vector of their  engines, are qualitatively new technical solutions in the  projects being developed. These technical innovations make it  possible to compensate for inadequacies in maneuverability of  fighters, and to raise the maneuverability of the missiles. For  the time being, the missiles are distinguished by broader limits  of launch zones, higher speeds, interference resistance, and  probability of target kill, and short-range missiles also by  high maneuverability and resistance to high G forces (up to 60).  (INTERAVIA, 1984. No. 9; AIR FORCE, 1985. No. 4)    The development of radars to control radars and also for  other tasks holds a special place in scientific research and  experimental design work abroad. The next-generation radars,  designed for fighters on the basis of solid-state active-phased  antenna arrays, their developers believe will be capable of  operating simultaneously in several modes or of using all their  energy in one mode, and will be part of a uniform system of  flight and weapons control. In addition to radars, the designers  will include in them IR sights, capable of detecting air targets  at the same range as radars, electro-optic and navigation  apparatus, multifunctional display assets, and aircraft and  weapons control elements. Computers to assess the level of  importance of detected targets, and rational launch zones of  missiles, are also being developed. [FLIGHT, 1989. No. 4150]    Such systems, which combine data sensors for tracking air  targets with scopes and control elements, will allow the  accomplishment of many functions: optimization of altitude and  height of flight, offensive and defensive maneuvers of fighters,  processing of sight data for fire, detection and tracking of  targets with automatic lock-on of the nearest of them. They will  free the pilot of the need to perform these functions, and will  permit the most favorable maneuver in an air-to-air battle.    Further increase in the range of detection of air targets,  particularly those with reduced cross section, will remain one  of the basic traditional directions in the development of radars  of the new generation. This is understandable: the first to see  the adversary gains victory. The designers strive to increase  the power of radiation of the radars using, along with the  pulsed mode, the pulsed-Doppler mode with coherent processing of  signals and high frequency of repetition of the pulses. All  these ways of increasing the range of action of radars have been  known for a long time, but today no potentials are being  identified in them.    It is very important to detect a target in a timely manner,  but this is not everything. What pilot does not know how much  precious time can be lost when after detecting a target, you  don't know its affiliation and characteristics! After all, on  the radar screens of modern fighters, the blips of all aircraft  are identical, and the type and composition of a target can be  judged only approximately, from the range of appearance of the  blip on the screen. But the existing systems of "friend or foe"  determine only the affiliation of a target, and even here the  reliability is inadequate. They cannot be relied upon during  active electronic warfare of the sides. Therefore the fighters  will be tied down in their actions, and must refrain from  delivering fire at ranges safe for them and most convenient for  engaging the adversary.    Thus the pilot may clearly observe the blips of the air  targets a good hundred kilometers away, but can neither make a  decision nor open fire, no matter how long-range his missiles.  In order to prevent engagement of friendly aircraft, he must  close with the adversary for visual identification from external  markings. But the more powerful and the longer the range of the  weapons, the more fluid the situation in battle, the greater the  need for full identification of air targets.    Timely identification of air targets was a serious problem  for all generations of fighters. However today the prospects for  resolving this problem, in the opinion of western specialists,  is more remote than ever before. Searches for reliable means of  identification are being conducted in the air forces of many  countries. Different methods and devices are being sought to  determine the type of targets, distinguish individual aircraft  in dense combat formations, and discern their location in  groups. Special devices for high-speed processing of radar  signals, systems based on programmable processors, whose memory  contains a whole group of emissions of equipment of the probable  enemy, are being developed for analysis of target signs in the  U.S. At the same time, equipment is being developed to discover  the specific modulation of reflected signals for each type of  aircraft due to the rotation of engine compressor blades.  English specialists have great hopes for optical devices aimed  at air targets using a radar, with subsequent conversion of the  optical image to a television image. [FLIGHT, 1986. No. 4011]    Still, despite these innovations, seasoned experts shake  their heads doubtfully. They believe that one of the basic and  most reliable methods of identifying air targets in the future  will continue to be continuous observation of their actions,  beginning with takeoff, or from that part of air space where  there are no friendly aircraft ("indirect identification of  state affiliation"). In other words, a combination of long-range  radar detection and identification of targets is predicted to  have an important role. (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW, 1986. No.  8) But is this really the solution to the problem?    Such are the basic characteristic features of the new  generation of fighter aircraft. However there is another  tendency becoming evident, which must be considered to make the  assessment of the state of the future aircraft inventory of  fighter aviation complete. The fact is that construction of  fundamentally new types of fighters will demand great economic  expenses and a long time, and then with the presence of a large  inventory of already developed aircraft. However it has been  noted that in the current types now, it is not so much the  design as the engines, armaments, and equipment which are  growing old. Naturally the efforts of the aircraft designers are  directed also toward modernization of earlier adopted aircraft  now in serial production, along with development of new designs.    Western specialists believe that this tendency will continue  to be completely valid in the future. It will make it possible  to ensure an increment in the combat capabilities of fighters  with the least expense. For many years the characteristics of  familiar American fighters F-15 and F-16, adopted in the  armament in 1972 and 1976, have been continuously improved.  Their modifications have included new engines, improved radars,  missiles, EW equipment, and navigational equipment. The program  of modernization of the F-4F and "Tornado" aircraft in the FRG  has been actively implemented. Plans are to replace some of the  onboard electronic equipment and arm them with AMRAAM and HARM  missiles. (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW, 1986. No. 8; AVIATION  WEEK, 1987. No. 6.) Western experts predict, and have no doubt,  that they will surely become part of the aircraft inventory by  the end of the century.  <H5>  4. New-Generation Fighters in Battle </H5>   The problems of tactics of the air-to-air battle on the  threshold of the year 2000 attract our attention no less than  the development of fighters of the next generation. Attempts of  pilots to fly the new or modified aircraft with their old  tactical baggage will not bring success, for they will not be  able to fully realize the high combat capabilities of the new  equipment.    Today the foundations of air-to-air combat are undergoing  critical analysis and revision. Western specialists stress that  for fighters with higher performance, powerful armaments, and  highly automated systems, which open up for the pilots  previously unattained possibilities, and offering great hopes,  nonetheless the basic rules of air-to-air combat, developed and  reinforced in past wars, will remain in force. Therefore foreign  experts are oriented toward battles combining both new and old  elements to some degree.    On this basis, the foreign press states that the regions of  air-to- air battles may have to be greater in size, or they may  be fought in a limited space. Their participants may be either  single fighters, or subunits operating according to a uniform  concept. However the more improved aircraft and their weapons  systems will entail more decisive targets, higher activeness of  the opposing sides, and diversity of tactical techniques. This  is why the old techniques, which have demonstrated their  effectiveness, will not die away, but will grow into new ones,  flowing from the capabilities of the equipment, which must be  expanded and deepened even more.    But what properties of the aircraft underlie such tactical  techniques? First of all, the high thrust and capability of  controlling aerodynamic forces.    The high thrust of new-generation fighters imposes its own  features on the air-to-air battle, changing the role of the  altitude advantage over the adversary and the nature of  maneuvers. In the past the altitude advantage resolved a great  deal. Descending to join battle, the fighters could increase  their speed, could quickly catch up with the adversary, assume a  favorable position, and conduct a surprise attack. When located  below the adversary, they were deprived of this opportunity. The  energy of the aircraft did not allow such maneuvers. But now  thanks to their enormous thrust, the pilots at lower altitude  than the adversary can quickly climb, can speed up not only in  descent, and also conduct other maneuvers without preliminary  climbs. Now the possibility of achieving surprise has become  inversely proportional to altitude. The one flying higher is  visible on the radar screen the farthest away, and has a harder  time detecting a target against the background of the earth.    The capabilities of controlling aerodynamic forces in turn  affect the nature of maneuver in an air-to-air battle.  Short-radius turns, combat banks [razvorot], steep loops  [petlya] and other similar traditional maneuvers, the components  of tactical techniques, now may be supplemented by fundamentally  new ones mentioned earlier: flat turns (without roll), and  ascent and descent without a change in angle of pitch.    Let us assume that in the dynamics of battle we need to aim  quickly and precisely, and for this we need to change the  attitude of our aircraft within small limits ("steer the nose").  What must the pilot do? A rapid turn [dovorot] to the target (or  away from it), launch of missiles and fire of cannon, and then  restoration of the previous attitude. Such combat maneuvers make  it possible not only to simplify and increase the zone of  engagement of the weapons aimed forward, but may also confuse  the adversary.    New weapons also make their contribution toward the tactics  of the air battle. Fighters armed with missiles with various  ranges of action will be able to fight at long, medium, and  short range, to engage the adversary maneuvering with high G  forces, from any direction. The classical scheme, combining  maneuver and fire while trying to get on one another's tail and  close to minimal range, under such conditions loses its dominant  importance, while head-on attack, allowing maximum range of  missile launch, on the contrary, will become more preferable.  Such attacks even quite recently appeared to be impossible. Not  even the bravest air warrior could manage to aim and hit a  target without having long-range missiles at his disposal. Now  closure can be at a trajectory close to straight. The air-to-air  battle has become an all-aspect one.    For this reason, foreign military specialists believe, not  without justification, that the capabilities of missiles will  exert a greater influence on the nature of future battles than  the performance of the aircraft. However some of them go further  and assume that when each fighter has powerful weapons, the need  will disappear for a joint buildup of efforts, and thus for a  group battle of fighters. Duel situations, in their opinion,  will prove to be more expedient, because they do not limit the  maneuver and combat might of the wingmen. (PROCEEDINGS, 1984.  January.)    Is this so? The tactics of aerial duelists or a group  air-to-air battle with its fire interaction in the group?    The majority of military specialists abroad conclude that a  single fighter even with the most powerful weapons will not be  able to engage all the enemy aircraft in a large group target;  in addition his aft hemisphere will be unprotected. But this  means that the battle formation of fighters would consist of  assault and support elements (escort, reserve, decoy, etc.),  combined under a single command. Of course, great doubts are  expressed today about the need for a decoy element. It is  thought that new-generation fighters with powerful weapons  cannot permit themselves such a "luxury." Naturally, besides the  multiple aircraft battle, there will continue to be duel  situations, but they can occur only under difficult  meteorological conditions, and even in the course of a  multiple-aircraft air-to-air battle.    In considering the standard variants of battle formations of  sub-units, western experts conclude that for complete use of the  capabilities of friendly weapons and ensurance of freedom of  maneuver, before battle the fighters should move further and  further away from one another, and the battle formations should  disperse more and more widely. And the fighting strength of  aircraft combined in a single group may be reduced. Here the  traditional functions of leader and wingman require vital  clarification in the smallest subunits -- pairs of fighters.  (AIR FORCE, 1986. No. 4)    If the leader attacks a target, the wingman only monitors  the  air situation and covers his leader; he frequently returns to  the airfield with his combat load unexpended. Fighters of the  new generation also need to be divided into leaders and wingmen,  but in order to rationally utilize all the power of their  weapons, they would do better to move in an opon battle  formation, close to the front, and both must be in readiness to  attack. The one to attack the target will be the one in a more  advantageous position. It will become the attacker, and the  second pilot the covering element. The covering fighter then  builds on the efforts of the attacking one.    Let us follow the dynamics of the standard air-to-air  battle,  in which foreign military specialists try to find new,  non-standard solutions. In their opinion, the battle should be  started from maximum range by active group attacks, in order to  immediately scatter the battle formation of the adversary and  reduce to naught his numerical superiority. However even an  adversary possessing roughly the same destructive capabilities  of his weapons will strive for analogous attacks. Therefore the  initial tactical superiority will remain with the group or pilot  who is able to first detect the adversary, assess the situation  earlier, make a decision, and shift more rapidly to the attack.    But what tactical techniques are expedient in a first  attack,  which was earlier valued highly, and with the increase in power  of fighter weapons, and the low effectiveness of repeat attacks,  is acquiring decisive importance? One such technique, albeit  familiar, but somewhat altered for new fighters, may be closing  with the target at a height lower than the expected height of  the target, with a subsequent surprise attack from the front and  below. Then the adversary will be in a worse position, since the  range of detection of his radar will be less against the  background of the earth, and he will be deprived of the  capability of a first attack.    Still, inconspicuous fighters, with a significantly reduced  radar cross section and intensity of IR emission will have the  best opportunities for a surprise attack. The range of detection  of such fighters by onboard radars of enemy aircraft, according  to the foreign press, will be reduced to 20-25 km, and the  lock-on range to 15 km. The range of lock-on of targets by  missiles with active homing heads, not receiving stable signals  from inconspicuous aircraft, will be reduced accordingly.  (AVIATION WEEK, 1988. No. 11) Therefore the pilots who first  detect the adversary will be able to covertly close with him and  attack him first (Figure 30).   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-33A>      Figure 30. Inconspicuous fighters armed with AMRAAM missiles on the attack </FIG>     Here one interesting circumstance arises. If the opposing  side has similar inconspicuous fighters, the battle of the  "invisibles," western specialists believe, will acquire quite a  different nature and will require other tactical techniques.  Here the attacks on the forward hemisphere will be extremely  difficult due to the short range of detection of the targets,  and all the features of close air-to-air combat, when fighters  still did not have radar sights, or long-range missiles, will  come to the fore. A return to the past? In some ways, yes!    The tactical techniques of joining battle should allow the  fighters not only to detect the adversary first, but also to  engage the maximum number of targets. Here new missiles with  active homing systems will come to the fore, which do not  require illumination of the enemy aircraft, whose launch from  each fighter is possible almost simultaneously against several  targets (AMRAAM). The first attack of inconspicuous fighters  using such missiles, possessing the property of "fire and  forget," will immediately acquire new features. Its concept may  be as follows: upon detecting a target or group of targets,  pilots will begin covert closure with them. The group commander  will distribute individual enemy aircaft among the wingmen in  order to avoid multiple engagement of them (it is recommended  that the commander himself select the most important target).    One necessary digression. In order to distribute targets  correctly, the command must know precisely the number and  location of the enemy planes in the group. When the commander  does not see it visually, and when there are conditions of a  difficult jamming situation, this is not easy to do. Therefore,  as long as the fighters do not have reliable devices to identify  targets, they require additional information, which may be sent  to them from a ground or airborne command post.    After distribution of targets among the pilots, each  distributes the missiles on board among the earmarked planes.  Then there remains little to do: execute the launch and "forget"  the missiles, and then execute an evasive maneuver in order to  avoid retaliatory fire. The attack is maximally simplified. Then  the commander organizes a repeat attack against targets which  survive the first, or the pilots begin to search for other  targets. (PROCEEDINGS. 1984. January; AIR FORCE, 1985, No. 4)    However an air-to-air battle will scarcely have the nature  of  an exchange of missile strikes only from long range. The  adversary may obtain timely information, and then he will do  everything in order to create a powerful electronic  counteraction, to "blind" the pilots, to hamper them in using a  specific type of missile, and to foil his long-range strike. One  cannot underestimate his capabilities, especially with respect  to inconspicuous fighters, in achieving surprise, when they turn  up at close range, ruling out the use of long-range missiles.  One should not forget the difficulty of instrument  identification of targets. And indeed, the pilots themselves may  aim poorly or commit other errors, so that long-range attacks  prove unsuccessful. What happens if the whole reserve of  long-range missiles is expended in the battle? In all these  cases an air-to-air battle started at long range may then become  a close-range combat.    Close-range air-to-air combat played a decisive role in  local  wars of the 70s and 80s. Thus in the Arab-Israeli War of 1973,  the Israeli pilots shot down 310 of the 450 Arab planes they  destroyed in close-range combat. (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW,  1985, No. 8) And even though, in the opinion of some western  observers, there will be no place for such battles in the future  (it will be more advantageous for fighters to return to the  airfield and top off their missile reserve than to continue to  close with targets), the close-in battles themselves stubbornly  ignore their lack of recognition, and the latest concepts. What  is more, recently an instruction was introduced to the program  of training of NATO tactical pilots regarding conclusion of each  training flight for air-to-air combat with energetic maneuvering  as applied to the conditions of close-range combat.  (PROCEEDINGS, 1984. January)    The main distinguishing characteristics of close-range  combat, which will basically retain its former aspect, will be  visual contact between the planes fighting the battle, and the  use of short-range weapons. At the same time, new features will  inevitably appear: a speeding up of battle dynamics, a reduction  in the time between attacks, an increase in the probability of a  kill of aircraft of the opposing sides. In aircraft with high  thrust-to-weight ratios and acceleration characteristics,  possessing missiles with autonomous guidance after launch, the  pilots may more quickly conclude attacks, restore lost speed,  and catch up with an adversary fleeing attack. These new  features not only expand the capabilities of the fighters, but  also make combat more dangerous for all of its participants. It  has become much easier to kill a target, but also more difficult  to defend oneself. Here the danger of collision has grown,  especially in attacks at high aspect angles.    In accordance with the changed conditions of air-to-air  combat, pilots are required to use new tactical techniques,  combining sharp maneuvers of short duration with the attainment  of high acceleration. Such techniques, based on control of  aerodynamic forces, create the most favorable conditions for  precise fire with cannon, and for missile launch. But despite  the most clever maneuvers, even well-trained pilots may lose the  battle at its very start, if they do not combine these maneuvers  with electronic suppression of weapons sights and homing heads  of the enemy missiles. There is still no alternative to  electronic warfare. Switch-on of active jammers, dispensing of  dipole reflects, and firing of IR decoys to disrupt missile  guidance and lure them in false directions, these pilot actions  must vitally supplement the picture of the battle of tommorrow's  fighters.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   The tactics of fighter aviation involve complex combat  equipment, and with each new type of aircraft and weapon, it  must seek new tactical techniques which are frequently  dissimilar to, and sometimes unique in past practice. If you put  a pilot of a future fighter in the cockpit of a MiG-23, say, I  don't know how he would do. There is no computer, to which he  has grown accustomed, no display with precise information on the  tactical situation either, maneuvers based on high  thrust-to-weight ratio and control of aerodynamic forces are  impossible. Under such conditions the pilot would simply be  unable to fight.    Perhaps this is an ingenuous comparison, but it does give  food for thought. For if you think about it, how eloquent here  the manifestation of interrelations of tactics and outmoded  equipment. Therefore, if we try to look into the 21st century,  then will we become witnesses, and perhaps even participants in  the new contradictions between tactics and equipment. In order  to resolve these contradictions and realize the high potential  capabilities of new-generation fighters, we will also need to  resolve other difficult problems, one of which is the air  adversary and his tactics.  <H5>  Chapter III. In Sharp Confrontation with Offensive Aviation </H5>   Bombers and fighters... It is a good seven decades now since  they came into the world, and for all these decades have been  fraught with the sharp confrontation between them. The  interrelations determining their development and improvement are  familiar. The very advent of the bombers called the fighter to  life, and it in turn led to the mounting of defensive weapons on  bombers, to the armoring of vulnerable points, to the protection  of gas tanks. Development of the defensive assets of bombers  brought forth further improvement in the armament of fighters:  the transition from machine-guns to cannon, then to missiles.  But similar relationships existed and exist between aviation  delivering strikes on troops and rear installations (let us call  it offensive aviation) and fighter aviation protecting them from  air strikes. The changes in tactics of one of the sides will  always entail the corresponding changes in the tactics of the  other. In tracing this dialectical, law-governed regularity,  which has been manifested quite clearly for many decades, we can  judge the development of the tactics of fighter aviation,  considering it within the framework of the general air defense  system with which the fighters jointly repel the raids of the  air adversary.  <H5>  1. Under the Onslaught of Offensive Aviation </H5>   The confrontation of Soviet fighter aviation and the  Hitlerite Luftwaffe began literally in the first minutes of the  Great Patriotic War, when the fascist bombers hit hard at our  cities and military installations. In the very first days of the  war, acting almost with impunity, the enemy was able to inflict  severe damage on troops and rear installations and the system of  air defense itself.    There were many reasons for such catastrophic consequences  of  the air strikes. Much has been said and written about these  reasons. Military historians note that right on the eve of war,  the advent of bomber aircraft in the air forces of fascist  Germany which were more dangerous than their predecessors, and  the mass nature of their use significantly improved the chances  of the aviation in battle against air defense. Of course the  natural lag of defensive means behind offensive means, although  it did exist, was not the only reason for the situation that had  been created.    Much postwar literature stresses the aggressor's material  superiority in forces, and his use of the factor of surprise.  The dramatic picture of disorganization and haplessness of the  air defense, including fighter aviation, in the repulse of first  massed enemy raids is explained by omissions in the training of  the Armed Forces for war, military-political errors of the  leadership, and the significant combat experience of the  Hitlerite aviation, which had been able to practice the  suppression of air defense systems of European countries and was  cloaked in an aura of invincibility. (At the start of the Second  World War, massed air strikes against Polish airfields,  antiaircraft positions, and command and control centers, in  which the attack of 2,000 Luftwaffe planes was opposed by about  140 fighters, had the result that the air defense system of  Poland virtually ceased to exist in the very first days of the  war. As a result of such massed strikes on French, Dutch, and  Belgian airfields, where a large number of fighters were  destroyed, the aggressor was able to shift to delivery of  strikes on other targets without significant resistance of the  fighter aviation of these countries (HISTORY OF THE SECOND WORLD  WAR, 1939-1945. Vol. 3. M.: Voyenizdat, 1974)) All these things  are true, of course. But publications pay significantly less  attention to the tactical aspects of the confrontation of  fighter aviation with the air adversary, which was also an  important cause of the failures.    Fascist bombers operated at low and medium altitudes (from  500 to 3,000 meters) in large groups, almost without fighter  cover, made so-called "star raids," arriving at their targets  from different directions, and repeated the raids several times.  What could fighter aviation do to oppose them? Low in numbers  because of losses inflicted on the ground, and inferior to the  enemy in tactical performance of the aircraft, it was committed  to battle too late and discredited itself becuase of its rare  appearances over protected targets. Frontline fighters, even  while on the airfields in immediate readiness for a sortie, did  not have time to meet the enemy. Air defense fighters,  possessing a longer enemy warning range than front-line  fighters, often intercepted the enemy using data obtained from  forward observation posts. However due to the unreliable warning  system, most often the fighters had to continuously patrol in  the air, hoping for an accidental encounter with the adversary.  So their actions often proved unfruitful.    All these defects and omissions had a negative affect on the  confrontation of the sides, as, incidentally, on the air defense  of other countries. Military specialists concluded that the  aviation had passed the combat equipment and tactics of air  defense in its development.    While restraining with all its might the onslaught of  offensive aviation, the fighters continuously revised and  improved their tactics. Changes could not take place overnight,  however. Before, the pilots had drawn their tactical wisdom from  the experience of the past, but now every day brought such  contradictory opinions, and confronted them with such unexpected  problems that only through profound analysis of air situations  could correct tactical recommendations be extracted from them.    Proven tactical techniques, which were tested by bitter  experience and had no analogues in the past, and the higher  tactical performance of planes entering the armament of fighter  aviation did their work, and further development of events  proved a surprise to Hitlerite aviation. Its massed raids were  opposed by a concentration of fighters forced in decisive axes,  and by more sophisticated tactical techniques. Already the  tactics of offensive aviation were seen to lag behind those of  fighter aviation.    In order to even out the situation somewhat, the Hitlerites  had to abandon the repeated raids on targets from different  directions, which demanded a great expenditure of forces, and  switched to actions in dense, less vulnerable battle formations.  The bombers reached their targets while changing directions and  altitudes, and, avoiding rote actions, sought to mislead the  fighters. The crews of the aircraft planned their routes so as  to create the impression that they were flying toward specific  targets, but then at the last moment would suddenly change  course and turn toward their planned targets. Another tactical  technique was the delivery of diversionary strikes on secondary  targets, while the main forces acted against the planned  targets. Fighter protection of the "Junkers" and "Heinkels" was  beefed up, and more forces began to be assigned to tie down our  fighters in battle and blockade their airfields.    Because of the dialectical relationship between offensive  weapons and defensive ones, the confrontation between them in  the subsequent course of battle ran with variable success. But  it always favored the side which used new types of aircraft and  concentrated large forces, allowed for the tactical innovations  of the other side, and quickly introduced correctives to its own  tactics in response to them.    By the end of the war fighter aviation had been transformed  into a terrifying adversary of fascist aviation. Possessing  decisive superiority in forces, it operated in accordance with a  uniform concept, and used maneuver of large forces extensively.  Front-line fighters were the first to encounter the enemy, and  their efforts were augmented by air defense aviation. Fascist  aviation still continued its raids, but when encountering the  opposition of fighter aviation, coordinated with respect to  target, time, and space, it gradually reduced its activeness.  Even such well-armed aircraft as the J-88 and He-111 could not  break through to their targets without substantial losses. In  confrontation with fighter aviation the enemy tried to  concentrate the forces of his aviation in individual sectors by  maneuver, creating special ace elements which arrived ahead of  time in the regions of upcoming action. The bombers sought to  reduce their time in regions within range of aviation, and  increased bombing altitudes, but such new tactical elements  reduced the effectiveness of strikes.    Experience of the Great Patriotic War exerted a great  influence on the nature of further confrontation between  fighters and offensive aviation in the postwar years, but the  adoption of nuclear weapons into the armament of the sides was a  powerful stimulus for its development. When aviation had only  conventional high-explosive and incendiary bombs, hundreds of  bombers were necessary to destroy targets of average dimensions.  If the air defense managed to keep the greater part of these  bombers from reaching the target, it was considered to be  successful, since the bombs dropped by the bombers breaking  through to the target were insufficient to destroy it. With the  advent of nuclear weapons, however, one plane armed with an atom  bomb could take the place of more conventionally-armed bombers  than any power in the world had, and its penetration to a major  target threatened colossal destruction and countless victims.    The tactics of aviation also changed radically. In massed  flights instead of dense battle formations, all at once there  were actions of a large number of single planes and small groups  of planes, dispersed in front and in depth. The simultaneous  appearance in the air of many independently operating targets  approaching the strike objectives from different directions, in  combination with jamming, put fighter aviation in a difficult  situation. Single enemy aircraft, which before had seemed easy  pickings for fighters, had become hard-to-kill, fast-moving,  high-altitude targets.    Foreign military specialists proved that it was a fantasy to  think that all aircraft carrying nuclear weapons could be  intercepted by existing air defense systems, given their limited  capabilities against a simultaneous fighter attack, without  fundamentally new air defense weapons and methods of their  delivery, which of course did not yet exist. "The probability of  destruction of aircraft must be the same at any point of a  defended space," the French military journal FORCE ARMEE  FRANCAISE noted. "As soon as the adversary discovers an unequal  distribution of defensive assets, he will attack from a safe  axis." (FORCE ARMEE FRANCAISE, 1973, No. 8, p 34.)    This is why, due to that same dialectical relation between  offensive and defensive weapons, the confrontation between  fighter and offensive aviation flared up with new force in the  mid 1950s. This was also because of the transition of aviation  from piston aircraft to jet, with more sophisticated armaments.    The development of aviation tactics in the very first  postwar  local wars occurred especially rapidly. As early as the Korean  War, beginning in 1952, American aviation began to operate in a  different way when encountering active opposition from the  fighter aviation of the KPA [Korean People's Army]. They  delivered strikes simultaneously against many objectives, using  a large number of forces, and were supported by various  disinformation measures in order to dissipate the efforts of the  fighter aviation.    Here is just one example. On 10 January 1953, about 300  tactical F-80 and F-84 fighters participated in a massed strike  and delivered strikes on nine road and railroad bridges on the  territory of the Korean People's Democratic Republic. The  approach of the main forces to the lines of radar detection and  their arrival at the targets were masked by jamming aircraft and  by the suppression of radars in false axes, by transmission of  false orders regarding the time and targets of strikes in  aviation radio nets in clear text, and also by special decoy  groups. (See: Stuart, J. Vozdushnaya moshch -- reshayushchaya  sila v Koree [Air Power -- a Decisive Force in Korea). M.,  Foreign Literature Publishing House, 1959, p. 151)    A serious impetus to the confrontation of tactics was  provided by the aggressive U.S. war in Southeast Asia. Attempts  of offensive aviation to operate without changing its prior  tactics resulted in heavy losses. Of course, at the start of the  war, taking advantage of the absence of an organized air  defense, American aviation operated almost without hindrance,  chiefly at medium altitudes, and the crews of the planes did not  use any new tactical techniques. They differed little from  actions against [practice) targets, which did not return fire.    But what happened later on? Later a quite unexpected turn of  events occurred. The aviation of the interventionists was not  able to break through the missile barrier which appeared in the  DRV [Democratic Republic of Vietnam] in 1965. In the first  battle on 26 June, Vietnamese SAM systems shot down three F-4  Phantoms at one time. (Hai Thu. North Vietnam Versus the U.S.  Air Force. Hanoi, 1968. p. 16) This had never happened before,  or at least it was very rare.    This lesson forced the offensive aviation to improve its  tactics. The appearance of SAM systems inevitably provoked a  response on its part. How could aircraft forced to enter the  kill zones of the SAMs be protected? At first the efforts of  military specialists were directed toward developing onboard  apparatus to warn of the launch of SAMs and detect the missiles  themselves. It was necessary to detect them at sufficiently  great distances from the aircraft for the crews to have time to  take protective steps, but attempts to develop such apparatus  were not crowned by success. It was necessary to look for weak  points in the air defense system, and to allocate significant  forces for suppression, exceeding several times over the  strength of the assault elements, and to develop means and  tactics for combatting SAM systems.    It was easiest to detect SAM systems from long range based  on  the operation of their target designation and missile guidance  radars. So-called anti-radar aircraft appeared which were  equipped with receiver/direction finders. They were supposed to  determine the coordinates of the radar-targets and guide  air-defense suppression elements to them. This was not a bad  idea, but without the means to measure the range to the targets  it was impossible to determine the precise location of the  sources of radar emission, and triangulation methods had still  not been mastered. Nor did it ensure simultaneous detection of  several SAM systems and their guidance systems, the number of  which continued to grow. More sophisticated anti-radar aircraft  with improved apparatus for electronics intelligence (F4G Wild  Weasel) were developed much later, with a lag of some fifteen  years behind the level of development of air defense.    It was also necessary to have some means of engaging the SAM  systems, also from long range. These were the Shrike anti-radar  missiles, which homed in on the operating radars. These missiles  were used for the first time in Vietnam, but had short range  (14-16 km), and when the radar stations were switched off by the  SAM crews they were knocked off course, and even retargeted  themselves on their own against other more powerful energy  sources. A result of ignoring this fact was that one day a  Shrike missile hit a shipboard radar of the American cruiser  "Warden" in the Tonkin Gulf instead of the Vietnamese SAM  system. The former was put out of commission and was sent to the  Philippines for repairs.    The airborne EW assets grew more and more diverse, but  control of them was manual and each operated in isolation. Even  in their aggregate they could no longer ensure effective  counteraction to the operation of air defense electronic systems.    Another circumstance also arose for aviation. When cannon  were replaced by air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, with  their powerful warheads and high firing accuracy, the problem of  survival of aircraft in the air was exacerbated. Survival became  as important as speed, maneuverability, and other  characteristics. This was mentioned in chapter II, but it is  important to stress it again, because the ways of enhancing  survival listed in Table 1 could no longer save aviation from  the deadly fire of SAM systems and fighters. The problem had to  be solved not so much in the military-technical context as in  the tactical context.    Since the whole group of counteractive means and tactical  techniques of crews was exhausted and did not bring the expected  results, foreign military scientists and designers directed  their efforts toward increasing the range of airborne weapons in  order to preclude the entry of the aircraft into the kill zones  of the SAM systems. This was a reassuring direction in the  struggle against them. The results were the gliding guided  aerial bombs and missiles with electro-optical and, later on,  laser guidance. Tactical techniques were also developed, whose  essence boiled down to using different deceptive maneuvers for  covert approach to bomb release and missile launch lines.    It seemed that a way out of the critical situation had been  found: aviation could deliver strikes on targets without  entering the SAM zones, or at least could spend minimal amount  of time in them. Now air defense was in a difficult situation,  and all the burden of combatting the airborne platforms of the  new weapons was carried by fighter aviation.  <H5>  2. History Repeats Itself </H5>   One encounters surprising coincidences in the history of  tactics. Strange as it may seem, in tracing the process of the  confrontation of fighter aviation with the air enemy, at times  we run into one and the same, seemingly long resolved problems,  which have cropped up again. One of them, for example, was the  battle with offensive aviation at low altitudes. At first glance  it would seem that there was nothing new here. Fighters were  repelling strikes from ground-hugging altitude back in the  Second World War. However in flight at an altitude of several  hundred meters, under the radar "lobes," the time of approach  and deployment of the aircraft in the vectoring regions of the  fighters grew so limited that there could be no question of  timely intercept of targets. Beside this, difficulties lay in  wait for pilots at low altitudes. On the one hand, due to the  limited range of detection of aviation, they could not climb in  time, and, on the other, even if they did manage to do so, the  control centers would not have time to guide them toward enemy  aircraft, and the pilots would have to search them out  themselves. But how can one look for low-flying targets if the  screens of the airborne scopes are filled with ground clutter?  Interception was also hindered by restrictions on speed,  maneuverability, and increased fuel expenditure in fighters, and  difficulties in piloting. According to statistical data, more  than 50 percent of air accidents in the U.S. Air Force occurring  through the fault of the pilots during the day, under visual  flight conditions, occurred at low altitudes, while performing  turns or horizontal maneuvers, while their flight time at an  altitude of 300 meters or less made up only 10 percent of total  flight time. (AVIATION WEEK, 1985. No. 1)    This is why during the war in Vietnam and in subsequent  local  wars, the use of low altitudes by aviation, where it could  covertly approach objectives and attack them with surprise,  became most important in tactics. By hugging the ground to  reduce the possible range of detection, and by using special  apparatus allowing prolonged flight with terrain following and  obstacle avoidance, the crews could operate under any weather  conditions day or night, and deliver strikes without visual  contact with the targets.    This is why the air defense, in retaliation, began to  organize unbroken low-altitude radar fields, create a special  system to warn of the flight of low-flying targets, began to  modernize sights and weapons, and improve the tactical  techniques of fighters. Nonetheless, the problem of timely  detection of low-flying targets became the main one, and the  most complex, for fighter aviation. Subsequently it developed  into the independent problem of all-weather long-range aircraft  detection, and rapid warning of all forces and assets of air  defense.    We have already considered this problem in examining the  confrontation of fighter aviation with fascist aviation, but  history has repeated itself. The fact is that as the flight  speeds of aircraft and the launch range of airborne weapons have  increased, it has become necessary for fighters to repel air  raids at longer and longer range from defended objectives. As  long as these speeds were relatively low and aviation did not  have guided bombs and missiles, the limited capabilities of  ground radars with respect to range of detection were not so  important. But now aviation was approaching the sound barrier,  and fighter aviation, despite the growth of combat capabilities,  was no longer able to commit adequate battle forces to repel  raids not only at low altitudes, but at other altitudes as well,  and could not realize the tactical radius of fighters to combat  aviation at the maximal ranges of their fuel reserve.    To increase the range of detection of aviation, the efforts  of designers and engineers of many countries were directed  toward raising the power of radar transmitters and improving the  sensitivity of receiving devices, toward changing the types of  antennas, and putting them on hills and high masts. As a result  new models of radars appeared, with better resolution and  resistance to jamming, and higher accuracy in determining target  coordinates. But what of range of operation? Alas, it increased  comparatively little. It became clear that the problem would be  hard to resolve in that way.    It proved possible to radically increase the range of  detection by mounting radars on airborne platforms: planes,  helicopters, and dirigibles. Here the radar antennas were put on  a kilometer-high hill, so to speak. However only those radars  which used the pulsed-Doppler method, which makes it possible to  follow aerial targets against the background of the ground or  water surface, could be "raised to the sky." To do this it was  necessary to solve a number of purely technical problems, i.e.,  to develop special antennas and control apparatus, reduce their  mass and size, and seek out new methods of detection of fast and  low-altitude targets. In this regard, in the development of  airborne platforms, their capabilities for carrying radar  equipment were considered more important than their tactical  performance. The basic requirements were merely high carrying  capacity and flight time.    As a result of years of research and development begun in  the  60s, radar early warning aircraft equipped with surveillance  radars were designed, and the efforts of the military industry  abroad were concentrated on development of whole aircraft  systems for long-range radar detection and control. Such a  system (AWACS) was developed at the end of the 70s in the U.S.  Possessing E-3A aircraft (Figure 31--[not reproduced]) equipped  with powerful radars, high-speed computers, and equipment for  processing and transmission of information and for situation  display, it still continues to operate without vital changes in  functions in the air defense system of the North American  continent and in the armed forces of the NATO bloc.    Adoption of airborne early warning aircraft in the air  defense systems, and their mass use, drastically changed the  situation in favor of fighter aviation. The radar field  immediately shifted to the depth of the territory of the  opposing side, and continuous surveillance of the air situation  and control of fighters over an enormous depth was ensured, not  only at high altitude, but at low as well. Thus, according to  the data of the foreign press, the aforementioned AWACS system  allows surveillance of air space over an area of 31,000 sq. km,  detection of aerial targets and guidance of fighters at ranges  of up to 600 km at high altitudes, and up to 400 km at low. Here  it is possible to detect up to 600 targets and track 250 of  them. (AIR FORCE MAGAZINE, 1984, No. 6)    Behind these numbers stands the whole problem, with aspects  reassuring to fighter aviation and alarming to offensive  aviation. On the one hand, the necessary range of detection of  aviation and timely scrambling of fighters to repel its raids  were achieved, and their control during commitment to battle and  in battle were assured, while on the other hand the capabilities  of aviation to achieve covertness and surprise of action became  problematic. In addition, airborne radar systems became in  themselves more survivable. Ground radars had permanent  coordinates which could be determined ahead of time by aviation  even in those cases when they were not operating. But airborne  radars were mobile and could elude the sight of the adversary by  ceasing operation and changing location.    Airborne early warning and control systems, allowing  detection of targets against ground clutter, seemingly made it  ill-advised for aviation to approach the targets of a strike at  low altitude -- the only tactical technique allowing crews to  evade the detection by radar. After all, all other techniques  demanded preliminary suppression of air defense assets in the  zone of flight. It seemed that an insurmountable barrier had  been put in the way of aviation. Fighter pilots sighed in  relief: the onslaught of aviation had been reliably repulsed.  But their joy was premature. Aviation quickly reacted to the  next innovation, and other ways to accomplish their missions  were found.    One such way was the use of early warning and control  aircraft by aviation in its own interests. First efforts in this  direction were taken back in Vietnam in raids by American  strategic bombers on the cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. Along  with the bombers, or somewhat ahead of them, EC-121K "Warning  Star" and E-2A "Hawkeye" aircraft took off to perform the  functions of airborne command posts. They conducted surveillance  of the air situation, warned the crews of the approach of  Vietnamese fighters, and issued target designations to their  fighters, F-4 Phantoms. Later on, in 1982, early-warning  aircraft, now the E-2C Hawkeye, were used extensively in  Israel's aggression in Lebanon. (AIR FORCE, 1986, No. 4)    Another such method, which appeared in the Arab-Israeli war  of 1973, was the sharp increase in electronic warfare (EW). The  tactics of aviation in combatting fighter aviation were marked  by the variety of the EW assets used. Combined jamming (active  noise, response-pulse jamming, and passive jamming) were used  against command and control centers and airborne weapons radars,  both by special jammers and by combat aircraft. Dipole  reflectors and IR decoys were used against missiles with radar  and heat-seeking homing heads.    Electronic warfare was used even more in Lebanon, where  Israeli aviation first laid down massive jamming in the region  of combat action, then delivered strikes under its cover against  the SAM positions and actively jammed the fighter's command and  control centers and the fighters in the air, and only then did  the assault elements enter the region. All this resulted in  almost complete disruption of the command and control of fighter  aviation, and offensive aviation accomplished its missions  without significant losses. (AIR FORCE, 1982, No. 7; MILITARY  TECHNOLOGY, 1984, No. 7)    In the comparatively small and brief military conflict of  the  U.S. in Libya in March-April 1986, events developed analogously,  but the air tactics were structured on a more sophisticated  technical foundation. Before the start of the American air  raids, Libya's air defense system was carefully reconnoitered by  reconnaissance satellites and early warning aircraft, and active  and passive jamming of great intensity was directed against  ground radars, homing heads, and radar proximity fuses of  missiles. New high-speed (up to M 3.5) HARM missiles, equipped  with broadband homing heads which "memorized" the direction of  the radar after it was switched off, replaced the Shrike  anti-radar missiles. Launch range of the missiles had reached 80  km, and the crews could use them without entering the kill zones  of the SAM systems.    Subsequently the anti-radar aircraft, or Wild Weasel system,  which had earned its right to exist back in Vietnam, experienced  a rebirth. They directed the search of radar targets, selected  the most dangerous of them, and issued target designations to  air defense suppression elements. Cluster bombs and anti-radar  missiles began to be mounted on these aircraft, and new elements  in crew tactics were noted. Anti-radar aircraft were to be the  first to begin suppressing the air defense, without entering the  kill zone of the SAMs, and jointly with combat aircraft to  support flight to the targets of the assault elements, creating  safe corridors for penetration to the planned targets. In turn  the pilots masked the launch of anti-radar missiles with  jamming, and they were often able to achieve surprise. All this  reduced the survivability of air defenses, and prevented them  from rapidly restoring combat readiness.    It seemed that the air defense system could no longer stand  up to the indestructible onslaught of aviation. But one has to  know dialectics. It seeks and finds ways out of the most  hopeless situations. Attainments of aviation in the field of  electronic warfare sharply exacerbated the confrontation of  tactics and lent new stimulus to the development of EW assets of  the opposing side. Radar jamming, decoy targets? But there are  other ways of combatting them. There were new studies and  experiments, and then air defense had other electronic systems  with greater energy potential, phased-array radar antennas, and  more reliable receiving devices with enhanced signal-processing  quality using super high-speed integrated circuits. Anti-radar  missiles? These were countered by long-range SAM systems, which  pushed the missile platforms to the limits of their launch,  radar emitters which guided the missiles out of their  trajectory, and various deceptive and masking measures. Jamming  equipment appeared on the fighters themselves. Other EW assets  were developed and improved, and became part of the air defense  elements. Electronic warfare ceased to be conducted  unilaterally, only by aviation.    These attainments in raising the interference resistance of  air defense systems were so great that they gave ground for the  claims of military experts that assets as anti-radar reflectors  and transmitters, emitting noise and response-pulse jamming,  would soon become ineffective.    And aviation? Indeed, it had difficulty suppressing all air  defense assets. Their number reached astronomical figures.  Radars of different bands, pulsed and pulsed-doppler with  different methods of protection against jamming, they filled the  air with millions of pulses per second. It was necessary to  select and suppress those of them which posed the immediate  threat.    Meanwhile a new barrier had arisen before fighter aviation,  and a new enemy became visible -- cruise missiles. I should say  at once that history again repeated itself, these missiles were  already familiar weapons. Their prototypes were known back in  the second World War (the FAU-1 aircraft-projectiles) and were  developed in the U.S. in the postwar years ("Regulus," "Snark,"  "Mace") but interest in them declined with the advent of  intercontinental ballistic missiles. Development of cruise  missiles was renewed many years later, only in the mid-70s, when  development of science and technology made it possible to create  small gas-turbine engines ensuring a low specific consumption of  fuel, to reduce dimensions and mass of the missiles, and to  raise the accuracy of the guidance systems. The number of types  of missiles under development increased swiftly, and their range  and accuracy grew.    Back in 1978 the U.S. conducted first experimental launches  of the "Tomahawk" tactical missiles against ground targets  (TLAM-C), in 1979, from ground launchers (GLCM), and in 1980  strategic cruise missiles, launched from aircraft, appeared  (ALCM). Fitted with inertial guidance systems, supporting their  flight to targets at maximally low altitudes, and armed with  nuclear or conventional warheads, cruise missiles could reach  targets several hundred to several thousand kilometers away.  (INTERAVIA, 1981, No. 12).    Following the cruise missiles, drones (BLA) joined the  battle  against fighter aviation. Subsonic and supersonic, with a mass  from 90 kg to 4.5 t, they were intended for the conduct of  reconnaissance, radioelectronic suppression, the delivery of  strikes against air defense assets, and correction of artillery  fire. The low cost of these drones makes it possible to use them  on a mass scale, and their small size also makes them less  vulnerable to air defense weapons.    Such properties of cruise missiles and drones again put the  fighters and all air defense in a difficult position. After all,  the radar cross section of these aerial targets was so low that  on the screens of ground radars and onboard weapons sights they  appear scarcely noticeable, now flickering, now disappearing,  now merging with "ground clutter," now points lost in the  jamming.    The tactics of Israeli aviation relied on precisely these  properties of drones in 1973 and in the armed conflict in  Lebanon in 1982. Using drones, they first determined the  location and parameters of operation of the air defense assets  of the Arab countries, and then launched strikes against them  with piloted aircraft. Here the drones were used to lay down a  curtain of dipole reflectors and as dummy targets to provoke the  SAM complexes and antiaircraft artillery to open fire. (NATO's  FIFTEEN NATIONS, 1985, August).    The first drones were shot down by fighters back in Vietnam  (Figure 32 [not reproduced]), but the experience obtained  demonstrated that to combat such qualitatively different, small  targets required a different approach, different assets for  their detection and identification, weapons which had a very  short reaction time, increased accuracy and rate of fire. And  again one detected a lag of fighter aviation behind the level of  development of offensive air weapons, and again it was faced  with the need of further development of tactics on the basis of  new equipment. But after all, the means of defense will not  appear before the means of offense.    The conflict between offense and fighter aviation breaks out  with new force. What can fighters use to oppose their adversary  today? Tracing the paths of development of tactics of the  opposing sides, based on what has already occurred, we will now  make a few generalizations, and analyze how this objective  law-governed regularity is manifested today, and sketch a  "portrait" of the offensive aviation with which our fighters  must be ready to join in battle, recalling that it will be a  joint battle with ground air defense assets.  <H5>  3. Who Must Fighters Fight Today </H5>   As any complex phenomenon, the tactics of present-day  aviation include many components. In their content one can  distinguish first of all the changes in the disposition and  combat formations of groups, profiles of flight to the targets  of a strike and tactical techniques to attain secrecy and  suppress air defense, and, very importantly, two different  tendencies:    --penetration to the strike objectives on the principle of  "force";    --avoidance of action of forces and resources of air defense  of the adversary.    Of course these tendencies are not new, but judging from the  views of the NATO military leaders, and the experience of  exercises, and also the most recent local wars and military  conflicts, they are acquiring new content.    Penetration to the strike objectives on the principle of  "force" presupposes engagement and radioelectronic suppression  of air defense assets. They are precisely what give rise to the  intensity of the conflict and the absence of compromise of  positions of the opposing sides in that reality which had  developed by the start of the 90s. And the reality for aviation  is dispiriting -- the problem of its overcoming air defense is  to this point considered unresolved, and consists of ensuring  flight through overlapping SAM envelopes of an enormous number  of SAM complexes and overcoming the barrier of powerful fighter  aviation armed with long-range air-to-air missiles and capable  of performing day or night under any weather conditions.  Therefore, in the opinion of foreign military specialists, no  aviation might will allow it to accomplish a single combat  mission if the entire air defense system of the opposing side is  not first destroyed.    There was no such precept in the past. Then the suppression  of air defense assets was a secondary and even passing problem  for aviation, but this was because such a powerful defensive  system did not exist either. This is why aviation is forced to  devote primary attention to the conflict with air defense,  despite the fact that it demands the exertion of great efforts,  reduces the power of strikes, and complicates its structuring.  From overcoming the air defenses (a concept which suggests only  partial suppression of the air defenses and various flanking  maneuvers), aviation is shifting to a breakthrough of the air  defenses, i.e., penetration to the objectives on the principle  of "force."    The tactics of aviation in the breakthrough of air defenses  consists of using specially assigned elements to combat the air  defenses with and jamming to make "corridors" for passage of the  assault elements to the targets. Here initially aircraft and  drones suppress the defense from zones bordering the  breakthrough sectors, deliver strikes jointly with air- and  ground-launched missiles against radar posts, air defense  command and control centers, SAM positions and fighter  airfields, and then the assault elements proceed to their  targets, and, in turn, jam the air defense assets from their  battle formations. Fighters supporting the assault aviation are  also part of the anti-air defense elements. They sweep the  airspace on the flight paths of the assault elements, form  barriers at approaches to the assault objectives, and their  actions are strictly coordinated in place and time from the  airborne command posts (AWACS).    At the same time, in devising the tactics of offensive  aviation, the military leaders of the NATO air forces to  preserve its forces strive to optimally mass their efforts and  reduce to a minimum the time spent on delivering massed  assaults. This is a very vital circumstance. You see, the  shorter the duration of the assaults, the less time the fighters  will have to repel the raids, and some of them will not even  have time to take off from their airfields. Under the conditions  of intensive jamming, the surviving air defense assets will not  have time to engage all aircraft involved in the assault either.  In addition, massed use of aviation along with drones and  missiles may lead to an oversaturation of the air defense system  with various aerial targets, and it will cease to cope with its  data processing. This will also be furthered by changes in the  disposition of aviation in massed assaults. With the adoption of  precision weapons and new target designation equipment, the  battle formations will consist of small elements: two or four,  more rarely eight aircraft each.    A short massed assault with very high density in narrow  breakthrough corridors, combined with heavy fire and  radioelectronic countering action -- this according to foreign  military experts is how the tactics of offensive aviation are  seen in the conflict with air defense.    However penetration to the assault objectives on the  principle of "force" when hundreds of planes and other aircraft  are concentrated in the air in a limited space, and for a short  time, is the enemy of surprise, and naturally cannot remain  unnoticed by the opposing side. Therefore it is considered  necessary in all cases to supplement the breakthrough of air  defense with supporting measures to avoid the action of its  forces and assets.    Avoidance of the action of air defense forces and assets  (the  second tendency) is based chiefly on their disinformation and  further development of all types of maneuver.    Impressively large-scale disinformation measures are  becoming  a characteristic feature of aviation tactics. New tactical  innovations, with the goal not of destroying or suppressing air  defense forces and assets, but of concealing the composition,  time, and direction of aviation assaults, are appearing more and  more. The problem of disinformation is formulated quite simply:  how to deceive and force the air defense system to meet aviation  where in fact there is none. To resolve this problem, along with  the preparation of massed assaults in the main sector, it is  considered necessary to create groupings of assault and  reconnaissance aircraft and drones in secondary (dummy) axes.  With the start of massed assaults, actions against fighter  airfields, radar posts, SAM assets are supposed to be  implemented not only in the breakthrough corridors, but also  over the entire line of the front and they may even be increased  in intensity in the dummy axes. Such action procedures, foreign  military experts believe, will force the fighter aviation to  maneuver to reinforce the dummy axes and thus weaken its  strength in the breakthrough sectors.    There is also another aspect to this problem. One need not  possess special perspicacity to see that there is nothing easier  than to provoke a hasty readying of forces and assets of air  defense, premature scrambling of fighters in the periods  preceding the delivery of massed air assaults. Simulation of a  massed scrambling of aviation from airfields, the transmission  of false commanders by radio, the laying down of radar  jamming... Imagine the difficulties that a commander will have  in estimating the situation, if these disinforming measures are  maximally plausible, if they are conducted by the attacking  aviation in a coordinated manner, in accordance with a  preplanned scenario. This is why western theorists believe that  as a result of such measures the sense of vigilance of crews at  the command and control posts will be blunted. When the  fighters, scrambled due to an incorrect assessment of the  situation, having expended their fuel, are coming in for a  landing, they will not be able to take part in the repulse of an  initiated massed raid which will be timed for this moment.    And finally, this use of decoy targets will be organized in  the disinformation measures on a large scale. This is assisted  by the adoption into the aviation armament of qualitatively new  EW assets. There are now an enormous number of decoy targets.  Some of them do not have a power plant and operate for a short  time, others are equipped with navigational apparatus, active  jamming transmitters and automatic chaff dispensers, and may fly  for some time along trajectories analogous to the routes of  combat aircraft.    All these decoy targets can proceed along many routes  intersecting with combat aircraft and complicate the detection  of rear targets by the opposing side, or be used as decoys to  draw significant fighter forces. Independent actions of decoy  targets at the limits of detection and intercept of fighter  aviation are possible, chiefly for disinformation of command and  control posts.    Of course an increase in the specific weight of  disinformation measures plays a negative role in complicating  the situation for fighter aviation, but in opposing attacking  aviation, it is also awaited by maneuvering targets.    What is a modern maneuvering target and what are the  capabilities for such targets to avoid the action of fighters?  They are small groups or single planes, cruise missiles, drones  with active jammers, operating within the framework of the  general disposition and concept of the attacking aviation in a  specific range of altitudes. The more the use of precision  weapons becomes part of its practice, the more of these targets  will be in massed raids. Where before it was necessary to expend  hundreds of conventional munitions, today one or several  precision missiles are enough. Therefore the crews can operate  while observing the principle of "each to his own target," and  widely utilize anti-fighter and anti-air defense maneuvers.    Of these two basic types of maneuvers, we are interested  chiefly in anti-fighter maneuver, which is done to avoid an  encounter and leave the zone of possible attacks of fighters or  to foil an aimed missile launch. No so long ago the main type of  maneuver, known even before the Second World War, was a sharp  turn toward the attacking fighters with maximum possible angular  velocity. The fitting with radar sights and air-to-air guided  missiles still did not lead to vital changes in the tactics of  anti-fighter maneuvering in the wars in Vietnam and in the Near  East. Missiles of that time had limited maneuver capabilities  and short ranges and, therefore, if the attacked aircraft turned  sharply, they would miss them.    However later, when more sophisticated missiles entered the  fighter armament, allowing them to attack air targets at various  aspect angles, from long range and secretly, maneuvers to evade  them were vitally complicated and pervaded with new elements.  Transition to maximal flight speed, descent to minimal  acceptable altitude in combination with maneuver in course and  bypassing of regions protected by patrolling fighters, these and  other maneuvers are programmed beforehand or may be input in the  program by the crew during the flight. There are many varieties  of anti-fighter maneuvers. One might say there are as many as  there are situations in air-to-air combat. It is also necessary  to execute anti-missile maneuvers against missiles already  launched by fighters, or in expectation of their launch  (uncoordinated turns with significant slip, maneuvers with  sign-variable G-forces).    To execute a maneuver under the new conditions, the crews  use  onboard equipment which warns of missile launch from fighters  using both radar and IR guidance systems. These equipments are  connected to jammers and IR tracers, and automatically are  activated upon detection of a launch. If the missiles are  "blinded," then regardless of the horizontal or vertical angle  at which they are detected, the most advisable maneuver for the  crews is a sharp turn at high G-forces in a direction  perpendicular to their line of flight.    Consequently now the crews of attacked fighters may begin  the  anti-fighter maneuver long before the fighters reach visual  contact range, and they combine an energetic defensive turn with  the use of EW assets.    Here is another interesting feature. The anti-fighter  maneuver is done in zones of antiaircraft missile and artillery  fire of air defense assets, and cannot but be combined by the  crews with anti-air defense maneuver, in order to avoid entering  these zones, and in the event that they do enter them, in order  to avoid being hit by missiles and projectiles. However in  execution of an anti-air defense maneuver, the crews encounter a  new situation. In continuous zones of missile and artillery  fire, the crew's knowledge of the location of fire complexes in  the terrain loses its importance, and when there are not  continuous zones, highly-mobile complexes capable of delivering  fire from short halts and on the move ensure the most timely  information about their coordinates and evasive maneuvers  planned in advance. Therefore, a more advisable form of maneuver  both against missile and artillery assets and against fighters  is considered above to be maneuver in altitude.    The range of maneuver altitudes in the general case may vary  from maximally low to maximally high, but maneuver in altitude  with subsequent transition to low altitude (fig. 33), as it was  until recently, no longer allows aviation to achieve surprise,  since it does not emerge from the surveillance zones of the  AWACS aircraft, which are capable of detecting targets against  the background of the ground. Expectation of secrecy is not  justified. Avoiding an encounter at low altitude with fighters,  just as engagement by numerous low-altitude SAM and artillery  complexes, is becoming more and more difficult. Therefore, the  need arises for further reduction in altitude, which, as  experience of the war in Afghanistan testifies, should not  exceed 15-20 m (height of the bottom limit of the kill zone of  the "Stinger" missile). But here it is hard to judge what is  more dangerous for the crews flying at high speed: destruction  by air defense weapons or collision with the ground. After all,  with an increase in speed the minimal safe flight altitude  increases, maneuverability decreases, and terrain-following  becomes impossible and, indeed, the plane itself becomes a power  source of thermal radiation and therefore is vulnerable to  missiles with IR guidance not only from the rear, but from the  front hemisphere. In addition, during flight at maximally low  altitude, it is hard, or, more precisely, impossible to search  for mobile camouflaged targets, to use guided bombs and other  precision weapons. So how will the crews operate in such  situations? They are forced to go to medium altitudes, but even  such a brief maneuver leads to loss of secrecy of actions.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-43A>      Figure 33. Maneuver in altitude to evade air defense actions. </FIG>     In order to ensure clandestine flight at very low altitude,  abroad they are trying to develop more sophisticated look-down  radars, allowing the crews to adjust their direction of flight  before reaching the objectives and to launch the missiles at  them without changing altitude. However, development of such  radars is still very far from perfection. It is thought more  sensible to combine maneuver in altitude with radioelectronic  countermeasures against the air defenses by the crews themselves  using their onboard EW systems, with permission suppression of  air defense installations in the flight zone. However, the  difficult flight conditions at maximally low altitude provide,  in the opinion of foreign military experts, an urgent need for  the use of other altitudes as well.    High altitudes are inconvenient for aviation; from them it  is  not possible to detect and deliver assaults against small and  mobile targets. Nonetheless, flight at these altitudes by some  crews to avoid encountering fighter aviation, the air force  leaders of western countries believe to be advisable. Here, due  to the significant dimensions of the "dead zones" of radars,  gaps are formed in the radar field created, rendering the  vectoring of fighters more difficult. In addition the density of  the antiaircraft fire is decreased (fig. 33). It is clear from  the figure that although the crews enter the zones of engagement  of the SAM complexes at any altitude, at high altitude, where  the number and dimensions of these zones are decreased, and the  flight speed increases, the crews cross them more quickly and  pass above the engagement zones of the low-altitude complexes.    However not all foreign military specialists so  categorically  believe in the capabilities of the crews avoiding the action of  present day air defenses. Is this not why a breakthrough of the  defense, and not overcoming it, is considered decisive in the  combat actions of aviation? Or is it that adequately effective  variants have still not been found?    Penetration to the assault objectives on the principle of  "force" or evasion of air defense actions? It would seem to be a  strange question. Both are necessary features of the tactics of  attacking aviation. But which of these features will take the  primary role in the future? Under the onslaught of what sort of  adversary will the fighters find themselves?    Don't wait for commentaries; there won't be any. Draw your  own conclusions. You will be able to test them by looking at the  further development of aviation tactics, about which we will  speak.  <H5>  4. A Look at the Future </H5>   Military specialists abroad are striving to predict the  paths  of further development of tactics of aviation in combating  fighter aviation. In their forecasts they allow for  scientific-technical progress occurring in aviation, and various  military-technical innovations which by the start of the 21st  century might enter its armament. And those efforts which are  undertaken in many countries of the world to develop new  tactical technicals and recommendations to aircraft crews of the  future become understandable. Wherein lies their fundamental  novelty?    All expected offensive air weapons from the standpoint of  tactics may be subdivided into two large groups. One of them,  aircraft, are the platforms for new types of precision, long  range weapons of modular design to engage various targets  without entering the zones of engagement of the ground air  defense forces, and even without crossing the front lines of the  opposing side at all. This group should also include  reconnaissance aircraft with radiotechnical reconnaissance  equipment, air elements of reconnaissance-strike complexes, and  AWACS planes. They all perform support tasks, operate at a long  range from and often beyond the borders of our radar field, and  also may provide radioelectronic countermeasures and be  protected by air defenses.    The other group consists of high-speed, highly maneuverable  aircraft with a low radar cross section and high thrust, having  integrated EW assets and defensive weapons. This group also  includes cruise missiles and drones of various types and for  various purposes. They all are intended for actions over  territory protected by air defenses.    In developing the tactics of each of these two groups, the  air force leaders of the western countries attach primary  importance to the platform aircraft of the first group, which  use precision weapons. They predict a great future for them.    The crews of the platform aircraft are given the task of  destroying the most important, well-protected objectives, and  also participating in the break-through of the air defenses:  assaults against SAM positions and fighter airfields in order to  create a path to targets for the second group.    The crews operating outside the zones of the SAM complexes  and at maximum range of the fighters naturally do not require  anti-air defense maneuvers. Their tactics will boil down to  different types of anti-fighter maneuvers which it is envisaged  they will perform in accordance with information of AWACS  aircraft. However these planes, which play a very important role  in controlling aviation, themselves are primary targets for the  actions of fighters. Of course, they patrol in engagement zones  of the SAM complexes, and are protected by fighters and  equipment with EW apparatus, and can detect fighters of the  opposing side long before the latter get close to them.  Nonetheless the crews of these planes complain of the complexity  and unreliability of coordination with protecting assets.    Western specialists are concerned by the question: how to  protect the large, poorly maneuverable AWACS from attacks by  fighters, what tactical techniques should the crews use?  Specialists name them quite definitely (fig. 34). Look at this  figure. Is it not true that as you get deeper into the territory  of the adversary in the search for an AWACS plane, you have  something to think about? It is as simple as can be to get in  trouble here.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-44A>      Figure 34. Tactical techniques of crews of AWACS aircraft under threat of fighter attack. </FIG>     The tactics of combat aircraft of the second group, which  will proceed to the assault objectives over corridors cut  through the air defense system by missiles of the platform  aircraft of the first group, in the opinion of foreign military  experts, will be based chiefly on avoiding the action of the  surviving air defenses. No, of course they will not ignore the  losses from the engagement by these assets, but will rely more  on planes with very low radar cross sections and weak IR  radiation, so-called invisible (stealth) aircraft. (Fig. 35 [not  reproduced])    It is clear from the figure that these aircraft in outward  appearance, despite the various purposes, have common features:  they do not have large flat surfaces, breaks in their skin, or  vertical control surfaces, and the B-2 bomber, made in the shape  of a "flying wing," has no tail section at all. The engines and  weapons are hidden in a well "slicked" fuselage, with air  intakes on the top to reduce IR noticeabilty.    What are these strange changes that we observe in the  designs  of combat aircraft? Now almost all of them, developed or planned  for development in developed capitalist countries, are built  with the use of technical solutions aimed at reducing their  conspicuousness, and a mass adoption of "invisible" planes in  the aviation armament is planned. But why are conventional  planes giving way to inconspicuous ones? They are now talking of  these wonderful machines in full voice, and it is easy to  explain why: the possibility of covert actions of crews over the  territory of the opposing side, once thought impossible, has  appeared.    Many military experts predict a great future for the  "stealths." However the term "invisible" is just a metaphor. In  fact they will not be as invisible as is thought, although they  will be the sort of plane which is hard to detect. Therefore,  the elation of their admirers is somewhat exaggerated. But if we  are logical and consistent, then all this by no means appears  depressing for the crews of these aircraft. Irony here is out of  place. The new combat properties of the "invisibles" will  provide scope for development also of fundamentally new tactical  techniques. No longer maneuvers in course and speed, not able  selection of weather conditions, and not suppression of air  defenses, for many years proclaimed among the main principles of  tactical techniques, but quite different components will  determine the nature of actions of these aircraft.    The tactics of crews of these "invisibles" will be quite  diverse. They may operate independently, alone or in small  groups, or in close coordination with the crews of different  types of aircraft.    In independent actions of "invisibles" the foundation of  their tactical techniques will be the capacity of penetration to  the assault objectives unnoticed by the air defense radars or IR  assets. However, since it is impossible to fully eliminate the  give-away signs of the aircraft, in order to remain undetected  the crews must constantly maintain a specific distance from the  detection means. Is it possible to achieve this in a continuous  radar field of the opposing side? American military experts  developing the new technologies of "invisible" aircraft answer  this question in the affirmative. They assume that crews having  data on the location of the most dangerous radars and possessing  high professional proficiency, will be able to ensure, if not  full secrecy of flight, then at least later detection by air  defenses, not leaving time to the SAM complexes and fighters to  engage and intercept.    For a reduction in the time spent in the surveillance and  engagement envelopes of the air defenses, strict limitations in  the use of airborne radars and other radiating electronics, and  almost complete radio silence throughout the entire combat  flight, as well as the use of EW assets, are envisaged. The  crews of the "invisibles" much more easily than other aircraft  can camouflage their weak signs or create blips of decoy targets  of low intensity on the scopes of fighters and radars of SAM  complexes. As for the flight altitudes, it is advisable for them  to be medium and high altitudes, more convenient for  accomplishment of combat missions. In addition low-altitude  flight, requiring continuous operation of terrain-following  radar, especially at night and in difficult weather conditions,  may strongly betray the "invisibles."    In coordination with aircraft of other types, the  "invisibles" may support their combat actions, first penetrating  enemy territory to suppress his air defenses and search for  objectives. Another version is also possible, which conventional  planes with long-distance missiles will be the first to deliver  an assault on air defense installations without entering their  engagement zones. Then the "invisibles" (B-2 bombers) as it were  in a second wave will enter the corridor formed to engage mobile  missile complexes, enterprises of the military industry, and  other remote objectives. But in all variants the routes of the  flights, the time of approach and passage of the lines and zones  of air defense will be carefully coordinated and combined with  various disinformation measures.    The tactics of the crews of other combat aircraft which do  not have low radar cross sections to an even greater degree than  for the "invisibles" will be directed toward disinformation of  the entire defense system. In this they will be assisted by the  onboard equipment, ensuring continuous maneuvering of the planes  in automatic mode, flight along the route with hard-to-predict  changes in course, and more sophisticated EW assets. In  assessing the possibilities of universal highly automated EW  complexes with programmed control and comparing them with the  interference resistance of the command and control posts and  onboard systems of the fighters, some foreign experts smile  ironically: the radioelectronic situation for the opposing side  will be so complex that the success of the attacking aviation is  beyond doubt.    But is that so? The expected complication of the situation  may lead to a vital reduction in the effectiveness of combat  actions of the fighter aviation, but only in the case that  further development of defense ceases. However, such stagnation  has never been observed in the history of the opposition of the  means of defense and attack. In each previous turn of the  dialectical spiral, the development of fighter tactics has  followed the tactics of offensive aviation. So a one-sided  prediction with the accent on the development of only one side  holds the danger of great error.    Let us try at least in general outline to prove the  rightness  of this precept and to sketch the contours of the further  confrontation. This situation is greatly brightened by the  development of the EW assets of the opposing side. Foreign  military specialists place great hopes on the mono-pulse radar,  allowing the fighter command and control centers to obtain  information about the range and direction of the targets to be  intercepted using only one pulse. They assume that serious  difficulties will arise for the attacking aviation with  expansion of the waveband of the new radars from the millimeter  to the long waves, and with the development and use by the crews  of technical techniques such as rapid change in the shape of  pulses, retuning of the frequency from pulse to pulse.    In the capacity of retaliatory measures to the strengthening  of radioelectronic countermeasures of aviation, the possibility  is considered of creating air defense radar systems in which the  transmitting and receiving antennas are widely separated from  one another. Without an idea where the receiver is located, the  crews of the planes may jam only in the direction of the  transmitter, while the receiver will be unaffected by jamming.  But an ever more insidious threat to aviation is created by a  wide network of passive assets for the detection and tracking of  air targets, which it will be impossible not only to suppress,  but even to detect. And what about weapons systems on the  fighters with combined guidance (radar, infrared, electro-optic,  laser)? After all, all of these systems must be suppressed  simultaneously and immediately! It turns out that the outcome of  the confrontation becomes quite problematic, just like the paths  of development of the very tactics of offensive aviation.    However, aviation will have yet another "trump card" -- the  cruise missiles of tomorrow, precision, long and medium range,  with different warheads (dispenser, armor-piercing,  concrete-piercing). Although according to the treaty between the  USSR and the U.S., ground-based cruise missiles have been  eliminated, air- and sea-launched cruise missiles remain, and  this certainly does not make things easier for fighters.    Pilots will be in a difficult situation when intercepting  cruise missiles launched many hundreds of kilometers away from  the protected installations, missiles moving at high, supersonic  speed, maneuvering in accordance with a program for searching  for the given targets and evading the attacks of fighters. How  can such missiles be attacked, which automatically select the  optimal flight trajectory, go around obstacles in their path to  the target, and even have reduced levels of give-away signs? At  the same time, judging from the development of cruise missiles  being conducted abroad, the effectiveness of their assaults will  become so great that any assumption of intercept is obviously  unacceptable. Plans are to mount infrared and optical  instruments, connected to a system for matching the contrast  contours of observed objects and those entered in memory.  Systems are being developed for autonomous (from on board the  missile) evaluations of the degree of destruction of the  objects, retargeting the missiles at surviving elements and  delivering munitions to the targets at an aspect angle most  effective for their destruction. (FLIGHT, 1988, No. 4132.)    Of course, a few paragraphs about the cruise missiles of the  future is only a concentrate of information, and indeed not a  complete one. For the time being, arguments about new approaches  to the tactics of fighters in combatting cruise missiles remain  just as incomplete. In order that I not repeat myself, I  recommend that the reader turn to chapter II and look again at  the capabilities of future fighters.    So how does the onslaught of the air adversary, armed with  super-modern equipment, appear? How does he intend to use all  these military technical novelties in the fight with fighter  aviation, considering that the latter, too, continues to be  improved? There is a constant discussion of opinions, ideas,  views regarding questions of further confrontation of offensive  and fighter aviation. Much is still unclear. Will not fighter  aviation be confronted by other conditions of combat action,  today unknown, by the start of the coming era? This is the key  question of the problem. It is answered in different ways, and  this is a true sign that the problem is still not resolved. But  here we enter the shaky ground of suppositions, and will not be  hasty in our forecasts. Clearly, even if resolved in the  technical context, a problem will still long await its technical  solutions.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   The process of confrontation of tactics of the opposing  sides, occurring in close relation and mutual causation, is a  natural and continuous one. Here any of the directions of such  confrontation begins with the appearance or advent of offensive  weapons. Naturally the creation of defensive assets without some  information about the offensive weapons is practically  impossible. The advent of more powerful aviation not only makes  conditions difficult for fighter aviation, but also reveals to  it new ways to resolve problems, provokes the need to seek out  and develop more effective equipment and tactics, and the  development of fighter aviation and air defense as a whole  engenders new techniques and tactics of aviation. And this  bilateral process will not end as long as aviation and air  defenses exist.  <H5>  Chapter IV. Mysteries of Interaction with Ground Air Defenses </H5>   From the start of its creation, air defense was structured  and developed as an integrated system, including different types  of forces and assets capable through their joint efforts of  repelling enemy air raids. And from the very start this system  included fighter aviation, which conducted the battle with the  air adversary in close interaction with the ground air defense  assets. And now I should reveal a secret. It should be  acknowledged that this interaction is not all that close. It  holds many mysteries, contradictions, and prejudices which are  not easy to figure out. But are things as bad as all that?  Before we delve into the causes of this, unfortunately we must  make another excursion into history. "Unfortunately" because  this question is by no means raised for the first time.  <H5>  1. Who Gets Priority? </H5>   At the air defense command post, the combat alert signal was  sounded. A large group of bombers was approaching the protected  installation. First the fighters were inserted into the battle  to repel the raid. They bravely attacked the enemy. But the AA  gunners were awaiting a favorable moment to open fire, and  watched the air battle carefully -- they did not want to hit  their own pilots! But then the AA artillery opened fire. Now the  fighters kept away from the fire bursts, and the bombers  meanwhile had already entered their target run...    Such a picture was a not uncommon sight at the start of the  Great Patriotic War. At that time the air defense had determined  two active assets, the fighter aviation and the antiaircraft  artillery. Their combat actions were supported by air  observation posts, which detected the adversary visually and  from the sound of his motors using optical and acoustic  instruments (binoculars, range finders, and sound rangers). The  fighters were supposed to join battle first, and after them the  antiaircraft guns of various calibers, and machineguns located  close to and within the objective, would open fire. And the  service for warning of the air adversary? How did it warn the  fighter aviation and AA artillery? The short range of visual and  optical detection of targets reduced to naught the aspiration of  the fighters to intercept the adversary at remote approaches to  the protected facilities. The fundamental defects in the  acoustic instruments, which also had short range of operation  and accuracy in determining the target coordinates, also had  their effect. Too little time remained for their interception  after the noise of the motors had reached the sound rangers.  Under conditions of poor visibility, binoculars and optical  range finders were of little use.    The literature of the fatherland reported, not without  pride:  first experimental units for radio detection of planes was  developed in our country in 1934. (See: M.M. Lobanov. Razvitiye  sovetskoy radiolokatsionnoy tekhniki. (Development of Soviet  Radar Technology). M.: Voyenizdat, 1982, p. 21.) And what of it?  A whole seven years later, radars, and only six experimental  models, type RUS-2, existed only in the national air defense  forces (See: Voyska protivovoxdusnoy oborony strany v Velikoy  Otechestvennoy voyne. (National Air Defense Forces in the Great  Patriotic War), vol. 1, M.: voyenizdat, 1954, p. 67.) How can we  not recall here that our future ally England back in 1940 was  able to create a coherent air defense warning system (based on  38 radars) and, fighting one-on-one with the German Luftwaffe,  won the battle. (Ibid, p. 42).    The war immediately demonstrated the increased role of air  defense and the improvement of interaction with its forces and  assets. Although overall they constitute an impressive force, a  classical scheme, developed before the start of the war and  envisaging a consistent and organized commitment of air defense  assets to battle was not developed.    Of course the conditions of the war's inception most  unfavorably affected the organization and implementation of  interaction. These have already been mentioned in preceding  chapters, but there were also other causes here. Air defense  forces interacting with fighter aviation were not fully equipped  with artillery guns, did not have sufficient ammunition, and  measures to form, arm, and deploy the subunits and units of AA  artillery were not concluded. The forces and assets of national  air defense, few in number, without a unified command, were  grouped to defend individual major points in the threatened  regions. Such a defense was very much a point-of-resistance  defense, did not have adequate depth and was not able to repel  massed strikes of bombers, which in addition were accompanied by  active suppression of air defenses.    Under such conditions, how could the coordination of fighter  aviation and antiaircraft artillery be organized? By day the  initiative in selection of targets was usually left to the  fighters. They attacked the adversary at high altitude, where  the AA fire was less effective, and also at other altitudes. The  AA gunners followed the progress of the battle, and when the  pilots entered their fire zones, they conducted "blank fire,"  i.e., they tracked the targets, observing them through their  sights. Sometimes the gunners themselves helped the fighters  with target designation by laying down check points with special  rounds, which created a cloud of colored smoke. Fire was  commenced only after the pilots exited the battle.    At night the fighters repelled the raids of bombers in zones  which were organized in illuminated searchlight fields, or  conducted visual search for aircraft against the background of  the moon, the bright side of the horizon, or from the flame from  the exhaust pipes of the motors. During enemy attacks in  engagement zones of the AA artillery, the pilots issued agreed  signals "I am attacking" with colored flares, but these signals  were hard to make out from the ground, greatly tied down the  gunners, and often led to the engagement of friendly planes or  to the AA artillery generally ceasing to fire.    The AA artillery could deliver fire only on targets  illuminated by the searchlights, or ineffective barrage fire.  However the searchlights, having a short range of illumination  of targets (7-8 km) and obtaining very imprecise data from sound  rangers, also proved to be far from the best means. They groped  long and impotently in the sky in search of enemy planes, and  could support the actions of the fighter aviation and AA  artillery only in cloudless weather, and only in a small region.    All these mix-ups and contradictions clearly did not fit any  frameworks of the theory of interaction developed on the eve of  the war.    In order to find a way out of the critical situation, in  which the coordinating forces and assets found themselves,  required exceptional efforts of the military leadership,  industry, and all personnel, but first of all a sharp increase  in the combat capabilities of AA artillery. Soon the situation  began to markedly change for the better.    In the troop air defense forces they began to form strong AA  artillery groups. By the end of 1942 they were already able to  support the massing of forces and assets of AA artillery and to  create zones of dense, multi-layered fire over the main troop  groupings. Thanks to the creation of large artillery groupings,  the troops received a reliable "umbrella" over their heads, and  losses to fascist aviation grew sharply. In the first year of  the war, AA artillery destroyed an average of about 300 enemy  planes a month, and in the second half of 1942, more than 400.  (Central Archive of the Ministry of Defense (TsAMO) F. 36, op.  12552, d. 10, l. 67-69.)    Subsequently the AA defense became more and more powerful.  To  protect the troops operating in main axes, they were reinforced  with a larger and larger quantity of AA artillery units and  formations. For example, in the Yassko-Kisinev operation, the  6th Tank Army alone had an AA artillery group consisting of an  AA artillery division and three separate AA artillery regiments.  (See: Voyenno-istoricheskiy zhurnal, 1962, No. 1)    With the increased capabilities of the AA weapons, the  fighters began to interact with them by separating the regions  of the battle, i.e., by intercepting the adversary at the  approaches to the protected troops, coordinating its actions  with the AA gunners, and they with their fire separated the  enemy fighters from our planes at critical moments of the  air-to-air battle. For coordination of joint actions sorties of  fighters were reported to the CPs of the AA units, and air  representatives were sent to them.    In the national air defense forces, they also conducted  serious organizational transformations. These boiled down to a  quantitative strengthening of forces and assets, creation of  extensive air defense zones, the forward lines of which were  200-250 km from the main protected installations. The zone of  action of the air defense covered the airspace over the defended  installations and at the near approaches to them. The fighter  aviation as the most long-range weapon was committed to the  battle at the far approaches and concentrated its efforts in the  most dangerous axes, but if necessary operated in the zone of  the AA artillery. But the main thing was that the fighter  aviation began to be successfully used in the interest of  protecting not one but several installations. Large groups and  assets of air defense were concentrated to defend the most  important rear installations.    Thus in the defense of Moscow alone, just from the 1st Air  Defense Corps and the 6th Fighter Aviation Corps operationally  subordinate to it, 600-700 fighters, 600-800 medium AA guns and  170-350 low-caliber guns, 170-650 high caliber AA machineguns,  and 700-760 AA searchlights participated in the repulse of  massed strikes of fascist aviation. (TsAMO, f. 72, op. 12274, d.  59, l. 1; d.7, l. 18; d. 49, l. 45.) A great leap in the  development of air defense was the adoption of radars which were  produced by industry in a mobile ("Redut") and fixed  ("Pegmatit") variant, the number of which by the end of 1943 had  reached 200. (Ibid, f. 81, op. 12204, d. 453, l. 4) While before  the air defense could detect and destroy only visible planes,  and behind clouds they were betrayed by the sound of their  motors, now neither clouds nor darkness hampered the battle with  them. Despite the technical imperfection, even the first models  of radars make it possible at once to improve by a factor of  8-10 the range of detection of the planes, determine their  coordinates almost instantaneously, and know the air situation  over quite wide regions.    Based on radars, dense radar fields and fighter guidance  centers were organized. The incidence of radar guidance  increased in 1942 from 17 to 46 percent. (Ibid, op. 94592, d.  29, l. 55.) Now fighter aviation repulsed air raids jointly with  other ground assets of air defense, which had also experienced a  qualitative leap: anti-aircraft artillery, which had radar  gunsights, and radar searchlights (visual searchlights combined  with radar) which illuminated the aircraft suddenly without a  preliminary search -- "with the shot."    The conditions of interaction of fighter aviation and  antiaircraft artillery also improved. This was implemented in  two ways: by distribution of efforts over zones of combat action  and by joint destruction of enemy planes in the zones of AA  fire. Here preference was given to the former, simpler, method,  when fighter aviation and AA artillery operated without  hampering one another. But during interaction in a single zone,  priority continued to be given to the fighters.    By the end of the war Soviet air defense, extending for many  hundreds of kilometers, and saturated with a net of airfields,  observation and guidance posts, and AA positions, became more  powerful and more impenetrable for the enemy. Its manpower and  assets were echeloned to an ever-increasing depth from the  defended objects, and further concentration of AA artillery in  the most important of them continued. Fighter aviation,  interacting with AA artillery in zones of combat action,  successfully protected objects in the territory liberated from  the enemy. Thanks to its maneuverability and offensive nature of  actions, it remains the basis strike force for air defense  throughout the war in interaction with AA artillery.    However, interaction at night still left something to be  desired. The Germans were using night fighters as much as they  could -- the two-engine Me-110 planes with onboard radars and  strengthened cannon (in the Berlin AD system alone the number  had reached three squadrons by 1944). (F. Reuter. Funkmess  Opladen, 1971, p. 122.) -- and our fighters interacted with AA  artillery only in visual searchlight fields, or looked for the  enemy from the flames of his exhaust pipes.    Now, jumping ahead mentally some one-and-a-half decades,  let's look again at the AD command post.  <H5>  2. Gains and Losses </H5>   ...Slowly the mighty radars move their latticed, delicate  antennas, searching the air space. The silver arrows of the SAMs  are frozen in readiness to launch, the all-weather fighters on  the gray concrete are ready to scramble. The Great Patriotic War  never knew such weapons of the national air defense forces.    In the ground forces, the rifled ZZ artillery has gradually  given way to the SAMs. Possessing different capabilities than AA  artillery in terms of range and accuracy in striking targets  over a broad range of altitudes and flight speeds, they could  destroy the air adversary not only over protected forces, but  also at the far approaches to them. A ramified net of mobile  radars provided continuous tracking of the air situation over  broad territories.    The systems of troop and national air defense forces were  created as a unified whole on the basis of mixed elements of SAM  and AA artillery units and subunits, which are deployed ahead of  time to protect objects, have a stable character, and elements  of fighter aviation. As the most maneuverable AD resource, it  was not assigned to individual objects, but was supposed to act  at the boundaries of the whole defended region and mass efforts  in decisive axes.    All this rich arsenal of new AD weapons and their principles  of formation, in combination with guidance systems which ensured  coordination of efforts of interacting forces, their warning and  target designation, radically strengthened the might of defense,  and created the capability of protecting whole regions and axes.  The interacting manpower and resources of air defense also  became capable of tasks which earlier could not be dreamed of.  But then, let us not create illusions.    It would seem from common sense that the effectiveness of  joint actions of fighters and SAM weapons should increase at  least in proportion to their combat might. However this did not  occur. This supposition, at first glance indisputable, is  erroneous. This phenomenon became a riddle, but where was the  explanation? Here one other problem was also noted: securing the  safety of the fighters, and eliminating cases when they were  engaged by SAMs, proved to be a very complex task, and this led  to very fateful consequences. With entry of the fighters into  the kill zones of the SAM complexes, their freedom of action was  constrained, and great limitations were imposed on fire maneuver  of the SAM complexes, so that the overall result was less than  the sum of the results achieved by each system separately.    A strange situation arose: the gains in combat might of air  defense turned out to be losses. And then one "side of the scale  of interaction" -- the growth of combat capabilities of AD  weapons, overflowed, and the counterweight proved to be entirely  inadequate: joint actions interfered with utilizing them fully.  And indeed, let us compare: high-altitude, rapid-fire,  jamming-resistent SAM complexes, and supersonic all-weather  fighters with powerful weapons, limiting the capabilities of one  another...    Years went by, and the range of fire of the SAM complexes  grew, and the forward edge of the zone of combat actions of SAM  assets extended further and further from the defended objects,  crowding out the fighters. However much in the organization of  interaction remained as before. The fighter aviation was  assigned the battle with aviation at the far perimeters, beyond  the limits of the kill zones of the SAM complexes, and the SAM  complexes had the job at the close approaches and directly over  the objects. Each AD asset independently operated in its own  zone, not interfering with the other, or ... the attacking  aviation, from consistently overcoming first the resistance of  the fighter aviation, and then that of the SAM assets.    Thus after giving an initial impetus to joint actions, this  impetus ceased to function. In AD systems a significant gap  appeared in place and time of the fire influence on the  adversary. What is more, this gab, or "neutral zone," kept  expanding.    But enough of abstraction and speculative estimates. Let us  pose the question specifically: what are the dimensions of this  "neutral zone"? In order to eliminate engagement of friendly  fighters by SAM complexes, they must be pulled from the battle  at a distance from the forward edge of the kill zone of the SAM  complexes equal to    Sv = Ri + Vi (tk + tz),    where: Ri is the turning radius of the fighters when they  pull out of the battle;    Vi is the fight speed of the fighters;    tk is the time of issuance and travel of the order to pull  out of the battle;    tz is the delay time of the pilots in executing the order.    Simple calculation allows the reader to obtain the specific  dimensions of the air space where the adversary is not  influenced, but even without doing the calculation, just by  glancing at the formula it is obvious that all of its components  depend on the flight speed of the fighters, and this, alas, does  not have a tendency to decrease.    At the same time, this seemingly simple formula of  interaction is very complex from the standpoint of its tactical  realization. First of all, the SAM element includes complexes  for various purposes with different ranges of fire, which in  turn are determined by the altitude of the targets. Second, in  order to destroy targets within the limits of the whole depth of  the kill zone of the SAM complex, the distribution of targets  and the issuance of target designations to the SAM crews must be  done at the more remote perimeters, whose location will also  depend on the flight speed of the targets. And third, the  spatial dimensions both of the SAM kill zones and of the  air-to-air battles of the fighters have continued to increase,  especially if they are moved to the forward hemisphere of the  targets. But for actions in a single zone (the zone of SAM  fired) the danger of an erroneous engagement of friendly  fighters has continued.    The further refitting of AD systems with more sophisticated  SAM complexes, the tightening of their network, and the growth  of fire power have made the presence of fighters in their zones  more and more hazardous, and then the command was faced with a  dilemma: SAM complexes or fighters?    And indeed, identifying aircraft in the air at long range,  quickly and correctly determining who is friend, who foe, under  conditions which rule out a visual assessment of the external  distinguishing marks, has become very difficult for the crews of  SAM complexes. And their elements have increasingly expanded and  deployed in such a way that continuous zones of missile fire  were formed over large territories. Therefore, for fighter  aviation there simply remained no free air space which could not  come under the fire of SAM complexes.    Experience of local wars showed that if the fighters were  forced to operate in the same zone with them, then SAM fire  would shoot down friendly aircraft, as happened in the  Arab-Israeli War of 1973. (International Defense Review, 1974,  No. 3.)    Where, there, were the fighters to operate, if their safety  in the zones of SAM fire was not guaranteed? Only at the far  approaches to the defended objects, or in the rear, which from  the tactical standpoint was not very advantageous? And how to  intercept low-flying targets if the lines of commitment of the  fighters to battle could not be extended beyond the limits of  the SAM kill zones? Puzzles, puzzles... But after all, it had  long been known that a chain cannot be stronger than its weakest  link, and fighter aviation became this link. The gain of SAM  assets led to a loss in its combat capabilities.    It cannot be said that this situation, which had acquired  for  the fighters an increasingly negative coloration, was all that  unexpected. It had developed gradually, and the ground AD assets  did not become so diverse overnight, from the mighty  multi-channel complexes, which could engage several targets  simultaneously, to the single missile on a soldier's shoulder,  with no warning of the approach of an air adversary. But equally  gradually the role and place of fighter aviation in the AD  systems changed, as we shall see.  <H5>  3. The Role and Place of Fighter Aviation in AD Systems </H5>   The role and place of fighter aviation in AD systems,  western  theorists believe, are determined by the specific features of  the military-geographic situation, the political and economic  importance of the specific regions and objectives, the combat  properties and capabilities of the fighters and other manpower  and resources making up the air defense. Economic factors and  the level of development of each country have a significant  influence on the role and place of fighter aviation. In studying  this question, western theorists concluded that the changes in  these factors, especially the combat capabilities of the  fighters and SAM complexes, which developed at far from the same  rates, from time to time provoke an overestimate of their role  and place in AD systems.    From the history of development of air defense it is clear  that the amplitude of such changes has proven quite wide, from  acknowledgement of fighter aviation as the chief means of air  defense to its complete negation. During the Second World War  and in subsequent wars until the advent of SAM complexes,  fighters played a decisive role and comprised the foundation of  air defense of many countries. AA artillery was in second place,  although its effectiveness was improving constantly. Thus while  in the First World War AA artillery of all warring countries  accounted for about 15 to 20 percent of downed aircraft, in the  Second World War it was already 40 percent. (ANTIAIRCRAFT  JOURNAL, 1949, No. 11)    The SAM weapons which were supplanting the AA artillery  first  were used only to reinforce the fighter aviation. Then their  role quickly grew. Thus in the local wars in Vietnam and in the  Near East they destroyed (along with AA artillery) around 90  percent of all downed air targets. (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE  REVIEW, 1973, No 12). Such high effectiveness of actions of the  SAM complexes led to a reassessment of the role and place of  fighter aviation in air defense systems. In the West new  theories of organization of air defense began to appear, in  which fighters were assigned a more than modest place. It was  proposed that they be used only for protecting secondary regions  unprotected by SAM complexes. Thus the French Army General A.  Bofre stated: "Be that as it may, now it is clear that aviation  can no longer play a decisive role in air defense of objects,  when the latter are provided with strong missile protection."  (FORCE ARMEE FRANCAISE, 1964, No. 18) Many agreed with him,  believing that SAM complexes were capable of solving practically  all problems of air defense, and that they should assume a  monopoly status in it. However, the opinions of other military  theorists were not so categorical, and "anti-fighter" views and  theories did not live long. Subsequently they were revised in  the direction of a balanced development of SAM complexes and  fighters, but still the role of aviation had diminished to some  extent. In particular, as the foreign press reported, the number  of fighters in the U.S. air defense system by the start of the  seventies had decreased by nearly two thirds in comparison with  1965. In the FRG, of four fighter squadrons only two remained.  Only the English command had stuck to its former views,  asserting that the air defense of Great Britain was based on the  use of fighter interceptors as long as the opposing side had  strike aircraft in its armament. (AIR FORCES, 1972, No. 11.)    The experience of local wars refuted the pessimism of the  extinction of fighter aviation. It was found that SAM complexes  and fighters had their own specific fields of application, where  they could be used with the greatest success and, therefore,  that they did not exclude but complemented one another. In the  early 70s in the NATO countries the concept was adopted for  their joint use. Here the priority use of fighter aviation was  envisaged beyond the zones of SAM fire, and at ranges far from  the defended objects.    Even today military leaders in different countries do not  agree in their assessment of the role and place of fighter  aviation in the air defense system. At times the differences and  polarity have been great. At one pole are the adherents of SAM  weapons. Comparing the characteristics of fighters and SAMs,  they argue that the time spent on closing with targets flying at  supersonic speed for fighters even with the highest readiness to  scramble (30 seconds) is almost twice as long as for SAMs.  Therefore in order to achieve the same effectiveness of combat  actions of fighter aviation, a significantly longer range of  target detection is required than for SAM complexes. Noting the  high accuracy, rate of fire, and operational reliability of SAM  complexes, some foreign theorists believe that the dominant role  in combatting the aerial adversary has forever shifted from the  fighters to SAM systems. The views of these theorists have found  support in some countries, where SAM complexes now occupy the  leading role.    At the other pole are the proponents of fighter aviation,  who  propose that although SAM weapons do have a higher level of  combat readiness and other advantages, they are not capable of  fighting a large number of enemy planes, operating in high  densities, without fighters. Besides, SAM complexes have  limitations in range of fire, and their missiles with respect to  G forces. They are still not effective enough in combatting  energetically maneuvering planes. Therefore the probability of a  kill against such targets in comparison with maneuvering ones  diminishes markedly, and generally is below the rated  probability. In their opinion fighter aviation is more mobile  and to a significant extent is free of these defects. The  tactics of fighters are more flexible and allow their action in  any region over a broad range of altitudes, in a rapidly  changing air situation and enemy tactics. In this sense the  elements of SAM air defense complexes are in the worse position.  They have less mobility and cannot quickly elude a strike, since  tearing down their battle formations, relocating to a new  region, and subsequent setup require a significant amount of  time, which sometimes exceeds the total duration of the enemy  raid.    Proponents of fighter aviation believe that in contrast to  SAM complexes it possesses adequate capabilities for maneuver of  long range. Only through the use of fighters is it possible to  quickly concentrate efforts of air defense in the axis of the  main enemy strike, ensure protection of the flanks of friendly  forces, and to close a breech formed in the air defense system  for some time. Among the advantages which fighters have over  SAMs they cite the capability of the fighters to monitor greater  volumes of air space, and more reliably determine the national  affiliation of the targets. Therefore to assert that SAM weapons  are the high road of development of air defense is at the least  still premature.    Foreign specialists stress that our desires to the contrary,  the initiative in selection of time and place of strikes belongs  to the adversary. He will penetrate the AD system where it is  advantageous to him, i.e., in the axes which are most weakly  protected by SAMs, at narrow sectors of the front. But this  means that the air defence manpower and assets will be forced to  operate under conditions of a very uncertain situation, that  only that portion of the SAM complexes will participate in the  repulse of the raids who are in the breakthrough zone. In this  situation, only fighter aviation can execute a fast maneuver,  concentrating its forces in the threat axis, and thus compensate  for errors in predicting the possible actions of the adversary.    The controversy between adversaries and proponents of  fighter  aviation is still not over. Western specialists are not all that  confident in placing an equal sign between fighters and SAM  complexes. They vacillate on who should be given the preference  under various conditions of the situation. However the  controversy in no case is about a monopoly, mutually exclusive  use of SAMs or fighters. In their studies and recommendations,  foreign theorists are unanimous in asserting that air defense  must be organized as a unified system containing both SAM  complexes and fighters.    As was already mentioned above, depending on the geographic  situation and other factors, these questions may be resolved in  different ways. Thus the U.S. and Canada have made  fighter-interceptors the foundation of their air defenses. They  have been assigned to protect the most important  administrative-political centers, command and control organs,  air and sea lines of communication against air strikes. But in  the European countries of NATO these tasks as a rule are  distributed between air defense aviation and SAM units.    At present all NATO countries are paying close attention to  raising the combat capabilities both of SAM complexes and of  fighters, a factor which among others determines their role and  place in air defense systems.    One could spend some time enumerating the new modes of  aviation and missile equipment. Let us stipulate at the outset  that we shall not try to "break them down to the fine details,"  for they are too diverse. Besides, many of them are very  short-lived, and merge with others, change their direction, and  indeed this book is not a reference. Therefore it is best for  the reader to acquaint himself with specific characteristics of  the SAM complexes and fighters under development from other  sources. We shall limit ourselves only to a description of the  general trends of their development, and assess how they  influence the role and place of fighter aviation.    In the opinion of foreign military specialists, among the  basic trends of development of SAM missile weapons one can note  an increase in their fire power and accuracy, an increase in the  range of the SAM, and a reduction in the time required to  commence fire. Linked to systems of long-range radar detection,  these complexes will have high-speed missiles with better  maneuverability and combined guidance systems. Such SAM  complexes are augmented by close-in systems with television, IR  and laser sights. At the same time, the capabilities both of  mobile all-weather SAM missile and artillery complexes to engage  high-speed aircraft and missiles, and in fire maneuver without  change of fire positions, are also increasing. Deployed in troop  battle formations and possessing high fire productivity, they  are used in various combinations; the missiles and guns may also  be deployed on the same transport. (INTERAVIA, 1985, No. 11;  1986, No. 12)    How do things stand with regard to an increase in combat  capabilities of fighter aviation? The foreign press notes that  it is occurring chiefly through replacement of outmoded aircraft  with more sophisticated ones, and also through stage-by-stage  modernization of the fighters now in the air defense armament.  There is no need to turn to the characteristics of the  prospective craft, with which the reader was acquainted in  chapter II; one need only supplement them with the requirements  imposed on "pure" air defense fighters: assurance of intercept  of attacking aviation at more remote perimeters, increase in the  capabilities of detection of small targets (cruise missiles),  and also rapid scramble on alert. Undoubtedly, with a sharp  increase in the capabilities of fighter aviation, its place and  role in organization of air defense will also increase. This  becomes all the more evident in light of the statements of some  western experts, who try to look into the future of defense.    They assume that the latest models of modern AD complexes  will probably remain effective for some time, but by the end of  the century they will not be able to repulse air raids with an  increase in their density, or destruction of high-speed missiles  maneuvering with high G forces. Despite the further improvement  in characteristics, the range of complexes will still prove to  be inadequate to protect objects at remote approaches, and they  themselves will remain vulnerable to precision weapons.  (INTERAVIA. 1984, No. 2; AVIATION WEEK 1986, No. 7)    This is why in the development and improvement of AD  systems,  one starts with the fact that no type of weapon created to this  point can ensure reliable protection of friendly objects from  all the offensive air weapons at the enemy's disposal. To  accomplish this task it is necessary to have a precisely  organized interaction of different types of weapons within the  framework of a uniform air defense system. At the same time,  joint actions of fighters and SAM complexes continue to impose  some restrictions on the combat capabilities of each of them,  especially when the state affiliation of the targets is  determined not on the approach to the intercept lines, but on  the ground from their fragments. Therefore the contradiction  between the growing might of air defense weapons and their  capability of joint actions continues to develop, and the  problem will not find its solution.    Of course it would be illogical to abandon interaction in  one  zone, say foreign military specialists. But how are we to  combine the efforts of fighters and antiaircraft weapons, how  can we eliminate their mutual limitations? To resolve this  problem newer and newer attempts are made, and technical and  organizational measures are undertaken. In particular, work is  done to improve systems of airspace monitoring in order to  ensure a more detailed depiction of the situation at command  posts, new methods are being developed for optimal distribution  of forces against targets, for each weapon altitudes and times  are established when it can be used without limitation, but the  problem remains unresolved.    Meanwhile foreign experts note that the processes of the  battle by fighters and SAM complexes with the air adversary are  becoming more and more similar. Thus the targets are detected by  radars of the guidance centers of the fighter aviation, and by  the reconnaissance and target designation radars of SAM  complexes at long range, and identified with "IFF" devices. Then  a target designation is issued to the fighters and to the  missile guidance centers, the targets are automatically traced  by the pilots or by the SAM crews, and after entry into the kill  zone of the air-to-air or surface-to-air missiles, are  destroyed. The only difference is that the fighters close  quickly with the adversary and must obtain a target designation  from the ground or airborne command post, while the SAM  complexes stay in the same place and have their own target  designation assets.    Consequently there is some unity developing in the battles  fought by fighters and by SAM subunits, and as a consequence  wider capabilities have developed for organization of their  joint actions. Thus the tactics of fighter aviation in air  defense systems continue to be the tactics of a joint battle  waged in accordance with a uniform concept, in which two  sub-systems must complement one another.    Here is something to think about both for the fighters and  for the SAM crews. Interaction between them should keep pace  with the development of aviation and missile equipment, allow  for changes in enemy tactics, and undoubtedly assure complete  realization of their combat capabilities.    Today the variants of joint battle are diverse. The fighters  may conduct an independent search in earlier-assigned regions  and meet the adversary before his approach to the SAM kill  zones. It is necessary to reduce the density of the raid and  scatter the battle formations of large groups, and then it will  be easier for the SAM crews to complete their destruction. If  necessary the pilots can enter the SAM zones, distribute their  efforts against the targets, altitudes, axes, and, if individual  SAMs should be put out of action, also in terms of time of  actions. Of course here it is necessary to adhere to minimally  permissible ranges of closure with the adversary, and observe  the restrictions in maneuver in order to assure safety against  engagement by friendly missiles. Nonetheless, if one looks  closely into such diverse variants of joint battle, one can see  their surprising uniformity. They all flow from the role and  place of fighter aviation, and are based on close interaction  with SAM weapons and in this regard they are alike as two peas  in a pod. The only difference lies in the conditions of battle  and the tactical techniques. Only by rising to the height of  this concept of joint battle can one see beyond today.    Thus as the most maneuverable and long-range AD asset,  fighter aviation plays a decisive role in crushing the air  adversary at the far approaches to the defended territory, and  where the SAM complexes are less effective. Its place is in  regions which are beyond the reach of SAM missiles (to the  front, rear, on the flanks, and in gaps between kill zones), and  if necessary (with high density of the enemy raid, or enemy  strikes on the SAM complexes) even in these zones.    The importance and the irreplaceability of fighter aviation  in air defense systems are determined by its high capabilities  to combat planes carrying precision weapons, its capacity to  fight independent combat actions with limited information about  the air situation, to execute rapid maneuver from one axis to  another, if events develop in such a way that the disposition of  air defense manpower and assets no longer adequately correspond  to it.    And finally, air defense fighter aviation shares its role  and  place with front-line fighters protecting the troops. After all,  the air adversary will break through the regions of their combat  actions to get to objectives in national rear. Therefore, the  protection of troops and objects of the rear, as it were, merges  into a single chain, although at first glance it appears that  their links perform different missions. In fact only the  conditions of combat action, and the place of the fighters in  this chain, are different. Here too there are specific problems  and variants. Sometimes fighters protecting the troops are the  first to join battle and thus create favorable conditions for  air defense fighters who are committed to battle at subsequent  perimeters. At other times all the fighters operate in the same  region and distribute their efforts by axes. Everything depends  on the character of the enemy raid, the disposition of the  protected objects and air bases, and the level of combat  readiness of the fighters by the start of the raid.  <H5>  4. The Tendency of Development of Air Defense and the </H5> Tactics of Fighter Aviation    Now and in the foreseeable future, foreign military  specialists believe, the basic problems of air defense will be:  repulse of massed raids of aviation and other offensive air  weapons operating in an enormous space and using powerful fire  and electronic countermeasures; intercept of high-speed,  low-visibility planes, cruise missiles, and drones at very low  and very high altitude; combat with planes carrying  new-generation precision weapons and destruction of missiles  themselves while in trajectory; the high cost of air defense  systems.    Of course these problems did not arise yesterday, and they  have received close attention before, but at the present stage  of development of air defense they must be resolved again, with  allowance for the principle of defensive sufficiency. Such a  precept did not exist in the past, but today it is the focus. It  is necessary to stop the arms race and achieve a further  increase in the strength of air defense through higher quality  indices, on the basis of reasonable spending for defense. And do  this given the mighty groups of offensive air weapons of the  probable adversary, and the unceasing growth of their combat  potential. But if the threat of attack continues, then a limited  quantity of manpower and assets of air defense for reliable  protection of troops and objects from surprise massed attacks  from the air can be compensated for only through the development  of favorable conditions for their timely and even prior  commitment to battle, rational target distribution, and  prevention of heavy losses on ground and in the air. These are  quality indices, which determine the tendencies of development  of air defense. As we see, the competition between the means of  defense and offense acquire new traits proceeding from  reasonable sufficiency.    There are a great many tendencies of development of air  defense. We shall dwell only on the following, which exert a  vital influence on the tactics of fighter aviation: the further  increase in combat readiness of air defense; the aspiration to  increase the range of detection and engagement of the air  adversary; further centralization and automation of command and  control, and enhancement of the survivability of air defense.    The further improvement in combat readiness of air defense  acquires especially great importance given the defensive nature  of military doctrine. This arises from the need to join battle  with an air adversary at any minute, from the constant reduction  of the already strict time limit which air defense has for  preparation and repulse of massed raids. Vigilance is also a  weapon. Having an adequate amount of even the most sophisticated  combat equipment and trained personnel, the air defense forces  will simply not have the time to exert the necessary  countermeasures on the adversary, and will be caught unawares if  the time required to make them ready remains as it is.    An increase in combat readiness consists in an increase in  the strength of the alert forces, an increase in the mobility of  SAM weapons in order to concentrate them in threat axes, but it  acquires special importance for fighter aviation, which in  comparison with SAM complexes takes significantly more time to  destroy targets. In order to not find itself in a secondary role  in the repulse of massed raids by an air adversary, its combat  readiness must be significantly raised. This finds reflection in  intensive hunts for ways to reduce the time required for takeoff  and rapid massed commitment of fighters to battle, and also in  fitting them with weapons which make it possible to fight brief  but successful battles at maximum effort. In the intercept of a  large number of targets simultaneously with airborne weapons  sights, and their engagement in a single attack, the total time  spent by the fighters in the air is also reduced, and they can  prepare more quickly for more sorties.    In addition, the manpower and assets of air defense may be  made combat-ready in a timely manner, and fighter aviation  scrambled ahead of time if the air adversary is detected earlier  than he is now. Inadequate range of detection has a negative  affect on the level of combat readiness, and demands that a  greater strength of alert assets be held ready for repulse of a  surprise enemy attack.    The aspiration to increase the range of detection and  engagement of the air adversary has always been one of the main  tendencies of development of PVO systems. This tendency appeared  with the growth in speed in the 60s and at the start of the 80s  when precision air-to-ground missiles, launched from long range,  and planes with small radar cross sections and weak IR radiation  began to enter the air armament.    For successful functioning of air defense systems, the most  radical solution of the problem would be extension of the range  of detection to maximum values, i.e., to the home airfields of  aviation, which would make it possible to detect its takeoff to  deliver massed strikes. This idea was met with enthusiasm by  military specialists abroad, who tried to implement it by  creation and integrated use of ground and air assets, based both  on traditional and on new principles of detection of air targets.    This tendency is manifested most strongly in the U.S., where  they are constantly improving the existing system of radar  early-warning aircraft (AWACS system) and developing  fundamentally new means of reconnaissance -- over-the-horizon  radars and space-based stations. How is this tendency in action?    The basis of the program for improving the radar early  warning aircraft includes a modification of E-3A aircraft, an  increase in the range of action of aircraft radars within the  limits of direct visibility, and also modernization of the data  processing apparatus for display and tracking of a large number  of targets from this range. At the same time active development  is under way for new radar early warning complexes based on  dirigibles, captive balloons, helicopters and radars operating  in the decimeter range, to detection of "stealth" aircraft,  cruise missiles and other small targets which are unprotected in  this range by anti-radar coatings. Variants in the use of radar  early warning systems are also being improved. Organization of  early-warning zones, a build-up of the ground radar field and  enhancement of its stability in threat axes, the use of fighter  guidance centers to raise the through-put of the system as a  whole -- all these variants increase the range both of detection  and of engagement of the air adversary. (MILITARY TECHNOLOGY,  1986, No. 5; Defense ELECTRONICS, 1987, No. 7)    Over-the-horizon radars constitute a fundamentally new means  of increasing the range of detection of the air adversary.  Recall that the basis of the operation of these stations is the  skip affect of short radio waves from the ionosphere and the  surface of the earth, and also air targets and accompanying  perturbations located in the path of their propagation. The  capacity of over-the-horizon radars to detect these targets  beyond the line of sight, and the enormous dimensions of the air  space, several tens of times more than the zone of surveillance  of conventional radars, have long attracted the attention of  military scientists.    The capabilities of over-the-horizon radars are great. They  are capable of detecting any air targets over all altitudes in a  range from 900-3,000 km and more, and need not fear anti-radar  missiles. Although the linear dimensions of the antenna systems  of these stations reach several kilometers (fig. 36 [not  reproduced]), it is impossible to determine the direction of the  operating radars. You see, their signals scatter due to the  reflection from the ionosphere. But an even greater advantage  over the other assets is obtained by virtue of the capacity to  detect plans and cruise missiles with significantly reduced  radar cross sections. This advantage is especially important. It  is understood that the lower the radar cross section of an  object, the later the radar will "see" it. The comparative range  of detection of planes with different cross section (the F-117A  fighter, the B-1B and B-52 bombers with cross sections of 1, 10  and 100 square meters respectively) according to the  calculations of American specialists are shown in figure 37.  (FLIGHT, 1988. No. 4142; FLUG REVUE, 1989, No. 1.) From the  figure it is clear that the range of detection of the "stealth"  aircraft is 3-10 times less than that of conventional planes  even in the absence of electronic jamming. Such a short range  cannot be compensated for by an increase in the number of ground  radars. Therefore the crews of "stealth" planes probably will  detect observation of them first, and will take the necessary  countermeasures.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-55A>      Figure 37. Comparative range of detection of radars with different radar cross-sections by </FIG>     However, one must disappoint the foreign specialists. For  the  methods of reducing the radar visibility of aircraft which are  known at present are effective only in a limited frequency range  (1-20 GHz), in which, it is true, most exist air defense radars  still operate. With simultaneous use of radars operating in very  different ranges, and with an increase in the wave length of the  radiated pulses, the detectability of the "stealth" aircraft  will increase. In itself this circumstance cannot provoke any  objections, theoretically it is all correct -- the wave length  of the over-the-horizon radar is much greater than in radars of  the centimeter range.    However, the designers do not place very great hopes in the  over-the-horizon radars. The fact is that they operate with  short waves (10-100 m) and therefore have low resolution of  angular coordinates (less than 1x) and determine the location of  targets with significant errors, and are susceptible to the  influence of natural and artificial interference. In addition,  their capabilities of detecting targets depend on the state of  the ionosphere. Therefore although air defense does not greatly  require precise characteristics of targets at long range, it is  still impossible to rely only on over-the-horizon radars.    Another means for increasing the range of detection of  "stealth" aircraft might be radars with separated transmitters  and receivers, so-called two-position, or bistatic radars (fig.  38). The transmitter illuminates the target and the receivers  pick up its signals reflected away from the source of radiation.  Despite the obvious simplicity of the operating principle of  two-position radars, this too has its problems. Detection of  "stealth" aircraft is possible only in a limited region, where  the beam of the transmitter and the field of action of the  receivers intersect. It is also necessary to have apparatus for  precise synchronization of operation of transmitter and  receivers.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-56A>      Figure 38. Operating principle of two-position radar. </FIG>     I should also mention one fundamentally new means of  reconnaissance, possessing unlimited range of detection --  space-based radars. They are just being developed and  experimental modes are far from practical utilization. There are  many complex design and tactical problems in the path of  producing acceptable radar characteristics: development of large  space antennas, reduction in the hindering background radiation  of the earth, the selection and optimization of surveillance  zones, the altitudes and inclinations of orbits for a look at  air space of interest to air defense manpower and assets. The  creators of space radars hope that these and other problems  arising in the course of their development will be resolved.  Then, such radars mounted on several satellites, deployed in  single orbit and at specific distances from one another, will  make it possible to obtain information about the activity of  aviation in the most remote regions of basing and over their  entire routes to targets with good regularity.    Thus integrated use of all means will make it possible to  form an external high-altitude thousand-kilometer field and warn  the air defense system of the flight of an air adversary in a  time which is close to the complete flight time of the planes  and missiles of the opposing side.    As for engagement of the air adversary at the far approaches  to the defended territory, here for the present we can see no  other air defense assets except for fighters. Their range of  action may be increased by in-flight refueling and their control  from air-born command posts. Moved out to pre-established main  directions of enemy raids, they will create favorable conditions  for successive commitment of fighters to battle at remote  perimeters, and also will be capable of interaction with SAM  complexes.    Naturally the further removal of the points of engagement  away from the defended objects and air bases will pose new  problems for tactics. What unexpected obstacles and surprises  await the pilots in their flight to a remote battle zone? These  may include sharp changes in the weather, unreliable  communications with ground control centers and a broken radar  field, where there is no information about the adversary, and  the search for him as he uses various tactical ruses, and the  adoption of a decision for the battle from rare target  designations from the airborne command post. And what high  demands will be put on piloting equipment, apparatus for control  of group actions, on tactical proficiency of the flight  personnel. Under such circumstances they will require bravery,  initiative, and the will for victory.    Further centralization and automation of control are  required  by the need to use more considerable amounts of manpower and  assets of air defense, in terms of composition and numbers, in a  large volume of air space, and coordination of their actions in  shorter time periods.    The construction of large and complex systems, centralizing  command and control and automating its process, began about  thirty years ago. As a result the widely advertised antiaircraft  air defense system of the North American continent "SAGE"  appeared. Somewhat later a combined air defense system for the  NATO countries of Europe was developed and continues to function  today. Command and control of air defense assets in this system  are centralized, and implemented from "NAGE" automated control  centers, providing collection, processing, transmission, and  display of data regarding the air situation and the state of  combat readiness of air defense assets, target designation of  SAM complexes and guidance of fighters. Automation of these  processes, and also the elimination of certain intermediate  links in the chain of data processing, led to a sharp reduction  in time expenditures. In comparison with manual processing of  data, the time of passage of data in the semi-automated systems  was reduced by 50 percent, and in fully automated systems by  85-90 percent. (ALLGEMEINE SCHWEIZER MILITAERZEITSCHRIFT, 1973,  No. 2; TRUPPENPRAXIS, 1975, No. 2.)    The advent of highly automated systems, which received  intensive development by the end of the 60s, somewhat blunted  the attention of military specialists to their further  development, but not for long. Today the talk of their  development is again going strong. But why has this tendency  appeared?    The answer lies in two problems which become urgent in air  defense. The first has to do with the now inadequate  capabilities of existing systems for coordination of efforts of  major air defense forces of different armed services and quick  reaction to the actions of similar major forces of the air  adversary. The second problem is to develop automated systems of  command and control and multichannel data lines which would  assure integrated command and control of air defense groupings  at different levels, and the rational distribution of functions  among them. For the time being the elements of command and  control which often duplicate one another leads to overload of  systems and unjustified losses of time.    Consequently, today there are much more complex tasks -- the  creation of an air defense system ensuring integrated use of all  manpower and assets of air defense with centralized command and  control, regardless of their affiliation to a specific armed  service.    But what interpretation do NATO military specialists impart  to the concept of "further centralization and automation of  command and control"? It should be noted that it is still not  very concrete. The issue is to enlarge the systems within one or  adjacent theaters of military action (TVDs), link operational  air defense centers with mobile automated systems of troop air  defense, a system of reconnaissance and monitoring of air space  at a higher level, and subordination of all of them to a single  command.    In the technical context this tendency is expressed in a  higher through-put capacity of the automated control systems,  speed of processing and transmission of data in command and  control nets, and more importantly, in a uniform software, used  in all the computer centers, and access to data for all  sub-systems and users. Automatic systems capable of sorting,  sifting, synthesizing, and displaying data in accordance with  the needs of the various command levels, are simply  indispensable here. After all, all the collected data are needed  by them to different degrees and in different forms. Too great  an amount of data hinders its utilization at the operational  level, while at the tactical level, on the contrary, detailed  data of each air target is required.    However, for now one can speak only of partial successes and  realization of individual technical solutions. There are many  causes: the difference in views regarding the essence of  processes and methods of command and control, the diversity of  methods of solving problems given the similarity of targets and  the diversity of designed electronic equipment. It is also  unclear what machines to use for the software.    Broad centralization of command and control undoubtedly will  make it possible to achieve a maximal effect in using fighters  over extended regions, since they will turn up precisely in the  axis and at the time when they are most needed for the repulse  of massed strikes. Automatic target distribution and issuance of  target designations to pilots from the fighter command post in  turn will reduce the cycles of command and control and raise the  accuracy of guidance to air targets. However it is still  necessary to attain mutual understanding between many levels and  precise distribution of command and control functions among them.    Acting within the framework of major automated command and  control systems, fighter aviation must be committed to battle  with special precision in place and time; uncoordinated actions  between units, tactical formations and ground air defense assets  are unacceptable. High accuracy is needed in using automatic  systems for command and control of air-to-air battles, and in  all systems based on interaction of man and machine, where  issuance of computer recommendations to the commander, automatic  generation and transmission of commands to the aircraft are  envisioned.    Enhancement of the survivability of air defense is  associated  with the increased capabilities of precision weapons and  reconnaissance-strike complexes of the opposing side with regard  to electronic suppression of various elements of the air defense  system. You see, in any system various electronic equipment are  and will be used whose emissions are difficult to conceal from  the enemy reconnaissance even in peacetime. With the start of  repulse of his raids, the air defense systems will reveal  themselves even more by turning on its many radars and  communications equipment and will become convenient targets for  precision weapons homing in on radiating sources.    This tendency has deep roots and a complex history. It found  intensive development after the Arab-Israeli conflict of 1967,  when the Israeli Air Force succeeded from the very start in  inflicting great damage on the aviation of the Arab countries  and suppressing their air defense systems. Allowing for the  unexpected and dramatic consequences of this conflict, the  military air defense commands of many countries immediately  began to raise the survivability of their air defense systems.  Simple reinforced concrete shelters appeared at airfields for  the planes, SAM complexes began to protect airfields, and  engineer preparation of radar positions and creation of decoy  targets simulating the operation of air defense assets were  started.    At present this tendency has received new impetus due to the  stormy growth in capabilities of the opposing side to engage air  defense installations. The reader is already familiar from the  preceding chapter with the efforts which aviation has exerted to  combat air defense, the difficulties which defense has  encountered in the harsh confrontation with the air adversary.  It will not be easy to safeguard the security of fighter  aviation at airfields. Vulnerability to precision weapons,  especially anti-airfield ones, which create small but numerous  foci of destruction on the runways (For example, the American  DAASM combination munitions, which consists of 8 penetrating  charges with high kinetic energy to destroy the runway, and 24  mines, which prevent approach to it. -- AIR FORCES, 1987, No.  11), reduce the fighting capacity of fighter aviation. In  addition, a larger portion of modern fighters are poorly adapted  to actions from dirt airfields, so fighter aviation is  restricted in terms of airfield maneuver.    In order to raise the survivability of air defense in all of  its links, many measures have been taken. These include  expansion of the net of hardened command and control points,  fixed, mobile, airborne, and adoption of radars and SAM  complexes which are scattered in the terrain, camouflage and  concealment from missiles and aerial bombs with electro-optic  homing heads, and much else. Of course these measures are quite  difficult, and it would be impetuous to judge their  effectiveness examining the essence of the ongoing processes,  but we are more interested in how the tendency of enhanced  survivability is manifested in fighter aviation.    Let us begin with the fact that in accordance with this  tendency, the need remains for the fighters to be disposed in  strong, hardened shelters, the creation of standby runways, and  the conduct of other such traditional measures. However  precision weapons have vitally devalued them. One can say that  now there is no problem with destroying targets at airfields  (depending on the range and strength of the weapons), but there  does exist a problem of finding them and obtaining precision  coordinates.    One thing is clear. In the interest of reliable defense of  fighter aviation at airfields, it is necessary to ensure maximal  covertness of its basing. It is much harder to camouflage  airfields than other air defense installations. Today reduction  in their tell-tale signs and integrated countermeasures to all  types of enemy reconnaissance are now no longer enough.  Therefore frequent and rapid relocation of fighter command and  control centers, maneuver of subunits from one airfield to  another, and also the creation of decoy installations, which  make it possible to trick the adversary with respect to the true  fighter aviation grouping, are becoming more preferable.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   In our day fundamentally new means of air attack are being  developed and introduced very quickly. The tactical techniques  of these assets are changing just as rapidly. And in these  surprising leaps, the need to maintain the constant combat  readiness of fighter aviation, and raise the tactical  proficiency of the flight personnel to repel aggression with  minimal losses stands out even more. This then is the principle  of defensive sufficiency, flowing from the nature of Soviet  military doctrine.  <H5>  PART TWO. TACTICS REVEAL THE SECRETS </H5> <H5>  Chapter V. Before Battle Is Joined </H5> <H5>  1. Guess or Foresee? </H5>   Does the pilot, and especially the command have the desire  to  precisely foresee the coming battle? Yes, this is the goal of  their work in preparing for battle. But it is not enough to have  a goal, one must also understand how this goal may be achieved,  what methods to use. But this question has been answered in  different ways at different times.    Intuition and inspiration, not a clever plan concocted on  the  ground, decides the success of battle. They themselves will come  to the pilot when he meets the enemy in the air; after all, you  can't foresee everything -- such is the assertion living  steadfastly on in the consciousness of some pilots from the days  of the Great Patriotic War, and one can sometimes hear it even  today from people with a poor knowledge of tactics. This is not  surprising. Ignorance, dilettantism, guesswork -- these are also  a favorable soil for idle arguments and silly conjectures.    Practical experience of the past and present demonstrates  something different: many of the components of future victory  are laid in the successfully developed battle plan. Surprise,  closure, rapidity of attack, quick response to sudden critical  situations in battle -- all these are derivatives of the  well-developed battle plan. No wonder they say that a battle is  fought twice: once in thought, then in action.    Commanders of all levels, when planning a battle, have long  sought to look into the future, to anticipate the enemy actions,  who in turn exerted no less effort, through camouflage,  concealment and disinformation, to pass off the true for the  false and the false for the true. During the front years, battle  planning achieved a high level of perfection. On the basis of  accumulated experience, logical conclusions, expert assessments,  aviation commanders determined ahead of time the nature and time  of actions of enemy aviation, the combat capability of the  fascist pilots, what "surprises" they were preparing to spring,  and then, without strict mathematical criteria, they created in  their minds models of the upcoming battle. This allowed them to  select and practice an expedient order of action. Many of these  models were polished direction in battles in accordance with the  answering tactical actions of the adversary, which were hard to  foresee.    Two-time Hero of the Soviet Union, A. Vorozheykin,  predicting  the tactics of the adversary in April 1944 in the Lvov axis,  noticed that during raids on our forces, the fighters which led  the way had the goal of either shooting down our fighter barrier  or diverting it away through demonstrative actions and opening a  lane to the targets of the strike. In the latter case the  fascists, without numerical superiority, approached  challengingly close, but did not join battle. Foreseeing the  enemy tactics, A. Vorozheykin led his squadron to protect the  troops. His prediction was justified. First on the horizon  appeared four FW-190s, but seeing that they could not attack the  fighters by surprise, they raced to the side, literally exposing  themselves to a strike. Soon another pair appeared, and hung  over the squadron threateningly. The enemy intent was clear, and  the commander did not rush to join battle. He had to wait. And  in fact, after a few minutes a report came from the guidance  center that a large group of bombers were approaching. This was  the decisive minute! The battle was fast-moving, the attacks  swift and sudden. The fascists suffered serious damage, and the  aimed strike on the troops was thwarted.    It is easy to find such analogues of foresight in the  experience of local wars. In the Vietnam war, pilots of American  Phantoms were baffled: how were North Vietnamese pilots able to  intercept them even before they broke from a closed to an open  battle formation (to form up for the target approach)? New means  of detection, new planes and weapons? Indeed no, in no case.  This happened because the air commanders, recording the routes,  flight altitudes, and nature of action of the Phantoms were able  to foresee their tactics ahead of time. Knowing the habits of  the enemy, the North Vietnamese fighters developed and applied a  method of combat actions from ambush on the ground and in the  air. Secretly flying to forward airfields half-destroyed by  American aviation, which the enemy did not notice, they were  committed to the battle suddenly and attacked Phantoms flying in  a dense battle formation, from close range.    In our time it has become much harder than in the past to  foresee how events will unfold. The situation has become more  fluid and complex, the aviation equipment more diverse. Battle  formations dispersed over tens of kilometers, the development of  EW assets and much else have changed the picture of  confrontation of the sides. The mentally predicted air-to-air  battle, and the foresight which air commanders have or do not  have, are marked by much greater complexity.    How then can one create a reliable and faithful analogue to  the battle situation in which the fighters must operate? How can  one study that which does not exist, but might (and might not),  in a more or less remote future?    These are not easy questions. Any prediction is based on  elements of the known and quite unfamiliar, but in their  aggregate quite predictable things. In one way or another, there  is a kind of logic in all things. In tactics everything is  always interrelated and controlled at times by obvious threads,  more often by invisible ones. Nonetheless, there are secrets to  prediction. As a creative process these lie in the objective,  law-governed regularities of air-to-air battle, which are  knowable.    Of course there are some difficulties involved in knowing,  and thus in foreseeing. How may they be overcome in order to see  these law-governed regularities behind the variety of battle  phenomena? In speaking of this, we always operate with concepts  such as sound knowledge of the basics of air-to-air combat,  equipment, and tactics, one's own and those of the enemy. But  knowledge is by no means all. It is not enough to memorize  precepts, formulas, numbers. So that they may be reflected in  foresight, one must also be able to consider the whole group of  factors influencing battle, uncover the deep processes of battle  dynamics, their causal relationships. Prediction of future  situations is closely associated with the use of probability  methods.    And what about intuition and inspiration, which come to the  aid of the commander? Their role cannot be discarded from the  scales, they are very important qualities, which supplement  probability methods. But it is rightly said that all intuition  is the result of erudition: earlier-accumulated knowledge,  acquired experience and skills. Thus it is worth something when  it relies on high professional training of the commander, and  precise calculation.    Before looking into the essence of the questions which have  been posed, let us note that the whole circuit of difficult  problems of foresight may be found only in special, quite  extensive military-science literature. But for us only specific  conclusions are important, and in the narrower meaning -- as  applied to the sphere of combat actions of fighters. For a clear  understanding of the essence of foresight and its practical  utilization in planning air-to-air battle, these conclusions may  be boiled down to three characteristic features: two-sidedness,  soundness, and specificity of foresight.    Foresight is a two-sided process, which flows from the  essence of dialectics which considers all the phenomena in their  inter-relationship and mutual causation. Such an approach is  quite complex, since the combat capabilities and tactics of the  sides (friendly and enemy) are revealed in a harsh  confrontation, are mutually dependent, and constantly being  improved.    Incorrect allowance for the correlation of combat  capabilities of the sides leads to one-sided assessments and may  give rise to errors: an overestimate of the capabilities of  friendly fighters and an underestimate of the capabilities of  the adversary (equating capabilities with realities or vice  versa).    In tactics an overestimate of one's own capabilities  engenders unconcern and conceit. For instance, fighters with  weapons sight systems and weapons for long-range attack were  given the position of a multiple aircraft air-to-air battle.  During planning of the battle, the group leader allowed for the  undoubted superiority over the "adversary," who did not have  such weapons, and decided to attack him head-on. The pilots had  seemingly calculated everything, and the outcome of the battle  was already decided. But when the group went aloft and detected  the "adversary" it began to close, but did not get to the point  of missile launch. The pilots preparing for launch were  subjected to a surprise attack from a different group, and in  this tactical situation they suffered "losses."    One of the causes of the defeat, if not the main one, was  the  underestimate of the capabilities of the "adversary," who more  realistically foresaw the actions of the fighters and allowed  for the psychology of their leader, who was aware of his  superiority in long-range weapons. At the last moment, on the  approach to the expected line of attack, the planes of the  "adversary" broke sharply, forming a strike group and a small  diversionary element, which foiled the missile strike. The  leader did not foresee this turn of events and did not provide  for countermeasures.    It is no less dangerous to underestimate one's own  capabilities and overestimate the capabilities of the adversary.  This is precisely what happened with another group of fighters,  which was performing the mission of troop defense. The planes of  the "adversary" used electronic jamming, the situation at the  command post was unclear, and command and control of the  fighters was unstable. Under these conditions, the group leader  saw a group of bombers which outnumbered the group of fighters.  The situation was critical, for the "adversary" was already  approaching the targets of the strike.    What was to be done? Of course an immediate attack and  report  to the command post was necessary in order that it build up  forces of the attackers, but the leaders, recalling the battle  plan, in which such a situation was not envisaged, found nothing  better than to avoid battle and continue to hunt for other,  smaller targets. One wonders if perhaps he in fact had no other  way out. No, he simply underestimated his own capabilities.  Remember what Suvorov said: "Not numbers, ability." It was  necessary to have the courage to attack a numerically superior  "adversary." Passivity in the air was tantamount to cowardice.  But then we cannot count quantity as something secondary. For  the issue is massing of the efforts of the fighters against  larger targets. This could be done by the command post guiding  the fighters, if the leader had promptly reported the nature of  the target, but he kept silent about the encounter in order to  avoid being rebuked for his irresolute actions.    The art of foresight is inseparable from the estimate of  capabilities of friendly forces. At first glance it would seem  that there is frankly speaking nothing to foresee here, since  all these capabilities are familiar to the commander. But the  fact is that they do not exist in and of themselves, but in  comparison with the combat capabilities of the adversary. The  capabilities of one and the same subunit, all other things being  equal, will be different in battle with an inexperienced or  strong enemy. In addition, the adversary himself will take  measures, predicting our capabilities and intentions, and what  is more, will influence the estimates and logic of the commander  in order to direct his actions in a direction favorable to  himself. Therefore it is natural to suppose that the adversary  first of all will strive to fully utilize his own combat  capabilities in order to deliver a strike of maximum strength,  and second through camouflage, concealment and disinformation to  trick the commander. Thus the enemy plan is almost never  manifested with the completeness the commander would wish, or  becomes known only after he has passed the lines of commitment  of the fighters to battle.    The total correlation of combat capabilities of the sides  may  be expressed most conveniently in quantitative terms, in the  number of planes participating in the battle, and in  quantitative-qualitative terms, by a comparative assessment of  the performance characteristics, weapons and equipment using the  existing coefficients of combat potentials, numerical values of  combat capabilities, if the qualitative indices are unequal.  From the whole variety of various characteristics, it is  necessary to select and compare the main ones, which have the  greatest importance for accomplishment of the upcoming mission  (speed, acceleration, maneuver characteristics of the aircraft,  dimensions of radar detection zones and interference protection  of the weapons sights, characteristics of the missiles, cannon,  and EW equipment). Such a comparison makes it possible to find  the areas of superiority of one's fighters in definite ranges of  altitudes and speeds, to select expedient tactical techniques  depending on the expected actions of the adversary.    Thus the two-sidedness of foresight allows the commander not  only to more profoundly assess his own capabilities, but also to  better foresee the actions of the adversary, which as a rule are  a response to the tactics of the fighters. Forcing him to act in  the spirit of his own concept, the commander as it were  "creates" the situation.    Soundness of foresight is based on a profound knowledge of  the law-governed regularities of battle, complete abandonment of  a subjective approach, earlier-adopted and quite possibly  erroneous prejudices and schemes. After all, it sometimes  happens that the very same information in the minds of different  commanders will acquire a different emotional coloration, and  this can lead to an unobjective estimate.    However, in addition to the law-governed regularities, a  battle is influenced by accidents, with which the air situation  is replete. Sometimes a pilot miscalculates in battle and tries  to explain this as an accidental confluence of circumstances  which it is hard to foresee, and at times impossible. Is this  really the case?    As the philosophers say, randomness is an objective  category.  Even in the most improbable event, after it has occurred they  strive to find the law-governed regularities. It is hard for us  to resist this temptation too. The adversary is before us. His  behavior in battle cannot be considered random, but it is not  repeated many times either. A smart adversary always proceeds  from our logic, strives to foresee it, and strives not to use a  single tactical technique.    Let us return to the example in which the leader,  underestimating the capabilities of the "adversary," was  subjected to a surprise attack, when victory was close. Did this  situation develop by accident? No, for the "adversary" nothing  at all unexpected happened. He calculated his battle plan and  worked it through ahead of time. But our leader, planning his  battle, did not suspect that he would operate according to the  decision which the "adversary" had foreseen. The situation  became critical also due to the unreadiness of the fighters for  a maneuver battle. So were these two events accidental?  Certainly not! They were both a consequence of the convergence  of two objective and mutually independent causes. Held captive  by prejudiced and desired estimates, the group leader himself  promoted the first of them, and the second came about due to the  unexpectedness of the first.    Of course one could relate differently to such unsuccessful  planning. One could reason like this, for instance: are there  many accidently, unforeseen situations in battle? Since they are  unforeseeable, why not avoid them? After all, battle is battle.  Anything might happen. But in this case can one say that  accidents happened? That they were simply inevitable? If they  did not happen, this would contradict common sense. No wonder  they say that accident is an unknown principle in operation.  This familiar saying sounds particularly apt in this situation.  Such accidents could have been prevented or at least reduced to  a minimum if the leader was able to foresee this natural turn of  the battle. The commander cannot foresee precisely what tactical  tricks the adversary would prepare for deception and  disinformation of the fighters in the given battle, cannot know  who would detect whom first, in what specific situation the  fighters would be relative to the adversary. He cannot have an  idea either of further failures of aviation equipment or ground  control assets due to their reliability, or errors which the  pilots might commit at a given stage of the battle. For example,  the very fact of detection of an adversary on the left of the  battle formation of the group, or an error of one of the pilots  in aiming, are random events. Even if such events are of low  probability, this does not prevent them from appearing, but one  must allow for these accidents, and take the necessary measures.    Consequently, of course one can predict the occurrence of a  particular accident, but one cannot predict a specific  manifestation of it with respect to place, time, or form.  Foresight in most cases is presumptive in nature and most often  is based on probability methods. This means that estimates are  based on average results and make it possible to determine only  a tendency of development of the process in question. But the  final outcome of accomplishment of a mission is random, one can  only construct suppositions about it. Low values of indices of  effectiveness of combat actions of fighters by no means rule out  the possibility of victory. Sometimes they show that the  developed plan of battle is not the best, and it is necessary to  look for other alternatives.    The basis of foresight is the hypothesis, a presumption with  a certain level of probability. Here it is easy to go wrong.  Therefore one cannot rush to unequivocal assessments, but one  can and should foresee the range of possible changes of the  situation, i.e., a certain amount of variants of the battle.  Here in order to remove or rightly allow for uncertainty of the  situation, one must also allow both for the completeness and the  reliability of the existing data, and for the commander's will,  which links the reliable information with the supposed. But the  amount of each of these components is different. Let us suppose  that you know the combat missions and intentions of the  adversary, but in the other case you know only that the  adversary will be somewhere in the sky. The answer is clear. The  more complete the data, the more weighty will be the  contribution made to foresight by strict calculations, the less  data, the greater the role played by suppositions, logic, and  the commander's will.    But will the prediction always be justified? To think this  is  to think the enemy a fool. The soundness of foresight lies in  discerning tendencies of the predicted battle, which operate as  an objective necessity, and arise as a result of accidents or  voluntary decisions.    Specificity of foresight consists in the directness, the  purposefulness and flexibility of the thinking process of the  commander. It makes it possible to narrow the circle of analyzed  situations and vary only the group of those which are typical  for the expected situation, and also quickly correct one's  estimates when it changes.    Of course each commander is interested in most completely  imagining the picture of the coming battle, more deeply getting  at the essence of its contradictions. But foresight is exercised  not for the satisfaction of idle curiosity. In order not to  drown in secondary questions, for the assigned combat mission  the commander must first correctly clarify what precisely he  wants to foresee, know at a minimum what he is striving for. The  answer to this question may be found not so much in the content  of the combat mission itself, as in what is known and unknown to  the commander, and does he need to know what he doesn't know.  But if the commander has only a vague idea of what he wants,  then numerous assessments of the most diverse situations, the  method of trial and error, will not help him. Two-sidedness and  soundness of foresight does not change the essence of the  matter. It is a question chiefly of the level of detail, the  accuracy of foresight, the distinguishing of precisely those  situations which have decisive importance for planning of the  specific battle.    Ideally the battle plan is, indisputably, as specific as  possible. But an excessively rigid plan, overloaded with  specifics and details, not only is difficult to execute, forcing  the pilots to devote a greater part of their attention to  keeping the set order of actions, but also hampers them in  reacting to the actually developing situation. Sometimes one  encounters commanders who, on the contrary, try to plan the  battle in the most general outlines. They construct the model of  an enemy raid, distribute fight forces along the point of  engagement, announce the procedures for command and control and  interaction, and believe that they have planned the battle. Such  planning, where all specific actions of the pilots are left to  the will of circumstance, testifies to poor tactical proficiency  on the part of the commander. Therefore the level of detail of  planning, and consequently also of foresight, should respond to  the requirement not to constrain the reasonable initiative and  tactical thinking of the pilots, but at the same time to permit  allowance for the greatest number of factors of the combat  situation.    But will prediction always be accurate? To think it will is  to insult the adversary. It is impossible to achieve absolutely  accurate values of all parameters of expected actions in battle,  and the results of foresight will always differ to some degree  from the actual development of events. And indeed, what sort of  guaranteed accuracy of prediction of enemy actions can there be  if even the battle formation of the subunit cannot be maintained  with absolute precision and with those parameters which the  commander puts in the battle plan? Nor is such ideal realization  of foresight required. Everything depends on for whose interests  it is conducted.    Suppose that a pair or flight of fighters is preparing for  an  air-to-air battle. Here it is necessary to carefully calculate  the conditions and procedures for accomplishment of literally  each maneuver, one's own and the adversary's one is to fight.  The regiment commander does not require such specificity. For  him, it is enough to foresee the totality of these conditions  and maneuvers as the foundation for development of a battle plan  of the fighter subunits combined by a common concept. But even  here foresight should be adequately specific.    For example, if the commander needs to plan a battle while  protecting ground troops, he must limit himself to prediction of  the actions of only that enemy aviation may deliver strikes on  the troops in the protected region, and only in the given time  of protection. This of course does not rule out a situation in  which the subunit is small but accomplishes an important task  (individual flight or pair acting to tie down the adversary in  the interests of all other tactical groups) and becomes the  object of the close attention of the commander.    Limitation of the framework of foresight in accordance with  the scale of the task to be performed allows the commanders of  various levels to forego "global" assessments and vagueness of  thought, and to focus on the search for answers only to those  questions which flow from the non-specificity of the situation.    Thus two-sidedness, soundness and specificity make it  possible to predict the air situation, however complex it may  be, to consider it not as a manifestation of "chaotic," "blind"  randomness, but the result of actions of the adversary and  friendly fighters. It is precisely foresight which serves as the  criterion for the commander's farsightedness and tactical  thinking. Now the times themselves pose the question: How then  can we plan a battle which has a fair amount of variants?  <H5>  2. Calculate Seven Times, Decide Once </H5>   One can clearly sin against truth if one says that after  receiving a combat mission the commander and his pilots  immediately begin to plan the battle. No, at times they do not  know how to approach the planning, and as their knowledge and  skills will allow they try to foresee the conditions of the  upcoming battle. Usually the pilots first look for analogies,  more or less similar to a situation with which they are  familiar. They use them for subsequent discussions and  comparisons with the expected situation, they strive to think  for the adversary, to delve into his possible assessments,  decisions, tactics, socio-psychological aspects determining his  behavior in battle. And the latter tries to do every thing to  conceal his plan and to force his will on the fighters. Thus  there is always a danger that one will fall victim to artful  camouflage and disinformation by the adversary. One must also  allow for many other circumstances which do not lead to  unequivocal assessments.    Opportunities for comprehensive allowance for diverse  conditions which may arise in battle are offered by modelling,  which allows one to reproduce, study and analyze all the ups and  downs of engagement and development of battle, to qualitatively  predict its results.    Modelling in tactics as a method of scientific foresight for  the time being remains the basis for planning air-to-air  battles. The two-sided process of foresight also requires  two-sided modelling. Here one can assume that the general  law-governed regularities of tactics are objective, and to a  significant degree apply to both opposing sides. Each of the  sides strives to create conditions which are favorable for the  actions of their forces, and at the same time to counter the  analogous aspirations of the adversary.    Consequently the model of an upcoming battle may be  presented  in the form of two interrelated models. On the one hand, the  model of the expected actions of the adversary, and, on the  other, the model of the battle with him. There can be very many  such models.    Today simulating and modelling complexes are already being  developed which include automatic control systems of fighter  control centers, integrated simulators for pilots, and  data-display equipment, and numerous models of air-to-air  battles have been developed and displayed on computers. These  allow automated vectoring of the pilots to the battle region,  realization of the commander's decision to destroy the air  targets, modelling and testing of tactical techniques and  maneuvers for specific situations in battle with any aircraft of  the adversary.    But what if the regiment still does not have such complexes?  Then the traditional, graphic-analysis modeling still remains in  force. Of course its basis is monotonous, hard work to register  a whole series of calculations. But even the simplest techniques  of graphic-analysis modelling, with which the pilots are quite  familiar, make it possible to calculate and analyze various  situations of battle. At any moment one can compare what happens  if when such-and-such maneuvers are used, the adversary responds  in such-and-such a manner. If you have doubts, change the  conditions and repeat the modelling. But for all the  multiplicity of modelled situations, one should proceed from the  fact that the adversary, by selecting the axis and the time of  the raid, determines the conditions of the battle only at the  very start. Subsequently the fighters can force their own will  and tactics on him, not forgetting however that the adversary  will seek to do the same to them. The very posing of the  question shows the direct link between modelling and foresight.    All these truths are meant for the uninitiated reader.  Pilots, not to mention air commanders, are well aware of the  rich possibilities offered by modelling of air-to-air battles.    But then, we will not go into the details and nuances of  modelling. There are no cliche techniques here, as there are no  identical air-to-air battles. Each pilot, depending on the level  of his knowledge, experience and even temperament, will proceed  in his own way, but the first step is always the same, that is,  clarification of the task, the goals of modelling, and selection  of tactical situations. But how many, and which situations  should be chosen from those that are possible? If one takes all  possible situations for modelling, one will simply bog down in a  sea of calculations.    No unequivocal answer can be found in a single book of  tactics, for this would contradict the very nature of the  creative thought process, which is specific in each separate  case. For any air-to-air battle, depending on the expected  actions of the adversary, the weather conditions and other  conditions, one must model a certain number of situations. They  will not be the same number of situations, and are determined  first of all by the level of indeterminacy of the situation.  Some of the components of its factors are known, others remain  undiscovered for some time, and perhaps remain unknown. An  identical answer is as impossible as a single plan of battle for  different conditions. There are many answers, and even more  approaches.    Here is one of them. Let us suppose that it is necessary to  plan actions of fighters to perform two combat missions of  differing content: interception and an air-to-air battle with  enemy planes in repulse of a massed raid, and conduct of a  "hunt."    When planning an interception and air-to-air battle on the  basis of knowledge and prediction of the general principles,  combat strength and disposition of the enemy forces in a massed  raid, guided by the logic of his thinking and by available  information, one can construct a model of the raid, foresee the  tactics of the groups and individual crews, but one should not  count on a detailed, reliable model. When planning a "hunt," the  level of indeterminacy is even greater. Where will the adversary  be encountered, will it happen at all, what types of planes will  there be, their number, the battle formation, the resistance by  air defenses -- all this is known only approximately, or not at  all.    But on the other hand, there are a number of well-known  factors which are determined by the content of the combat  mission and the conditions of its accomplishment, and do not  require prediction. These include the flight models to the  interception and to the "hunt" region, the points of engagement  of the fighters, the corridors for passage of the front line  upon returning from combat missions.    For all the diversity of combat missions, one cannot fail to  note the similarity here: the indeterminacy of the situation  related to the adversary, and the unambiguity of the parameters  flowing from the mission content, which may be accepted in the  capacity of starting data for modelling.    Consequently, it appears possible to specifically and in  detail determine the procedures for the takeoff of subunits,  their movement to the points of engagement or to the "hunt"  region, and the tactical techniques of the search, i.e.,  everything that the pilots do before they encounter the  adversary. As for further actions, the higher the level of  indeterminacy of the actions, the less strict and detailed the  modelling should be. Such a variable level of modelling, in  terms of level of preciseness, at different stages of planning a  combat flight, which flows from the specificity of foresight, is  evident in itself, and does not arouse particular objections.    "But what if I know everything about the adversary?" a  persistent reader may ask. "Can't you then avoid spreading  yourself too thin on numerous situations, and stay with one, and  construct one, precise model of the upcoming actions? For  example, I am given a simple mission using a flight to intercept  a non-maneuvering target, whose characteristics and altitude  have already been reliably established at the command post  controlling the fighters."    Answering this question, let us accept such an assumption  (even if it is extremely dubious) and let's see if the other  conditions for accomplishment of the mission are so unshakable  that one can restrict oneself to a single model. You of course  will allow for information about the adversary, the terrain, and  weather, and in accordance with the combat capabilities of one's  flight (and that you will know thoroughly), and you will  construct an appropriate model. It goes without saying that if  the airborne complex and weapons allow an attack on the target  in the forward hemisphere, you will choose the most favorable  from among possible conditions -- closure with the adversary  head to head, when it is not necessary to conduct a visual  search which burdens pilot attention.    But why do you refrain from other variants in modelling a  battle, even with an adversary known to you? After all, the  not-so-unexpected might happen, and instead of a long-range  battle, you might be forced to fight a close-range air-to-air  battle. And when there is a close-range battle, you have to seek  the target with your eyes. There are many reasons for this:  errors in calculation of the CP and the pilots themselves,  retargeting of the fighters, etc. Such are the moments of  reckoning for a single model!    In forecasting the conditions for accomplishment of an  at-first-glance simple combat mission, you selected the most  possible situation from your standpoint, and discarded the less  possible (but not impossible!). And among them are those which  radically change the nature of actions of the fighters. Thus it  would be illogical to limit oneself to structuring of one model  even with the uncompromising conviction that "I know everything  about the adversary," just as with regard to the other "known"  factors, including friendly combat capabilities, interrelated  with and inseparable from other conditions of the situation.    An element of indeterminacy is a vital, fundamental property  of almost any air situation, and the degree of this  indeterminacy may be very high. But it seems to me that in this  case there are not and cannot be circumstances and factors which  were not predicted at all; only the specificity of the foresight  will be different. It may be only in general outlines, but one  must predict everything. But if it is impossible to obtain  reliable data for sound conclusions, one must assess the  situation as a whole with allowance from multi-variant  development of the situation.    However not only the indeterminacy of the situation has its  affect on the number of modeled situations. After all, it often  happens that even in similar situations one can operate in  different ways. Using the terminology of cybernetics, one can  say that one and the same event may be displayed by different  models. They will all enjoy equal rights. But the situation  forces one to arrive at a quite specific decision. Here one  cannot manage without volitional qualities, without experience  and intuition of the commander.    Nonetheless, one can clarify a certain law-governed  regularity in the relation of the foundation of calculation to  that of will. Let us recall the simple and wise popular saying:  "Measure seven times, cut once." Rephrasing it, we can say,  "Calculate seven times, decide once." For all the provisional  nature of this formula, it is quite apropos here. The foundation  of calculation (7:1) in modelling is given a clear preference.  And the commander with his assistants carefully and repeatedly  calculates all the details of the battle.    As a result of repeated, two-sided modelling of tactical  situations, they may be reduced to several variants of battle  and for each of them characteristic, specific attributes have  been distinguished. How then to select that variant which makes  it possible to perform the assigned mission in the best way? Of  course, by comparison. There is no other way of selecting the  variant; here there are many things unclear.    The main question is, How may we compare the variants with  one another and draw a conclusion in favor of one or another of  the variants? Everything depends on the goals which must be  achieved by the fighters in accomplishing the given combat  mission. One need only select the corresponding indices.  Unreliable indices are like a compass which confuses us, and  draws us off course. If the goal of the battle is formulated  wrongly, then the searches for an optimal variant, headed in the  wrong direction, may lead to an attempt to achieve secondary  goals.    For example, in an air-to-air battle when providing troop  protection, one of the indices will be the mathematical  expectation of the number of targets destroyed by the fighters.  However one cannot but allow for where they will be destroyed  relative to friendly troops (the adversary should not have time  to launch a strike) and at what cost the success will be  achieved, i.e., what friendly losses will be. When the planes  are supported by other arms of aviation, the indices are  different: the degree of protection of the defended planes, the  number of attacks repulsed, and also friendly losses. The  mathematical expectation of the number of downed fighters of the  adversary has secondary importance. In actions against ground  targets in aerial reconnaissance, other indices have decisive  importance.    The contradictory nature of all of these indices does not  allow us to find the best (optimal) variant simultaneously in  terms of each of them. Thus one must have an integral index of  effectiveness, i.e., one which allows for the attainment of all  goals. Here one of the indices should be taken as the main one,  and the rest are given the value of limitations, especially the  index of friendly losses. This index directs one to cheerless  thoughts. Plan the death of pilots ahead of time? What's the  sense of this? No, not plan, but minimize the index. The  possibility of great losses not only does not permit, it  directly forbids acknowledgement of a battle variant as  advisable if even in the stage of development it threatens the  fighters with significant harm. Consequently, any battle variant  must have a precisely set goal and meet the strict requirements  of every combat mission. Universal variants do not exist.    Of course, in using battle variants, however many there may  be, it is impossible to allow for all the variety of the air  situation, but they do create indisputable advantages for the  commander.    Let us suppose that in planning a battle you have decided to  have in the battle formation of the squadron both decoy elements  and strike elements, and also a reserve element to protect the  first two, and intend for buildup of efforts in the battle. Does  this mean that such a disposition of forces is always retained  when battle is joined? No, the pilots must be ready to change  roles. It is best for that element to attack the adversary which  is in the most favorable position. It may happen that the  reserve is the first to join battle. Then the other elements  must immediately reform for its protection, or for execution of  a decoy maneuver. There may also be other situations, but  pre-planned variants give the pilots the possibility of finding  their bearings more confidently in the situation, more quickly  seeing the chances for success, and psychologically reorienting  themselves.    And so we conclude that multi-variant planning of battle  makes it possible to obtain precise quantitative estimates and  foresee the results of battle on the basis of two-sided  modelling. This conclusion does not give grounds for excessive  optimism. If we were to model certain air-to-air battles of the  Great Patriotic War, for example, from the mathematical and even  logical estimates, they will not fit into the generally accepted  indices. However, these battles desire our admiration. A bold  group of seven fighters under the command of Major B. Yeremin  joined battle with 25 fascist planes, and after downing eight of  them, gained the victory; Captain A. Gorovets destroyed nine  bombers in just one battle. Thus the models of those battles,  formulated in the heads of the front-line troops, allowed for  still other factors. In those days there were also many  unsuccessful battles, whose modelling today would give higher  results.    Unfortunately, today we cannot allow for everything, no  matter how complex the mathematical techniques to which we try  to reduce the battle variant. No mathematical apparatus, no  computer can eliminate or even discover errors of tactical  thinking. Therefore, to repose vain hopes, and blindly believe  in the force of models, is simply harmful. The development of  battle variants is not exhausted by the intricacies of  modelling, and does not completely fit in the framework of even  complex calculations. They only reinforce tactical thinking with  precise quantitative estimates.    However let us recall the place of the volitional foundation  in modelling, and the ratio of 7:1. The dialectic of development  of battle variants is such that despite will, experience and  intuition of the commander, strict calculations come first. But  how impatient we are at times in our desire to obtain the final  results! Do we allow for untested, doubtful data and details, or  only the most visible surface attributes of situations, do we  strive to control the uncontrollable urge to "cut" immediately,  without any calculations, simply on the basis of common sense,  "by eye"?  <H5>  3. How Many Tactical Techniques? </H5>   This question might sound strange, but it arises in the  commander and his pilots each time in planning an air-to-air  battle. In order to answer it, first let us consider what we  want to get from the tactical technique.    Any tactical technique should correspond to the general  concept of the battle, allow for the expected actions and  tactical tricks of the adversary, allow its executors rapid and  even instantaneous determination of the appropriateness of a  particular, planned tactical procedure for the developing  specific situation in the course of battle. It is still  necessary to achieve covertness of actions in order to outwit  the adversary. The necessary requirements for a tactical  technique are the possibility of its development by several  variants in battle, and simplicity of execution. Of course, it  has nothing in common with stubborn straightforwardness, and  entails abandonment of far-fetched complications which would  require useless expenditure of forces to overcome. Nor should we  forget about reliable protection from attack by enemy fighters,  which requires allocation of part of the forces, or of tactical  and fire coordination in groups.    This list of requirements is a kind of methodological  approach to development of tactical techniques, and it may be  viewed from the standpoint of assessment of their "tactical  cost." Unfortunately, real battle gives the true price of the  technique, but fortunately, the tactical attainments of the  adversary are also subordinate to this same criterion.    Is the variety of tactical techniques large? Yes, there are  quite many, and this is necessary to provide the pilots with a  choice of a rational one in the conditions of indeterminacy of  the air situation. Such a situation may develop as a result of  actions of the adversary, changes in the weather, and other  circumstances which cannot be unequivocally determined ahead of  time. Here resides all the complexity of the question. Even in  one and the same situation, several variants may be found, while  sometimes the tactical technique may prove to be the one.  Therefore the number of tactical techniques in itself says  nothing. If failure befalls you, this means that the technique  did not correspond to the situation, or was poorly executed.    However, in arguing about the number of tactical techniques,  at times we meet the statement that (having) many tactical  techniques is good, and having few is bad. Is there an index of  quality of tactics? Will it not happen that in the search for  new techniques we will operate by the slogan "Let it be worse,  as long as it's different"? There should not be stagnation in  tactics, but this does not mean that everything new is ingenious.    Imagine that when closing with a maneuvering target you have  applied an original tactical technique, but its results are  worse in comparison with some already known, you attacked a  target using a new technique, but it entailed a hazard to flight  safety. Should such tactical innovations be encouraged? There is  much innovation, but what is the ultimate result? After all, it  is determined not by the degree of innovation of the tactical  technique, but by the effectiveness of accomplishment of the  combat mission. However much a pilot may wax sarcastic about the  cliche nature of already known tactical techniques, a situation  in which the race for quantity becomes an end itself is already  bad.    They say that the great scientist Einstein once was making a  note in his little notebook. Answering a question from those  around him, he said that he was writing down his thoughts.    "Why such a little notebook then?" asked one curious person.    "Because good thoughts don't occur to one that often," the  scientist replied with a smile.    There it is! And sometimes we try everything we can to think  up yet another tactical technique, so that we have a lot of  them, we fill up thick workbooks, and later on we ourselves  can't understand the notes. But on the other hand, you won't go  far repeating customary tactical techniques. There is a rule in  pedagogy that simple repetition, regardless of the number of  repetitions, only strengthens skills, but does not bring  perfection. This is also the case in tactics, in unthinking  repetition of the same mechanical tactical techniques.    Modern tactical techniques of fighters have achieved a high  level of sophistication. Sometimes it appears that tactics has  entered a period in which everything that can be improved has  already been improved, and some sort of tactical ceiling has  been reached, which it makes no sense to go beyond. Is this the  case?    Once upon a time a young pilot in the circle of his comrades  expressed the interesting idea that, as he put it, the time of  creativity in the search for tactical techniques had disappeared  along with the piston aircraft and subsonic speeds. Now they  must not learn creativity, but execute the flight program and  the commands from the ground. All of his actions were  programmed, all the tasks were carried out by "smart"  instruments. Those were the work of Chkalov's day, when new  methods of attack were in stormy development, and high aerobatic  maneuvers were being developed!    Yes, Valeriy Chkalov improved the existing and searched for  new methods of using his aviation equipment and weapons. He was  not satisfied by the existing views, according to which a target  could be attacked only from conventional horizontal flight.  Despite the established rules, he proposed and developed other  variants of attack, including the delivery of fire with the  aircraft "on its back," and for the first time in the world  executed maneuvers such as the "slow roll" and the "climbing  spin." Precisely these maneuvers were used later on in vertical  maneuver combat which became dominant among Soviet fighters  during the Great Patriotic War. Chkalov's contemporaries were  always struck by his erudition, his knowledge of aerodynamics  and the equipment which he flew, and his creative attitude  toward his job.    Indisputably, present-day aviation equipment is incomparable  with the equipment of the thirties, which Chkalov mastered, but  have Chkalov's times ended? No, creativity in tactics cannot  disappear from our profession. What is more, the diversity of  tactical techniques characterizes the pilot, determines his  style, his signature.    Creativity is the accomplishment of non-typical tasks, the  creation of the new and original. Creativity of the fighter  pilot is of a special sort. It is subordinate to the mission of  destruction of the air adversary, and under the conditions which  are complex and hard-to-predict. It is expressed not only in the  creation of tactical techniques which are new in concept and  execution, but also in their capable selection from a group of  those already existing. This means that the nature of the new in  tactics is such that it often is born in the core of the old.    Before we move forward, it is necessary to comprehensively  consider what has been accumulated, with allowance for the  requirements of today. There is truth to the joke that "The new  is the long-forgotten old." Thus tactical techniques of group  maneuver battle, sharpened to perfection at the front, and  forgotten in the 50s, later on were reborn on a new foundation;  the cannon fire, once consigned to oblivion, blazes again in  air-to-air conflict.    Of course the importance of experience of bygone wars is not  all the same: it was greater in the first postwar years, when  basically the equipment of the concluding period of the war was  in the armament of fighter aviation, and less in the subsequent  period, with transition to new equipment and with the  introduction of correctives to the theory of the air-to-air  battle. Nonetheless, we continue to study the experience of  bygone wars and exercises, and we seek in them the answers to  problems of present-day battle, and try to avoid the repetition  of errors.    We proceed to the new in tactics also through hard pondering  of today's experience, we study the capabilities of modern  equipment, we "probe" the tactics of the adversary, we collect  crumb-by-crumb everything interesting which is occurring in the  practice of the best pilots. Alas veins of gold are not  everything discovered -- tactical techniques are not put in our  hands ready-made, but this by no means diminishes the importance  of the question.    However, it is apropos to recall that blind copying of  something, even the best experience, does not replace the  personal touch. Look carefully at one's practice and you will  most likely find that you can add something to tactics. This may  be, for example, a different combination of practiced piloting  situations, or unexpected changes in simple maneuvers, in the  models of battle. Even the experienced enemy may become  flustered in the face of such changes. After all, he may have to  change an adopted decision under a time shortage, and this is a  quite complex process. On the basis of personal experience, new  ideals open up, and thought is spurred. It is impossible to  learn to fight a battle only on the basis of others' attainments  and errors.    How then are new tactical techniques born? The search in  tactics cannot be boiled down to some sort of accidental  enlightenment, a flash of intuition, although this might happen  in battle. The search begins on the ground, in the preparation  for flight. It begins with development and accumulation of  battle variants. Here calculation, repeated modelling, tests and  playing out of variants, comprehensive testing of the obtained  models, their necessary practical application. In discussing  variants of battle, pilots due to the essence of a particular  situation, learn to soundly prove the essence of their arguments  (truth is born out of controversy). This makes it possible  "roughly" to be ready for actions in the air. There remains only  to link the arising situation, from a certain number of traits,  to a prepared tactical technique, and the habit of thinking  creatively ensures rapid determination of the technique which is  optimal for the given situation.    At the same time, new tactical techniques often are born  directly in battles, with unexpected changes in the situation.  Nonetheless, if the pilot does not model a variant similar to  such changes on the ground, in the air he will find himself in a  very difficult situation. Hard mental labor aimed at foreseeing  possible situations will always promote creativity in the air.    But then even now some theorists believe that better has to  mean more complicated. In the race after new tactical  techniques, they solve tough mathematical equations, operate  with many indices relating various characteristics of friendly  and enemy planes, but they do not allow for the living human  being, the pilot. Knowledge is transformed into dogma,  methodical approaches become law, a distinctive,  hard-to-understand terminology is formed.    It seems to me that tactics constitutes techniques which are  simple in their essence, but hard for the adversary to puzzle  out in detail. And probably there is nothing more reasonable  than the sense of harmony between the complexity of concept of  the tactical technique and its practical feasibility. Tactical  techniques arise out of the need for them. If we perceive this  need, and it does not disappear when some other technique is  used, that means that we need another, more effective one. To  develop truly necessary tactical techniques requires sound  theoretical knowledge and modelling skills, but that is not  enough. In battle there is no one you can describe your  knowledge and skills to, and no point to doing so. You also need  the desire to seek out the new in tactics, to find in it the you  of creativity, to view it not as something extraordinary, but as  an indispensable trait of the pilot profession.    There is a widely-shared viewpoint that the new and  progressive will inevitably, sooner or later win out, will fight  its way through. Perhaps we simply are not aware of the fate of  those tactical innovations which did not win out. What destroyed  them? Passivity of the pilots, the resistance to change of the  leaders, the impatience with "dissidence" in tactics in the  period of stagnation?    Imagine that you are preparing for an air-to-air battle,  possessing exhaustive information on the adversary, who is not  expected to put up serious resistance. Are special tactical  devices required under such testing range conditions, so to  speak, in order to achieve victory? Here open actions, in which  there is no place for improvement of tactics, are natural and  logical, but the unsoundness of such actions is also evident.    Here is another example, when despite the complex situation  and the boldness of the pilots in their tactical decisions, the  baggage of knowledge accumulated over long years, the experience  of the senior officer plans the role of a conservative force and  prevents looking at the tactics in a new way. In one squadron,  during preparation for the next evaluation testing, they decided  to shine before the higher command with a new tactical  technique, which significantly raised the effectiveness of  intercept of air targets. How much effort, time, and thought was  expended to develop it, only the pilots themselves know! It was  all calculated and tested, but... when the senior officer, now a  former officer, was acquainted with this technique, he  categorically forbade using it, and even accused the squadron  commander of adventurism.    "Why should we risk something new and difficult?" the  officer  reasons. "All the actions of the pilots are written out in the  governing documents," he stated, feeling no embarrassment. "Just  follow the instructions as required, and nothing else."    Of course by no means every technique must be encouraged,  but  it is necessary to look into it, so as not to discourage  creativity. Of course the following sortie to intercept a  hypothetical adversary, known to be weak, to top it off, was  successful, but if one can put it thus, it was reminiscent of a  woodcut of a blue, cloudless landscape, the embodiment of a  problem-free situation.    The squadron commander bent over his desk and thoughtfully  examined the separate models of the upcoming battle. Both he and  his colleagues had two variants: one the usual, which the pilots  often used, the other more complex, since it was associated with  energetic maneuvering, and required high flying proficiency, but  promised the greater success.    It would seem that the commander had no reason to ponder for  long, that the conclusion was more than obvious: he had to  operate by the second variant. But the commander could not  forget the unsuccessful example of his neighboring squadron and  had good grounds for doubt. The two developed variants of the  battle he saw as two paths: the first was off road, untraveled,  in which there were more chances of error, the second was well  worn, one might say "classical" in its simplicity. The  all-justifying call to remember only flight safety was a  reliable shield for the second variant. After all, in the event  of failure the commander would again be accused of adventurism,  excessive independence. And he chose the second, well-worn path.  Who likes to be told off, with no attention paid to those around  him?    "Nothing doing," the squadron commander waved aside his  creativity, opting for a calm course of service. "Am I smarter  than the others? Better not to tempt fate." And he set off to  assign the mission to his subordinates.    I won't undertake to say the mood with which the pilots  greeted the decision of their commander, but it would appear  that they were not especially upset.    "It's typical phoniness" the reader will probably snap, and  he would be right.    I too got mad, and when the pilots returned to the air  field,  I went up to them and inquired how the battle had gone. Some  spoke of the easy victory over the "adversary" and were happy at  the success, others argued that they did not have to make any  maneuvers for secrecy or swiftness of attack. The squadron  commander without a shadow of embarrassment in his voice, as if  he were speaking of practicing some elements of combat  application, answered me:    "What is this about? After all, everything is hypothetical  in  our training, and we did win the battle. Anyway, I don't  understand why we need these training complications." Here, no  longer concealing his irritation, the officer continued (the  well-worn path did its work), "Let a real war come, then we'll  show the enemy what we can do. Anyway, why are you interested in  this case? That's the way it will be tomorrow and the day after."    I explain my interest: it's better to suffer a defeat in a  training battle today, but to gain the new experience which will  bring victory in the future. Of course one can cling for some  time to general words of the dubiousness of using complex  tactical techniques in combat training, and of the remote  aspects of a real battle. But there it will be different, if you  select and use a good tactical technique, you will save yourself  and your comrades, and win a victory, if you don't, then blame  yourself, as they say.    There are not many such cases in the experience of combat  training now, but the cost of each of them is very high. False  opinions have appeared suggesting that creativity in tactics is  the domain of the select, a mystery behind seven seals, a gift  of the gods. But in fact, any thinking person is capable of  creativity, and what is more, can learn creativity. This is why  we seek out new tactical techniques again and again.    How many tactical techniques should one have? Ten, twelve, a  hundred? Sometimes it seems that they may be counted, especially  if the types of aircraft, the numerical strength of the  adversary, the place and other conditions of the battle are  known.    Flight commander Capt. Ye. Kaberov, knowing these  conditions,  together with his pilots developed a battle plan in detail. They  selected and calculated standard tactical techniques of battle;  they seemingly covered all tactical situations of the flight.  But the unexpected happened: whether the "adversary" received  precise information from the ground, or whether he himself used  some technique unknown to the flight commander, the latter  detected him too close, on a pursuit intercept course, and  significantly lower. When the "enemy" planes flashed by to the  left under him, the captain realized that if he structured a  maneuver for turn to attack by the whole flight, as envisaged in  preparation for battle, he would lose the initiative. He  required another tactical technique, but precisely one which  would correspond to the situation. To the commander's credit, he  did not lose his head.    "Six-hundred thirty, attack!" the officer ordered the leader  of the second pair, which was behind in a more favorable  position for the attack.    "Six-hundred thirty," understanding the commander's intent,  executed an energetic turn to the right and delivered an  accurate strike. The commander with his wingman supplemented the  force of the strike. The battle was won.    "The hundred-and-first tactical technique," joked the  pilots,  assembling after landing. "How many tactical techniques do you  have to have?"    "Just as many as you need in different situations," answered  Kaberov. And you have to agree with that answer. Perhaps you  won't have to improvise in every battle, but you always have to  know how to find the tactics which were not envisaged in the  battle plan. The main thing here is to precisely determine the  situation from which one can proceed to selection of a suitable  technique.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   And so preparation for battle is concluded. The battle plan  has been drawn up and studied. The commander is certain that  each pilot knows where to go and what to do. Everyone is intent  on victory. It goes without saying that it will depend not just  on the hopes of the commander. It would of course be nice to  fight a battle if it were waged only under the condition that  the battle plans were flawless, and the tactical techniques  promised every chance of success. There are no such chances,  there is a pitched battle, in which not everything shown in the  plan is precisely repeated.    The method of trial and error always entails great losses.  For every error in battle planning one must pay not the low  costs of an exercise, but human lives. Painstaking battle  planning in variants, based on profound foresight, a group of  prepared and practiced tactical techniques, and a readiness for  action in unexpected situations, these are what the pilot needs  first of all, when battle breaks out.  <H5>  Chapter VI. So As to Win in Battle </H5> <H5>  1. Fully Utilize the Capabilities of the Weapons </H5>   I shall begin with a fact which is well known to pilots. You  take off to intercept an air target. After receiving information  from the CP about its characteristic, height and distance, you  mull it over and seek out an appropriate variant of battle,  developed before the sortie and promising the greatest success,  you compare your capabilities with the capabilities of the  adversary. If your plane has greater speed, you will be able to  intercept the adversary more quickly, catch up with him or at  the most critical moment break away from pursuit; if your  maneuver characteristics are better, you can more effectively  conduct the maneuver battle; if your weapons are better, you can  hit the target more accurately, and from farther away.    This truth today requires serious augmentation. The fact is  that it is not all that easy to completely utilize the high  potential capabilities of present-day aviation equipment. In  flying a high-speed aircraft, one cannot go beyond the limits of  the existing limitations. But if a pilot wants to go beyond  these limits, he does so in modes which are close to critical  and cannot execute an energetic maneuver for attack or evasion  of a strike. At such moments he must fight not with the enemy,  but with his aircraft. The fear of violating safety measures  forces the pilots to pay more attention to maintaining various  flight modes, and limits the maneuver capabilities of the  fighters. The zones where he is allowed to launch missiles are  strictly regulated, so working with the sight, and tracking  while observing the set launch parameters, demand a great deal  of attention. In the past the high effectiveness of utilization  of airborne machineguns and cannon was achieved by firing at  maximally short range. Today the spectrum of firing distances is  quite wide, and such an approach is completely inapplicable to  missile launches.    Consequently, however surprising and remarkable the  capabilities that fighters may posses, they may remain unused  under difficult battle conditions. This is why the attainment of  maximal effectiveness, i.e., complete use of the capabilities of  aviation equipment, has today become an independent and no less  complex problem than that of the development of new models.    For example, at your disposal you have various types of  missiles, and a cannon, and you have to use this mighty armament  in a group, and differently in different battle situations.    First of all, you have to correctly choose the moment of the  start of utilization and the transition from one type of weapon  to another. It is determined by the direction of attack, the  speed of closure with the adversary, the distance to him, and  the expected countermeasures.    Second, it is necessary to create the most favorable  conditions for the use of the selected weapons. Thus for missile  launch at a given hemisphere of a maneuvering target, the  fighter must as a rule be in the range of missile fire. When  firing with the cannon, it is better to be on the inside of the  enemy maneuver.    Third, one should select the sight in a timely manner  (radar,  optical) for the developing battle conditions.    Fourth, it is necessary to precisely determine the optimal  ranges and the moments of missile launch and fire with the  cannon, which will depend on the target aspect, nature of its  maneuver, and other conditions of the attack.    From even a simple enumeration of pilot actions, it is clear  that you have to know a lot, and be capable of much in order to  fully utilize the capabilities of your weapons for a surprise  and swift attack on the adversary, who in turn will undertake  everything in order to destroy the fighter or evade a strike.    Of course the pilots of all generations wanted to fully  utilize the capabilities of their weapons, but they went about  it in different ways. It is interesting to have a look at how  this was done in the past, and how it is done today.    On 12 April 1943, in the skies over Kuban, squadron  commander  A. Pokryshkin (later on a Marshal of Aviation, a triple hero of  the Soviet Union), who was with his squadron in its alert zone,  was radioed from the command post the mission of intercepting a  group of enemy planes. In order to increase the power-to-weight  ratio of their fighters, the pilots while still in expectation  of battle, had flown in the zone by the "rocking cradle" or  "swinging watch" method: altitude, swift descent over a given  region, making it possible to develop high speed, and high speed  allowing a rapid gain to the necessary altitude to deliver  surprise strikes on the adversary. In addition the battle  formation of the squadron was vertically separated with 200-300  m between pairs and 600-800 m between wings. Therefore, at the  moment that the intercept mission was received, the squadron had  an undoubted advantage in power-to-weight ratio over the  adversary, although the tactical performance characteristics of  the planes of the sides were roughly equal. In this battle the  enemy did not number more than eight planes, and our fighters  had no losses. The success of the battle was determined not so  much by personal bravery as by the ability of the commander and  pilots to ably utilize the capabilities of their weapons. Here  the famous Pokryshkin motto, suitable for any battle, was fully  evident: "altitude - speed - maneuver - fire," which clearly  substantiated the close connection of all elements, determining  the degree of realization of the weapon capabilities.    Almost a half century later, pilot first class Captain  Tsibin  took off to intercept an air target, a radio-controlled target.  We will compare these two episodes, separated by such a  significant interval of time. One occurred at war, the other in  the course of tactical flight training. What do they have in  common? After all, Tsibin's fighter was far more sophisticated  than the fighters from the war years. But upon comparing the  episodes, we see that as in a mirror they reflect one and the  same ability of the pilots to fully utilize the capabilities of  their weapons.    The radio-controlled target was still lurking far off  somewhere, when Capt. Tsibin received the first commands from  the CP: bearing, altitude, weather in the region of action was  bad. Lower edge of clouds was 300 m, haze, and the target was  protected by jamming, was maneuvering to foil interception on  this overcast day. For the target, what was bad visibility, what  was, as the pilot's say, a "million by a million," there was no  difference. It would cut turns at any G forces, as much as the  control surfaces would allow. The operator would not black out;  he was on the ground.    Tsibin clearly saw the importance and the complexity of  executing the mission, and allowed for the maneuver  characteristics of his own plane and the target. He knew that  whether or not the so-desired target return would appear on his  scope, against the jamming background, would depend on his  considered maneuver, on the correct handling of the sight. In  executing the commands sent to his plane from the CP, and not  taking his eyes from the sight scope, Tsibin concentrated his  attention on piloting the plane and seeking the target. The  "adversary" maneuvered energetically, never ceasing the jamming,  but the electronic ring shone with the numbers of the  provisional code. The distance to the target diminished swiftly.  In the course of several tens of seconds the pilot had to  perform numerous necessary actions with the controls of the  plane, the sight, and the weapons. Each movement was calculated  precisely. The engine rpm, maintenance of the target return on  the screen, all was aimed at executing a devastating attack.  Before his eyes the signal light flashed, indicating that the  pilot had entered the launch zone. Without taking his eyes from  the sight, he pushed the launch button, and the missile broke up  the thick gloom with the flame of an explosion. The target was  destroyed.    On the ground they asked Tsibin what he would have done if  the target was not destroyed by the missile strike. The pilot  answered that in that case he would have immediately switched  the armament system to cannon fire immediately after the launch,  and prepared it for battle. Like Burnozyan in the remote wartime  past, in this flight the officer demonstrated the ability to use  his weapons in difficult situations.    In those same live fires, one of the pilots was vectored to  the target at a difficult aspect angle (the CP crew erred) and  another had a defect in his sight (for reasons beyond his  control). It occurred to each that the developing situation gave  them the right to turn back, but they immediately rejected it:  what about accomplishing the mission? The pilots did not lose  their heads. Each demonstrated enviable speed of reaction,  correctly analyzed the developing situation, and successfully  attacked the assigned target. The first using an original  maneuver, the second by finding the cause of the failure and  using a different operating mode of the sight. Indisputably if  the pilots had not known the capabilities of their weapons well,  if they had not mastered them to perfection and were not  trained, they would not have been ready to perform under these  unexpected conditions.    There is no need to explain that the more difficult and  multifaceted the weapons, the greater the probability of  erroneous actions. If there is an inadequately trained pilot in  the fighter cockpit, his slightest error or incompetence becomes  immediately evident.    In those same live fires, after landing, a fighter taxied to  the fueling zone with his missiles unfired on their launchers.  Everyone wondered why the pilot had not fired. An unexpected  equipment failure, unsuccessful guidance from the CP? The  officer himself confirmed their doubts. Blaming the jamming, he  reported to the commander that he had detected the target a  little later than required, so that he had no time to aim. In  fact everyone understood that the officer did not have the  knowledge and skills to operate the sight under jamming  conditions.    But here is the interesting part. When I asked the pilot why  Captain Tsibin had downed a target under the same conditions, I  heard in response: "Just luck. The captain lucked out!"    But those who know Tsibin corrected the officer. Behind his  flight lay the faultless knowledge of his weapons, and long hard  work. Ultimately good luck is very discriminating, it gives its  preference only to the worthy. Most likely the officer himself  knew this, but he did not want to acknowledge his errors.    In his attack of the air target the young pilot developed  high speed, did not maintain the set parameters of missile  launch, and they went wide of the mark, another in flight acted  hastily, was nervous and forgot to turn on one of the weapons  switches, so that the launch did not occur at all. The cause was  one and the same: both were not adequately trained, both were  undone by inept actions with the controls and sight. How then  could they maximally utilize the capabilities of their weapons!    These errors are especially perceptible if it is not a lone  fighter going into battle, but a whole subunit. Do not think,  dear reader, that the combat capabilities of the group is the  arithmetic sum of the capabilities of the fighters making it up.  No, they are greater than this sum, to the extent that the  pilots, controlled by the uniform will of the leader, have  mastered the tactics of multiple-aircraft air-to-air battle, the  ability to build up their general capabilities with high  personal proficiency, and to artfully interact in battle.  Tactical and fire interaction in the group by far increases its  combat might and reduces the possibility of surprise attacks by  the adversary, even ruling it out if vigilance is high.    I have had occasion to hear the following remark by a young  pilot:    "What do I have to do as the wingman? You go to the left,  look to the right, go to the right, look to the left at the  leader. The main thing is not to lose him, not to break up the  battle formation, and follow the commands."    I would advise the pilot: look at yourself through the prism  of combat experience, read the memoirs. It shows there how  pilots died when they thought in just that happy-go-lucky  fashion. Of course you're not supposed to violate the battle  formation. Wartime experience shows that if the wingmen forgot  this and abandoned their leaders, got caught up in the chase for  individual enemy planes, and even downed them, they badly let  down their leaders, and often were themselves shot down.  Therefore the initiative and independence of the wingmen is to  some extent limited.    Let us ask ourselves: in the present-day air-to-air battle,  can one fully realize the capabilities of the group's weapons if  the wingmen only passively hold their places in the battle  formation, if their role does not go beyond the framework of  blind copying of the actions of the leader and his planes? No,  something else comes to the fore here: the capacity of each  pilot to masterfully attack the adversary at any moment at the  orders of his commander, to quickly and accurately follow the  instructions given to him, to be read to assume responsibility  for successful accomplishment of the whole mission. This  requires something else entirely: the ability to look at the  place occupied in the battle formation not only with one's own  eyes, but with the eyes of the leader, to understand one's role  in attainment of the ultimate result of battle. And then the  wingman will truly "get into" the actions of the group.  Narrowness of tactical thinking and lack of initiative will  never result in anything good.    Each successive generation of fighters acquires better and  better tactical performance characteristics, contains in itself  elements of fundamental scientific and technical innovation,  contains many undiscovered, still-hidden combat capabilities.  However there is a serious obstacle on the path to their combat  utilization: some characteristics and combat properties of the  fighters are already reaching a practical limit, determined not  by the qualities of the planes, but by the physical capabilities  of the pilots.    The new-generation fighters are characterized by G forces  which are much greater, and more importantly, have a longer  duration and higher rate of buildup. Even trained pilots can  withstand high G forces only for a short time, to the detriment  of observation of the situation in the course of battle. In  addition the growing angular velocities of maneuver result in an  overload of the pilot's vestibular apparatus, and he has a very  hard time controlling the spatial position of his aircraft  during prolonged maneuvering. And at low altitudes, the maximal  flight speed becomes higher than that at which it is still  possible to safely fly the aircraft and conduct visual  orientation in direct proximity to the ground.    The difficulties associated with the high of  high-performance  aircraft naturally are supplemented by the profusion of  instrumental data, the increase in the necessary operating speed  with the piloting and navigation apparatus, the aircraft control  systems and weapons. The capacity to find one's bearings in the  numerous dials, instruments and scopes, the attentiveness,  memory and other mental and physiological capacities of the  pilots also are approaching the limit of human capabilities. And  all this in a single-seat fighter, where the pilot is deprived  of the assistance of other crew members. He must observe the air  space and at the same time look at the instruments. Otherwise,  he might not notice when a small red light flashes in the  cockpit, indicating say the start of a fire in the engine. In  other words, with the expansion of equipment capabilities,  battle has become more work-intensive. In a shorter time, it is  necessary to perform more actions. This is when the  contradiction arises that "The aircraft is capable, the pilot is  not."    One cannot overlook this contradiction, or underestimate the  importance of the problem. How can one reflect about the full  utilization of the capabilities of equipment if they are greater  than the capabilities of the man? To resolve the problem by  improving the skills of known automatism, behind which lay long  training sessions, exhausting labor, maximum exertion of  strength and will? There is much being said now about the need  to resolve this problem. The parameters of the problem exist and  are susceptible to accounting, quite precise at that. Valuable  statistical material has been accumulated. Nonetheless, research  in this field has to this point not brought tangible results.    One can definitely say just one thing: the aircraft  designers, scientists, all of us have work to do here. Here  there is no way to manage without an understanding of how pilots  perceive and assimilate information, without a serious,  thoughtful approach to development of fundamentally new means of  reducing the loads on the human being in executing maneuvers,  and display devices to densify the data streams.    Aircraft designers strive to reduce to a minimum the harmful  influence of G forces on the pilot, to improve the readability  of the instruments, to reduce the number of switches. For  example, on the prospective American ATF fighter there will be  one tenth as many as on present-day fighters, and they will all  be located to the side and on the chair of the pilot. The chair  tilts to compensate for G forces, and the control stick is to  the side, not blocking the view of the instruments. The  designers want to ensure constant dosing of data in a volume  which is optimal for its assimilation by the pilots, to replace  apprising information with command information, which one need  not think about, but immediately execute (target selection,  method of attack, optimal maneuver). These functions are still  not carried out by those low-power airborne automatic control  systems which today are installed on planes. In addition they  are not always linked: the algorithms of one cannot be  understood by another.    The pilots understand the need to practice protective muscle  and respiratory anti-overload techniques, special training  sessions and self-monitoring of one's psycho-physiological  state, and react positively to the ideas of reducing the  instruments and switches in the cockpit, and to further  automation of control, but they want to reserve for themselves  the right of choice: when to fly in automatic mode, and when to  intervene in this mode, to shift to manual control of the  aircraft.    Have they paid attention to the width and the multiplicity  of  the problem? Let us try to analyze and note the ways of  resolving it. If we sketch a circuit of tactical and engineer  tasks flowing from our discussions, then in it one can  distinguish two basic trends in developing of the "airborne  brain" or onboard algorithms:    - control of the plane and weapons (let us call them the  combat algorithms);    - development and realization of decisions for the  air-to-air  battle (these algorithms would logically be called tactical).    The combat algorithms, providing the pilot with automated  piloting and navigation of the aircraft, optimizing maneuver,  control of the zones of surveillance of the sights at launch,  lockon of targets, aiming and other such actions, are a task of  today which is successfully resolved in fourth-generation  fighters.    Development of tactical algorithms is a new scientific  trend.  The issue is expert systems, allow the subunit commanders  purposeful perception of data displayed on board the aircraft  before and during battle for assessment of the situation and for  decision-making. The software may include identification and  grouping of air targets, selection of suitable maneuvers, battle  formations and weapons type, determination of the expected  results of attacks and other calculations. The commander is  shown the general situation, including the jamming situation,  some supplemental information, and is given recommendations  regarding distribution of detected targets among the pilots, and  tactical and fire interaction in the group, and then automated  command and control of the battle is implemented.    Clearly no one need be convinced of the advantages which  pilots and commanders will receive in the not so remote future  when these wonderful creations will come to life and acquire  real sense. There is a hope that even weakly trained pilots will  have increased changes of victory in battle. This is why,  without combat and tactical algorithms, without expert systems  one cannot conceive of the construction of fifth-generation  fighters. Preliminary studies, having to do with the feasibility  of their development, have been conducted for more than one year  now in different countries. There also exist quite realistic  developments of "smart weapons." Suffice to say that the  above-mentioned ATF fighter is supposed to have 20-30 expert  systems, 10-12 of them tactical.    However, in order to go from suppositions to reality, one  must also allow for another aspect. Today there are still no  developed views of the problem as a whole, doubts are expressed  concerning the tactical capabilities of its resolution, and  differences of opinion remain with regard to approaches toward  the practical significance of new algorithms.    But some military specialists may ask: Has not the role of  the "airborne brain" been exaggerated, is not all this just  another fashion, a theory not implemented in practice? To talk  of resolving the problem is tantamount to not seeing, or not  wanting to see the difficulties and obstacles which are still  insuperable, the expenditures for development which are played  down.    "The plane will become smarter than the pilot if these  algorithms are developed," other specialists object. "Is this  conceivable?"    The doubts are by no means indisputable. They have their own  logic. Difficulties and uncertainties cannot be ignored. What  does it mean to implement a tactical algorithm in practice? For  expert evaluations of target importance, selection of rational  tactical techniques, distribution of the fighter forces and many  other elements making up the command decision, it is necessary  to form a data bank regarding the adversary, friendly fighters  and their capabilities, to classify some number of models and  tactical situations (they were mentioned in the preceding  chapter), and do it separately for close-in and long-range  battle, and overcoming of enemy air defenses. And all this is a  complex of extremely difficult problems for whose accomplishment  it is impossible to propose universal reliable algorithms. But  then, development of such intricate algorithms is a special  topic, and I would like to return to today, to see the first  steps in this field.    Let us look at a fourth-generation fighter, for example the  Su-27. Just a few years ago hardly anyone could imagine that a  commander leading his subordinates into battle in this plane  would have an earlier unknown system for controlling them, that  on the basis of between-plane radio-telemechanical  communications, coming to him from wingmen would be concentrated  on the tactical situation scope of his plane, and that he could  transmit it to subordinates. You see, such an innovation gives  command and control the nature of an ordered target distribution  in group air-to-air combat.    It remains for us to express our opinion on the thesis that  the plane is "smarter" than the pilot. Is that the case? The  plane becomes not simply a weapon, but something different, an  advisor, an assistant of the pilot. Thus only in combination  with further improvement in piloting mastery and tactical  proficiency may one fully utilize its high combat capabilities  and realize the principle that "the plane can, and the pilot can  too."  <H5>  2. Stratagem Is Also a Weapon </H5>   Recently I had occasion to be an unwilling participant in  the  following dialogue between two young pilots.    "What do you say about stratagem? They say that it can  really  save a pilot in battle."    "They don't say it -- they used to say it."    "We need it, but why?"    "I think that our brother fighters in the Great Patriotic  War  had it better. No ground or airborne radars, the adversary in  full ignorance, and full scope for stratagem. I do not remember  where I read it, perhaps at military school, that our glorious  aces achieved victory by hiding in the sun, clouds, the dark  side of the horizon. And now what? Whatever you say, the time of  military stratagem is long past."    "What do you think? Our commanders says that stratagem is a  weapon of the pilot."    "No, you listen to me: we live in an era of radar and  electronics. Everything is different now. Judge for yourself, do  you think you can sneak up on an enemy, with his continuous  radar field? And the AWACS system? It will track each of your  maneuvers even at low altitude. So how would you employ a  stratagem?"    "I can't figure it out. So we have only straight-ahead,  artless maneuvers? The real air warrior must catch the enemy  unawares, force him to submit to a strike."    "Fine words, but what do they mean?"    "Well, for example, non-standard construction of battle  formations, non-standard maneuvers, speed of closure, perhaps  also...    "Hah! The adversary will discover your plane before you  begin  maneuvering, before you reach the area of possible attack. Do  you think you're dealing with a fool who won't notice, or who  will wait for your attack?    "You forget about jamming, electronic and fire suppression  of  enemy radars.    "You slipped up here too. Don't you understand, you  `tactical  giant' that no one will expend manpower and resources specially  for your stratagem."    "You're a `giant of absurdity' yourself, and your ridicule  isn't worth a damn."    Let us interrupt this protracted dialogue of the young  pilots, the skeptic and the optimist, which almost reached the  point of blows. Behind it is not so much youthful fervor as the  reflection of a serious problem. One can understand the skeptic,  who marshals quite convincing arguments to deny stratagem. To  some measure he unfortunately is correct, it is harder to  achieve it now. But did the optimists use all the arguments in  order to prove the reality of this "weapon" in the modern  battle? One need not wax sarcastic here.    So what are the capabilities and the field of application of  military stratagem in tactics? Can one, and if one can, then  how, confuse the adversary, how can one conceal one's true  intentions in those unfavorable conditions of which they spoke  in the dialogue? In order to respond to these questions and to  learn the secrets of military stratagem, there is nothing more  convincing or graphic than specific examples.    On one tactical air exercise, squadron commander Major S.  Grishalev received the mission of clearing the air space and  tying down the "enemy" fighters on duty in the zone. The  assessment of battle variants began. There were several, but the  commander rejected one after another. What was it that hampered  him from finding a suitable variant? He knew that the tactical  performance characteristics of the planes and the level of  training of the pilots of the opposing sides were about the  same. The difference lay elsewhere. The squadron had to perform  the mission over "enemy" territory, his ground radars monitored  the situation, while the friendly fighters were unable to obtain  target designation from the CP.    After weighing his own and the "enemy's" capabilities, the  commander concluded that the squadron's chances of beating or  even simply tying down the fighters in the zone for a long time  were minimal, and the losses might turn out to be quite heavy.  Here it was simply necessary to develop an unusual, daring, even  risky variant which would make it possible to confuse the  adversary and achieve success.    In order to confuse the adversary, there are two evident  variants: use of very low altitudes, and the jamming of enemy  radars. But for fighters these variants are not very suitable --  they do not select the flight altitude, which depends on the  alert altitude of the fighters of the "adversary," and they do  not have powerful EW apparatus. Here one can count only on other  tactical techniques.    After thinking it over to the extent that time permitted,  the  commander adopted a non-standard decision: to break up the  battle formation of the squadron, and separate a flight from it  which was to proceed at a much higher altitude than the main  group. Of course the squadron commander foresaw the puzzled  glances of his subordinates (instead of massing efforts of the  fighters for the decisive first attack, he, the commander for  some reason was dispersing them), but the results of  calculations, which the commander was convinced were correct,  favored the decision.    That is what happened. When the squadron reached the battle  region, the "adversary" did not notice the main group, since he  was occupied by the flight, which was earlier detected by his  radar, and about which he received target designation from his  CP. In performing the functions of a decoy element, the flight  did everything to be noticed. From the energetic offensive  maneuver which the "adversary" carried out, it became clear that  the commander's plan was realized and the battle unfolded in  accordance with it.    Acting deliberately, without camouflage and concealment, the  "decoys" were able to draw the "adversary" under the strike of  the main group and assured its covertness of closure and attack.  The effect exceeded all expectations. Tied down by these  actions, the commander of the attacked group did not have time  to get his bearings in time, and issue commands to the wingmen.  The battle formation and the tactical coordination in the group  was disrupted, and it was impossible to restore it in the course  of the battle.    The technique was risky (if the "adversary" had figured out  the plan of the fighters, they would have been destroyed in  detail) but it was effective under the conditions when it seemed  that even to think of covertness of action would have been naive.    After the exercise, the pilots of the opposing side blamed  everything on the CP crew, which had not noticed the assault  element, but they also did not hide the fact that they are not  confronted by stratagem all that often in their routine  training. They said they expected standard actions, and then,  all at once, there was another element. And the fighters did not  operate "by the rules," which also caused confusion. Well, it is  true that there is fertile ground for such arguments. Perhaps,  precisely because the skeptical pilot, with a persistence worthy  of a better application, convinced his comrade that stratagem  had died away?    Another example. An assault group of bombers, escorted by  fighters, had the mission of delivering a strike on an objective  which was of great importance. Successfully repelling the  attacks of the fighters of the defending side, it fought its way  stubbornly to the target. Then the commander directing the  actions of the fighters from the CP scrambled three separate  elements to intercept it. Two of them were weak in numbers, and,  not concealing their intentions, they created a threat of enemy  attack simultaneously from two directions, and drew the fighter  protection toward them. But the third, the main force, attacked  the bombers unhindered, and, using the confusion of the  "adversary," they delivered a devastating strike. Stratagem  again saved the pilots.    It remains for us to look at the place of stratagem in the  very critical situation of battle, when, it would appear, there  is nothing that can be done except witness one's defeat.    A fighter flight, according to the received mission, was  penetrating "enemy" territory. As in the first example, the  pilots realized that they were under direct surveillance of his  radar, and that they could not count on the help of their CP.  They were still conducting a search, the screens of the onboard  radar sights were still clear, and there were no returns on  them, when suddenly they heard in the earphones:    "I see a target. I am attacking!"    These familiar words were uttered not by the flight  commander  Captain I. Shaklin or by his subordinates. When the captain  heard them, he looked in his periscope and saw enemy fighters in  the aft hemisphere. Their tactical advantage appeared  indisputable, the defeat inevitable. In order to somehow evade  the strike, the flight began a turn at maximum G force, but the  fighters raced after them. Their leader resolutely constructed  the maneuver, and probably was already counting down the last  seconds before commencing fire.    Here it is, a moment when only something unexpected can foil  the attack. But what was to be done? In this critical situation,  in order to change the position of the sides, Shaklin decided to  try a stratagem. A brief command and all the pilots reduced  their G forces for several seconds. The adversary could have  engaged them without hindrance if he had foreseen the  possibility of such an illogical action. But he was already  convinced that the attacked planes would seek to escape from  their pursuers only through maximum G forces, and therefore,  without guessing Shaklin's plan, he put his foot in it, so to  speak. In contrast to the "adversary," the flight commander  controlled the situation and recalled that he had mere seconds  to seize the initiative. When the planes had gained the  necessary velocity reserve, he put the element into an energetic  turn. The picture of the battle changed sharply. Maneuver,  another maneuver... Now the rivals were on equal terms. The  stratagem succeeded, and the outcome of the battle was now a  matter of technique.    Let us now move on from individual episodes to broader  generalities. Despite all the variety of tactical situations,  let us try to formulate a general concept of "stratagem." It may  be understood as those actions of pilots and CP crews which  distract the attention of the adversary, create an incorrect  idea of the situation in him, and thus deprive him of the  opportunity to realize his plan and leads to the adoption of  erroneous or late decisions. Stratagem should be considered  successful if the adversary cannot guess it and take  countermeasures before the fighters attack him. The more unclear  and difficult the situation for the adversary, the longer the  action of military stratagem will last.    So what promoted the attainment of stratagem in the three  described episodes? I believe that the determining conditions of  success were in the tactical and piloting proficiency of the  commander and all the pilots. Much depended on how creatively  they were able to use unusual, surprise techniques, how they  were able to force their will on the adversary in performance of  tactical missions. But if we look into these three small  episodes, we can see that they mirror the basic components of  stratagem. Let us try to formulate them.    First of all, it is necessary to act the way that the  adversary least expects, i.e., to create situations for which he  is unprepared. To catch the adversary unprepared for retaliatory  actions means to force him to abandon earlier decisions and to  make new ones. Such decisions, adopted hurriedly, without  adequate calculation and soundness, will correspond less to the  changing situation and may lead the adversary to defeat. But  this requires one to play some sort of "surprise" on him, to use  a tactical technique which is capable of stunning the enemy, to  create a false idea of one's intentions, to confront him with  the need to react to our actions by the laws of logic known only  to us. Persistence, initiative, and even daring in combination  with able use of weapons and precise interaction within an  element and between elements will make it possible to muddle the  adversary's plan of battle and draw him into a trap.    Second, exceptional speed of action is required. A stratagem  retains its force until the surprised adversary figures out, if  he can, the plan of the fighters and begins to counter them. To  hit the enemy before he realizes he is being attacked means to  beat him to the punch in maneuver, to be the first one to  accelerate one's plane, to gain altitude or descend in order to  assure oneself the conditions for a surprise attack, to appear  unexpectedly in a convenient fire position and immediately use  one's weapons.    Third, a readiness to undertake risk is needed. A stratagem  is always associated with it, and he who knows how to take a  well-founded risk gains greater advantages in battle. When an  exceptionally hard and solitary chance will lead to victory, one  must resolve to take it.    Of course risk by its nature is not safe. While the need for  it is obvious in a military battle with a real enemy, in  training flights where the adversary is just hypothetical it is  very difficult to determine its acceptable limits. This is a  subtle matter. There is not, there cannot be, an instrument  which could objectively measure such limits, where stratagem  does not contradict the rules of flight safety.    It would seem that not so many intricacies must be allowed  for in order to learn stratagem. But stratagem is not impromptu,  although at times you can't get by without it. When I asked  Shaklin how he managed to react so quickly to a critical  situation, and so nimbly evade the strike, he got a large album  and mutely handed it to me. Paging through it, I saw carefully  devised variants of fighter battles, corroborated by the results  of modelling. Also in the album (albeit in general features) was  the variant by which the flight operated.    "Well fine," one reader might say. "So it is just a matter  of  thoroughly studying all components of stratagem ahead of time,  to stock up on its variants, and its attainment will be assured?"    "No," I respond. "It will not be assured, even if all  components are allowed for."    Judge for yourselves. A squadron was given the mission of  destroying an early-warning aircraft in the depth of the  adversary's territory. The pilots had already accomplished such  a mission in past tactical exercise. At that time, thanks to an  original combination of decoy actions with an encirclement  maneuver, they managed to disorient the adversary's fighter  protection and draw the early-warning plane into a trap. The  stratagem of the pilots, their surprise attack on the target,  were especially noted by a senior officer at the exercise  critique. But now, when the squadron again used its experience,  it fell into a trap itself. The "adversary" was on the alert.    This is why the above components may be considered only  general rules of stratagem. It must also be original. Ask any  pilot having in his reserve a very great number of tactical  techniques, does he have occasion to use the identical "traps"  in ready-made form. I am certain that you will receive a  negative answer. Do you think such a thing would be appropriate  in tactics, which by its nature does not brook cliche? Clearly  any tactical technique may quickly exhaust itself if it is used  repeatedly in accordance with an established scheme, which  sooner or later will be uncovered by the adversary.    Thus stratagem is a multifaceted concept, a less painful  path  to victory. Today it is used differently than in the past, when  the opposing sides did not have widespread radar detection  systems, but even today there are not and cannot be stereotypes,  for this would contradict the very essence of stratagem. One  must know how to vary different combinations of tactical  techniques in accordance with all the diversity of conditions.  <H5>  3. Do You Know How To Make Seconds Count? </H5>   A tactical flight exercise was under way. Many tens of  kilometers from the CP an event was under way in the sky which  called commitment of fighters to battle. The planes took off  pair after pair. The commander, following the scrambling of the  fighters with his watch, smiled: the pilots had exceeded the  standards. He did not imagine at that moment how soon he himself  and, even more so, his subordinates would require this quality,  the ability to make seconds count.    Some time later, when the commander glanced at the plotting  board, he immediately grew alarmed: one of the air targets  moving to one side, to which he had initially not paid  attention, had suddenly changed course and begun to approach an  important installation. From the rapid shifting of the target  return on the board, it was not hard to determine that it was  going at high speed. There was not a second to spare.    The commander was well aware that in the developing  situation  everything depended on speed of action. But how was he to gain  time, how could he beat the adversary to the objective? There  was no time left to scramble fighters from the airfield. In his  search for an acceptable solution, he again looked at the board.  A pair of fighters proceeding to intercept another pair, which  was still at a significant distance from the designated  perimeter, was the closest to the dangerous target. Assessing  the possibilities of intercept of this target by the other  fighters, and convinced of its feasibility, the commander  decided to retarget the pair at the new target. This decision  made itself, as it were, but behind it lay the hard thinking of  the commander, speed of calculation, recalculation of  perimeters, flight modes of the fighters, and precise control of  the fighters in the air.    The pair leader, receiving the new mission from the CP,  realized that lost seconds in the flight to the target would be  practically irretrievable. Thus the fighters had to reach the  attack line in an extremely short time, but this was not all. It  was possible to quickly detect the target, but not draw any  tactical advantage from this, if the position assumed in the  search and the battle formation of the pair did not allow  immediate closure. And in the lost seconds the adversary would  deliver a strike.    The leader decided to go for the target at maximum  permissible speed and with an increased interval between the  planes in the pair to attack the adversary even if the wingman  lagged behind. In this case the calculation was sound: it  allowed the possibility of accomplishing the attack by one of  the fighters in the shortest time, and also of building up  forces if the adversary were to maneuver.    Now the target was detected and identified, but its  objective  was also nearly at hand. The adversary, upon detecting the  fighters, began to maneuver energetically and put the pair  leader in a difficult situation. There followed an energetic  counter-maneuver of the wingman who was lagging somewhat behind,  precise aiming, and the target was destroyed when they were just  a few seconds from the objective. The attack was fast-moving,  and as the data of the flight recording equipment confirmed, it  was precise.    This is what it means to make seconds count. There is a good  reason why pilots joke that time is like air. When its there, no  one notices it, and when its not there, everybody suffocates.    There is no question, in situations characterized by an  urgent time shortage, it is not always easy to perform. There  are times when the very best decision may prove useless, when it  is made late, and the most clever tactical techniques will not  bring success if they are made too late. But it goes without  saying that a time limitation cannot serve as justification for  tardy actions and miscalculations in battle. If a commander is  tardy in assessing the situation, is slow in issuing the battle  order, if the pilots are late in scrambling or display a lack of  resolve upon detecting the target, the result is the same: a  well thought-out battle may end in failure.    The time element has always played a role in tactics, and  fighters also were confronted with time shortages back in the  Great Patriotic War. The success went to those who valued and  knew how to use time.    At Kursk, this was 12 July 1943, a squadron of Yak-9s was  protecting our troops. Eighteen fascist Heinkel-111 bombers  appeared very high above the fighters, and even higher a group  of Messerschmidts covering them. Neither the correlation of  forces nor the relative disposition of friendly and enemy planes  favored joining battle. What was to be done? The squadron  commander decided to attack the bombers, not straight on, but  first to gain altitude, get a little closer, assume a tactically  favorable position for battle, and hit the adversary when he was  more certain of success. Well, of course, this decision was well  founded. But the commander lost sight of one important  circumstance: the bombers were already approaching our forward  edge, and he could not know what terrible danger their bombs  posed to our troops. To gain altitude and execute a protracted  maneuver meant to lose time, during which the irretrievable  could occur: the enemy would have time to deliver a strike  before the fighters attacked him.    Major F. Gnezdilov took another way. That same day he found  himself in a similar, but more complex, situation. He was  leading eight Yaks which encountered 36 Heinkels, also protected  by fighters. Of course, all of the pilots expected to meet the  adversary, but none expected such a large group. However the  commander well knew the value of time: the most important thing  was not to allow the fighters to drop their bombs on the  protected troops. He headed one flight right at the enemy  fighters, and the other at his command went into a steep dive,  and using their great velocity reserve, broke swiftly into the  battle formation of the bombers. Crimson tongs of flame and  tails of brown smoke immediately extended behind three planes.  While the enemy in confusion tried to figure out what was  happening, the Yaks leapt through the Heinkel formation and  again attacked them, now head to head. Again two enemy planes  began to smoke. And then the battle formation of the enormous  armada fell apart. The fascists dropped their load hastily,  wherever it might land, and hastened to retreat.    I am taking a long time to speak of these precious seconds,  but there, in the air battles, they were much shorter. The error  of the commander who does not know the value of time is  unforgivable, and all praise goes to the bold but calculating  decisions which do not allow delays which the adversary might  use.    But let us return to today. Imagine for a minute that you  are  in the cockpit of a MiG-26 fighter, and are leading a group to  air-to-air combat, and hunched over your sight you await the  appearance of a target. Now say, how much time will you have to  make a battle decision, once you detect a target, in comparison  with the past?    In seeking an answer to this question, you will think of the  high speeds and rate of climb of your fighters, and of course  will not forget the suspended all-aspect missiles which do not  require long closure with the adversary and which can destroy  him at long distance.    The easiest answer: the time to make a decision has  decreased  immeasurably. Who can deny it? But can one measure this  "immeasurable time"?    But then, judge yourself, let us count the seconds, which  sometimes are more eloquent than words. Let us estimate the  approximate distribution of time for all actions of pilots of  average proficiency after detection of the adversary (fig. 39).  It is clear from the figure that the total time which the  fighters have before missile launch is around 50-60 seconds. But  what time remains to the element commander to make a decision  (tp, ts, and tr)? I believe that the meaning of this requires no  comment. This time can scarcely be increased, as it is  impossible to restrict the speed of the attack.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-76A>      Figure 39. Time characteristics of attack on a headon course. </FIG>    Probably this interpretation will not suit many. That may be  the case, the experienced reader will argue, but why look at the  work of the commander only in the most difficult conditions,  when closing with an adversary head-to-head? Let us take such  doubts seriously, and now analyze the time characteristics of  command functions under other conditions.    At first glance everything is much easier. Let us assume  that  a flight commander, vectored by the control center to the rear  hemisphere of the target, sees a group of eight aircraft ahead  of him. Upon detecting our fighters, it executes an unexpected  maneuver (fig. 40, I). Assuming that the tactical performance  characteristics of the planes of the opposing sides are equal in  the majority of components, let us analyze the distribution of  time expenditures in this case.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-77A>      Figure 40. Capabilities of executing the decision of a flight commander in terms of time pair, must push the button of the transmitter and say a </FIG>     Here the tactics are obvious. In the prevailing situation,  the flight must either attack one of the separating groups with  the entire complement, or, more favorably, both groups with  pairs, despite the numerical advantage of the adversary (fig.  40, II). Then both groups would be tied down in battle, and the  initiative would be with our fighters.    Let us return to dry but objective figures. After making the  battle decision in the same time as in the preceding example,  the flight commander, in order to transmit his command to the  other pair, must push the button of the transmitter and say a  minimum of five or six words ("Attack left element, right target  is yours.") -- four or five seconds. How much time is then  required of the leader of the second pair in order to understand  the command and begin the maneuver? By the most modest  calculations, 10-12 seconds will be expended. In this time the  adversary will turn to meet the fighters or go beyond the limits  of visibility.    We are limiting ourselves to a small fragment of the battle  in order to demonstrate all the complexity of fighting for every  second. How many such consecutive fragments confront the  commander with the threat of a negative balance of time! This  very important conclusion, at first glance even paradoxical, is  completely legitimate. The significance, effectiveness and  practical feasibility of tactical techniques are more and more  determined by the time factor, and this must not be  underestimated. One must deal with reality, and it is truly  worth thinking about and, after thinking, seeking the paths of  further tactical development.    However, the ability to make seconds count in an air battle  is only one of the aspects of the time factor. Another no less  important is the struggle for seconds in the organization of the  fighter sortie and their commitment to battle.    Here radar subunits have detected the adversary in the air.  The first routes of the air targets have appeared on the  plotting boards of the CP, and the competition to win time has  begun between the opposing sides. Who then will win? This  estimate can be made if one compares the flight time of the  adversary (Tf), the time he takes to fly to the point of  engagement of the fighters (RVB) with the time spent on  commitment (Tvv). It goes without saying that the time spent on  the commitment to battle must be less or at last equal to the  flight time of the adversary. This condition (fig. 41) may be  formulated in the form of the following expression:    Tvv less than Tf    The flight time of the adversary has a special meaning.  Essentially it is the time resource which the adversary "gives"  to the fighters to repel the raid. In order to calculate the  flight time, one must know the range of detection of the  adversary by ground radars, or by airborne early warning  complexes at various altitudes, and their location relative to  the point of engagement d. The obtained distance between  the perimeters of detection and commitment of the fighters,  divided by the speed of the adversary, gives his flight time  (fig. 41).   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-78A>      Figure 41. Conditions for timely commitment of fighters to battle, </FIG>     Another reader might think that the flight time does not  depend on our actions. The adversary himself will chose the  appropriate altitudes and flight speeds for himself, and the  location of the radars is determined by the senior officer. This  is not so. The flight time may be increased, especially under  conditions of a difficult jamming situation, by using the  information of all types of reconnaissance capable of detecting  the scrambling of enemy aviation from their airfields and  tracking their flight until entry into the radar zones, and also  by speeding up the receipt and display of data regarding the air  situation.    Let us track the route of information about the adversary  from his detection until the commander's reaction to it. The  main suppliers of information about the air situation remain for  the present the radar subunits, which transmit it to the higher  CP, where data are synthesized and systematized, and then go to  the CPs of the aviation units. It would seem that everything is  smooth and simple, by how much time do these manipulations  require? In this time the adversary will have time to cover many  tens of kilometers. Information from the higher CP lags  constantly. If the commander wants to increase the flight time  of the adversary, he must try to obtain fresher data from the  radar subunit with which he is directly coordinating, and to  involve the fighters themselves, performing missions over enemy  territory, in reconnaissance of air targets.    Now let us turn to the second component of the above  inequality -- the time required for commitment of fighters to  battle (Tvv). As is clear from figure 41, this time consists of  the time spent by the commander to adopt a decision (tr),  transmit the command to the fighters for sortie (tk), their  preparation (tp), takeoff (tt) and assembly in battle formation  (ts), fight to the attack line (tb) and for maneuver for the  start of battle (tm). The sum of the indicated times is the  total time (Tvv). Of course a negative difference between them  and the flight time of the adversary, as in the air-to-air  battle, is unacceptable. There are many ways of shortening the  time of commitment of the fighters to battle. All categories of  personnel participate in seeking and implementing these ways.    Let us begin with the commander. He must make the battle  decision. Whether this decision is formulated in written form  with all specifics, or is concentrated in just a few phrases, it  is always made in accordance with a specific algorithm. Let us  again examine that familiar chain of actions which the  commander's thought runs through: clarification of the mission,  estimation of the situation, the decision, formulation of the  decision, assignment of tasks to subordinates... The commander  is completely familiar with the working procedures of this  logical algorithm. So why would he go slow in searching for a  rational decision, even when he knows the negative consequences  of tardiness? Let us try to enter into his position. A great  volume of data, and non-specificity of the situation,  multiplicity of alternative situations and variants of battle,  and along with this an urgent time shortage, which does not fit  into the customary framework of the recent past, these are the  reasons. Much has been written about this, so there is no need  to repeat it. In battle there should not be any long-winded  instructions, verbose reports, or a profusion of eloquent  documents.    And if the time shortage is so urgent that there is no time  at all for clarification of the mission, estimate of the  situation, and other components of the process of developing the  decision, what then? That also happens. Events in the air  develop more and more quickly and unexpectedly. Therefore it is  often necessary to run a risk, relying only on one's personal  experience and foresight. The commander must react  instantaneously to suddenly arising threats. It seems to me that  under such conditions one must change the program of  decision-making and that a more flexible algorithm, developed on  the principle of "If I do not know what to do, then I will do  this..." would not be out of place.    Sure, a "daring" decision made by such an algorithm will be  risky, and not entirely correct under the conditions of the  specific situation, but that is better than a late decision  which cannot be implemented at all, or simple passive waiting  for the outcome. An algorithm for such situations may be the  most simple, and then subsequently with clarification of the  situation can always be modified.    In corroboration of this, I will site one instructive  example. The adversary managed to organize a raid on an airfield  where fighters were based in such a way that the commander  learned too late of their approach. The advantages of the  attacker are well known. He has the initiative in the choice of  method and time of delivery of the strike, in order to put the  defenders in an unfavorable position. What was to be done.  Perhaps, proceeding from the strict logic of the "classical"  algorithm, to make a sound decision to repel the raid? But the  threat of the strike was too evident, and the commander  immediately issued the command to scramble the alert subunit to  protect the airfield. What did he hope for in making this  unconsidered decision? Of course, the takeoff of such small  forces did not allow him to prevent the strike, but the  commander assumed that just their presence in the region of the  airfield would lower the effectiveness of the strike and give  additional time to clarify the decision. And that is what  happened. The duty subunit immediately after takeoff attacked  the first element of enemy planes already appearing over the  airfield, which did not have the strength to hinder the  beginning scramble of the main forces. Under its protection the  fighters took off pair by pair and immediately joined battle.  And the strike on the airfield did not take place after all.    Strictly speaking, it would be incorrect to call the  commander's decision unconsidered. An estimate of the situation,  albeit very brief, had preceded it. Of course the officer  reckoned that the time was clearly inadequate to scramble all  forces to evade the strike, and he allowed for the fact that it  was also not advisable to wait out the strike on the airfield,  because the fighters at this time were not in their shelters.  However his decision was based solely on personal experience. He  understood also that the takeoff of the duty subunit to meet the  adversary was associated with a well-known risk, taking off  under fire.    Thus what conclusion can be drawn from this episode? That  this was the victory of experience and foresight over the  traditional algorithm. Perhaps the considered algorithm is not  indisputable. After all they say with good reasons that truth is  born in controversy and experience. Arguments and discussions  occur in order that different opinions be expressed, and so that  the reader may draw his own conclusions and look for the truth.    Now let us turn the conversion from the intellectual sphere,  so to speak, to the material sphere -- preparation for combat  flight of the aircraft and armament. The significant time  expenditures in this sphere, which restrain the timely  commitment of the fighters to battle, are no secret to anyone.  Complicated aviation complexes, which require strict and  punctual accomplishment of many operations of maintenance and  work in accordance with rigid schedules, have still not fully  stimulated a reduction in the turn-around times of fighters.  Much time is needed to find the causes of failures, and correct  various defects. And this is done under conditions when the  slightest omission in preparation of the planes and the  equipment mounted on them, which are based on electronics, may  be catastrophic in battle.    One is somewhat reassured, and some hopes are raised, by the  technical ways of satisfying the requirements of tactics for  minimal volume and minimal time of technical maintenance (they  were mentioned in chapter II), but again, seconds are growing  "shorter and shorter." And this means that such well known  requirements as constant maintenance of the aviation equipment  in excellent condition, a high level of proficiency and personal  responsibility of each specialist maintaining the equipment and  arms, team-work in the actions of all the engineer and technical  staff, and high technical culture remain in force, and continue  to retain their importance.    The fight for time also makes a vital impression on the  actions of flight personnel. I will not tire the reader with a  recitation of the whole group of well-known measures which speed  up the processes of fighter sorties, beginning with engine start  and taxiing to the takeoff points. However situations which  arise here at times give grounds for gloomy thoughts. Once  during a training alert I watched a plane taxi out onto the  runway, guided by a young pilot. This time he performed in  terrible haste, forgetting safety measures. He exceeded the taxi  speed and made some sharp turns, causing a breakdown on the  plane. He had to return to the parking area. Does one have to  prove that hastiness of pilots in reports, their distortion in  comparison with the established form, may lead to repeated  questions from the CP, and even to incorrect commands if these  reports are misunderstood? Many "excess" seconds are spent in  correcting errors.    Haste and bustle, in which the probability of errors and  blunders grows, are poor assistants to the pilots. This would  seem to be an evident truth, but can one believe that everything  is clear here? Look at another commander, who in training  sessions is interested first of all in reducing the times of  working operations of pilots with cockpit equipment, and you  will see that speed of action proliferates into haste, into  numerous errors. How to more quickly prepare for a sortie, to  take off with minimal acceptable intervals between pairs, to  reach the point of engagement at maximum possible speed, all  these are untapped reserves of time, so necessary in battle, and  open for discovery. The old tested method of "trial and error"  is inappropriate here -- there is too little time for "trials,"  and the "errors" might prove too costly. How important, in the  struggle for time, is the ability of the commander himself to  make precious seconds count, to make rapid and correct decisions  in difficult, critical situations! But speed of actions is good  when it is precisely measured.    Thus the struggle of time indisputably rules out all haste,  not speed and alacrity. These are precisely the necessary  qualities, while haste is the absence of patience and  self-control, which is a kind of laziness of thought, prompting  one to quit the heavy work of assessing the situation when the  possibility of decision-making is just taking shape, to speed up  one action or another without need. Remember the familiar saying  "make haste slowly" and consider whether we sometimes try to  save seconds too easily or too arbitrarily.    Look at how you, the reader, would make decisions at the CP  or in a training battle. Seconds lost in the estimate of the  situation, in hearing the reports of specialists, the long  seconds of pondering under the conditions of high-speed  attacks... Think of the ultimate result of all this, and what  advantages could be acquired if one truly learns to make seconds  count.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   The aspects of the air-to-air battle are multifaceted, and  not all of them have been reflected here even briefly. In any  battle, in order to achieve victory and avoid defeat in  unfavorable situations, pilots must know how to use every  capability of their weapons, how to outsmart the enemy, and to  use time economically. However victory in battle goes not only  to the pilots who personally attack the enemy, but also to those  who direct the battle. Of course their participation is less  noticeable, their contribution to victory less visible, and at  times they are mentioned just in passing, but the demands put on  them are no less, and first of all on the commander of the CP  crew.  <H5>  Chapter VII. How to Conduct Tactical Command and Control </H5> <H5>  1. Knowledge and Capabilities Required of the Commander </H5>   What are the activities of the commander at the CP? In order  to respond to that, perhaps naive, question we transport  ourselves mentally to the command post at, what is for us, the  most interesting moment in the warding off of an "enemy" raid.  The room is in semi-darkness. The weak light of the signal  boards and indicators illuminates the shelves and tables holding  the equipment and the concentrated faces of the specialists of  the CP detail. Our glance lingers on the large vertical plotting  board where the air conditions are depicted.    The work of the CP team appears very humdrum when viewed by  an outsider. The CP receives continuous information concerning  the situation in the air from the forward radar posts and from  other sources. Here this information is processed and analyzed  and from here the fighters in the air receive guidance. Those  monitoring the plotting boards and those operating the equipment  tirelessly track the air targets and their fighters. Here radio  operators are providing uninterrupted communications. Officers  directing the combat, riveted to their instruments, guide the  fighters onto the targets, give the necessary commands to bring  the aircraft into a tactically advantageous position as combat  is initiated, render assistance in maintaining battle order,  support tactical cooperation and flight safety. Behind  sound-proof glass the officers, who maintain constant  communications with the cooperating units supporting the  subunits, transmit and receive the necessary information.    Periodically the commander looks at the vertical plotting  board and its indicator, listens to the specialists' reports;  from time to time he talks on the telephone, gives brief  instructions over the loud speaker and even briefer instructions  over the radio: "9-49, attack target!". To an outsider it would  seem that the commander is not working as hard as the others.  However, that is not the case. The CP team has no superfluous  jobs, and the commander's job is particularly important.    One is reminded of the days gone by on the front. There were  all kinds of commanders back then. There were those who "fought"  primarily at the command post and with signal flags in their  hands on the airfield. They themselves did not fly combat  missions, had no understanding of how their pilots fought,  didn't know how to conduct themselves in an air battle, didn't  know who was worth something and who could be trusted with what.  Must one be reminded of the irrefutable advantage a commander  obtains when he instructs and trains his own pilots, acting as a  role model. "Example is stronger than rules," "knowledge  teaches, example attracts," "a good example is better than  advice" -- these are popular old sayings. The wisdom of such  sayings is obvious. Nothing inspires one to great deeds, nothing  persuades one like the example of a commander. Therefore, if a  commander wants to have capable air fighters, he himself leads  them into battle.    However, at the same time we must not forget that the  commander is, above all, a tactician, a combat organizer, who  spends the greater part of his time at the CP where he has a  better perspective on the situation than the pilot in the air  now that radar information has become more accurate and more  timely than in the not-too-distant past.    Of course, the nature of management has also changed. Under  the influence of new aircraft technology and armaments, the  processes and functions of management have been accelerated, and  while their form has not changed, they have acquired a new  quality. They have become more complex. It is generally known  that without a commander no decisions are made, the technology  is useless, and the people don't work. But I can't help but  mention something else. In his head the commander holds a vast  array of instructions, numerical data, and other information  necessary for combat management. However, no matter how great  the resources of human memory may be, they are, nevertheless,  limited. If these resources are used recklessly, then, for all  the effort, not only will you not achieve the necessary effect,  but the result will be negative.    I am reminded of one such incident. Lieutenant colonel N.  arrived at one of the aviation units from the Air Force Academy  after completing his studies. He worked hard mastering his  duties as commander. Superiors and colleagues who had spoken  with him remarked that the officer was exceedingly well-versed  in many spheres of operational-tactical and military technical  knowledge. But then during one of the exercises a critical  situation developed and it required that command and control of  the fighters be transferred quickly to another CP. In order to  do this the lieutenant colonel should have sent the tactical  command and control officer the necessary information. And then  it became clear that this man, who had appeared so  comprehensively trained, didn't remember the very thing that he  should have known by heart: the actual data concerning the  capabilities of the fighters and of their command and control  means. Afterwards, the officer lamented: "It was some kind of a  delusion, they say -- I knew everything, and then when I needed  it, I forgot it." Of course, it wasn't a matter of delusion. The  man simply lost his head in the flood of information which came  pouring down on him, and he forgot the most important thing he  needed to know in the actual situation.    What knowledge and capabilities then should the commander at  the CP possess? This question must be answered in the most  specific terms of the commander's activities. When making  decisions, the commander usually listens to his aides and  specialists, and, if time allows, he might consult his  instructions, reference books, or various text books; often it  is simply necessary to do more than that. The commander's head  is not like the memory unit of a computer. Therefore, the  ability to quickly work with a number of documents, to find the  necessary information and answers to the questions put to him  are as essential to the commander as the information which he  should know by heart.    A more complicated matter giving rise to a mass of  contradictory opinions is that concerning what volume of  essential information the commander should possess. Should he  know the enemy? "What a question!", exclaims the reader, "It is  even clear to a civilian that without knowledge of the enemy you  can't entertain the thought of conducting battle with him." Yes,  any commander should know the enemy, but to what degree, within  what limits? Obviously it is not as important for the commander  to keep in mind the composition and disposition of the aviation  in the theater of operations, but it is vitally important to  remember and to thoroughly know the combat capabilities of the  various groups of enemy aircraft and the enemy's tactical ruses,  because otherwise it is not possible to make decisions and  revise them in the course of battle.    But to what degree is it necessary to be familiar with the  command and control means? The commander now has many  complicated and precise combat control levers concentrated in  his hands. At his disposal are powerful means of communication,  ground radar stations, the range of which is greater than the  fighters' onboard sighting devices, automated systems and other  very new electronic innovations. Obviously, the high degree of  effectiveness of all this equipment at the commander's disposal  depends on the reality of whether he has a perfect command of  them.    Sometimes they say, referring to one commander or another:  He  knows the control means "down to the nuts and bolts." This  testimonial is, without a doubt, flattering. However, is such a  degree of knowledge required today? It appears that along with  the usual professional knowledge, gaining more and more  importance today is that knowledge which embraces the general  principles of the control systems, their functional  interdependence and capabilities under the actual conditions of  the situation. In other words, the commander should have an  irreproachable knowledge of what tasks can be carried out by the  command and control means, what they will deliver to the  commander, what estimates, how fast, and with what degree of  reliability they can be performed, what variations of their  usage in what tactical situations, when there are partial  damages, and how much time is required to correct them. At the  same time, it doesn't seem so bad if the commander isn't capable  of performing calculations for an interception like a navigator,  but he needs to assimilate the navigator's general principles in  order that he avoid giving orders back to his command and  control officers which he knows cannot be fulfilled and in order  that he intelligently conduct tactical command and control.    And still, tactical mastery, i.e., the ability to conduct  tactical command and control, seems to be the finishing touch to  a commander's professionalism. Possessing a high degree of  personal training, he should concentrate his managerial work on  implementing plans, creating the most favorable conditions  possible for those subordinate to the commanders and for the  pilots to fulfill their assigned combat missions.    In the past few years much has changed in the activities of  the commander at the CP. The technical command and control means  -- "the commander's tactical aids" reflect the situation more  completely and swiftly, automatize necessary calculations, but  more and more often without warning they burst into the CP  making management of the conditions more complicated. At the  most inappropriate moment radio communications with the fighters  which have just taken off are interrupted by the enemy, the  screens are filled with interference, it becomes more and more  difficult to identify the target blips. Here the commander has  to manage under conditions where there is not enough  information. But this means that he should be able to imagine  the development of the air conditions and the position of his  own aircraft in relation to those of the enemy not only based on  the representations of the plotting board and the indicators,  but also based on the results of calculations, the pilots'  messages, and information arriving from other sources. He must  know the possible ranges of changes in speed employed by the  fighters in executing maneuvers; he must take into consideration  the functional condition of the pilots, their degree of combat  fatigue, and, finally, he must be able to imbue them with  confidence and decisiveness, and to guarantee flight safety.    You can make list after list of everything that a commander  should know, be capable of, and take into consideration when  conducting tactical command and control. For example, the  position of the sun and of cumulus clouds when the fighters are  committing to combat. These sources of powerful thermal  radiation, if they are not taken into consideration, will  undoubtedly have an adverse impact on the effectiveness of the  attack when the pilot launches heat-seeking missiles. But it  would be irrational and illogical for the commander to strive to  make all the decisions for his pilots, to substitute petty  guardianship for their decisions by constantly meddling in their  actions. Such a style of leadership, giving rise to a surplus of  energy and self-importance, not only infringes on the  subordinates' right to initiative, but spares them their  responsibilities.    What, then, is the upshot of these discussions? The range of  knowledge and skills required of a CP commander is unusually  broad. In addition, as they say in the manual, he is the  immediate organizer of combat and political training, he is  responsible for combat readiness, discipline, and the  moral-political state of the personnel. Much strength and energy  is required of the commander to carry out his daily activities  of training and instructing his subordinates and managing his  administrative and support affairs. There are many other facets  in the "chief - subordinate" sub-system which is an integral  part of any military system. All of this must be supported,  merged, and kept under control in the proper manner. But from  this point it follows that for the time being the CP commander  should be spared unessential information, as we mentioned  earlier, and he should be given the opportunity to assimilate  precisely that knowledge and those skills that he will really  need. One should never forget that when determining the final  aims of commander training. Heterogeneous knowledge and skills  (administrative, navigational, engineering) should give way to  tactical interpretation applicable to the actual command and  control functions of a commander.    Finally, there is one more group of circumstances without  which there would be no commander. More than anyone else, the  commander, if you will, must possess confidence, self-control,  and a sense of responsibility for his decisions and actions.  Every thought invested with the commander's great power and  formed into a laconic combat order is very crucial because it  brings many people and combat equipment into action. And if the  commander is indecisive, isn't he incapable of taking the entire  responsibility for fulfilling the combat mission?    It doesn't make sense to divide the responsibility, bit by  bit, among everyone. In the final analysis the result would be  that nobody would actually carry the responsibility. One  commander foreseeing an "enemy" raid makes the decision to put  fighters into the air in advance and does so, while another  commander waits to see how the neighboring command post will act  and waits for instructions from higher up. As a result the first  takes full advantage of the opportunity to intercept the "enemy"  on distant borders, while the second commander has significantly  less opportunity to achieve this even though the aircraft in  both cases are exactly the same.    And so, what does the commander do at the CP? Guided by the  pre-planned scenarios and the training of the members of the CP  team, he manages battle. Together with his team the commander  tries to figure out the "enemy's" intentions; he sends up  fighters and brings them to the point of engagement. It is  difficult for the pilots themselves, and not always possible for  them to determine a tactically advantageous position for  attacking targets, to independently execute a maneuver when  drawing close to the enemy, to take countermeasures in the face  of the "enemy's" reciprocal attacks, to continuously observe the  actions of their comrades in battle. Therefore, using the local  and weather conditions, the commander and his aids secretively  bring the fighters to the "enemy," help them to forestall the  enemy through their actions, and to confuse the enemy as to  their intentions, prompt them as to what maneuver they should  use to initiate combat, from what direction they should expect  an enemy attack, how to escape a strike, and thereby create  favorable conditions for setting up for an engagement.    But then the group leaders report to the command post: "I  see  the target, I'm attacking." The battle has begun. The commander  knows that if the battle disintegrates into uncoordinated  dogfights of the fighters with the "enemy," it will hardly be  possible to achieve great results. Therefore, when executing  command and control he strives to create an advantageous  correlation of forces, to coordinate reciprocal actions between  the groups of different tactical designations according to time  and location, and to concentrate their efforts on the most  dangerous targets.    How does the commander do this? Don't look for stereotypical  answers. He can, for example, in order to destroy the primary  targets, direct several groups from different directions, he can  begin with an engagement of the "enemy's" combined fighter  cover, or he can also carry out a variation by employing  missiles of various ranges. There are a multitude of other  solutions, but in each case from the outset the commander must  be able to locate the most dangerous targets in the "enemy's"  complex tactical order of battle -- the strike forces,  remembering to observe the rules of safety in flight.    In group combat the situation can change and become  complicated very rapidly. Here the mixing of your own and enemy  aircraft, and the cropping up of new points of engagement and  the formation of heavily jammed sectors, which cannot be seen  from the CP. If you can imagine that all of this is going on  simultaneously (the situation is not all that improbable), it is  not difficult to understand how important it is for the  commander to know how to use the complex of ground means and the  reports of the pilots, to logically think in order to properly  orient himself in the situation, and to make the best use of the  insufficient information.    The pilots know how important it is to be confident that at  the command post there is an experienced, decisive commander and  at the control panels there are competent, resolute officers  capable of sending out comprehensive information on the air  situation and of coming to their aid at any minute. The word of  a tactical control officer giving a routine command on behalf of  the commander is law, an order to be acted upon. And what if,  when broadcast, this word sounds indecisive or, worst of all,  what if there is no word at a time when a command is sorely  needed?    Take, for example, guidance onto air targets. At first  glance  this is a simple matter, but, indeed, even when simplified, it  is like orienting a person in the dark.    Let us suppose that the command post team has directed the  fighters into the rear hemisphere of the target at a greater  distance than was required. Then they have ahead of them a  lengthy pursuit of the enemy, who, if he has detected the  pursuit in a timely manner, can set up jamming and break away  from the fighters. And it could also happen that the command  post team completely failed to bring the fighters into an  advantageous position for attack. Does such a thing occur?  Unfortunately, yes. Such a miscalculation occurred on one of the  tactical air exercises (a tactical command officer dawdled  inexcusably). Of course, this affected the setting up of the  engagement in the most negative way. When the fighters detected  the "enemy" anyway and, in spite of the disadvantageousness of  their position, tried to go over to the offensive, their actions  were uncoordinated; the group was not a unified whole and was  withdrawn from the engagement. Other fighters had to intercept  the target.    Even worse incidents occur, if the CP team does not observe  the rules of flight safety, and allows the fighters to exceed  the speed limits set for the given type of aircraft, or allows  the aircraft to come dangerously close to each other or the  targets, or if the tactical command officers do not remember the  minimum permissible fuel reserves for the various distances of  the aircraft from the airfield. In such cases, disaster is not  far away.    Mistakes in matters of command and control are dangerous and  cannot always be corrected. The experience of wars on our own  soil testifies to the fact that a significant percentage of  combat losses of fighter aircraft is related to their being  inadequately managed in air engagements. It is only as a result  of errors committed by control centers when guiding aircraft,  that approximately one third of the aircraft were lost. (See:  AVIATION and COSMONAUTICS. 1987. No. 6. P. 4.)    The person responsible for these errors is primarily the  commander, not only the commander managing combat, but the  commander supervising the work of the CP team as well. It is  namely he who should make efforts to attain mutual understanding  and coordination in the work of his subordinates. At the same  time, of foremost importance today is the commander's ability to  conduct command and control from a CP equipped with modern  automated systems. These two important aspects of a commander's  activities deserve individual examination.  <H5>  2. The Commander and His Subordinates </H5>   The haze of the scorching air has been hanging over the  airfield since morning, washing away the already unclear line of  the horizon. On the ramps by the takeoff strip everything is at  a standstill in expectation of the departure of the aircraft;  the command post team has been on combat alert duty for hours.  Behind them is the intense preparation for the big exercises,  ahead of them the most crucial moment -- a flight to repulse the  "enemy's" first massive raid.    Waiting for a raid at any moment is a rather oppressive  affair. The longer the waiting lasts, imperceptibly, somehow  little by little, an invisible nervous tension grows within the  CP team. The commander himself is also quite excited, although  he understands very well: he of all people cannot yield to  emotions; indeed, dozens of pairs of eyes are trained on him.  Sense and experience unerringly prompt him: in order to  successfully carry out the upcoming complex mission, it is  important to have a calm, psychologically stable situation at  the CP. He knows that when people work together and relate  kindly with one another, they are capable of a lot. The reasons  for this -- a common goal, example, mutual support, competition,  and, finally, their psychoemotional attitude. All of this  increases each person's capacity for work. Yes, a person's  capacity for work depends on his attitude, and here we are  speaking not only about capacity for work, but about the  performance of the most important combat missions, and, at time  of war, about the preservation of defended installations and the  lives of pilots in combat.    However, all of this is much easier to understand than to  provide. The senior commander, in answer to the commander's  interrogation over the telephone, just tossed out an angry:  "Don't interfere, wait!" Sitting around a table the chief of  staff lashed into the chief of communications. And then tactical  control officers turned away from the radar indicators and  stared at the commander, who had just finished his telephone  conversation. The semi-darkness of the command post prevented  him from making out their staring faces. A feeling of annoyance  intensified the monotonous humming of the fan, which wasn't  cooling. It was stuffy, hot, and the commander couldn't restrain  himself:    "Well, what are you staring at? You're not supposed to be  looking at me, you're supposed to be looking at the air  situation!" He struck at their very hearts and then he turned  away as if he had been deeply offended by his subordinates.    And indeed the commander had everything: knowledge,  experience, resolute qualities. But there was just one thing --  he did not have enough respect for other people, and yes, if you  will, modesty. It is not difficult to imagine what took place in  the consciousness of those people, what humiliation they  experienced as a result of those unjust words. Sullen and silent  they no longer expect anything good out of dealings with the  commander.    Let us leave the stuffy command post building for a short  time and concern ourselves with the further development of  events. What has happened makes one wonder. It is customary to  call the CP the brain of the regiment. This "brain" will  function more reliably the better each of its cells functions.  But this depends on the coordination of the actions of the team,  how well the members "fit" together, and their interaction with  the commander.    Of course, unnecessary conversation and inattentiveness are  impermissible at the CP. What's that? Chance or echelon are not  very significant in the chain of disorders? It is not terribly  difficult for the experienced commander to examine this. But  what worse place for the rude shout than when the splash of  emotions rises above the logic of reasoning. And what is the  result? Don't resentment and enmity toward the commander, who  should not respond so rudely, obscure the sense of duty and the  desire of the subordinates to fulfill as well as possible that  part of the combat mission which was entrusted to them?    We return once again to the command post and glance at the  vertical plotting board that we have mentioned so often that is  now already thickly covered with the various colors of the  flight routes. Red and blue lines extend toward each other, bend  and intersect. Gradually the "enemy's" tactical intentions are  taking shape. His aircraft are attempting to break through to  defended installations from two directions, maneuvering at an  altitude under the cover of jamming. The air situation is  becoming more complicated with every passing minute. Whitish  bands of jamming thickly dotting the screens of the radar  indicators, rapidly spread, become brighter, show more contour,  and the tiny blips from the multitude of targets can hardly be  distinguished one from another against the background of  blinking dull color. The fighters repulse a massive "enemy"  raid. Both sides are exceedingly active.    At the command post there is the usual working rhythm of  combat operations; one hears reports, commands, and messages  delivered in muffled tones. The commander is at his work  station. Now he is calmness and self-control personified; he  expresses his feelings judiciously and with restraint, he  strictly controls his behavior. The commander's intonation,  gestures, facial expressions, and the expression of his eyes are  transmitted immediately to his subordinates. They all understand  each other from half a word, half a gesture; everyone is imbued  with a common goal -- how best to carry out the assigned  mission. It is as if the low noise of the equipment creates a  special coziness; nobody notices the stuffiness. Pair after  pair, echelon after echelon, in the thunder of the afterburners  they take off from the airfield. The tactical control officers  do not take their eyes off of the blips on the indicator screens  and guide the fighters onto the appropriate targets according to  the commander's decision. It is natural that the commander acts  as the unified center, the nucleus of command and control. He is  constantly in his subordinates' field of view; their attention  is riveted on him, as to the conductor of an orchestra.    Yes, the CP team is a peculiar sort of orchestra, where the  role of the conductor belongs to the commander. It is namely he  who must make the decisions, encompassing the strength of  collective thought. But if the orchestra plays something wrong  it only lowers the quality of the music, whereas a false note in  the work of even the most insignificant "musician" at the CP can  cause the fulfillment of the combat mission to be frustrated no  less than the negligence of the "conductor" himself. The  individual monitoring the plotting board was careless in  plotting the information, things are not going well for the  communications operator, the command and control officer is late  delivering his commands, there is dissonance in the commands, in  the clarifications... Is it really possible to conduct command  and control with aides like these?    Not a single of the most competent and talented commanders  can get along without a well-trained and hardworking CP team,  but even a model team consisting of highly qualified specialists  cannot ensure combat success without a competent commander. Such  is the dialectic relationship at the commander - command post  team level. The commander cannot exist on his own without a team  acting as a single mechanism to evaluate the diversity of the  air situation, and all the matters with which the subordinates  working at the various stations are occupied. Only playing "by  the notes", i.e., the coordination of all the members of the  team, will ensure success.    The commander is at his work station. His gaze is directed  at  the plotting board; question after question occurs to him: what  strength level of fighters should he employ; at what point of  engagement; in cooperation with whom, and in what sequence  should the current large target be intercepted? In what  direction should efforts be concentrated in order to achieve  superiority of forces over the enemy? No matter how  comprehensively the commander has been trained, here he cannot  get along without his own form of feedback, whereby the  communication is not passive but active, entailing not only  reports concerning the fulfillment of orders and commands, but  also the issuing of evaluations full of initiative useful for  the commander's decision making, and of constructive suggestions  for the combat employment of the fighters.    Such timely evaluations and recommendations are of great  value. To a great extent they help to find a way out of critical  situations. But how important it is for the commander to regard  them with interest so that he himself does not falter in those  tense minutes.    And what if the commander is nervous and this inner  agitation  robs him of his equilibrium in dealing with his subordinates?  What if he once again gives free rein to his emotions, is  peremptory or categoric in his opinions, is persistent even when  he is wrong, ignores people, cuts short their reports? Then  don't expect any good to come of it. On the job even the most  capable specialists are not immune to flaws. Look, someone has  been slow in coming up with important information, somewhere a  command was improperly executed or understood, a piece of  equipment was improperly used. But why? People are rather afraid  to show personal initiative, to ask that unintelligible commands  be repeated, knowing that they will be met with the same shout  and the same fault-finding of a commander who doesn't know how  to listen.    This is the picture you get. The air situation is constantly  changing, the leader has to work under extreme pressure and at  the same time his subordinates are silent and instead of helping  the commander they are waiting for additional instructions. But  if the one is thinking about everything, then the others have  simply stopped thinking. This way it is easier and simpler not  to have to wrack your own brain, and you can always conceal your  own tactical incompetence and laziness. And so the commander  literally has to extort the data essential to him and waste time  on unnecessary interrogations. Thus, he himself deprives himself  of the support of his subordinates.    Such a picture could be the result of the team's being  inadequately trained. Of course, well-founded evaluations and  suggestions can actually only be given by officers who recognize  their functional duties down to the last detail. People should  be trained to work out the priority of reports, thereby ensuring  that they will receive the best possible interpretation by the  commander. Causes of a purely psychological nature should not be  given a low priority.    Subordinates don't understand a commander as well when he  shouts. The strength of his personality lies not in rudeness,  but, more likely, on the contrary, in his tactfulness,  sensitivity, and attentiveness to people. We always admire  leaders who know how to conduct themselves, we see them in a  good light. Self-control is a useful quality for everyone under  any circumstances, but in tense situations it is simply a  necessity. In order that subordinates not hide behind their  commander's back, but work actively and strive to make a  feasible contribution to the common problem, the commander does  not have to strain his vocal chords, but quietly and calmly  enlist the services of the entire CP team to conduct command and  control. Then the task of command and control will become a  common task and together it will be an easier task to fulfil.  The science of not offending, if you will, is the easiest and at  the same time the most complex concept for all of us.    How then can one manage to put together a team that is not  just a haphazardly assembled group of people, but a solid  collective, cemented by a sense of duty and responsibility? The  secret here lies in the commander's ability to create a healthy  moral and psychological atmosphere at the CP. It is important  for each person, sensibly and with feeling, to realize his role  and place in the mission being carried out by the CP team, as  well as to be confident that when expressing the most audacious,  even incorrect, ideas, he will not be rudely rebuffed by the  commander.    And, nevertheless, to develop a steadfast belief in the  commander -- that is half the battle. He himself should know and  believe that each subordinate will fulfil his duties as he  should. Without this it is not possible to have mutual  understanding between the commander and his subordinates.    Here's another thing the commander must not forget. The  command post team is made up of people with a variety of  personalities and idiosyncracies, with their own "subtleties"  and "vagaries." One may not like the way his work station  neighbor converses, a second may not like the way this same  colleague jokes, a third may not like the manners of the second.  Forced as a result of their duty to constantly associate with  one another, they all experience sympathy and antipathy which  from time to time are difficult to explain. Here it isn't mutual  understanding that occurs, but alienation and hostility among  people -- something we refer to as psychological incompatibility.    The commander must help people to control their feelings, to  exhibit mutual trust and benevolence. He has opportunities to do  this because he sees his subordinates in the most varied  situations and observes how they react, not only on a  professional level, but also on a psychological one. For this  reason it is easier for him to find motivating factors which  will cause a person to act one way or another. Alas, this does  not always pan out.    "Why didn't you give me a timely update on the changes in  the  air situation?", a commander reproaches one of his officers.    "You yourself ordered that we weren't to report unless we  were asked," the officer's gaze reflects sincere bewilderment,  and there are distinct traces of nervousness in the intonation  of his voice as he answers.    The officer was reporting about everything he saw on the  plotting board without any system and without selecting the most  substantive information and in the course of his reports the  main points got watered down. He could not yet grasp the meaning  of his functional duties and simply bothered the commander. Then  it made sense in his case to instruct him only to report when  asked. But in this case he also received a reproof that he  simply did not understand. But if you constantly reproach people  for improper actions without taking into consideration the  motivating factors, what will the result be?    Evidently, one should treat genuine experts in their field  differently than one would treat random persons committing  errors in their work. One should be patient in dealing with each  person, show him how he could better contribute to the  fulfillment of the common combat mission. You must adhere to the  rule: if a glitch occurred somewhere, if someone was inaccurate  -- don't rush in with remarks, and certainly not with reproofs,  but point out the error in a calm tone, in a businesslike  manner, to the person whose fault it was, and explain what the  ramifications could be.    And now we once again turn to the commander who understands  the secret of interaction with his subordinates. He is still  managing the combat. The "enemy's" forces have not dried up, new  targets continue to appear on the plotting boards and  indicators, the thunder of the engines of airplanes taking off  has not died down on the airfield. The commander sees that his  men are tired and that fatigue is growing exponentially. Fatigue  is an insidious thing. I recall that government commissions  investigating the causes for railroad, shipping, aviational, and  other catastrophes found that one of the main causes was fatigue  of personnel brought about by systematic overworking. Prolonged  physical and emotional stress give rise to apathy and  indifference to the work being performed. The time put into the  situation sometimes increases several fold, while the accuracy  of the operations, on the other hand, sharply declines, and  mistakes occur where they aren't at all expected.    Of course, not every case of fatigue gives rise to an  explosion or a catastrophe, but one thing is clear: people  require rest and recreation; otherwise, they might miss  important commands or might not react to them in the proper way.  But the commander cannot yet offer his subordinates the rest and  recreation that they have earned. In other words, from time to  time you've got to at least have a psychological release.    For a moment the activity on the plotting board and  indicators has died down a bit, but the specialists cannot leave  their work stations. How long will this lull last? Only the  "enemy" can answer that question, but this is precisely the time  to relieve some of the nervous tension built up after the long  minutes, or even hours, of tiresome, monotonous work.    Who should do this? The commander, of course. It goes  without  saying that he himself has just experienced at least as much  tension, he has shouldered as ponderable a burden; he would also  like to take it easy, but first he has to take care of his  subordinates. This is his duty as commander. But very little is  required to do this: take a microphone in hand, call those who  are particularly tired, and with a simple joke relieve the  emotional tension. Of course, the wise commander will not start  to scold and deride someone for a mistake, and will not allow  himself to tell even one of those condescending jokes which  might damage a person's dignity or pride.    Commander and subordinates... In our time public opinion has  become exceptionally stirred up. People are aware of their right  to participate in everything. Subordinates are watching their  commander attentively; they see and evaluate everything. How  complicated interaction can be sometimes in the tense rhythm of  combat operations and how important it is to maintain the common  equilibrium without pressure, not to allow someone's superiority  in experience, in official position, or in their quick  wittedness to turn into resentment, to wound someone's  self-esteem. The people on the team are different, and, not  without reason, a wise Armenian saying goes: "The way a  commander is, that's how his subordinates are".  <H5>  3. The Commander at the Computer </H5>   The commander was uneasy. One minute he was sitting, the  next  pacing up and down, which for him was a sign of anxious  brooding; now he sullenly glanced at his subordinates, but it  was no use to upbraid them. The soft blinking light of the  displays was reflected on the concentrated faces of the officers  sitting at the display panels. They were processing data,  performing various calculations, and using the information  retrieval system. In the briefest period of time they found and  delivered the necessary information to the commander.    However, returning to his work station the commander glanced  at the column of figures, graphs, and text fragments flashing on  the screen somewhat anxiously and then transferred his gaze to  the electronic plotting board. The information set down by the  computer printer not only gave an idea about the air conditions,  but also showed the potential changes in the conditions based on  the decisions made. The situation was shaping up unfavorably:  fighters sent up to intercept a group air target are not in the  best initial position for attack and the correlation of forces  is also not advantageous.    Every commander is familiar with the feeling of vexation  which arises after a serious error in decision-making. What  essentially happened? Was the fighter force inadequate, were the  pilots not well-trained enough, or was the command post team at  fault? None of the above. There is another reason: the  interception was performed according to a decision made by a  computer, but the target went under the cover of jamming and  actively maneuvered, its tracking was unsteady, the assessment  questionable. And nevertheless, the commander decided to stick  with the recommendations issued by the computer.    The officer turns once again to the computer. He wants to  analyze the various decision scenarios, to juxtapose them, to  evaluate the effectiveness of corrective measures. The input  data and the conditions have changed... And again the computer  has come to life, its multicolored lights are flashing; maybe  this time it will be a different scenario. But, alas, under  conditions where the information is incomplete or unauthentic,  where there are alternative combat combinations which could not  all be programmed, even the most modern computer can strike out.    "What was it like in the past, when there weren't any  electronic gizmos to interfere with the commander's thinking and  decision-making," sighed the commander and added with  unconcealed irony, "We truly have woe from an electronic mind,  and now you're supposed to do the thinking for a machine."    In that remark there is a hint of nostalgia for the old,  "manual" methods of command and control -- a phenomenon which  you might say is typical. Such is human psychology. It is not  difficult to understand: isn't it better to act in accordance  with the experience you have than to trust something unfamiliar?    But let's get on with the story. The commander, who at the  outset shifted his functions to the computer, was able to  correct the decisions he had made earlier. What remained was for  him to put into effect the scenario which he had found to redeem  the situation, which, as it turned out was not all that  difficult.    ...The leader of the fighter group which was already being  guided onto the target in the automated mode has not uttered a  word since takeoff; the command post has also been silent. Just  this sort of silent "conversation" was going on between the  leader and the instruments in his cockpit, which were providing  him with information for executing an interception. The group  was already approaching the target, but the command and control  officer, in keeping with the commander's revised decision, was  able to recalculate and enter the new data into the computer.  The triangular indexes moved smoothly along the indicator  scales; a series of figures lit up on the message panels  indicating the flight parameters. The automated system computed  another trajectory for the fighters, and they then executed its  "commands" with maximum accuracy. The most important thing was  to maintain the assigned parameters, and that is not all that  complex. Freeing the pilots from other secondary operations  enabled them to better evaluate the situation and to get ready  for the attack. Complete radio silence enabled them to achieve  an element of surprise.    However, CP commanders and pilots who are a little older  remember the times when guidance using an automatic control  system was considered a novelty. They remember how skeptical  they were when introduced to this system in flight. Silent  flight without radio communications between the CP and the  pilot, without constant prompting from the ground, was unusual.  The pilots started to get nervous, they were late in reacting  to the instrument commands. Switching their attention to those  instruments, they forgot to monitor the other indicators. The  movements of the control surfaces became more abrupt.    "It's all the fault of automation, it doesn't pull you out  where you're supposed to be," sighed the commander, excusing the  pilots after they had returned to the airfield from a failed  photo-reconnaissance mission. "Guidance the old way, by voice,  would have been more reliable."    Is it a matter of automation here? No, it works reliably. To  make it the scapegoat is simply frivolous. Why, then, did so  many treat automation with skepticism and mistrust? The old way  was well known, tested repeatedly in practice, and seemed by  force of habit to be more reliable than the new way, although  the new way possessed many advantages. Therefore, along with the  newest electronics, they set up areas with experimental radar  indicators, nomograms, tables, and gave them a preference.  Stormy arguments ensued as to whether the computer infringes on  the commander's creative thinking.    A considerable amount of time has passed since then and  perhaps there is no recollection of those noisy arguments, but  today, as well, even experienced commanders sigh. They are  troubled by the complexity of the new systems that need to be  thoroughly mastered, but what troubles them even more is the  necessity to do without the customary methods of command and  control and to shift from direct interaction with subordinates  to contact with them through automated means. Indeed, using the  new system instructions and reports are passed in the form of  specific signals and are interpreted without any emotional  effect, and the very air situation is depicted, if one can use  that term, in "coded form." The result is that the logic of the  commander's decision is not known until the end, the need for  emotional information is not satisfied and the commander's  personality, to a certain degree, loses its sensual specificity.    Nevertheless, we are attempting, however briefly, to refrain  from sighs of nostalgia, though we are speaking not only about  today, but about days gone by as well. It's bad for any field if  a specialist abandons new technology and arms himself with a  crow-bar and a shovel. In the field of aviation this is even  dangerous. We wouldn't want to exaggerate, but what can you do  if the time parameters for any one of the commander's actions  exceed his psychological capabilities for making decisions and  for command and control, or if the amount of information coming  to him becomes so great that he doesn't have time to comprehend  it?    Can you imagine a volume of information consisting of  multi-digit figures? Of course one can imagine it, but what is  this volume of figures for? To understand what massive amounts  of information concerning the enemy, his aircraft, and the  conditions of the air situation circulate in contemporary  command and control systems, what amount of time is required to  process it and manually transmit it from the radar control  panels at the CP, and for it to be assimilated by the commander.  This creates a situation that is reminiscent of the famous story  about the ill-fated meteorologist, who, when asked if he could,  with complete accuracy, consider all the factors affecting  tomorrow's weather, replied, "Yes, but to do that I'll need a  week to perform the calculations." That is why the time is not  too far off, when the basic mass of information will be fixed,  stored, and represented in the machine's memory, when the  commander simply cannot get along without automation. The way in  which automation will serve the commander will depend on the  commander's ability to use automation in his own interests.    In the complex interaction of the radio technical means  delivering information, of the electronic "brain" reprocessing  it, and of the operations of the commander himself, the  situation is evaluated, a decision takes shape, the optimal  flight paths and flight modes of the fighters to the points of  engagement are calculated, and the commands to the pilots are  worked out. The foundation of this interaction is the principle:  transfer to the machine those tasks which it performs better  than a human being, and leave to the human being those tasks  with which only he can cope. The concept "better than a human  being" includes, above all, the computer's incontestable  superiority in those of its properties with which a human being  cannot compete: speed, accuracy of calculation, formalized view  of systems of logic. These properties make the computer a  special amplifier of the commander's own creative abilities.    Automation can do a lot, but not everything. A still greater  share is left to the commander. You see, the computer considers  a limited number of factors. Strictly speaking, the system of  algorithms and their function in the automatic control system  are essentially a programmed operation for processing the  commander's decision, only in the most general situations. As  with any logical task, this operation cannot be formalized  without specific assumptions; in the calculations and  recommendations there are always some errors which are  permissible for some situations, but require correction in  others.    The commander thinks more slowly, but more complexly.  However, it is precisely thanks to this complexity that he is  capable of making decisions in non-typical, not previously  experienced situations, under the most intricate circumstances,  where (in any event, for the time being) the most "intelligent"  computers would fall down. When there is insufficient  information and the situation is unclear, as was the case, for  example, in the episode described at the beginning of the  section, a computer's decision would also be incomplete and  under those conditions there would be no replacement for the  commander. One could hardly expect the computer to exhibit  initiative and resourcefulness; it won't be able to "think up" a  war stratagem, and, you see, it is thanks to those capabilities  that victory is achieved in combat. There is yet another quality  that the commander possesses which cannot be attained by a  computer and that is adequate in the evaluation of the  situation, not giving way to a precise quantitative description.  But, from another aspect, you can't get away from indecision,  doubts (man -- not machine), and then the minutes granted to the  commander by the computer he can use for deliberating and for  more precise evaluations.    That is why in contemporary automatic control systems the  commander is given the right to interfere with the operation of  the computer and correct its recommendations. The commander is  free to make decisions based on the computer's recommendations,  he can take them partially into consideration or even reject  them completely. He is guided by his own experience, the reports  of the members of the CP team, and, of course, the situation's  degree of uncertainty. As they say, you need to be able to  listen to another person's mind, but you can't live through  another person's mind. This means that you must not blindly  follow the recommendations of the computer, but act according to  the conditions as they take shape, making corrections for every  specific situation; you must know that the computer is prompting  only one of the admissible decisions.    Look what is emerging from our discussions. In the system  "computer - commander" only the latter is active, and that is  what determines his place in the system. Unfortunately, for some  commanders the complexity of this system becomes a psychological  barrier, and they begin to disregard at least some of its  elements and capabilities. Sometimes the other extreme occurs --  the commander overestimates the computer's capabilities. The  commander views the computer as a mechanism which can conduct  command and control automatically. From this sort of commander  you hear the expression now and then, "the computer produced the  optimum variant." But the computer cannot think. Its intellect  is simply a metaphorical name referring to programmed computers  which imitate human activity. When the commander has unlimited  faith in the infallibility of a computer, he transfers to it the  decision-making role and becomes completely dependent on it. We  recall once again the commander mentioned earlier who didn't  know how to deal with the information provided him by the  automatic control system. I would say that is a classic example  of the illiterate use of that system.    Today at the end of a century of scientific-technological  revolution and electronics, when the computer handles more and  more of the command and control operations, questions are  already occurring to the military reader: how will the  relationship between the commander and the computer shape up in  the future, and what new innovations await him?    These are not just idle questions. Let's try to have a look  at the commander role of our successors.    The flood of information concerning the air situation is  increasing, and, as it does, the time available to the commander  is inexorably shortened -- a consequence of the growing dynamics  of combat. The situation calls for perfected human-machine  complexes based on expert systems which enable the automation of  those command and control operations which cannot be based  solely on ancient, eternally correct mathematics. The  functioning of these complexes is based on longer-range methods,  and, in particular, on the methods of artificial intelligence,  which enable machines to solve informal-logical and heuristic  problems without human interference, to represent these problems  in the computer, and give them to the commander for  decision-making.    Of course, we are speaking about systems in the  more-distant-future. They will be able to relieve the commander  of the burden of time devoted to uncreative problems and will  provide an even more complete combination of the computer's  capabilities with a human being's intellectual faculties. It  will make possible a transition from the passive routine whereby  the commander simply enters data into the computer and receives  a ready result, to an active routine of interaction with the  computer, as well as the automatic management of a data base and  control over its expansion.    Using this system, in addition to the variant calculated by  the computer, the commander will be able to enter his own  intuitive variant into the computer, and it will be able to  evaluate and select the best of them according to the accepted  criterion (the extent of the damages being prevented to the  defended installations, the number of targets hit, etc.).    And yet another innovation. With time, when the computer has  the capability to perceive a human voice, although, perhaps not  with all of its various levels of meaning, it will become  possible for the commander to carry on a conversation with the  computer, and, in the course of their dialogue, for the computer  to give him alternative solutions based on the model "if...,  then..."    This innovation requires clarification. You will have at  your  disposal a portable terminal unit which is connected to the  computer. Using this unit you can simply read some sort of text  and the computer will understand everything. Evaluating the  situation or making a decision, you enter the initial  information into this mechanism, and then a series of questions  and responses in dialogue form ensues. The computer poses  questions requesting more information, you respond to them, ask  your own questions and receive responses. The displays and graph  plotters "draw" and write without any mood swings, fixing the  results of the calculations; the voice, devoid of human bias,  recommends the very actions for the commander to expediently  undertake. In so doing, it explains how and on the basis of what  in the system the given problem was solved, and demonstrates the  process of the "deductions" made by the computer. The first  steps in developing units capable of spoken dialogue have  already been taken. It is true, they are limited to a specific  vocabulary that the computer is capable of perceiving and  synthesizing.    The commander can expect innovations which are at least as  interesting when he goes up into the air with his pilots. The  onboard control system based on machine vision, machine voice  recognition, and machine comprehension of the commander's  speech, will systematize, summarize, and depict the tactical  situation. Hopes are also being expressed for the system's great  potential in processing recommendations for the selection of  tactical methods, for the employment of armaments and electronic  warfare through human-machine dialogue. Here the system retains  the "right" to warn the commander if it is dangerous or  impossible to carry out his decision. Then the system can  suggest another solution.    For example, let's say you have taken off to intercept an  air  target. In accordance with that target's maneuver shown on your  display, your flight path is revised and a variant for the  set-up of the air engagement is worked out. But this variant  doesn't suit you and you enter amendments. Having received its  assignment the computer begins to "cogitate" and then suggests  another variant, taking into account the new parameters of the  situation. You accept it and on the display in numerical and  graphic form the zone boundaries are depicted along with the  time for the launching of the missiles or the employment of  another type of armament. Then, with your agreement, the target  is hit in the first and subsequent attacks.    But now the battle is over, and it turns out that the fuel  reserve is insufficient to return to your airfield. During the  engagement this information was not put out over the display so  that you would not be distracted, since the information was not  urgent enough. Now, however, by way of alternatives the computer  recommends landing at one of the reserve airfields. Having  glanced at the display, however, you reject that, knowing that  at that airfield the airstrip is damaged. The next variant  suggested by the computer is acceptable and then it assigns you  a flight mode to proceed to a landing.    This dialogue system at the command post and in the air is a  great, as yet unrealized, business. The computer prompts the  commander as to what he needs to do, what comes after what, what  along with what is inexpedient. But then either an idea occurs  to the commander that requires immediate implementation, or a  doubt. And then begin the clarifications, the corrections, and  even the "wranglings" with the computer, which remembers the  finest nuances and details of the situation if the fatigued or  absent-minded commander forgets them.    What is concealed in the "soul" of the electronic intellect?  We won't exaggerate the potential of the dialogue system and  other systems. They are completely determined by the models  installed in them, by what was considered in them and how, and  they will never be able to become phenomenal robots or the  cybernetic likeness of a commander. We can only speak of means  which, to one extent or another, amplify or broaden the  intellectual capabilities of the commander.    In order to skillfully combine the inquisitive mind of the  commander with the rapid and accurate calculations of the  computer, you need to develop, if it can be expressed in those  terms, computer literacy, computer culture, and they should  begin with a basic psychological revolution in consciousness in  relation to automation. Will the commander judiciously evaluate  the computer's recommendations if he doesn't understand the very  process of its operation, if he doesn't know what a computer can  and cannot do, if he is not familiar with that complex of  factors which its creators considered for the model installed in  it, or with the limiting conditions or the accepted allowances?    And one more thing. Computers dash old conceptions about  leadership methods. They require a different way of thinking on  the part of the commander and the CP team, a different quality  of work at automated work stations, an extremely clear-cut  differentiation of the duties of the personnel in order that  they can carry out their functions without unnecessary commands  and questions. In order to do this, in addition to his purely  commander-oriented and traditional skills for leading his  subordinates, the commander should possess the skills of an  operator steering a piece of complex technical equipment. Just  as other members of the CP team, the commander needs to know how  to quickly read and analyze symbols, forms containing letters  and numbers, and other designations on the screens of the  situation indicators. He must be able to work with a keyboard,  to retrieve the necessary information from the data base, to  enter command and control commands, expressing the complexity of  his thought in an extremely clear-cut manner using the limited  capabilities of the technical means. And all of these operations  must be carried out without hesitation; otherwise, the time  gained, thanks to the computer's rapid operating speed, will be  wasted.    It is as if they are both simple, easy to understand, and  subjective -- the fast operating computer and the experience of  the commander. But, imagine how long and labor-intensive the  work of those people is in order to train or "bring to life" the  computer, to develop their mathematical and program support, how  the titles alone of the input data they have to enter and  consolidate in the automatic control system need to be worked  out. But, you see, without the computer program the computer is  nothing but an "empty brain," an expensive but useless piece of  equipment. Yes, "service" entails a lot of preliminary work, but  it's difficult to get along without it.    The role of the commander is also great here. He must know  on  what basis the problems are programmed, especially with  contradictory data, and the principles for forming computer  algorithms for processing information; otherwise, it will be  difficult to have a formalized conception of the operations and  phenomena which must be replaced with the models realized within  the computer and to correctly put the problem to specialists and  work in close contact with them.    Such are the demands of time. That's the way it is today.  Whether we want it or not, whether we like it or not, we either  love computers or cannot stand them from the time we are  children, but we've got to use them. The commander who doesn't  learn to deal with computers as freely as he deals with plotting  boards and indicators will soon be likened to someone who  doesn't know how to read or write.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   The CP lives by combat. Here all the threads of command and  control meet and are held in the hands of the CP team headed by  the commander, an outstanding individual possessing superior  business-like qualities and talent, reacting quickly and  correctly to changes in the situation. His subordinates use the  commander as their standard. They notice how confidently he  gives his instructions, how the chiefs converse with him. This  is how it should be.    Command and control has never been considered easy. Just  look  at yourself, commander. Don't you make mistakes from time to  time in your decisions as a result of not fully evaluating the  situation? Are you always fair in your dealings with your  subordinates? Doesn't your automated work station oppress you,  and don't you cover your eyes if these indicators of your  managerial activity oscillate somewhere on the level of  mediocrity?  <H5>  Chapter VIII. Know How to Overcome Yourself </H5> <H5>  1. The Burdensome Time of Mental and Psychological Stress </H5>   Air combat is packed to the limit with difficult tactical  situations. The enemy might act within any altitude range, from  the most unexpected directions, using all types of armaments and  radar jamming. It is precisely with such a resourceful,  well-trained enemy that the fighters will have to meet in a  heated dogfight.    To achieve victory in battle each pilot should have  confident  mastery of his aircraft and armaments, and be able to quickly  and correctly use the tactical methods which are specifically  appropriate for the given situation. But what do the  mental-psychological and combat morale qualities mean for him.    In brutal dogfights fraught with the unexpected, where just  one false maneuver can cost a life, pilots experience, among  other things, severe mental and psychological stress. Everyone  has developed a sense of self-preservation, which weighs on the  psyche, melding from time to time reason and will, and one must  know how to overcome this. However, not everyone can or wants to  experience hardship and danger. A human being is a great master  when it comes to that which he desires. Self-deception, which is  based on subconscious fear, can easily become conviction.    In this regard it is apropos to make a short excursion into  the history of World War II, where there was not a dearth of  dangerous, psychologically difficult situations, to recall  long-standing events.    All sorts of things were happening at that time, all sorts  of  people were at the front. Back then cowards and panickers,  thrown by their leaders into combat, were treated with contempt  and anger.    And the reason for those unseemly actions, in my view, can  be  traced, above all, to the fact that the pilots had not been  trained for an encounter with dangers in a mental-psychological  sense.    Here is a tragic episode. It happened at the 762nd fighter  aircraft station in July 1943 the second day after the battle of  Kurskaya began. The air was simply swarming still with  "Messerschmidts" and "Junkers." An eight-aircraft element of  Yak-7 fighters under the command of squadron commander Captain  L. Avyekov took off to provide cover for the troops. Having  detected two groups of nine "Junkers" flying under the cover of  "Messerschmidts" the commander made a daring decision: to attack  the first group of nine aircraft with three pairs and to provide  cover for our actions with the fourth pair. However, when we  went over to the attack, instead of our own covering pair we saw  a line of "Messerschmidts." The subsequent events developed  rapidly; an attack didn't come off.    Returning to the airfield after this grave, unsuccessful  engagement we did a great deal of thinking. Either the fascists  shot down the pair providing cover, or they didn't know their  tactic well enough and didn't know how to get into the  engagement. But it was something else. When, after landing, we  saw the "missing" pair of aircraft on the ramp and asked the  leader why it happened like that, he irresolutely alluded to  engine trouble. Right! We understood that he, by the way, a  pretty good pilot, had simply gotten cold feet. That was  cowardice that turned into a crime.    We could recall even more acute, critical situations which  occurred in the war years and also in our time. All of them are  a grim reminder that you cannot completely rely only on the  piloting technique and the tactical training of pilots. One must  not forget about the high level of mental and psychological  stress that they are experiencing. Could you weigh their burden,  measure and compare the end results of battle? In aviation,  unfortunately, there are not yet the appropriate statistical  data and tangible indicators to make such estimations. But one  can judge that these stresses are not all that harmless from the  research conducted in related fields.    Thus, foreign military psychologists calculated that out of  the 1,630,000 army veterans in the USA who participated in World  War II, approximately one million suffered from various  psychological disorders and were subjected to the appropriate  treatment. Of them, 545,000 were immediately pronounced unfit  for further service. (TRUPPENDIENST. 1982. No. 1.) The  correlation between psychological and physical traumas in the  Israeli army was 3:10 in the Arab-Israeli war of 1973 and 2.3:10  in the war in Lebanon in 1982. (MILITARY REVIEW. 1985. N0. 7.)  Statistics and indicators are quite eloquent, aren't they?    And now we return to mental and psychological stress in the  course of our combat training. Without these stresses here we  also couldn't get along, but in peacetime, when there is no real  enemy in the air, these stresses manifest themselves in a  different way.    Each new generation of fighter aircraft distinguishes itself  from the preceding one not only with its improved  aviational-tactical features and its weaponry, but also with the  increased emotional and nervous tension which the pilots  experience. A contemporary fighter aircraft is the focus of  electronics, automation, and the most complicated systems. Now  an integral part of the onboard systems, they introduce  substantial changes in the work of flying, they facilitate it so  much that it seems as if the automatic system itself could  control the airplane.    However, the most highly perfected equipment does not  relieve  the pilot of the oppressive time of psychological and mental  stress and never will. It just takes on a new quality. It has  been determined, for example, that when flying faster than the  speed of sound the pilot performs various operations 6-8 times  more than when traveling at speeds below the speed of sound.  This means that when controlling the aircraft he should make  decisions faster. A delay of even a few seconds could lead to  irreversible consequences. Therefore, although the flight speed  alone does not have a direct influence on the pilot's body, its  psychological effect is very tangible. The need for highly  accurate, coordinated movements and the combination of them with  complicated thought processes in multi-mode flight leads to an  increase in emotional tension. Therefore, as the saying goes,  the pilot is constantly fired up. He has a sense of heaviness,  of fatigue, he doesn't always manage to work out a rhythm to his  thinking in order to interpret and process the information he  has received.    Now imagine that this new generation of fighters has just  arrived at your unit. To learn a new aircraft -- that is the  hidden desire of every pilot. You want to sit in the cockpit as  soon as possible and take off. But here is one more episode on  the psychological plane.    For a long time you have been flying a type of fighter that  you have already mastered; you know it down to the "last nuts  and bolts"; you feel completely in charge in the cockpit. You  approach the new unfamiliar aircraft with this feeling.    Confidence in one's own strengths is a valuable quality. It  enables a pilot to discover his own capabilities to the fullest  extent, to better perform the most complex tasks. But, on the  other hand, as strange as it may seem, your former skills --  complex conditioned reflexes, can become an unforeseen obstacle  in mastering the new equipment. The thing is, aircraft not only  have similarities in their general principles of control, they  also have differences. Therefore, the influence of old skills on  the new ones is two-fold: either positive, or negative. In  either case the previously acquired experience will show, and it  won't always be useful.    The new aircraft has an unusual form, a different nose droop  angle in the forward part of the fuselage, a different cockpit.  There in the cockpit behind the smoky light is the realm of  levers, toggle switches, familiar and unfamiliar instruments.  The physical essence of the ongoing processes in the onboard  equipment is changing, for example, in the automatic control  systems and in the piloting and navigational systems. In  addition, the piloting technique of the former and the new  aircraft sometimes differs substantially in the degree and rate  of motion of the control levers and the pedals and in proportion  to the increase in the sensitivity of the new aircraft to the  tilting of the control surfaces, precision is required in  distributing and changing your focus of attention.    These constructive changes, depriving the pilot of his usual  reference points, and the parting with the former piloting  techniques give rise to additional psychological stress and it  doesn't go easy on either the experienced pilot or the young  pilot. The new skills have not yet taken shape and the old ones  already can't be used to their full extent.    I don't think that I'll meet with objections if I say that  transferring your skills from one aircraft to another is not  only keeping in step with technological development, but it is  also a surmounting, even a breaking of established patterns in  one's consciousness, patterns leading to the automatism of  pilots' actions with the aircraft control systems. There needs  to be a restructuring of skills, but the established  habits/patterns prevent a pilot from perceiving this difference,  from going beyond the limits of the usual and mastering an  aircraft that requires a different type of piloting.  Psychologically, pilots are unequally prepared for that. The  novelty and complexity of the technology could give rise to both  unnecessary emotional experiences and caution (this is the  antipode of the concept "confidence in one's own powers"), as  well as self-confidence (as mentioned above). In conjunction  with the still insufficient depth of knowledge and the lack of  necessary skills, they will hardly be capable of quickly  mastering a new aircraft. The practice of switching pilots from  conventional to jet aircraft in the post-war years showed that  the main feature determining success was the emotional factor  associated with the novelty and the dissimilarity of the  equipment.    To master a fighter equipped with the newest control  systems,  with different sighting-surveillance devices, with missiles, to  learn to pilot it, is not a simple matter. But the burden of  mental and psychological stress becomes heavier when the pilots  are subjected to extreme situations which we call special cases  in flight.    In our time aviation technology has become more reliable.  Everything has been done to make flight safe, and not every  pilot will experience that extremely unpleasant feeling one gets  when an engine or equipment fails, or in other similar  unforeseeable situations. The majority of aviators have not run  up on situations like this in their entire flying careers. But,  on the other hand, the increased reliability of the equipment  gives rise to an exaggerated sense of well-being in pilots.  Their "contribution" is now being made by the automation of  aircraft control. Actually, this is a double-edged weapon.  Observing the instrument readings isn't equivalent to active  operations. When a man participates directly in aircraft control  he reacts incomparably more quickly to breakdowns than when  aircraft control is automated. In order to compensate for this  circumstance, he needs to maintain a greater degree of vigilance  in flight, to be in constant readiness to act in the event of  sudden breakdowns. But this means that pilots' nervous and  psychological stress will by no means decrease.    Much has been written about the effect of extreme situations  on a pilot's actions. It is still important for us to know that  the more reliable the equipment is and the less likely it is to  break down, the more unexpected these breakdowns are and the  more difficult it becomes to act. Let's consider one more trait  of the human psyche -- the fear of the unknown. It has been  noted that ignorance, as well as incomplete information, have a  negative effect on a person and reduce his emotional stability,  give rise to a feeling of uncertainty and sometimes confusion.    Pilots who have been in acute, critical situations when it  was necessary to act swiftly and precisely say that the hardest  thing was to determine the root of the situation and to  determine its cause. A good illustration of this point is found  in the story I heard told by a pilot at one of the aviation  units.    ...Carrying out the mission at an altitude of 12,000 meters,  I was going along, climbing slightly, when I saw on the speed  indicator that I was rapidly losing speed. What could have  happened? Having decided that the engine thrust was decreasing,  I brought the aircraft into horizontal flight, but the speed  continued to decrease. I shifted into descent. I quickly lost  altitude and I realized that to hesitate or to make a mistake  could mean death. Alas, that only aggravated the situation. A  feeling of heaviness came over my whole body, an unpleasant  sense of uncertainty in my own actions and fear of the unknown.  My hands seemed like they belonged to someone else, they didn't  obey me. I began to doubt the readings on all the instruments,  my gaze literally dashed all over the instrument panel. Under  normal circumstances I could see all of the instruments well,  but then in that incomprehensible situation my perceptions were  dim. I could only determine that the needle of the vertical  speed indicator showed descent. Constantly thinking about what  had happened, which instrument was wrong, it didn't occur to me  to report to the flight director.    But then I could tell from the aircraft control stick that  the speed of the aircraft had quickly increased; I heard the  noise that is characteristic for flight at a very great speed,  and I understood: the speed indicator had broken down. The  tension immediately subsided, and then I could clearly make out  on the instrument dials: rpms normal, oil temperature and  pressure in the engine -- unchanged. The ability to sense the  aircraft's operation by sound, and the knowledge of its behavior  at various flight speeds had saved the day. I went over to  piloting the aircraft using the back-up instruments and safely  returned to the airfield.    The frank confession of a rather experienced pilot who found  himself for the first time in a critical situation and his  actions under the influence of paralyzing fear is  understandable. He wasn't psychologically hardened enough to be  able to maintain his cool, his calculating nature, his  self-control. It's hard to say whether this pilot could have  spoken so openly about this flight if it had taken place at a  lower altitude.    I propose that we examine one more situation, which at first  glance is not similar to the previous one.    A fighter was taking off, swiftly gaining speed on the  takeoff run. It was already time to raise the front wheel when a  red light -- the danger signal, flashed before the pilot's eyes.  In the cockpit the signal light "oil pressure falling" blazed  on. The pilot braked and aborted the takeoff. Looking in the  periscope the pilot saw that the tail of the aircraft was  blanketed in a cloud of whitish smoke. Without thinking, he  leaped from the cockpit and quickly ran away from the plane.    Stop reading now, and, after laying your book aside, think.  We can anticipate your answers right now.    "The pilot's actions were correct," says the cautious  reader.  "The situation was threatening the safety of the flight."    "No," objects the thoughtful reader, "even though in itself  such a situation did threaten the safety of the flight, the  pilot did not have the right to abandon a disabled aircraft on  the landing strip."    "And what about the smoke that the pilot noticed behind the  plane?"    "That was more likely than not a cloud of steam from the  kerosene that got on the heated turbine after the engine was  shut down."    Who is right? I suppose that you should go along with the  evaluation of the thoughtful reader. And actually, if the pilot  had looked at one more instrument after the false activation of  the signal lights he would have seen that the oil pressure had  not fallen and that there was no cause for hasty actions. The  abandonment of a disabled aircraft on an airstrip created a  dangerous situation for other pilots making landing approaches.    It remains for us to explain why, then, the pilot was unable  to correctly analyze the unexpected situation.    "Inadequate familiarity with the equipment, insufficient  training," quickly responds the cautious reader, without  pondering, and he would be correct.    "And insufficient psychological training," adds the  thoughtful reader, and he would also be correct.    The cause of hesitant, erroneous actions, as a rule, is a  weak knowledge of the equipment. "That which I don't know, I  fear" is a timeless truism, not only for pilots. But judge for  yourself. Today aviation technology has become so complex that  in order to service it, not to mention to correct malfunctions,  as many as ten specialists are required, including engineers. Is  it then within the powers of one pilot laboring under an acute  deficit of time in flight to know the equipment well enough to  instantly recognize the breakdown, its cause, and to make the  sole correct decision? That is why there has long been and why  the concept for aiding the pilot in decision-making in  extraordinary situations brought on by the equipment itself  continues to make inroads.    We have already discussed in Chapter II onboard automated  self-diagnostic systems and systems for correcting malfunctions,  which support flight safety. Now it is important for us to  explain why a person who has mastered equipment sometimes  becomes flustered, bluntly put, why he acts incompetently if he  has to act under difficult circumstances.    There is little fuel in reserve, the weather conditions are  harsh, the airfield is unfamiliar, a group air engagement is  being conducted at low altitude, and in addition to the threat  of crashing into the ground, there is the added threat of  colliding with the other aircraft of the group, -- all of these  external irritants can have a great influence on a pilot's  psychological stability. We know of an incident where, under  similar grave circumstances, the flight director gave the  command over the radio "Eject!", but didn't give the radio call  letters. Upon receiving this unaddressed command, a pilot for  whom the message was not intended, abandoned his aircraft.    We don't wish to bring the reader into the discussion of  this  situation. We leave it to the conscience of the flight director.  But here is what comes from reading. You don't have safety  unless you have an understanding of the actual danger. There  isn't a pilot who has not been subjected to the emotional  influence of extreme situations, and the behavior of each pilot  is different. Some react calmly and confidently receive and  analyze a quantity of information, which under normal  circumstance would be impossible to process. Others lose their  self-control, commit errors, their ability to perform is  drastically decreased. Why? Perhaps the secret lies in the fact  that they are inadequately trained. Not just that. In his time  the famous Soviet pilot M. Gromov said: "In order to fly safely,  it is very important to know how to comport oneself, how to  overcome fatigue, uncertainty, and your own fear."    And so, in striving to overcome ourselves, we stop to ponder  two problems: what do we do to prevent the pilots' reactions  from being dulled, so that their mental and psychological  stability is not decreased when they find themselves in extreme  conditions; how do we learn to engage in combat and conduct it  while maintaining clearness of thought and level-headedness, not  yielding to fear and weakness of will.    When discussing these problems one must keep in mind the  totality of the factors giving rise to psychological stress  among flight personnel and to those factors, of a contrary  nature, which contribute to mental and psychological  conditioning (figure 42). Of course, the simplified picture does  not convey the entire diversity of these factors. But in this  case it is important to systematize only those factors which  will be reflected in our story. In addition, one should not  forget that a high degree of nervous psychological stress should  not be considered only as a negative phenomenon for pilots. This  is the normal reaction of any human being's body in response to  an increase in the intensity of work or to the presence of  danger. It is simply needed to mobilize the body's forces, to  increase psychological and physical endurance.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-95A>      Figure 42. Moral and Psychlogical Factors. </FIG>   <H5>  2. Is Bravery Necessary in Air Combat? </H5>   This question implies a simple answer: without bravery  achieving victory over the enemy is unthinkable. However, not so  long ago I happened to be an involuntary witness to a curious  argument apropos this matter. Waiting to receive the command to  depart, some pilots whiled away the time. After their encounter  the day before with veterans of a unit which had participated in  World War II, they were all impressed with the recollections of  fearlessness, of the unprecedented bravery of the comrades in  arms, of the heated dogfights in the skies on the front.    "And anyway, the romance of such dogfights is gradually  disappearing from our lives, and along with it bravery and  valour," said the echelon commander, air force pilot 1st class  Captain L. Ryzhkov. "Now in air combat you sometimes don't even  see your enemy."    "But is the enemy of today really less dangerous or less  insidious than the fascist aces?" the other pilot tried to  object. "And do you really think that less bravery is required  today in order to achieve victory in combat?"    "Combat conditions are not the same," Ryzhkov stubbornly  continued. "Judge for yourself," he turned to ask for support  from those around them listening with interest to the argument.  "Like infantrymen meeting in hand to hand combat the fighters  approached the enemy, penetrated into the very depth of the  enemy's battle order, shooting down the Hitlerites at point  blank range. Just as a lot less bravery is required of a soldier  firing a rifle compared to one wielding a bayonet, the same is  true of a pilot launching long-range missiles and destroying an  air target before he sees it with his own eyes. That is why,  first and foremost, our work requires a jeweller's precision in  calculations, accurate aiming, actions which are perfected to  the point that they are automatic, but by no means does it  require bravery. Indeed, the concept of `bravery' is becoming  meaningless."    "You are forgetting about close maneuvering air engagements  where the enemy is suddenly right in front of you..."    "If you don't know how to competently conduct long-range  combat," Ryzhkov ironically continued his colleague's thought.  "But, why count on incompetence? I'll tell you something else,"  growing angry and not allowing anyone to voice his objections,  he raised his voice. "As long-range weapons are developed,  direct contacts with the enemy in all cases are disappearing,  and along with them bravery and heroism."    The command to depart interrupted the officer's speech and  Captain L. Ryzhkov's pair took off to intercept an air target.  The argument was not finished.    Let's see how the pair's flight went. All the pilots'  thoughts were concentrated on one thing: to find the "enemy" and  to swiftly attack it. But the target went under cover of jamming  and performed a hard maneuver. They were unsuccessful in guiding  the fighters onto the target from the CP. Then the leading pair  received the command to seek out the target on their own. It was  not easy to find the target without help from the ground against  the background of jamming, and it became even more difficult for  the pilots when they detected the target in a place where they  had not expected it at all. In order to get into the necessary  position for attack the pair had to execute a series of drastic  and complex maneuvers. Finally, in the fighters' sights the  harmless sign of the target lit up steadily and they executed a  "missile launch" at the given range.    It looked like Ryzhkov, who had started the argument before  the mission was flown, was right. The interception was  difficult, but, in essence, everything came down to accurate  work with the weapons radar, knowledge of piloting technique,  and the use of well-known tactical methods. He rather  accurately reflected the crux of the changes going on in  aviational armaments. It is no longer necessary for aircraft  crews armed with long-range missiles to approach the enemy to  the point where there is visual contact. The battle can be  completed at the point where earlier the approach had only  begun. Of course, the inconclusiveness of the results of the  attack assumes a high degree of responsibility on the part of  the pilots for its success, but, on the other hand, the  attacking aircraft is farther and farther away from the enemy.  This creates an illusion of one's own safety and reduces the  emotional stress. But, then, the enemy in this interception only  defended himself, and the battle itself was a training exercise.    Yes, the pilot in a long-range air battle does not see the  enemy, but to make up for that he is under constant observation  (remember the AWACS system) and there is the continuous threat  of a sudden missile strike (the enemy also has new armaments).  Such factors have broadened the spectrum and scale of dangerous  situations considerably.    Consider the state of a pilot who does not see the enemy,  who  can't act against it, but at any moment he expects a strike, and  you will understand what a feeling of defenselessness he is  experiencing, what psychological stress, what prolonged nervous  tension is engendered by the invisible threat with which pilots  must constantly clash. And everyone knows that the enemy will do  everything in order "to blind" the interceptors with powerful  radioelectronic countermeasures, to frustrate their strike from  the maximum range, and the long-range engagement will develop  into a close one, which Captain Ryzhkov has tried to discount.    Having read Chapter II the reader already knows where close  combat takes place. In spite of the omnipresence of  radioelectronic equipment and the greater launching range of  missiles, close combat will not only remain, but will find a  wider range of usage. We will not repeat ourselves. One thing is  clear: Contemporary combat requires decisive actions to the  point of daring, but when faced with the enemy these give way to  anxiety, doubt, and fear of responsibility for one's decisions.  But if in a calm situation the pilot confidently flies his  aircraft, acts perfectly, is considered a master of his  business, it is still not known how he will conduct himself when  he encounters the actual enemy. Won't it seem to him or won't he  imagine that every step of the way danger is lying in wait for  him, danger that in actuality is not that great? Usually people  with these qualities do not act in the best manner.    And so, is bravery a necessity in combat? Doubt in this  engenders in the consciousness of people who are far from  detached, the erroneous, but, obviously, for them convenient  opinion that it is not all that necessary. Deception in itself  is intolerable because it implies the underestimation of the  enemy, and, moreover, cowardice. How then can one teach young  pilots to suppress and block out fear and uncertainty, to  develop the capacity for mental self-encouragement,  self-control; how can bravery, or, in a broader sense, high  levels of morale and aggressiveness in combat be taught?    These questions are not synonymous. Here, as nowhere else,  the limited nature of the old forms of combat training and the  inertia of thought and of old habits have left their mark, and  we are experiencing the results to this day. It must be  confessed that not all that long ago we judged the development  of the level of morale and aggressiveness in combat in extremely  simplistic terms and with totally unjustified optimism.    Who does not know that practice is needed to instill these  qualities, that they are inculcated under difficult situations  approximating combat activity? Nobody teaches as effectively as  an enemy acting actively, daringly, and unexpectedly. The very  circumstances force the pilots to mobilize all their powers and  will for victory. A passive enemy, who carries out all of his  tasks according to the book will not teach but will only create  the impression that it is a relatively easy and simple task to  achieve victory over him.    But peacetime is not war where dangers are real and deadly.  That is why we must not now avoid the specific conventions and  limitations which are dictated by the strict rules of flight  safety. To close one's eyes to that contradiction would be like  an ostrich escaping danger by hiding its head in the sand. We  have already run up against this situation when formulating  tactics (see Chapter V) and we know how dearly this can cost.    The most surprising thing is that the task of making the  circumstances approximate combat activity does not have any  obvious opponents. Everybody is "for" it. Numerous official  directives, training manuals, and articles in military journals  fight for this.    So many impassioned statements have been made in the  struggle  with simplifications and indulgences made to the worn-out target  for criticism. We'd like to avoid didactic instructions, but  what can you do when you hear things over the radio like:    "`Big', don't turn, we need a picture for the record." This  "brave" pilot prevails upon the crew of the target aircraft that  he is attacking and "big," curtailing the maneuver, shifts into  horizontal flight.    And so it happened that with the general approval of a very  sound slogan, practically all the responsibility for fulfilling  it was taken away from the commanders. It came to the point  where the only criterion for their work was that their flight  operations be accident-free and that they have a plan for  attack. Alas, in itself a great "fake" attack still does not  teach bravery, self-control, or presence of mind.    The power of the inertia of thought and of conceptions which  have formed over years is great. The stagnations,  oversimplifications, and overcautiousness which have developed  in the course of many years continue at times to be difficult to  overcome in the quest to develop combat morale attributes among  pilots. They are very much alive in our consciousness and  traditional ideas. We are accustomed to using the well-worn  words "bravery" and "courage" both in and out of place, to  glibly rattle them off. In this way the essence of these very  important ideas is devaluated, and then, the main sphere of  activity of the commanders and political officers, their great  personal responsibility for instilling their staff with high  levels of morale and combat aggressiveness.    We intentionally laid it on a little thick in order to show  the entire complexity of the contradiction: safety through  danger. How then do front line aviation commanders resolve this  contradiction; how can they successfully put pilots in really  difficult training situations?    "In the regular forces soldiers roll around in tanks,  missilemen have to their credit battle-noise simulators, smoke  candles, tape recordings of the roar of diving aircraft,  comprehensive training; in the radiotechnical troops morale and  combat aggressiveness are taught using sudden radar jamming,"  one of the commanders told me not long ago. "But we aviators  only have one way -- to simulate a complex air picture with all  its difficult to resolve situations, but to simulate it so that  it integrates tactics not only to train the crew professionally,  but also in a mental and psychological sense. Without this close  interdependence it would be impossible to instill the pilots  with a sense of military duty, a belief in their powerful  armaments, a will for victory, and finally, bravery.    "As before, we thoroughly study the enemy, the tactical  ruses  he might employ, and his capabilities, but we put our main  emphasis on elaborating models for combat situations with  varying degrees of difficulty. We work tactical problems into  them which enable the simulation of such emotional factors of an  air battle as lack of time and information, novelty of the  situation, its danger, uncertainty, and, in so doing, we control  the pilots' mental and psychological stress. Such models which  create an atmosphere of creative search, of justified risk,  impel people to acts of courage and initiative.    "The difficulties and dangers that pilots can encounter in  battle are also reflected in the variants of combat actions  which we have worked out. Perfecting these variants in practice  flights, not breaking the rules of flight safety, we all  understand that in battle it will be necessary to carry out  missions under far more difficult circumstances. Persistence in  achieving goals, keeness of wit, military cunning, the  employment of comprehensive methods of a mental and  psychological nature are in every way possible encouraged and  advocated. Otherwise, our combat training will simply become  tedious..."    We will interrupt the commander's story, with which one  can't  help but agree, and turn to the concrete matters of his  squadron. They are not at variance with his words. Here truly  the kind of situation is created which requires the bravery and  valour of the pilots. For example, in the squadron the rule has  been laid down to "destroy the enemy" with the first attack. But  how can this be achieved if the pilot does not approach the  target undetected, if he is not able to execute a daring  maneuver, if the attack itself is not daring and fulminant and  the "enemy" does not have time to react to it?    "The second attack might be the last for a fighter," a  squadron commander in my presence told one of his pilots, who  had complained about the mission being deliberately complicated.  "Forget that the enemy here is simulated."    Yes, destroying a target on the first attack is not a task  for the timid. Here conditionalities are reduced to a minimum.  The tension in the squadron is even greater when intercepting  radio-controlled targets. The pilots know that after pressing  the ordnance release button it is not a photographic target hit  verification device that is put into action, but a missile which  bursts out from under the wing towards the target. And if there  is no cloud from the explosion bursting in the sky and the  ground is not strewn with shapeless fragments, long after the  fact you still have to put up with the scornful glances of the  commander and your comrades.    These training routines, somewhat similar to the routines on  the front, show that bravery has not lost its meaning in our  times either. No matter what heroic deeds the pilots perform,  there is such bravery hidden behind that humdrum routine! The  ability to withstand great mental and psychological overloads,  maintain self-control and the readiness to take a risk -- all of  this is bravery.    And yet, bravery alone is of little worth, if it is not  based  on a profound knowledge of technology, if it is not bolstered to  a great extent by tactics. It is not all that easy to achieve  victory over the enemy of today. He is fairly well armed and  trained. One must be able to take into consideration all aspects  of the air picture, and to have skillful mastery of the  armaments. Courage and readiness to perform a heroic deed are  borne of persistent labor. Three-time Hero of the Soviet Union,  Marshal of Aviation I. Kozhedub, said that he had been convinced  many times: bravery without conditioning is like a blank round.  If one lacks enthusiasm, then one lacks the desire to become a  hero. This might be enough just for a brief flash, but not for a  long persistent struggle, because a struggle is work, and work  requires skill. But one cannot achieve victory over an enemy  without bravery. Without bravery a pilot will not set out to  perform a heroic deed.    However, there is another type of bravery, when a man will  fail to realize when danger is lying in wait for him or when the  lack of ability to realistically evaluate the situation and his  actions makes him fearless. This bravery comes from ignorance,  it is an irrational, presumptuous bravery associated with  vanity, with the desire to become famous, and that simply with  dare-devil behavior.    What fighter pilot is not familiar with the feeling of  combat  ardour, when before him is the powerful enemy, employing  tactical ruses! The young pilot was seized by such ardour. He  impetuously attacked the target and achieved victory. One  circumstance, however, dampens our admiration. In the dust of  the air battle he did not notice that he had created a G-force  that exceeded the permissible limit -- his hands had been  activated before his head had had time to think.    "A genuine fighter pilot should fight bravely in battle,"  shouted the pilot, his voice breaking, at the post-flight  critique when the commander upbraided him for a flagrant  violation of the flight mission and the safety regulations.    The commander stared at him. Anyone who has been in a  similar  situation knows that it is not necessary to say any more, but,  nevertheless, he answered:    "In your response there was more bravado than common sense.  Bravery was turned into the most elementary ignorance. Certainly  one can and must improvise in battle, since battle is fighting  against opposition, but that kind of bravery only indicates that  you do not know how to use your aircraft's advanced  capabilities."    Indeed, it is true. And today one comes across cases where  the young pilot acting on the best motives wishes to immediately  accomplish something heroic. Even the fear of punishment yields  to the desire to confirm one's reputation as a daring air  warrior. Alas, he does not yet have a real foundation under him:  knowledge, skills, and tactical mastery. Such "bravery" of  course is more than adequate for bragging, but not enough for an  unrepulsble attack.    And so, in answer to the question posed at the beginning of  this section, we can say that bravery was and remains a most  important component in the level of morale and combat  aggressiveness of all aviators. Bayonet strikes in the past  required a great deal of bravery, but less thought and  calculation. The essence of training today is to teach a pilot  to think tactically and to be brave in battle. This means that  there is now a need to more fully realize the spiritual  potential of a man -- the combat pilot, and on a higher level.  <H5>  3. Logical Patterns and the Unexpected in the </H5> Morale-Psychological Sphere    In the sky today there is no insidious enemy that would  strive with unexpected attacks to overwhelm the psyche of pilots  with surprise, to deprive them of hope for victory. Of course,  flight on contemporary fighter aircraft, as has already been  mentioned, is also associated with considerable mental and  psychological stress. But much of what has been predicted here  can be attributed to logical patterns, and falls into a logical  order. However, these logical patterns do not always work in  harmony; from time to time they are substituted by various  unexpected phenomena.    Which of our readers is not familiar with the situation  which  may be considered obvious: experiencing great mental and  psychological stress, even well-trained pilots quickly become  fatigued, their motor and intellectual reactions are reduced in  a routine air situation, but especially in a difficult one.    However, the opposite also happens: a pilot acts confidently  in a difficult situation, and in a routine one commits blunders.  What causes this? So that the blunder is not repeated, we must  understand, we must analyze this unexpected phenomenon. Leaving  the reader free rein for independent thought, we will turn to  the authorities.    Once the illustrious ace, Marshall of Aviation I. Kozhedub  was asked:    "When did the experienced combat pilots make mistakes on the  front?"    The answer was unexpected:    "Often this happened under the most routine of conditions,  because they let down their guard, they lost their vigilance,  they did not follow the air situation as carefully."    Actually, the history of World War II and other wars  contains  a host of similar examples. The same sorts of unexpected  phenomena are also encountered in today's training routines.  Those guilty of committing the errors are not novices but first  class pilots whose experience should serve to perfect tactics.  At the same time their less experienced colleagues, acting under  the same conditions, successfully perform analogous missions.    Our experienced pilots should not suspect me of being  disrespectful of them. I always have been and will be an admirer  of their mastery of flight, but the facts are stubborn things.  On one of his flight days the experienced pilot, as always,  confidently took his place in the cockpit of the aircraft and,  after starting up the engine, flew off to intercept an air  target. The takeoff, the approach to the designated intercept  point -- everything went as usual. The pilot received the data  for the attack from the CP, and there on the weapon radar  display the target blip lit up. The target didn't maneuver, it  wasn't covered by jamming, and, therefore, there was no doubt as  to the pilot's success. The pilot, firmly knowing the procedure  and the flight modes for interception and not considering the  mission difficult, did not exhibit particular zeal. When he  received the command from the CP he made some sluggish turns to  the correct heading, and the remaining degrees, as they say, he  made up mentally; almost mechanically he manipulated the  switches of the weapons radar. And what happened? The inaccurate  execution of the CP command, the lack of urgency, the  carelessness, the sluggish maneuver when approaching the target  not only hindered its interception, but almost caused a grave  incident.    Many at that time were puzzled as to why one of the most  highly trained pilots, whose successes had become commonplace  for everyone, suddenly committed errors which could only be  forgiven of a lieutenant who had only just begun to master  combat equipment.    The answer to this riddle "suddenly" was concealed in the  officer's overestimation of his own mental and psychological  attributes ("I know everything, I can do anything"), in his  insufficient responsibility for the performance of the mission  assigned him. In actual fact he had solid skills in controlling  both his aircraft and its armaments, but he did not know how to  control his will or his emotions, and, what is particularly  vexing, his excessive self-confidence and conceit undermined his  hope for accumulated experience. The pilot crawled out of the  cockpit in confusion and said only:    "It's not necessary to convince me or educate me. I  understood everything; skills have to be trained like muscles."    Unfortunately this is not an isolated instance. The smallest  inaccuracies and vexing blunders lead to the same negative  results from a pilot's lack of psychological concentration. All  you have to do is fall asleep at the switch for a second, lose  control of your actions for an instant, and you end up in a  situation that is disadvantageous for combat. Having detected  the "enemy" and skillfully exploiting the conditions of the  situation, the leader of a pair was able to approach the target  undetected. Tactical superiority was achieved before the battle  even started. Exploiting this advantage the leader decided to  attack the target simultaneously with the pair from the left,  but instead of the command "Attack from the left" over the radio  he uttered "Attack from the right." It is true, the leader  immediately corrected himself, but it was too late. The reader  has probably already guessed what the outcome of the battle was.  Correct: the supporting aircraft dawdled a little bit, the  "enemy" saw the fighters and started a head-on maneuver. The  battle was lost.    The commander considered that the cause for this was the  lack  of discipline of the leader who violated the rules of radio  communications. However, we can hardly agree with this. If his  actions are referred to as undisciplined, then one must  recognize them as conscious and deliberate. But that is really  absurd.    Just as in the previous episode, the cause of the defeat was  the same: the leader became complacent, let down his guard,  allowed his attention to stray and made a slip in his speaking.  He had flown a lot, and courageously, but with time his  fastidiousness had eroded, and he uncritically evaluated his  training. Is it possible to reconcile with that when the pilot,  instead of satisfying his tactical proficiency, which can always  be improved, experiences a false sense of infallibility and  allows carelessness when executing a maneuver or giving commands?    It is human nature to make mistakes, but psychological  mistakes are often deep-rooted and, therefore, very dangerous.  They still need to be revealed and their causes need to be  explained so that they can be counteracted with active  preventative and educational measures. Sometimes the mistakes of  experienced pilots are mentioned in passing, or not at all, so  that their authority is not undermined in the eyes of their  subordinates, sparing their self-esteem, hoping that the culprit  himself will correct the "accidental" slip-up. From time to time  such mistakes go totally "unnoticed," assuming that the fly  won't really spoil the ointment. Then one can only console  oneself with the fact that the negative experience in the given  case was just as useful as a positive one, although that does  not answer the question of what to do and how to do it in order  to solve a new problem.    And what about inexperienced pilots? With them the mistakes  have other sources. Most often they result from lack of  knowledge and know-how, which, as has already been mentioned,  intensifies the feeling of uncertainty and gives rise to  excessive tension. In order to spare oneself such mistakes, it  is sufficient to do some additional course work and training  sessions, and to carry out a few flights with an instructor.    And here is one more seemingly obvious logical pattern: a  rank of fighter pilots without a moment's hesitation agrees to  carry out any mission, even the most difficult. What's wrong  with that? The whole problem is that a pilot is untrained and  incapable of fulfilling the flight mission, but he reports his  readiness and then loses his presence of mind in flight, commits  flagrant errors, and does not even accomplish the assigned task.  Isn't his bravery deceitful? Indeed, because of it, not only  does the interception of a, perhaps, very important target not  take place, but the life of the interceptor is put in jeopardy!    What is the cause? It is based on a sense of false shame.  How  do you voluntarily confess and tell the commander that you can't  manage some difficult aerobatic figure or some air combat  maneuver that is a piece of cake for your comrades? Do you waive  your pride, become the target for sniping in the squadron, in  the regiment?    Pride, and sometimes an unfounded fear of falling into the  category of "wimps" makes a pilot conceal his doubt a bit deeper  within himself and urges him into the aircraft cockpit -- "maybe  I can manage." If the flight has a satisfactory outcome, the  pilot very rarely confesses as to what happened in the air. In  one-man fighter aircraft, where the pilot is deprived of the  advise and support of the other members of the crew, the sense  of false shame is all the more dangerous.    A pilot who is experienced, but who has had an inadmissibly  long break in his flight activity was assigned the task of  intercepting an air target and what happened was what one should  have expected: the man did not notice that the G-force had  increased beyond the permissible limit, he lost his head, and  the aircraft fell into a spin. We will not now judge the  decision of the commander who assigned this task which was  beyond the pilot's capabilities. But the pilot himself  understood very well that he might not be able to handle the  assignment, but he was afraid to report this. If that had been  the case, the officer would have been given additional training  classes and some transport flights. His prestige would not have  suffered as a result of this.    I am not going to burden the reader by recounting other  episodes where the sense of false shame stifled the voice of  reason. I will only say that to recognize your own weakness is  not easy and it is only within the power of men of principle who  possess great strength of will. But this means that anyone who  trains and leads pilots into combat must be a good psychologist,  must understand the motives behind the actions of his men, must  be very sensitive to those who, because of their own shyness or  desire not to fall behind their colleagues, do not hasten to  report their doubts.    For example, after an air combat flight the pilot reports to  the eschelon commander in detail what turned out better, what  turned out worse, he complains that he was not able, as he would  have liked, to attack the maneuvering "enemy":    "I did everything as I was taught, but a headlong attack  didn't work and I don't understand why."    Of course, analysis of the performance monitoring and  recording devices puts everything in perspective, and,  meanwhile, judging by the pilot's report, the cause of the  failure lies in his indecisiveness and sluggish maneuver when  approaching the target.    "I'm fed up with sickly people!", the indignant commander  grumbled aloud. "They don't have enough assertiveness, they're  afraid of being overworked."    The eschelon commander, the mentor and advisor came down on  the pilot for whom something had not worked out during the  flight, who had not been able to find the cause of the setback.  It could be that the officer really was rather afraid of being  overworked, but could there be another reason? Then -- a mutual  enmity, the pilot's uncertainty about his own capabilities. And  all around are the subordinates -- witnesses of this peculiar  analysis of the flight. But even without being a psychologist,  one can predict that hardly a one of them now feels like telling  the commander about his difficulties, confessing his doubts,  even if he had to, and the doubts remain. Without confidence in  people, without comradery, the commander cannot achieve mutual  psychological understanding with his men, and they cannot  analyze the reasons for their doubts and mistakes.    Can it be that these unexpected phenomena, which we have  exposed and traced in the morale and psychological plane, are  the inevitable costs of various human temperaments which can be  smoothed and concealed, but not totally neutralized? No, these  unexpected phenomena confirm a position that has been known for  a very long time concerning the preventive study and calculation  of factors (figure 42).    A surprising fact: in order to understand how an airplane  flies, the laws of aerodynamics are taught, but in order to  understand how a pilot flies, it is not considered obligatory to  teach the laws of psychology. And sometimes these factors, which  would seem at first glance to be common knowledge, are scorned.  But indeed within them are concealed a series of purely  psychological moments, promoting the assimilation of new  equipment, the perfection of tactical mastery.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   A man in combat should know how to overcome all difficulties  and dangers. But he is overcoming not only these, but also  himself. In order to manage his own will, emotions, and  consciousness it is necessary first of all to understand himself.    Imagine yourself in the role of a young, energetic pilot.  You  are pondering an upcoming difficult flight. You want to  objectively evaluate the dangers, to overcome your sense of fear  of the unknown, to feel a sense of confidence in your own  strengths. Who, but you yourself, can better judge you in all  strictness and frankness, remembering that bravery and courage  can be taught. And you, commander, before a flight look at each  pilot. Eyes in a wide open stare, the brows knit or, on the  contrary, raised high -- this is the typical expression of a  face showing excessive tension. Will you be able to count on  this pilot in combat? It is just not necessary to reproach him  for timidity or uncertainty if he himself is trying to overcome  these qualities in himself.  <H5>  OVERT AND UNDISCLOSED SECRETS </H5>   Before the book comes to a close, let's leaf through its  pages and sum up what we've read. What does it mean to master  the secrets of unrepulsable attacks? This is a book of overt  secrets. The principle of its structure was revealed in the  first pages. This principle recognizes completely the complex  multi-faceted phenomena of tactics and the practical realization  of the results achieved.    To master the secrets of unrepulsable attacks means:    --to be able to predict the course of events, to correctly  analyze the expected situation, to prudently plan the  engagement, to develop and employ tactical methods in various  combinations;    --to be familiar with and take full advantage of the  capabilities of your armaments, to quickly make the correct  decisions for their employment in combat;    --to be able to use military strategems in order to make the  enemy act in a way that is to your advantage and to be able to  turn the course of the battle in the required direction;    --not to procrastinate in making decisions and taking  actions, to look for and find reserves to win time when  preparing for the flight and in combat;    --to competently manage the engagement from the ground and  in  the air, creatively combining the wealth of potential of the  automated guidance systems with tactical thought;    --to possess a high level of psychological stability and  everyday morale so that one does not waver in extreme flight  situations and in combat with a strong enemy.    There are no secrets in these essentially well-known  positions, but if you do not strive to grasp them, it means that  you won't master the secrets of unrepulsable attacks. But that  is not all. How do you relate to innovations in tactics, what  are you pondering? Tactics is a creative matter. That is why,  from time to time, secrets occur that still need to be grasped.    The development of the tactics of fighter aviation entailed  quite a few steep turns. Part of what has been achieved has been  rejected, but as a result there has been a great return. Reading  the book and following its development, you have seen how some  methods of military action and tactic procedures have died out  or been thrown out, and others have been restored to life on a  new technical foundation.    Not everything that was successful in combat yesterday is  applicable today, but much remains unchanged. For example, in  the course of many decades attacks from the side of the sun have  played a significant role in fighter tactics. They have enabled  aircraft to approach the enemy undetected, and climbing in the  direction of the sun made it possible to break away from the  enemy. Radar weapons aiming systems and guided missiles have  supposedly brought about an unconventional form of camouflage  using the sun. But, it turns out, that with the appearance of  heat-seeking missiles, deviation toward the sun, which for them  is jamming, has once again become an effective tactical method.  Or, let's turn to weapons and attacks on head-on courses. There  was a time when daring "suicide" pilots who had worked for these  attacks with the emergence of missiles were ridiculed. What an  anachronism, they say, in an age of supersonic jet technology.  But attacks on a head-on course have not only experienced a  revival, but they are the basis of long-range air engagements,  and to make wisecracks sounds more like a limp joke.    Such is the incessant movement of tactical thought. Each  generation of commanders and pilots reveals the secrets of  unrepulsable attacks in its own way, based on a broader sphere  of knowledge and its own comprehension. We go forward, we  accumulate tactical wisdom, but aviation technology is  perfected, the air enemy changes, and the secrets remain. The  tactical methods found by us withstand with ever greater  difficulty the test of time. Even in the time it took to publish  this book, some of what has been said in it is already outdated;  it now belongs to the past, and the future is reality.  Therefore, in spite of the variety of the existing methods, we  must constantly and urgently uncover the new secrets of  unrepulsable attacks and seek ways to achieve victory over a  strong, intelligent, and brutal enemy. These secrets are part of  the eternal problems of tactics. No matter how much has been  said and written about them, they will never be exhausted.    Something else is evident. Good tactical ideas can be  discredited by a weak material base which does not satisfy the  tactical requirements. There are also facts of another sort, of  an, as we say, "local significance." Occupied with the everyday  pressures of work, we unfortunately continue to think in  outmoded terms, to employ tactical methods of days gone by, and  in order to theoretically justify that way of acting, we allude  to the rich experience of the past. But attempts to cling to old  experience by calling it combat tradition signifies a stagnation  in tactics. That's when "blank spaces" occur where, based on  sound reflection, they shouldn't be.    But we're not talking about those "blank spaces" here.  Unexposed secrets (the reader also encountered them on the pages  of the book) are an objective logical pattern of tactics. Which  aspects of today will be transferred into the future? Which  combat action methods promise the greatest success? These are  serious questions, and you don't have to be particularly astute  to predict that the answers to them won't be specific enough.  Alas, the science of tactics does not reveal its secrets that  easily.    Let's just consider this: there are secrets that in the  meantime have not been fully revealed. Ahead of us are numerous  studies, calculations, generalizations of experience, the  development of hypotheses, and the definition of their details.  One thing is certain: we must seek out ways to understand  unrevealed secrets even with the most long-term perspective in  complex situations of conflict, in a cunning interlacing of  combat maneuvers.    Looking into the future of fighter aviation tactics, we will  see pilots conducting combat on unfamiliar aircraft, employing  armaments and electronic warfare means which are unknown to us.  The enemy's aircraft and armaments will be unfamiliar. What will  be familiar is the bravery and courage, the combat activity and  initiative, and the tactical training of the fighter pilots.  They will remain that crystal ball through which the entire  dialectic of the secrets of unrepulsable attacks is viewed.    COPYRIGHT: A.B. Krasnov</p>

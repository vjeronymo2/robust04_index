			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Bomb explodes near Tube station A BOMB exploded yesterday evening in a car parked near Woodside Park Underground station in north London. Scotland Yard said that vehicles were damaged but nobody had been hurt. The station is above ground near the end of the Northern Line. The bomb exploded less than an hour after a coded telephone warning had been given to the AP news agency by a man who said he was from the IRA. The agency said the caller named Woodside Park, saying that a large device was in position. The caller said there were '15 minutes to clear the station'. Police evacuated the station and a nearby school and the Tube line near Woodside Park was closed through the night for searches. The scene of the blast is about a mile from Inglis Barracks where one soldier was killed and nine injured in a bombing in August 1988. Yesterday's blast follows the introduction of random police road checks in central London and in Manchester, where 64 people were hurt in two blasts last week. The IRA has threatened a Christmas bombing campaign on the mainland.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Announcer Sergey Medvedev] Who  would have thought that after the fighting at the beginning of  the week, the Georgians and Abkhazians would agree on peace at  the end of it. But that is what seems to have taken place.    Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov was able to  bring representatives of the warring sides to the negotiating  table in Moscow, and they found a common language. Now, the  appropriate agreement is expected to be signed on Monday [4  April], in the presence of Russian and UN officials. Andrey  Kozyrev, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a special  interview for our program, explains what exactly has been  achieved over the past few days. [video shows Andrey Kozyrev  speaking to unseen interviewer]    [Begin Kozyrev recording] Agreement has been reached on,  firstly, a cease-fire and no resumption of shooting, which is  extraordinarily important and of course a condition for talks to  switch from the language of the gun to that of political  settlement.    Secondly, there is agreement on a complete return by  refugees. Thank God, a formula has been found that conforms to  international standards. I do not want this to be famous last  words, but the formula corresponds to the UN's approach. The  essence of this approach is that everyone can return, with the  exception of a very small group of people who could possibly be  accused of direct participation in and guilt for military  crimes, and so forth. I think that this will be the first step  in further progress toward an Abkhazia settlement.    The second step could be establishment of economic links and  solutions to a whole range of other issues, such as confidence-  building, and so forth.    And of course, of course, at some stage the question of  status and all these legal issues is bound to arise. If you  look at the agreement you will see that Russia is involved not  only diplomatically. We will retain our presence and  participation. A whole range of UN organizations will be  actively involved in resolving these issues, but I want to  stress once again that, of course, people can only be convinced  by their own consciences and their responsibility before their  nations.

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Independent chiefs consider auction as last resort An auction for Newspaper Publishing, owner of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday, has not been ruled out if satisfactory bids are not received soon, Raymond Snoddy writes. Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman of the loss-making newspaper publisher, is becoming increasingly exasperated by the delay in receiving a formal bid for the company from the consortium put together by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder of The Independent. Pressure is being put on the consortium, which includes Mirror Group Newspapers, to submit a bid as soon as possible. Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Independent Newspapers of Ireland, is likely to submit a counterbid soon after this, possibly with another newspaper group. If the process becomes so delayed that the future of the titles is threatened, a clear option for the non-executive directors would be to hold an auction, although that would be seen as a last resort.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Germany moves to protect jobs in east THE German cabinet yesterday launched an emergency programme to prop up the east's fragile industrial base and protect 400,000 jobs. The scheme includes subsidised financing for foreign construction contracts and the extension of export credit guarantees to barter deals with east European customers who are chronically short of foreign exchange. Bonn has also promised to double federal purchases from east German companies and pay premium prices for goods and services. Most of the increase is likely to come from the defence, interior and post ministries. The main aims are to maintain the former GDR's export links with eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and to open up new markets in western countries. However, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, who proposed the scheme, was told it must be financed out of existing resources. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said on Tuesday that current annual transfers from the west of DM150bn (Pounds 59bn) marked the limit. Mr Mollemann had claimed earlier that his proposals would need more than DM10bn a year. However, under the stern eye of the Bundesbank, the government is committed to a public spending freeze. Approval of the scheme coincided with an appeal for action from the federation of German industry (BDI). The existence of the east's entire capital goods industry - which accounted for 38 per cent of total industrial sales - was in danger, it said. Western companies, meanwhile, were concerned that falling production and order intake in their factories signalled further economic weakening, the BDI said. The effects of the sluggish recovery in export markets had been exacerbated by a 10 per cent increase in unit labour costs since 1990 and the recent appreciation of the D-Mark. It was becoming increasingly difficult for them to contemplate investing in the east. A report from the respected DIW and IW economic institutes, based in Berlin and Kiel respectively, said the eastern economy was still stuck in a deep crisis. A poll of 2,500 industrial companies had shown around 60 per cent suffering from lack of competitiveness. The proportion rose to more than 80 per cent among companies still owned by the Treuhand privatisation agency. According to the economics ministry, 150 Treuhand companies employing 200,000, had been hit hard by the collapse of markets in the former Soviet Union and east Europe. Their suppliers, employing a further 200,000, had been similarly affected. East German mechanical and electrical engineering and vehicle manufacturers, which had expected to make up to 60 per cent of their sales in former Soviet and east European markets, were in most need of help. As an immediate measure, the government has agreed to auction more than DM1bn-worth of unsold stocks to the highest bidder. Any losses will be covered by the Treuhand. It has also offered up to DM45m a year to subsidise loans to east German contractors bidding for infrastructure contracts in Poland, Hungary and the Baltic states.</p>

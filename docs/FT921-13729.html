			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / International Company News: Air France improves in second half AIR FRANCE, the state-owned airline, broke even at the operating level, or might even show a small profit in 1991, after making heavy losses in 1990, said Mr Bernard Attali, the chairman, Reuters reports. The improvement, plus cash from asset sales, meant its second half made up for a disastrous first one. It should lead to a net loss for 1991 of about FFr700m (Dollars 127m), Mr Attali said. He gave no exact figures, as the 1991 accounts are still being prepared.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Chile may have to cut 1994 budget CHILE may have to cut its 1994 budget because of the continued sharp impact of the international downturn, according to Mr Juan Villarzu, the man widely expected to be named finance minister after general elections on December 11. Mr Villarzu, economic co-ordinator for presidential frontrunner Mr Eduardo Frei, said the next administration would 'probably be obliged to revise the 1994 budget which was made when copper prices were higher. . . and with the expectation of 5 per cent growth'. Chile had planned a 5.4 per cent budget increase next year to Dollars 11.4bn (Pounds 7.6bn). Weak prices for Chile's principal exports - copper, cellulose and fishmeal - meant that growth next year would probably be around 4 per cent, he said. The next administration would seek to implement a 'slightly different monetary and fiscal mix' by bringing in a temporary tax, possibly on petrol, which would allow an easing of interest rates. Such a combination would encourage investment and slow the appreciation of the peso. Mr Villarzu is likely to pursue broadly similar policies to those of the current finance minister, Mr Alejandro Foxley, a fellow Christian Democrat.</p>

Sir Ketumile returned home from Harare last night,  where he attended a one-day meeting of the OAU ad hoc committee,  which discussed a number of trouble-spots in Africa,  particularly South Africa.    The Harare meeting was opened by President Robert Mugabe of  Zimbabwe, who regretted that some black leaders like Chief  Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom Party have allowed  themselves to be manipulated by ultra-rightists within the white  community who are opposed to the democratic process in South  Africa.    He urged all parties opposed to next month's multiparty  election to learn from the recent events in Bophuthatswana,  which showed that no amount of repression can stand in the way  of a people hungry for freedom and its right to  self-determination.

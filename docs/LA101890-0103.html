			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BITES  </P> <P> The following are capsule reviews of some of the better restaurants recently  visited by our critics:  </P> <P> The 24-page menu at Jack's Restaurant and Deli offers everything from Mexican  and American to vegetarian food and deli. The beers alone come in 136  varieties. Try the sweet, tangy baby-back pork ribs or the Mexican dishes,  which are particularly good. Jack's is in Westlake Plaza Shopping Center,  Westlake Village; 495-8181. Open every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Monday-Thursday 7 a.m.-midnight; Friday 7 a.m.-1:30 a.m.; Saturday 7:30  a.m.-1:30 a.m.; Sunday 7:30 a.m.-11:30 p.m. Dinner for two, food only, $19-$52.  </P> <P> You can go to Santa Barbara's crown jewel, the Four Seasons Biltmore Hotel, for  more than just the atmosphere or the Sunday brunch buffet. The kitchen is now  among the best in town, turning out wonderful dishes from lobster sausages to a  bittersweet chocolate souffle. Better at dinner than at lunch. Either the  indoor La Marina or the sparkling outdoor Patio makes for romantic dining. The  Four Seasons Biltmore is at 1260 Channel Drive, Santa Barbara; 969-2261.  Serving in the Patio weekdays 6:30 a.m.-10 p.m., weekends 6:30 a.m.-11 p.m.  Serving in La Marina weekdays 6-10 p.m., weekends 6-11 p.m. Lunch for two, food  only, $30-$48. Dinner for two, food only, $50-$70.  </P> <P> The pub at Victoria Pub and Restaurant is a lively gathering place for English  expatriates and pub lovers alike. It stays open until everyone goes home, and  the dart games never stop. The more subdued restaurant serves an English menu,  complete with steak and kidney pie, fish and chips, and Cornish pasties. The  soups, which change every day, are excellent, as is the lamb steak. And you  don't have to be British to appreciate the desserts. The crumble of the day  with hot fruit, sweet crumble and cream is particularly good. Victoria Pub and  Restaurant is at 1413F S. Victoria Ave., Ventura; 650-0060. Lunch is served  every day from 11 a.m.-3 p.m. Dinner is served from 5-9:30 p.m., and the pub is  open until 2 a.m. Dinner for two, food only, $25-$60.  </P> <P> The flowing hot springs at Wheeler have drawn people to their therapeutic  ambience since the early 1800s. Today, you can enjoy them along with a massage  and a fine dinner. The menu changes every week, and the vegetables and herbs  come from the restaurant's own gardens. The restaurant at Wheeler Hot Springs  is located at 16825 Maricopa Highway in Ojai; 646-8131. Dinner is served from  Thursday-Sunday 5-9:30 p.m., and Sunday brunch is from 10 a.m.-2 p.m. Dinner  for two, food only, runs $52-$68.  </P></p>

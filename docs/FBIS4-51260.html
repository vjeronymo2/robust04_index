			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] The State Economic and Trade Commission recently  decided to launch a campaign among enterprises across the  country to change operating mechanisms, improve management, tap  internal potential, and raise economic efficiency while  deepening the regulations on changing enterprises' operating  mechanisms. The campaign, which will be initiated this year, is  aimed at providing guidance to enterprises on tapping their  potential, improving quality in an all-round way, better  adjusting themselves to the market, and competing in the market.    A State Economic and Trade Commission spokesman recently  briefed reporters on the campaign's purpose and demands. He  said: The purpose of launching the campaign is to proceed  steadily in establishing a modern enterprise system in  accordance with the need to develop a socialist market economy  so as to lay the microeconomic groundwork for the market  economy. Through the campaign, we will strive to raise or  improve, with appreciable results, enterprises' technical and  economic indexes for product development, quality, energy and  raw materials consumption, capital turnover, and safety over the  next two to three years. We will raise the leading economic and  technical indexes of more enterprises, bring them up to or close  to advanced international levels. Deficit-ridden enterprises  will reduce their losses or turn losses into profits, and the  general level of enterprise management will reach a new high.  We will bring about remarkable improvements in managing basic  affairs, financial matters, on-site operations, general affairs,  and operating and marketing matters. Enterprises, which are  basically well-managed and outfitted with advanced technology  and equipment, should move toward advanced international levels  in operation-related management.    The spokesman said: To assess the campaign's results, we  will generally adopt the single-index listing format. Each  year, all localities and departments will list, index by index,  the results of given industries as measured against specified  evaluation criteria; they will then publish the results.</p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / N-weapons deal will cap Bush-Yeltsin summit PRESIDENT George Bush will arrive in Moscow this evening for a farewell summit meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. It is to be capped by the signature of an historic agreement cutting the US and Russian nuclear arsenals by around two thirds. They are expected also to discuss Russia's economic reforms, as well as relations with other former Soviet republics - especially Ukraine, whose failure to fulfil its pledge to get rid of the nuclear weapons on its soil is viewed in Washington as one of the most critical threats to efforts to control the nuclear threat. But Mr Bush has less than three weeks to serve before he hands over power to President-elect Bill Clinton, so little of substance is likely to be transacted. Nevertheless, diplomats in Washington expect Mr Bush to use the meeting to press for Mr Yeltsin's co-operation in stepping up pressure on Serbia to end hostilities in Bosnia. On his way home, Mr Bush will stop in Paris for dinner with President Francois Mitterrand, and will try to win his backing for a tough UN resolution allowing the enforcement of the no-fly zone over Bosnia - as he sought that of Mr John Major, the British prime minister, at a meeting last month in the US. The broad outlines of the nuclear missiles agreement which Mr Bush and Mr Yeltsin will sign tomorrow, known as Start II because it builds on the framework of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty signed by the two superpowers in 1991, were agreed at their last summit in Washington in June. The US and Russia have agreed to deploy no more than 3,000-3,500 strategic nuclear warheads by the year 2003, with a separate limit of 1,750 warheads deployed on submarine-launched missiles and a complete ban on the use of multiple warheads, known as Mirvs, on land-based missiles. It has taken six months to resolve technical disagreements over issues such as the conversion of silos protecting one banned type of missile to enable them to house smaller missiles, but US officials said the delay in completing Start II has also reflected Mr Yeltsin's difficulty in selling the agreement to his military commanders and to nationalist politicians on his right. The agreement throws out the principle of strict parity that has pervaded earlier US-Soviet arms treaties by setting a band of 3,000 to 3,500 warheads. Mr Yeltsin said in June he intended Russia to aim for the lower end of this band, while the US is expected to end up closer to the upper limit.</p>

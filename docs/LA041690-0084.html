			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT CONCERN COMES TO FORE IN O.C.;  </P> <P> ACTIVISM: RECENT EVENTS HAVE SPARKED A SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT THE QUALITY OF  LIFE -- AND SOME ACTION.  </P> <P> After years of being accused of having no environmental heartbeat, Orange  County is showing signs of life.  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach oil spill, malathion spraying over much of North County  and final development plans for Laguna Canyon have all fueled public concern  and spawned a new collection of activists -- even politicians -- pushing  environmental causes.  </P> <P> Grumbling opposition has always existed to growth, offshore oil drilling and  traffic congestion in Orange County, but only recently has this concern been  forged into action. And environmentalists are already outlining a county  environmental agenda for the 1990s that includes planting 1 million new trees,  mandating recycling and banning or sharply reducing the use of ozone-depleting  chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons.  </P> <P> "Five years ago, people were generally in a state of bliss. Most folks were  happy, pursuing the Orange County dream," said Brian Jacobs, chairman of the  recently formed Orange County Environmental Coalition. "But now people are  conscious of what is going on. They look around and realize this isn't the same  place. And they are upset."  </P> <P> Even state and federal lawmakers from the county are talking up environmental  topics and issues. U.S. Rep. Robert K. Dornan, the ultraconservative Garden  Grove Republican, conceded that he has softened his stand on offshore oil  drilling and now considers himself a moderate "Pete Wilson-style Republican" on  some environmental issues.  </P> <P> Developers too are feeling the heat. Billionaire Donald Bren found himself  suddenly across the table from Laguna Beach environmentalists after activists  last fall helped turn public opinion against his company's Laguna Laurel  project.  </P> <P> More than 8,000 people marched against the proposed development at the mouth of  Laguna Canyon, a winding chaparral-covered gorge leading to the famed art  colony and the Pacific beyond. And many of the protesters were not from Laguna  Beach -- a marked difference from past rallies and one of many signs that the  environment is now an issue troubling residents across Orange County.  </P> <P> Newport Beach activists in recent months have been enlisted to help rural  residents east of Orange challenge another Irvine Co. proposal to build more  than 12,000 homes on the edge of the county's dwindling backcountry.  </P> <P> Anger and fear over malathion spraying to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly  has spurred many otherwise passive residents to turn out at city halls and  street corner demonstrations from Brea to Garden Grove to protest the aerial  pesticide assault.  </P> <P> And along the coast, scores of people -- mothers with small children, merchants  and students -- flocked to the oil-fouled shores of Huntington Beach and  Newport Beach in early February, volunteering to sop up the petroleum that  spilled from the wounded tanker American Trader.  </P> <P> But some observers wonder whether the rush to embrace environmental causes  reflects genuine concern that will last in a county noted for its growth and  consumption. Or will it slowly evaporate after next Sunday's nationwide  observance of the 20th anniversary of Earth Day?  </P> <P> Rallies and speeches decrying development, polluted air and failed leadership  are not enough to sustain the movement, veteran environmentalists warn. Some  even fear that once the hoopla and headlines surrounding Earth Day end, so  might the surge in grass-roots interest in repairing the region's tattered  environs.  </P> <P> "Born-again environmentalists are sprouting everywhere in the spring sunshine,"  said Richard Arklin, a member of the radical environmental group Earth First!.  "Right now, it's the thing to do. It's hip to sign up. Everybody is talking  environment. But let's see how many stick with it. Remember what happened 20  years ago?"  </P> <P> After a burst of activism and unity following the first Earth Day in April,  1970, Orange County's environmental movement splintered and by the early 1980s  was nearly invisible. In a conservative county where President Reagan was  revered, those who talked about excess and growth controls were not. The  economy was expanding, traffic problems were still largely confined to  rush-hour commutes and open space -- although disappearing -- was not yet a  burning issue.  </P> <P> Only a handful of single-issue groups, waging high-profile campaigns to protect  upper Newport Bay, the Irvine Coast and the Bolsa Chica wetlands, home to  several endangered bird species, carved out sizable followings.  </P> <P> "Most environmentalists were in the closet," said Lorraine Faber, past  president of Amigos de Bolsa Chica, a Huntington Beach-based group that has  fought since the mid-1970s to preserve the Bolsa Chica wetlands. "There was a  lot of environmental bashing going on. We were considered freaks bent on  destroying Orange County."  </P> <P> That changed. Concerns about quality of life increasingly preoccupied those  living and working in a region where computer chips replaced citrus as a  leading cash crop. By the late 1980s, the bubble had burst, and Orange County,  for all its wealth and splendid weather, was choking on its own success.  </P> <P> Overcrowding, clogged freeways and suburban sprawl had touched a nerve. Talking  and acting environmental moved into the mainstream.  </P> <P> "People began encountering environmental issues on a daily basis," said Mark  Chamberlain, a Laguna Beach photographer who has actively campaigned to halt  development in Laguna Canyon. "They would wake up to watch stories about global  warming on the morning news programs, then get on the freeway and drive  bumper-to-bumper to work in the smog. The problems were inescapable and it  finally started dawning on people."  </P> <P> Tom Walkins, a Greenpeace activist, views the wave of new converts more  cynically: "Propose a freeway, housing tract or shopping center in someone's  back yard and watch how quickly he becomes an environmentalist."  </P> <P> Elisabeth Brown, chairwoman of Laguna Greenbelt, credits Measure A, the  countywide slow-growth initiative that was defeated in 1988, for igniting the  environmental fires, particularly in South County. Even though the measure was  defeated, 56% to 44%, it sent a message, she said, "that the masses were angry.  They wanted business as usual to stop. The environment was now more important  then new shopping centers, movie theaters and houses."  </P> <P> Twenty years after the first Earth Day, observers such as political consultant  Robert Nelson believe the county's environmental movement is on firmer footing.  It has a better chance of sustaining itself, Nelson says, because of the  county's robust economy and what he called the "environmental ethic" of the  baby boom generation.  </P> <P> "We've had a long period of peace and prosperity, so most people aren't worried  about war or finding a job. Their attention has turned to other things, like  the environment," said Nelson of Nelson/Ralston/Robb Communications in Costa  Mesa. The environmental bug was bound to bite Orange County because, he said,  "concern is highest among educated people, like baby boomers, who were raised  with a greater sensitivity to the environment.  </P> <P> "And baby boomers are running this county now."  </P> <P> Activists are better equipped today to tap new recruits. After years of waging  lopsided struggles against bigger and better-financed foes, county  environmentalists have emerged more sophisticated politically and seem ready to  set aside differences to support each others' causes. Computers, databases and  fax machines have become invaluable weapons, allowing the county's 50 known  environmental groups to swap mailing lists, the lifeblood of groups short on  cash and long on need for volunteers.  </P> <P> For example, organizers of last November's Laguna Canyon march -- which some  say helped prod the Irvine Co. to reconsider its 3,200-unit Laguna Laurel  project -- electronically recruited key environmental figures by fax, who in  turn attracted thousands of protesters.  </P> <P> "Computer technology is allowing us to network like never before," Faber said.  "We are no longer isolated groups, acting independent of each other. It's much  different than 10 or 15 years ago."  </P> <P> Evidence of this environmental awakening is everywhere.  </P> <P> Membership in the Orange County chapter of the Sierra Club has jumped to 9,420.  "For years people joined as a way to go on outings," said Alan Lopez, the  club's local membership chairman. "But we've picked up 1,400 new members in  less than a year, and most sign up because of environmental concerns."  </P> <P> High school and college campuses countywide are hotbeds of environmental  activism.  </P> <P> At Cal State Fullerton, a small band of students last year formed the  Rainforest Action Club to discuss the destruction of tropical rain forests,  valued as major oxygen producers. The group now meets weekly and has a mailing  list of more than 200, including a dozen professors. Members even sent a small  donation recently to the Costa Rican National Park Service for rain forest  replenishment.  </P> <P> In Newport Beach, overflow turnouts are common when Corona del Mar High  School's six-month-old environmental club meets.  </P> <P> "I was astounded. I didn't think it would fly," said Maya Decker, a biology  instructor at the school and a longtime Audubon activist. "The goal is to  change lifestyle patterns. But at first when I talked about water conservation  and the importance of four-minute showers, some of the kids looked at me like I  had come from another planet. A four-minute shower is an alien concept to most  people. But now I think we're getting through."  </P> <P> Troubled by Orange County's consumptive prowess and astounded that with all the  county's resources, wealth and brain power there was no game plan to slow the  trend and heal the deteriorating environment, businessman Tom Larson called  activists together last year for a chat. What resulted was the "Guide for  Environmental Restoration in Orange County," a collaborative effort by a wide  range of parties to set an agenda of environmental issues and goals.  </P> <P> "People realize that future generations can't enjoy the rate of consumption and  growth that has distinguished this county," said Larson, an executive with a  wholesale Irvine nursery. "We are not seeking to derail progress, or halt  growth, but send a message that a strong economy must be built on a strong  environmental base."  </P> <P> On a personal level the message appears to be hitting home.  </P> <P> A recent Times poll found that 77% of county residents have become more  interested in the environment within recent years. Moreover, a vast majority  support new government regulations, such as mandatory recycling, to cut waste  and protect the environment.  </P> <P> Six Orange County cities offer some form of curbside collection for recyclable  items, including glass bottles and jars, aluminum and tin cans, plastic soda  and milk containers, newspapers and even cardboard. Half a dozen other cities  are considering similar programs. Currently, an estimated 175,000 to 200,000  county residents voluntarily participate in curbside recycling in Anaheim,  Brea, Costa Mesa, Laguna Beach, Orange and Irvine, which was the first city in  the county to adopt a program in September, 1987.  </P> <P> "When we started the program we were hoping for 40% participation," Irvine  Mayor Larry Agran said. "But it's over 70%, and that tells me people are  looking for ways to get connected to the environmental movement."  </P> <P> But in general, environmentalists say county officials and political leaders  have been unresponsive and ineffectual in curbing growth and development, which  is blamed most often for many of the area's ills. They complain that government  planners are too busy promoting growth-oriented projects rather than seeking  solutions to overcrowded roads and dwindling open space.  </P> <P> "How come our leadership is trying to get trains from Las Vegas to Anaheim but  hasn't uttered word one about a countywide recycling program or appointed an  environmental coordinator," said Sherry Meddick, a longtime backcountry  activist and founder of the Rural Canyon Residents Assn., who now works for  Greenpeace. "We don't have environmental leaders. We have environmental  followers."  </P> <P> Don R. Roth, chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, defended the  proposed high-speed rail link with Las Vegas, saying it will also carry weekday  commuters to the county from the boom towns of San Bernardino and Riverside  counties, easing traffic on area freeways. As proposed, the train will be  privately financed, a direction Roth said government must take to solve transit  and other environmental problems.  </P> <P> "Government just doesn't have the resources to solve all the problems," Roth  said. "The initiative and money increasingly must come from the private sector.  And we've got to act now."  </P> <P> Environmentalists share Roth's urgency because the impact of the county's  explosive growth -- and its effects on the environment -- are everywhere.  </P> <P> Orange County generates more trash per capita -- 2.1 tons for every man, woman  and child -- than any county in the nation. The region's chronic air pollution  -- identified in a recent Times Poll among county residents as the No. 1  environmental threat -- is the worst in the nation. And the county's high-speed  growth will taper only slightly in the coming decade with 300,000 new arrivals  pushing the population to more than 2.6 million by the year 2000.  </P> <P> "It's really sad, but this county is becoming strictly an urban area," Cal  State Fullerton biology professor Jack Burk said. Noise, congestion and  pollution, he said, have driven many people indoors. "In the 1970s, people  wanted housing with big yards. But now they don't want any outside space. . . .  They want to isolate themselves in environmentally controlled homes where it is  always 72 degrees.  </P> <P> "They have their VCRs, computers and Nintendo games. We used to play croquet,  badminton and tennis outside. Now we go to ritzy clubs and play indoors. It  seems people are retreating from the environment."  </P> <P> Others, like art photographer Carol Havens, have even left Orange County,  trading away established careers to live in quieter and less spoiled  surroundings.  </P> <P> A native Southern Californian, Havens had lived in Laguna Beach for two  decades, but a year ago she and her husband moved to a small island north of  Seattle, Wash. It became "harder and harder" to remain in Orange County, she  said. The bulldozers and giant earthmovers reshaped the hills she "loved  photographing." Then came the houses, "row after row. And even if you couldn't  see them, you could feel them. You knew they were there from traffic, the  congestion."  </P> <P> "Every time we'd go for a drive around South County or toward the mountains,  I'd end up in tears," she said. "It's expensive to live Orange County. But it  had always been worth the price -- the weather, the people, the work. But the  environment got to the point where it wasn't worth the price any more."  </P> <P> Even some developers -- long perceived as the villains in the county's  environmental equation -- are coming around to the notion of "environmental  balance." Peter Denniston, president of Signal Landmark Corp., which waged a  15-year battle to build homes, a marina and restaurants at the Bolsa Chica  wetlands, said that if developers "are not willing to find a balance, show some  sensitivity to the environment, they shouldn't be in the business."  </P> <P> A year ago, Signal Landmark and Amigos de Bolsa Chica reached an agreement that  allows construction of homes on 412 acres in the wetlands but eliminates plans  for a 1,400-slip marina, hotels and eateries. About 1,104 acres will be left as  open space or wetlands, where scores of migratory waterfowl nest and feed,  including a pair of endangered bird species.  </P> <P> "Environmentalists used to be considered extremists, fringe types who were a  threat to property and political values," Denniston said. "No more. Being  environmental is now middle America."  </P> <P> EARTH DAY EVENTS  </P> <P> A calendar of some of today's Earth Day highlights in O.C. B2  </P> <P> </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION: FIVE PROFILES  </P> <P> Five who are having an impact in the Orange County environmental movement:  </P> <P> Gary C. Gorman, 44, of Huntington Beach spearheaded a campaign to restore a  dying 25-acre salt marsh near the mouth of the Santa Ana River, making it  habitable once again for scores of migratory birds, including several  endangered species. This week, nearly five years after helping launch the  effort to revive the Talbert Marsh, Gorman will be honored by the U.S.  Environmental Agency in Washington for his work to save coastal wetlands, which  have all but vanished in California. Gorman, a Long Beach firefighter, admits  that he did not know what wetlands were before he helped bring local, county  and state officials together to restore the Talbert Marsh along Pacific Coast  Highway east of Brookhurst Street. Now he is regarded as an expert. "He has  been a tireless worker, an example of somebody who decided to make a  difference," said Louann W. Murray, a UCLA professor.  </P> <P> Richard Kust, 57, of Irvine is president of the 2,500-member Sea and Sage  Audubon Society. He helped negotiate an unprecedented agreement last fall with  the Irvine Co. requiring a series of mitigation measures and changes to protect  wildlife and reduce the density of the company's 12,500-unit planned community  in the hills east of Orange. "Some viewed the agreement as a sellout. . . . We  viewed it as an opportunity to shape a project that was going to be built one  way or another," said Kust, a part-time business and computer instructor at Cal  State Fullerton. A 20-year county resident, Kust was involved in Friends of  Newport Bay before joining the Audubon group nine years ago. He is one reason  the group is more politically active today, speaking out on a range of  environmental issues. An active member of the newly formed Orange County Fund  for Environmental Defense, Kust is a major proponent of creating a Santa Ana  River park, a series of greenbelts and recreation areas along the river.  </P> <P> Tom Larson, 43, of Irvine was the catalyst behind a 26-page document that is  now considered Orange County's first environmental manifesto: A Guide for  Environmental Restoration in Orange County. It was Larson who carried the idea  a year ago to the county's diverse environmental groups in hopes of unifying a  fragmented movement. "He is part of the new wave of environmentalists," said  Elisabeth Brown, a veteran activist who heads the Laguna Greenbelt. "He got a  bunch of us into a room, and even more amazing we agreed on something. I didn't  think he could pull it off. He is very sincere." Larson, a horticulturist who  is executive vice president of a wholesale nursery, said the scientific  evidence about the environment's deterioration became "so obvious" that it was  time to act. He is not aligned with any specific group, but supports the newly  organized Orange County Environmental Coalition.  </P> <P> Sherry L. Meddick, 36, of Silverado Canyon has been a backcountry activist for  more than a decade, challenging efforts for developments in the hills and  canyons of eastern and southern Orange County. In the backcountry where  residents are fiercely private and opposed to organized movements, she has  successfully united diverse interests under the Rural Canyon Residents Assn.  She is aggressive, unwavering and highly outspoken. "At times she's viewed as  part of the environmental movement's shock troops," said Audubon official  Richard Kust. But she is also knowledgeable about complicated land-use issues  and laws, a point even her opponents concede. At hearings, it's not uncommon  for an appointed official to publicly seek her opinion. "No matter her style,  she gets results because she is impeccably prepared," said one county planner  who has opposed Meddick on several projects. To work on regional issues,  Meddick recently took a position as field director for the Los Angeles office  of Greenpeace.  </P> <P> Jean H. Watt, 63, of Newport Beach has successfully moved from the ranks of  environmental activist to elected official without losing touch with her  activist roots. In 1988, she won a seat on the Newport Beach City Council after  helping guide the group SPON (Stop Polluting Our Newport) for more than a  decade. The group twice in the 1980s thwarted the Irvine Co.'s expansion plans  for Newport Center, a major office and retail complex that includes Fashion  Island. She also played a significant role in the eventual compromise with  company officials over development of the Irvine Coast (now known as Newport  Coast) south of Corona del Mar. Since her election she tried to win support for  a city ordinance restricting the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons,  and is pushing to win adoption of curbside recycling in the beach town. She is  also vice president of the Orange County Fund for Environmental Defense.  </P></p>

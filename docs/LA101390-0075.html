			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> BANK ROBBED FOR 2ND TIME IN 2 DAYS  </P> <P> An Oxnard bank was robbed for the second time in two days on Friday,  authorities said.  </P> <P> A man robbed the Wells Fargo Bank at 460 Esplanade Drive in Oxnard at 1:50 p.m.  and escaped on a bicycle -- but not before a red-dye packet that clings to  clothes and skin exploded on him, said Gary Auer, agent in charge of the FBI's  Ventura County office.  </P> <P> After the man asked the teller for money, he was given a red-dye packet with  the cash. After he left the bank, the dye packet exploded, giving off smoke and  gas, Auer said.  </P> <P> Witnesses told authorities that they last saw the man peddling through a large  parking structure with a stream of red smoke trailing after him.  </P> <P> FBI officials believe this is the first bank the man has robbed in the area. He  was described as a white man in his mid-20s, about 5 feet, 6 inches tall with a  slim build and blond hair. He was wearing a light blue striped shirt and light  blue denim pants.  </P> <P> On Thursday, a man suspected of nine county bank robberies and one attempted  robbery robbed the Oxnard Wells Fargo.  </P> <P> In that case, a dye packet exploded and the robber was chased into the street,  Auer said. The man fled into a housing complex. Undercover police agents staked  out the area and arrested an Oxnard man about two hours later, Lt. Stan Myers  of the Oxnard Police Department said.  </P> <P> Jose Luis Villareal, 19, was being held on suspicion of bank robbery and for  outstanding misdemeanor warrants, a jail spokesman said. Villareal is also  believed to be responsible for a bank robbery in the San Fernando Valley, Auer  said. CAROL WATSON  </P></p>

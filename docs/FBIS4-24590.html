			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 30 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam Monday [30 May] asked his ministers to prepare for  every possible contingency after the breakdown of talks between  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    Kim was addressing a security-related cabinet meeting at  which various means of coping with the DPRK's nuclear issue were  discussed.    The DPRK and the IAEA reached no agreement during their  talks  in Pyongyang last week over refueling at the DPRK's 5-megawatt  nuclear reactor.    The IAEA claimed in a statement that the DPRK had rejected  the IAEA's proposal for inspection to ensure that no fuel was  being diverted to make nuclear weapons.    Monday's meeting was attended by South Korean Prime Minister  Yi Yong-tok, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the National  Unification Board Yi Hong-ku, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu,  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and other senior government  officials.    The meeting decided that South Korea would strengthen  cooperation with the countries around the Korean peninsula --  the United States, Japan, China and Russia -- and study possible  action in case the nuclear issue is referred to the United  Nations Security Council.    "The efforts of the government and the international  community to peacefully solve the North Korean nuclear problem  are facing a grave challenge as Pyongyang has ignored the  international community's demands and pushed for replacement of  fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon," President Kim  told the meeting.    Kim urged the DPRK to immediately stop discharging the fuel  rods, saying that "the selection, storage and measurement of  fuel rods are indispensable to securing the transparency of past  nuclear activities as well as ascertaining the non-diversion of  nuclear material."    The meeting also decided that South Korea will continue to  try to solve the nuclear issue through dialogue ahead of the  regular meeting of the IAEA's Board of Governors scheduled for  June 6.    The South Korean Government plans to hold a unification and  security policy coordination meeting this week to draw up  detailed measures following Monday's meeting, official sources  said.</p>

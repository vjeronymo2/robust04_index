			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Laura Beck] </F>   [Text] British nuclear experts yesterday came under fire  for their attempts to allay Hong Kong's fears of any danger from  Daya Bay following a one-day visit to the nuclear site. A  legislator labelled the trip a "publicity" stunt and a waste of  time. The British experts said that Daya Bay posed no danger to  Hong Kong, but environmental groups and legislators disagreed.    And Reverend Fung Chiwood, an outspoken Daya Bay critic,  attacked the visit of the two experts as a waste of time because  they offered no suggestions or advice to Hong Kong about the  plant. "I feel that they are doing publicity and public  relations in Hong Kong rather than giving advice," Rev Fung  said. "It was a waste of time, energy and money because they  didn't give any suggestions and only said there was no problem.    "What is the use of 10 monitoring stations in Hong Kong if  we  are not in danger? "If there were a minute accident then water  and food could be affected and people would be affected," he  said.    Chris Willby, deputy chief inspector of nuclear  installations  in Britain, said there was a high level of commitment to the  plant at the moment, and that for the foreseeable future it  would be run efficiently. "The plant is designed to high  international standards and I gained an overall favourable  impression," Mr Willby said.    "I am satisfied that if there was an emergency there is no  doubt that Hong Kong would be told quickly, although it is  difficult to say how much time because we have no control over  information links in China.    "There is a political commitment to nuclear power in China  so  this plant will get the resources," he said.    A spokesman for Friends of the Earth said: "The point is  that you can design a nuclear plant as safely as possible, but  accidents still occur and you can't rule out human error.  Telling us we are safe is not enough, and the government needs  to demonstrate that all systems are in place if there is an  emergency.    The spokesman said the contingency plan for Hong Kong was a  concern of Friends of the Earth. At a test in August police and  the government seemed not to know what their functions were.    Mr Willby stressed the need for China to maintain good  public  relations so people were informed of what little risk there  really was at the plant. "No people will die from nuclear power  plants this year and more than 600 will be killed in  aeroplanes," he said.    Frances Fry, assistant director with the United Kingdom  National Radiological Protection Board, said she was very  pleased with the visit and was satisfied with the contingency  plan procedures in place. "You are not in danger here but the  import of foodstuffs from the affected area should be checked if  there was an accident," Ms Fry said. "All parts of Hong Kong  are sufficiently far away (from Daya Bay) so it is not possible  to envisage a mass exodus."</p>

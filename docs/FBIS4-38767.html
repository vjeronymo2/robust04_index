			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking in parliament Wednesday morning, President  Leonid Kravchuk offered lawmakers to amend the law on the  delimitation of powers between Ukraine and Crimea "by envisaging  more powers for Crimean authorities."    Simultaneously, he called for correcting Ukraine's laws on  the security and police services so that Crimea's "so-called  power structures" be unconditionally subordinate to the central  authorities.    He proposed an early reform of Ukraine's Constitutional  Court, which, in his opinion, is called upon to abolish all  Crimean administration decisions as "illegal." He motivated  such a reform by scarce powers of the Supreme Soviet, which, in  his words, "can only suspend illegal autonomy acts rather than  abolish them." He is ready to submit as soon as possible for  parliamentary endorsement candidates to Constitutional Court  judges.    He spoke in favour of a subcommission to be set up in  Supreme  Soviet to deal exclusively with Crimea's problems and accepted a  proposal to set up within the cabinet an office of a  vice-premier on territorial issues.    Stressing his desire for a peace settlement without  conflict,  Kravchuk pointed out that "calm and peace are possible only if  the Crimean leadership recognized the priority of Ukraine's  Constitution and laws. He observed for this reason that "power  in Crimea has been taken over by the party that proclaimed as  its strategy Crimea's secession from Ukraine and its return to  Russia."  IF Note: May 30 marked the expiration of Kiev's ultimatum to  Simferopol, which was demanded to reverse its decision to  restore the May 6, 1992 Constitution. The dual citizenship and  formal bilateral ties envisaged by the Constitution have proved  unacceptable for Kiev. As Interfax has learned from  parliamentary circles in Simferopol, at a session of the faction  of the Russia bloc of parties -- the major Crimean parliament's  faction -- lawmakers found it inexpedient to go on its decision  and reconsider the Constitution.    Kravchuk believes that the situation in Crimea might be  greatly improved by an early solution to the Black Sea Fleet's  problem, above all setting up separate naval bases for Ukraine  and Russia.    As the chief Ukrainian negotiator to negotiations with  Crimean lawmakers, Boris Oleinik has reported to Interfax that  Crimea may be discussed in the Ukrainian parliament in linkage  with the Black Sea Fleet's problem on Wednesday.    The main task for the Ukrainian delegation is to "find out  whether Crimea's parliament is in principle prepared to make  concessions and abolish its last decisions as unconstitutional".</p>

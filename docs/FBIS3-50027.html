In a statement issued on the occasion of the current visit  by  a Council of Europe delegation to Slovakia and given to CTK  today leaders of Romany organizations of the Kosice district  represented in the Association Council of Slovak Romanies  protested efforts by Hungarian parties to create an autonomous  ethnic territorial unit with "exceptional" rights for ethnic  Hungarians in southern Slovakia.    "Apart from other non-Hungarians at least 200,000 Romanies  also live in southern Slovakia. Although they have declared  themselves to belong to the Hungarian minority, national  minority rights which are being fully enjoyed by ethnic  Hungarians have never been applied to Romanies," the statement  says.    The Romanies appealed to the Slovak Government, parliament,  and Council of Europe not to confine themselves to dealing with  "pseudo-national" claims, but to at last stop the economic  decline of Slovakia and to pay more attention to abolishing the  reasons for the impoverishment of Slovakia's population.    The government and parliament do not respect Romanies'  views,  ideas, and proposals concerning their own cultural development.  By hiding their heads in the sand they support intolerance  towards Romanies and condone their "spiritual genocide."    According to a spokesman of the Union of Romanies Civic  Initiative, Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac is to meet  with Romany representatives in Kosice in the near future.</p>

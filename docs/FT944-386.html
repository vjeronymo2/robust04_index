			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Whitehall pay A report out today claims that the UK's senior civil servants are among the best paid of their breed in the world. The European Policy Forum's paper is a useful antidote to Whitehall's self-serving conventional wisdom, which holds that Britain's top officials are comparatively poorly rewarded. The problem is to know how to make the comparison. Because overseas comparisons are difficult, and the City down the road, the tendency of late has been to size up permanent secretaries against senior private sector executives and to declare them poor. There would be some justice to such comparisons if the civil service were in competition with the private sector to fill its top posts. But it is not. The new executive agencies have made serious attempts to recruit in the private sector and, where successful, have in some cases paid chief executives in excess of Pounds 100,000 plus bonuses. But Whitehall proper remains a closed club, with permanent secretaries almost invariably appointed from inside. It will not be long before the pay of agency bosses becomes the yardstick for Whitehall, and is used to justify large salary increases. This should be resisted. There are good reasons for continuing with the status quo: not least the fact that there is no shortage of first-rate civil servants. A case can be made for adopting the EPF's proposal to apply private sector disciplines to Whitehall by linking senior officials' salaries to performance contracts, as in New Zealand. But until such a decision is taken, it is inappropriate to portray Sir Humphrey as the poor relation of his Rothschild cousins.</p>

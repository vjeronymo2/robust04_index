			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Paying for Nature's violence - Eric Short on why insurers are re-assessing premiums in areas of Britain most prone to severe weather LOOK carefully at the map. If you live in an area shaded X or Y, then it is a high-risk storm area - and you can expect your buildings insurance premium to be altered accordingly. Gone are the days when insurers charged one rate for the whole country - effectively putting householders into one big pool, with the low risks subsidising the high. Now, underwriters are splitting the country into separate areas according to their risk factors. Underwriters take five major risks into account when setting rates for insuring buildings: fire, flood, storm, frost and subsidence. Of these, storm and subsidence generally cause heavier claims. Most fires are confined to a particular building, so the risk can be controlled and damage minimised. Floods tend to be localised in well-defined areas, usually affecting only a few hundred buildings at most. Damage caused by frost can be widespread and, in the past, a sudden freeze-up has led to massive claims for damage from burst pipes. But lagging exposed pipes in new houses is now standard and most residents of older properties have learnt from experience to do likewise and take other precautions. Underwriters are less concerned about cold spells than they used to be. It is the storms of winter and a succession of dry summers that have played havoc with claims. Insurers shudder to think about the great storms of October 1987 and January 1990, and the summers of 1988-91. Using past claims information and large-scale geological maps, underwriters have been assessing the subsidence risk nationally and now have a clearer picture of its extent. Assessing storm risks proved trickier, mainly because there was not enough data over an extended period. Storms still occur infrequently but, when they do, the damage is widespread and costly. The climatic research unit at the University of East Anglia has, however, examined 47 major storms between 1920-90. This helped to provide the material from which the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries produced a report last year on Storm Rating in the Nineties. For the first time, underwriters now have a clear picture of storm frequency in various parts of the UK (as shown on the map) - although, interestingly, the institute found there was no conclusive evidence of an increasing trend in storm losses, or to support the global warming theory. Underwriters now are assessing these storm patterns, together with their own claims' experience, to establish the changes that should be made to buildings insurance rates. The map shows that people living in most of Scotland have the highest risk - more than 180 per cent of the average. But Scots have known this for decades and have built their houses to withstand the weather. Thus, the likely premium increases will be much less than one would expect from the risk factor. The areas most likely to be affected adversely by premium increases are the next highest-risk areas of Kent, Sussex, Cornwall and northern England, where the storm risk is 130-180 per cent above average. Houses in these regions generally were not built to withstand ultra-severe weather and claims have hit insurers hard in recent years. While builders now are adapting new homes to cope better with storms, existing properties remain exposed to the next blast. So, if premium rates are increased in these areas, house-owners will know why. Conversely, owners in central England may anticipate a reduction in rates because of their below-average storm risk.</p>

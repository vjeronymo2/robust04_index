			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Francisco Forteza: "Cuban Leader Says United </F> States Is Isolated in Blockade against Cuba"]    [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 7 Feb (PL) -- Today, Carlos Lage,  vice president of the Cuban Council of State, said the United  States is increasingly more isolated in its blockade policy  against Cuba.    In an interview with PRENSA LATINA at the end of his  official  six-day visit to Brazil, which concluded in Rio, Lage said an  example of this isolation is the UN General Assembly's approval  of resolutions against the U.S. embargo for two consecutive  years.    He noted that the second time, more countries supported the  resolution.    The 44-year-old Cuban vice president indicated this is the  result of Cuba's refusal to renounce its socialist principals  and the admiration this position produces in the world.    Regarding Washington's lifting of the embargo against  Vietnam, Lage said this is the result of "the heroic Vietnamese  struggle and victory," and makes it even more evident to  international public opinion that "the U.S. blockade against  Cuba is unjust and cruel."    In Brazil, the Cuban leader and the delegation accompanying  him visited Sao Paulo, Brasilia -- the capital of the country --  and Rio de Janeiro. They met with President Itamar Franco,  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso, and Health Minister Henrique Santillo.    Shortly before ending his visit, Lage said he found, in the  aforementioned officials, a great understanding and a firm  attitude against unilateral measures, like the blockade against  Cuba and the so-called Torricelli Law, which seeks to influence  third countries with the objective of attacking Cuba.    Carlos Lage, one of the Cuban Government's officials in  charge of the economy, said the objectives of his official visit  to Brazil were to contribute to the development of bilateral  political, trade, and economic relations in general, to promote  important scientific cooperation agreements in the field of  agricultural, and discuss issues of interest to Latin America.    Brazil, he underscored, is an exporter of food and  industrial  products that Cuba needs, but he clarified that he wants trade  with the South American giant to be balanced.    He indicated that the increasing amount of exports to the  Brazilian pharmaceutical market will contribute to that  stabilization. A $30 million contract for Cuban sales of those  products was signed this year.    He emphasized that Cuba owes Brazil $48 million and it is a  debt that still needs to be completely paid, but it will be  eliminated through the growth of bilateral trade.    Regarding the vaccine against type B meningoccic meningitis,  which Cuba manufactures and which Rio authorities requested to  fight an outbreak here, he indicated a Brazilian national  commission is still examining it in order to approve it being  imported.    He added Cuba can wait for those results because its health  authorities are convinced the vaccine is effective, given its  parameters comply with all international regulations and was  successfully used in Cuba during a mass immunization campaign.    In the area of general Brazilian-Cuban cooperation, he said  Brazilian firms provide specific services to companies with  concessions for petroleum-producing studies in Cuba, but he  stated there were no talks on petroleum during this visit.    In the agricultural field, he expressed Cuba's interest in  intensively studying Brazil's experience with alternating sugar  cane and soybeans crops in the same soil.    Regarding Cuba's situation, he said it is expected that in  1994, along with economic growth in tourism and the production  of domestic petroleum, there will be an upsurge in other  economic sectors that have been in decline.    This will depend, he clarified, on various factors,  including  the fluctuation of prices on the international market, and,  because of the complexity of that situation, he suggested  caution in making predictions.    Finally, regarding Cuban predictions for economic relations  with the United States if that country lifts the blockade, Lage  said that in the last few months the Clinton administration has  intensified the blockade and approved the Torricelli Law.    "At this time, we are not yet in a condition to anticipate  that situation with the United States," he stressed.</p>

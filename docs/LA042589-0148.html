			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FEDS ASK OUSTER OF LAWYERS FOR AMERICAN CONTINENTAL  </P> <P> Federal regulators, battling the parent company of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan,  told a U.S. district court judge Monday in Phoenix that lawyers for American  Continental Corp. should be removed from the case because of a conflict of  interest.  </P> <P> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance  Corp. filed papers asking the court to disqualify the Houston-based law firm of  Sheinfeld, Maley &amp; Kay because it still represents FSLIC in a Texas court  and knows the agency's litigation strategy.  </P> <P> An American Continental lawyer also revealed that Beus, Gilbert, Wake &amp;  Morrill, a Phoenix law firm helping Sheinfeld Maley, could have a similar  problem because it represents the FDIC in the takeover of a Phoenix-based  savings institution. Under President Bush's rescue plan for the S&amp;L  industry, the FDIC is managing S&amp;Ls at which the FSLIC serves as  conservator.  </P> <P> "Having been advised of a potential conflict, and it appears well taken, I'd  advise using other counsel," U.S. District Court Judge Paul G. Rosenblatt told  attorneys for American Continental. His comment, however, was not a ruling.  Lawyers will return to court Friday  </P> <P> The loss of Sheinfeld Maley could be a blow to American Continental's own  strategy. The law firm had helped the company devise the plan that included  American's April 13 petition for bankruptcy reorganization. The company also  put 11 Lincoln subsidiaries, but not the S&amp;L, in bankruptcy. Regulators  seized Irvine-based Lincoln the next day.  </P> <P> Monday's arguments came in a suit American Continental filed to stop the  regulators from removing officers and taking other actions at the 11 Lincoln  subsidiaries in bankruptcy. The judge has ruled that the company can go to  trial over the agencies' rights in operating the subsidiaries.  </P> <P> In another motion filed Monday, attorneys for Star Bank in Cincinnati asked to  intervene in American Continental's lawsuit. The bank represents about 11,000  holders of American Continental bonds and notes, bank lawyers said.  </P> <P> FDIC attorneys said the agency will oppose Star Bank's motion.  </P></p>

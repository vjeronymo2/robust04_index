			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Recovery in car sales faltering The recovery in west European new car demand faltered in February, with sales rising by less than 1 per cent to 926,000 units from 919,000 a year ago. In January, sales increased by around 7 per cent year-on-year, halting 12 months of unbroken decline in the European market. In the first two months of the year new car sales at 1.96m were an estimated 4.1 per cent higher than a year ago. Sales in the whole of 1993 fell by 15.2 per cent to 11.45m units, the steepest decline in the post-war period. The renewed weakness in demand comes as the European Commission and the Japanese Ministry for International Trade and Industry resume negotiations today in Tokyo on the level of Japanese car and light commercial vehicle exports to the European Union this year. Sales in the EU fell by 15.9 per cent to 11.74m vehicles last year, while direct vehicle exports from Japan to the EU were reduced by 18.4 per cent to 980,000 units. The Japanese share of the European market rose slightly, however, as a result of increasing Japanese vehicle production in Europe. Last month a recovery in sales in France and Spain and a strong increase in the UK as well as in several smaller European markets helped compensate for the continuing steep decline in new car demand in Italy and the weakness of the German market. In February new car sales were higher than a year ago in 12 of 17 markets across west Europe. Demand rose year-on-year by 14.8 per cent in the UK, by 8.2 per cent in France and 6.1 per cent in Spain. New car sales fell by 15.7 per cent in Italy, however, following a drop of 20.4 per cent in 1993.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                          January-February 1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Volume   Volume      Share (%)   Share (%)                       (Units)  Change(%)   Jan-Feb 94   Jan-Feb 93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET        1,963,000     +4.1       100.0        100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen group      317,000     +0.0        16.1         16.8  -Volkswagen          216,000     -0.0        11.0         11.4  -Audi                 47,000     -7.0         2.4          2.6  -Seat                 46,000     +3.9         2.3          2.3  -Skoda*                8,000    +32.6         0.4          0.3 General Motors***     252,000     +9.6        12.9         12.2  -Opel/Vauxhall       241,000     +8.7        12.3         11.8  -Saab**                9,000    +40.7         0.4          0.3 PSA Peugeot Citroen   245,000     +7.8        12.5         12.1  -Peugeot             143,000     +2.7         7.3          7.4  -Citroen             102,000    +15.9         5.2          4.7 Fiat group****        235,000     -4.8        12.0         13.1  -Fiat                180,000     -1.4         9.2          9.7  -Lancia               31,000    -15.0         1.6          1.9  -Alfa Romeo           21,000    -16.1         1.1          1.4 Ford***               234,000     +5.9        11.9         11.7  -Ford Europe         231,000     +5.8        11.8         11.6  -Jaguar                2,000     +8.1         0.1          0.1 Renault               197,000     -0.4        10.0         10.5 BMW group*****        125,000     +6.1         6.4          6.3  -BMW*****             61,000     -3.2         3.1          3.3  -Rover*****           64,000    +16.7         3.3          2.9 Mercedes-Benz          74,000    +45.5         3.8          2.7 Nissan                 69,000     +7.9         3.5          3.4 Toyota                 49,000     +0.2         2.5          2.6 Volvo                  33,000    +24.2         1.7          1.4 Mazda                  29,000     +0.0         1.5          1.6 Honda*****             23,000     +9.3         1.2          1.1 Mitsubishi             19,000     -2.8         1.0          1.0 Total Japanese        214,000     +0.7        10.9         11.3 MARKETS: Germany               485,000     +1.7        24.7         25.3 Italy                 345,000    -12.8        17.6         21.0 United Kingdom        344,000    +17.9        17.5         15.5 France                265,000    +11.2        13.5         12.6 Spain                 115,000    +15.6         5.9          5.3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *VW holds 31 per cent and management control of Skoda. ***Includes cars imported from US and sold in western Europe. **GM holds 50 per cent and management control of Saab Automobile. ****Fiat group includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Innocenti, Ferrari and Maserati. *****BMW is acquiring 100 per cent of Rover group, 80 per cent from British Aerospace and 20 per cent from Honda.

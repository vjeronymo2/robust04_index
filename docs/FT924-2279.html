			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Mortgage cover causes concern THE GOVERNMENT said yesterday that it was concerned about a planned change in mortgage indemnity insurance that would make it difficult for the owners of private flats in local-authority tower blocks to sell their properties. The main mortgage indemnity insurers are negotiating with lenders to tighten policies so that societies will normally be unable to get insurance for mortgages on former council flats in blocks above seven storeys in height. The Department of the Environment said it was worried about the 'seven-storey clause', put to lenders in a contract drawn up by four insurance companies. It said it had made representations to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. The clause would be awkward for the government because it would limit the value of council flats bought under 'right-to-buy legislation'. Although flats were sold at discount, it might cut their value below that price. The clause is among a series being negotiated between insurers and lenders. The insurers are estimated to have lost Pounds 3bn in the wave of house repossessions of the past three years, including defaults among former council tenants, while gaining only Pounds 750m in premiums. Legal &amp; General, one of the four companies providing most indemnity insurance, said it would insist on keeping the clause, which would make lenders seek approval for mortgages on council-block flats in order to gain insurance. Mr Dane Douetil, a director of Special Risk Services, a Lloyd's insurance broker, said the talks were causing 'a great deal of tension' because insurers were insisting on indemnity policies becoming both more expensive and restrictive. The main terms of new mortgage indemnity contracts were agreed by insurers and lenders in September. They replaced the old formula for indemnity payments with one that makes lenders bear at least 20 per cent of the loss. The insurers have insisted that lenders bear some of the future loss to make them take more care over lending. The two sides were unable to agree the subsidiary clauses by September, though, and a new deadline for agreement of January has been set. Among the clauses are provisions to end insurers' liability if lenders are defrauded by borrowers. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chairman of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said the lenders understood that insurers wanted to tighten the terms of mortgage indemnity insurance, but it was likely to lead to restrictions in lending.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL MISCELLANY;  </P> <P> NAMES AND NUMBERS  </P> <P> How Do You Figure?: Dave Stewart of the Oakland Athletics was 8-0 when he lost  his first game to the Baltimore Orioles last season and 6-0 when he lost his  first to the Orioles this season. He is 47-21 against the rest of the league  since the start of the 1987 season and 0-5 against the Orioles.  </P> <P> No Jose: In Jose Canseco's absence, A's right fielders began a weekend series  with the Milwaukee Brewers with no home runs, 14 runs batted in and a .256  average. Then there's designated hitter Dave Parker, who had 11 RBIs in the  first 10 games of the season but has had only one since April 13.  </P> <P> Home Sweet Home?The Houston Astros, who have not had a losing season in the  Astrodome since 1975 and only three in their 25 years there, are 6-12 in the  dome this year.  </P> <P> Superiority: How convincingly has it swung to the American League West? Through  games of Thursday, the West was 90-64 against the East, a .584 percentage.  </P> <P> On the Brink: The Philadelphia Phillies, who have four pitchers on the disabled  list and used nine different starters, are concerned about the status of their  top draft choice of 1986, USC's Brad Brink.  </P> <P> The 24-year-old right-hander suffered a slight rotator tear at Maine last year,  chose rest over surgery, aggravated the tear in his last start at  Scranton-Wilkes-Barre Tuesday and now will have an operation. He is expected to  be sidelined at least a year.  </P> <P> Signs of Age?Former Angel Bob Boone has been charged with only one passed ball,  but he's been behind the plate when Kansas City Royal pitchers have delivered  13 wild pitches and baserunners have stolen 14 times in 19 attempts.

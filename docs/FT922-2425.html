			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Sears responds to dissidents SEARS, Roebuck, the US retail and financial services company, responded this week to shareholder discontent by making changes to the way the company is governed. At a special meeting in Chicago, the directors decided to make shareholder voting completely confidential. They also required directors to hold at least 1,000 shares of Sears common stock and removed the company chairman from the committee that nominates members of the board of directors. The committee will now be entirely composed of outside directors. The board also lowered the retirement age for directors and trustees of its profit-sharing fund to 70 from 72, but it will allow serving directors to continue their terms until aged 72. Mr Edward Brennan, chairman, said: 'The board has listened to our shareholders and has adopted a series of measures which we believe are both responsive and in the best interest of the company.' Mr Brennan also said the board would elect one or more outside directors during 1992. However, the measures did not go nearly as far as the shareholder proposals presented last month at the company's contentious annual meeting. These included proposals that a break-up of the company be considered and that the posts of chairman and chief executive, both now held by Mr Brennan, be separated. In May, shareholders voted 41.2 per cent in favour of changing the three-year staggered election of directors to an annual election. It was the highest tally of any proposal considered at the meeting. Mr Robert Monks, a frequent critic of Sears, said the steps were a 'nice start', though more remained to be done. Mr Monks was defeated in an attempt to be elected to the board in 1990, but he hopes the board might choose him as a director this year.</p>

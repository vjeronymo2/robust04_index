			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Bus chief queries BR bid guidelines Bus companies interested in bidding for parts of the British Rail empire will draw little comfort from merger guidelines announced yesterday, one leading bus operator said. The Office of Fair Trading published a guidance note intended to help potential bidders decide whether they would infringe monopolies rules. The companies most likely to encounter problems are bus companies that operate in the same region as the rail franchise they are interested in buying. However, Mr Trevor Smallwood, chairman of Badgerline Holdings, a Bristol-based company, said: 'A lot of it is very broad-brush guidance. They say they will look at the transport market in an area as one market and not as several different markets (depending on the mode of transport used). That makes us more uncomfortable. It is not necessarily helpful in terms of co-ordinating bus and rail transport.' In mergers involving rail franchises it is relevant to consider the extent to which other public transport services compete with or complement the rail service, the OFT said. But differences in price, comfort, convenience, availability and speed make it unlikely that the OFT would consider all public transport services to be substitutes for each other. 'It is not absolute differences in prices, quality, etc. that determine whether different products are in the same market but the extent to which customers would switch from one product to another in response to changes in prices and other conditions,' the OFT said. The OFT pointed out that while a 25 per cent market share was the statutory threshold for determining whether a merger qualified for a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, this did not automatically trigger a reference. Market structure, the degree of competition between the two companies before the merger and competition from other companies would also be considered. Railways: Guidance on Mergers.

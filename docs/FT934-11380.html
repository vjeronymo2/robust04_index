			<p>931101 FT  01 NOV 93 / Observer: Old song The professional advisers behind the rescue of Canary Wharf seem somehow to have preserved their sense of humour during the last few months of negotiations. But, as children, they were clearly all far too serious-minded to watch cartoons. The company that rises Phoenix-like in place of Olympia &amp; York to control the Docklands development is called Sylvester Investments, apparently named after the cartoon cat that pursued Tweety Pie, the canary. Only problem is, in the cartoon Tweety Pie was never caught. Unlike the bankers and other creditors to Canary Wharf. . .</p>

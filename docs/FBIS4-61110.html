			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>   [Text] Brussels May 3 TASS -- Press secretary of deputy  head of the commission of the European Union Leon Brittan  described Brittan's Moscow negotiations as remarkable progress.    He told a briefing at the commission today the negotiations  with Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin aimed to sign the  long-awaited agreement on partnership and cooperation between  the European Union and Russia.    Although the sides have not finalized all the problems, the  commission is optimistic about the agreement conclusion and  contacts with the Russian vice-premier will be continued on  telefax and over the telephone.    In the words of the press secretary, the sides reached good  progress in the sphere of nuclear material trade, which is the  main of the three problems in the agreement. The rest two -- on  sea transport and activities of European banks in Russia -- will  be settled as soon as the first problem is eliminated, he noted.    It is the matter of a compromise between some members of the  European Union, including France, which fear the inflow into the  European market of a large amount of cheap nuclear materials,  and Russia, who wants to include nuclear material trade in the  agreement alongside the trade of other goods, that is without  discrimination. The Russian proposal to specify this problem  with letters is being discussed.    After specific aspects of the draft document are finalized  with Russia, the commission will pass it over to governments of  the European Union member-states for consultations.</p>

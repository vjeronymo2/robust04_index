			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Bosnian Serbs hint at offer over territory Bosnian Serbs said yesterday they wanted to reopen talks with western powers and Russia on a Bosnian peace plan. Willingness to make at least heavily qualified concessions was further demonstrated by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, who indicated for the first time that he might accept the division of Bosnian territory laid out in the peace proposal. The Serb offer to negotiate is the latest move in a protracted haggle which intensified on Friday when the self-styled Bosnia Serb parliament refused to accept the peace plan brokered by an international 'contact group' comprising the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany. The contact group responded on Saturday by calling for tighter sanctions but the five foreign ministers failed to evoke the measure most feared by the Serbs - lifting the Bosnian arms embargo. Such a move, which would strengthen the Moslems, enjoys wide US political support. France yesterday rejected new negotiations, saying the 'proposal contains no new element. . . .' The US called the idea a 'non-starter' and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, said in Belgrade he would no longer talk to Mr Karadzic. 'We cannot be a toy in the hands of the party of war,' he said. Britain and Germany also rejected more talks. Mr Bosnian Serb leader signalled a more conciliatory attitude in an interview due to be published today in the Russian daily Sevodnya. He said Serbs might accept the division of Bosnian territory outlined in the contact group plan which gives the Moslem-Croat federation 51 per cent of the land and the Serbs 49 per cent. 'But the territory we are given must not be a patchwork,' he said. Mr Karadzic, whose forces control some 70 per cent of Bosnia, also sought to further divide the already fragile consensus within the contact group, where Russia has consistently taken a more placatory stance toward their historic allies, the Serbs. 'Russia must understand how dangerous Nato's games are not only for Serbia but for Russia as well,' he said, after praising last week's personal intervention in the peace process by President Boris Yeltsin. 'Nato is trying in all ways to diminish Russian influence in the Balkans.'</p>

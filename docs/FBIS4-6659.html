			<p>BFN     [Text] Nagoya, April 20 KYODO -- The Fair Trade Commission  (FTC) said Wednesday [20 April] it has ordered mosaic tile  makers to dismantle the price cartel for tiles sold at home and  overseas. The FTC said the national union formed by 114 tile  makers has fixed the prices of mosaic tiles for domestic sale  and exports in violation of the Antimonopoly Law.    Commission officials said the tile makers, plagued by  swollen  inventories in the wake of the burst of the "bubble economy,"  formed the price cartel to prevent price falls.    The FTC issued the order after three rounds of  investigations  at the union's headquarters in Nagoya and other places, the  officials said.    Tile makers belonging to the union set a low-end price for  mosaic tiles at 95 yen per sheet, each consisting of 18 tiles,  the officials said.    Companies not accepting the FTC order will be liable to a  penalty fine set in proportion to sales.</p>

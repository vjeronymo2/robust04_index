			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: Mannesmann earnings lag at 5 months MANNESMANN earnings fell during the first five months of 1992, Reuter reports from Duesseldorf. Group sales rose 21 per cent to DM10.4bn (Dollars 6.8bn), mainly due to the first time inclusion of new units, Werner Dieter, management board chairman, told the annual meeting. Mr Dieter gave no profit figures but said that incoming orders jumped by 25 per cent to about DM13bn during the five months, compared with the same period in 1991. Mannesmann said earnings in the current year are under pressure from start-up costs for its D-2 mobile telephone system and new acquisitions. Outlay for the D-2 network will peak this year, it said. In the engineering and plant divisions, incoming orders rose 8 per cent to DM5.6bn while the division's sales rose 4 per cent to DM3.8bn. Sales in the transport technology division advanced 36 per cent with a 20 per cent rise in orders. Five-months sale were flat in its hydraulic engineering division but incoming orders increased 9 per cent to DM1.4bn. Triumph Adler, the German arm of the Olivetti group, told the annual meeting yesterday that sales in the first five months of 1992 were holding level, but orders, especially domestic orders, showed a clear decline since the start of May.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- China has mapped out an  ambitious plan to build its own information superhighway with a  focus on an information application system, a nationwide public  data service network and an advanced telecommunications network.    In a recent symposium on the wide use of information in the  national economy and China's information superhighway, Wu  Jichuan, minister of posts and telecommunications, said China  will watch closely the world's latest development of the  information superhighway construction and carry out its own in a  planned and step-by-step manner.    He said China will expand the application of computers in  digital exchanges and accelerate the construction of optical  fibers and build an internet by developing a network  telecommunications platform based on the country's public  telecommunications network.    The symposium, attended by China's senior officials and  information experts, exchanged information on the world's  current trend of information superhighway construction, its  definition and its social economic significance. China's  demands for such a highway and its potentials were widely  discussed in the symposium, the first of its kind in China.    As part of the effort to cope with the world's new  information revolution, China is busy building 22 national-level  optical fiber trunk lines to connect all the provincial  capitals, 20 digital microwave trunk lines, and large and  medium-sized satellite telecommunications ground stations.    According to government sources, the large capacity digital  transmission network connecting the country's major provincial  capital cities will be completed early next year. First phase  construction of a nationwide digital exchange network was  completed last September.    At present, the network extends to 267 of China's major  cities and has started to exchange information with 37 centers  in 20 countries and regions.    Meanwhile, the first phase project of the high speed digital  trunk line connecting 21 provinces and municipalities will be  put into operation this July. A cellular phone network has  covered the coastal provinces in the southeast and some central  provinces.    Viewing the current level of information modernization,  experts said that the 700,000 mobile telephones will be linked  by a nationwide network soon. China's seven million radio  pagers have made the country one of the world's largest paging  markets. Computers have been widely used in banking, customs  clearance, railway transportation and civil aviation and weather  forecasting. These, in all, will contribute to China's  information modernization, experts commented.    As another major step in the construction of the information  superhighway, China plans to accelerate hi-tech research  concerned with information modernization, especially advanced  remote sensing, surveying, computers, automation facilities and  modern telecommunications technologies.    The construction of the information superhighway is a  systematic project which will involve different fields of work,  said Wu Jichuan, minister of posts and telecommunications. He  called on the joint efforts of participating departments to work  toward erecting the modern information network.</p>

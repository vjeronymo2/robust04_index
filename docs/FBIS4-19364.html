			<p>BFN     [Text] Support for the European Union [EU] is continuing to  fall in Sweden. According to an opinion poll published in  GOTEBORGS-POSTEN, supporters of the EU now number 33 percent  while opponents number 42 percent. The poll also reveals that  over half of Sweden's Social Democrats are against the EU. This  is a problem for the party leadership that is in favor of the EU  and is seeking to gain governmental powers in the Swedish  elections in September.</p>

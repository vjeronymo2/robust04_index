			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (11): New image for old wine - The island is best known for an eponymous produc / Peter Wise reports that vineyards once used for making table wine are switching to export varieties with European support Madeira wine may never again attain the level of prestige advertising and customer-driven distribution channels it commanded from the 17th to 19th centuries. Falstaff celebrated Malmsey, the best-known variety, in Henry IV  -an anachronism as the island had not been discovered at the time at which the Shakespeare play is set. America's Declaration of Independence was toasted with Madeira wine. The island's growing importance as a port of call in the 18th century led to voyagers such as James Cook and Horatio Nelson taking thousands of gallons on their journeys to south-east Asia and the Americas. By 1780 more than 70 British Madeira wine shippers were based in Funchal. Today, only seven export houses remain, but the largest in terms of turnover are still dominated by Britons. The cachet of Madeira as a fine drinking wine has been undermined by bulk shipment of more than half the island's production to be used mainly as a cooking ingredient in France and Germany. Rising production costs have turned Madeira from being the cheapest to the most expensive of the three fortified wines - Madeira, port and sherry - in the past 20 years. And the limited scale of the industry means that shippers cannot support the marketing and distribution costs required to stay ahead in an international drinks market dominated by big multinationals. But steps are being taken to meet the challenges that an age-old industry faces in an era of mass marketing. The Madeira Wine Institute (IVM), a state body set up in 1979 to regulate and promote the wine, has set an ambitious target of not only doubling production from 3.2m litres a year but also of substantially increasing the quality of the wine and thus the value-added it produces for the island's economy. Less than 2,000 hectares of terraced vineyards currently cultivate the four varieties of vine used in making Madeira wine. These produce Malmsey, a sweet, rich dessert wine and the best-selling variety; Bual, fragrant and full-bodied; Verdelho, elegant and golden; and Sercial, light, dry and served chilled as an aperitif. 'The forests and mountains that cover two-thirds of Madeira mean that our vineyards cannot be greatly extended,' says Mr Alberto Casimiro of the IVM. But vineyards used for making the non-marketable table wine that many Madeirans drink at home are being converted to the cultivation of export varieties with the support of European Union funds. And vines used for producing wines for blending into Madeira will be replaced with superior stock. More cultivation of the better vines will produce more high-quality, higher-priced wine. This will put pressure on some exporters to place greater emphasis on bottled wine than on bulk wine destined for culinary sauces, which is younger, less technically-demanding and cheaper to produce but also much less profitable. It remains to be seen whether the big French and German importers who sell cheap Madeira under their own cooking-wine labels will also be willing to adapt. Unlike port and sherry, which are also fortified with grape brandy, Madeira has been unable to benefit from mechanisation. 'The terrain is too hideously steep for any machine,' says Mr Richard Blandy of the Madeira Wine Company, which accounts for 40 per cent of the quality bottled Madeira wine market, with annual sales of Es840m out of Es1.5bn for the whole industry. The other cost problem is that most vineyards are minuscule. His company buys grapes from more than 2,000 farmers each harvest. But exporters are moving to cut costs and enhance quality by improving their own production methods. Henriques and Henriques, a large shipper, will open a new winery in Camara de Lobos, close to the vineyards, later this year. Madeira Wine is investing Es800m, of which 60 per cent will be provided by EU grants, in a new winery in the same area. It is due to be ready for the 1996 harvest. Madeira wine shippers are also developing links with bigger drinks companies to extend their marketing and distribution capacity. Warre, a leading group in the port wine trade, bought a controlling stake in Madeira Wine in 1989. La Martinicaise, a large French importer of bulk Madeira wine, has formed an association with the shipper Justino, apparently to guarantee supplies. Barbeito, another Funchal-based exporter, has established ties with companies in Japan, the biggest importer of bottled Madeira wine after Britain.</p>

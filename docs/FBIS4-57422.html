			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Santo Domingo, 18 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today,  Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer announced he would accept  holding supplementary elections in the provinces where it can be  proven dishonest actions took place. The 87-year-old chief of  state pointed out "he would accept holding these special  elections in those places where irregularities took place, but  the Central Electoral Board (JCE) must organize them."    Balaguer, the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC)  presidential candidate, declared himself the winner of the 16  May elections, but the opposition claimed there were  irregularities during the elections. Expecting to begin his  seventh term at 87, on 17 May, the almost blind president denied  there was fraud and maintained the elections were honest.  [passage omitted]    Today, the JCE suspended issuing the bulletin that would  make  public the name of the winner of the general elections in order  to analyze the PRD [Dominican Revolutionary Party] allegations  of fraud. A PRD delegation delivered the vote challenge to the  JCE. According to a JCE spokesman, it will take "pertinent" time  to give an opinion on the opposition's charge and petition, but  will make a ruling on 19 May at the latest. [passage omitted]</p>

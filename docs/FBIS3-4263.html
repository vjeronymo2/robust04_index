			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yinchuan, March 26 (XINHUA) -- Afforestation by  aerial seeding has proved to a big success in China as it has  turn many barren mountains green and brought about tremendous  ecological and economic benefits.    According to the Ministry of Forestry, the country has  afforested 9.6 million ha by aerial seeding during the past 12  years, exceeding the total of the previous 23 years.    The country's average survival rate under aerial seeding has  increased by 22 percent in the same period.    At present, a large-scale aerial seeding has been conducted  in 700 counties of the country's 25 provinces and autonomous  regions.    Aerial seeding has been further expanded northward, becoming  the world's first success in aerial seeding in areas with annual  precipitation lower than 100 mm.    Aerial seeding has also proven fruitful in northern China's  sandy land and deserts as well as in some freezing high altitude  areas in southwest China's Sichuan Province.    Seeds of various broadleaf trees and arbors have been used  in  aerial seeding instead of the original single type.    Thanks to the principle of spreading the operation in  conjunction with experiments, aerial seeding techniques have  been implemented quickly and effectively in many barren or sandy  areas beset by windstorms, sandstorms and serious soil erosion.    Statistics show that aerial seeding has saved the country's  ten percent of sandy land from the invasion of deserts with  40,000 sq k of barren land now covered with trees.    Aerial seeding has played an important role in afforestation  in north China's shelterbelt project, known as Great Green Wall.  A stretch of 540,000 ha of forest has brought green to sandy  areas in northwest, north and northeast China through aerial  seeding.    Aerial seeding not only makes the afforestation possible in  remote high or stony mountains and deserts but also surpasses  manual afforestation with lower costs, minimal labor demands,  higher speed, larger scale and higher survival rate.    To better conduct aerial seeding, the central government  earmarks large amounts of funds each year for the project.  Permanent stations have been set up for tree management and  protection work in provinces where regular aerial seeding is  conducted.    China airlines and the air unit of the Chinese People's  Liberation Army have both actively supported the aerial seeding  activity all over the country.    China's aerial seeding has taken the lead in the world in  both efficiency and technology and has attracted experts from  more than 40 countries and regions of the world and from  international organizations.</p>

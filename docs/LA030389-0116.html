			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATLANTA MINORITY PROGRAM DEALT BLOW  </P> <P> The city's affirmative action-minority enterprise program was overturned  Thursday by the state Supreme Court, which said officials failed to produce  enough evidence of past discrimination to justify it.  </P> <P> The court also unanimously found that the Minority-Female Business Enterprise  program, begun in 1975, was too broadly drawn and failed to consider  alternatives to a yearly minority participation goal in city contracting.  </P> <P> The program sets a goal that 35% of city contract dollars go to minorities.  City officials declined comment on the ruling and its implications for the  program, one of the nation's most recognized and most emulated.  </P> <P> "It is apparent the city had available to it less intrusive means of  accomplishing the MFBE's race-conscious purposes but had not fully explored  those," Justice Willis B. Hunt Jr. wrote for the seven-member court.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear whether the ruling on behalf of the American  Subcontractors Assn. effectively dismantles the program.  </P> <P> City Atty. Marva Brooks said an appeal is unlikely, but she said unspecified  steps would be taken to save the minority program.  </P></p>

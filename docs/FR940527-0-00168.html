			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter opposed this deletion alleging that proposed 780.23(c) does not specifically require the same information as was provided to the regulatory authority by former 779.22(c) deleted in this rulemaking. The commenter characterized &sect;779.22(c) as serving to eliminate any doubt as to the regulatory agency's authority for requiring a description and classification of the land uses under local law. In deleting former &sect;779.22(c), OSM does not intend to infer that final 780.23(c) does not continue to convey sufficient general authority for the regulatory authority to require all the information previously and specifically required by the deleted section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. This rulemaking also deletes former 30 CFR 780.23(a)(2) which required the submission of a detailed management plan where range or grazing was the proposed postmining land use. In 1979, OSM rejected comments to delete this section. At that time, OSM stated its belief that a detailed management plan was necessary to determine the feasibility of a proposed range/grazing postmining land use. (44 FR 15058, March 13, 1979). Since then, OSM has reconsidered the utility of requiring such detailed plans. In concert with this rulemaking, OSM consulted the Bureau of Land Management regarding its current views on the need for a detailed management plan to be included in the permit application for a surface coal mining and reclamation operation. The Bureau indicated that the proposed deletion of the requirement for submitting such plans would not affect its program which also required detailed management plans. OSM understands that for legitimate economic and/or ecological reasons the actual management plan implemented for a reclaimed area may often vary greatly from the detailed plan originally submitted under &sect;780.23(a)(2). The uncertain benefit which may be derived from the submission of these plans is not felt to justify the burden of their preparation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter supported the deletion of &sect;780.23(a)(2) stating that a detailed management plan was unnecessary. Two other commenters disagreed with the deletion but suggested a change in the regulatory language of &sect;780.23(a)(2) to require a ``general'' instead of a ``detailed'' management plan. OSM does not accept that suggestion. Former &sect;780.23(a)(1) which required an explanation of how the postmining land use is to be achieved has been redesignated as final section 780.23(b)(1) and should allow for the level of reporting detail necessary for the regulatory authority to determine the feasibility of any proposed range land/grazing land use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Vegetation Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Rules discussed the deletion of 30 CFR 779.19 (Vegetation information). This section authorizes a regulatory authority to require a map and a description of the plant communities within the proposed permit area and within any proposed reference area. OSM originally envisioned that this detailed information could be helpful in completing the vegetative land use analysis required by &sect;779.22 (land use information). (44 FR 15037, March 13, 1979). In revisiting this issue in its proposed rule, OSM justified the deletion of &sect;779.19 on the grounds that it was felt to be redundant and that other specified permit application provisions provide the regulatory authority with sufficient authority to require the level of detailed information necessary to complete &sect;779.22(a)'s vegetative land use information requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous comments were received strongly opposing this deletion. The commenters stressed that the information of &sect;&sect;779.19 and 779.22 was ``complementary and not duplicative.'' The commenters expressed their view that section 779.19 serves an essential and wider purpose than merely helping to complete &sect;779.22(a)'s land use information requirements. These commenters further questioned whether the other permit application provisions cited by OSM in its proposed rule actually provide the regulatory authority with sufficient authority to require the detailed information relative to species diversity and ground cover which is needed to properly evaluate an operator's ability to revegetate the disturbed area. In light of the comments opposing the proposed deletion of &sect;779.19, OSM has determined to retain that section unaffected by this rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

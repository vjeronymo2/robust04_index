			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A year to drink up - Wine / The 1991 clarets THE 1991 Bordeaux vintage was devastated by a late April frost and diluted by rain in the middle of the picking. The 2.15m hl red wine harvest was little more than 40 per cent of the previous year's record one, and the crop was particularly short in St Emilion and Pomerol where the Merlot was severely hit. In spite of spraying and mass picking Petrus is not marketing a 1991, and throughout the leading communes some chateaux are not selling their wines under their grand vin chateau label. Nevertheless, thanks to modern equipment and technique, 1991 cannot be written off. Indeed, in two or three years it may be very welcome, subject to certain conditions: only the first generation grapes and not the post-frost buddings should be used, summer pruning to cut the yield, a quick end to the picking after the September rains, a rigorous pre-vat selection of the incoming grapes, and a very careful blending of the vats for the grand vin. After all this the wines can only be sold at loss, for taking inflation into account they will be priced at less than the initially denigrated but now often much enjoyed 1987s. These superior appellation '91 clarets are due for early bottling this month or next, and the Union des Grands Crus has recently shown its members' wines in London. The 120-strong association represents most of the classed growths and some lesser chateaux, but not the firsts and only a few of the seconds. About three quarters of the members presented their '91s in London, but very few of the Sauternes and Barsacs that suffered very heavily from the frost. The dry whites had survived in very small quantities, but as they had picked before the rains they showed fairly light but attractive: particularly Domaine de Chevalier, Fieuzal and Rahoul. Overall the clarets had good colour and often a fair aroma, but generally they lacked backbone, and until one reached the classed growths - and not all of these - the wines were often short-flavoured in the mouth. Of those I tasted, those in their districts that had fair fruit and appeared promising included: Graves - Dom de Chevalier, Fieuzal; Medoc  - La Tour-de-By, Loudenne; Haut-Medoc - Beaumont, Chasse-Spleen, Clarke, Couffran; Fourcas Hosten, Poujeaux; Margaux - Anguludet, Malescot, Monbrison, Palmer; St Julien - Beychevelle, Leoville-Barton, Gruaud-Larose; Pauillac - Lynch-Bages, Pichon-Longueville, Pichon-Lalande; St Estephe - Montrose. It was a former maitre de chai of Lafite who said to Elie de Rothschild of a previous moderate vintage: 'We need wines like these to wait for the others.' There is no lack of earlier years with promise of longevity - '88, '89 and '90 - and the best of these '91s will have the virtue of early drinkability, with more concentration than the '87s. With advice, worth 'looking at' in the next year or so.</p>

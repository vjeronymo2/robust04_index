			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POWER, THE NEWPORT BEACH ARTS COMMISSION, CENSORSHIP AND THE FULL NAKEDNESS OF  ADAM  </P> <P> I recently have witnessed a most brazen and benighted abuse of official power  in the censorship of artworks by the Newport Beach Arts Commission.  </P> <P> Rosa Williamson, an artist and resident of Orange County, was invited by the  commission to exhibit more than a dozen of her works (along with those of two  other artists) at the Newport Beach City Hall Gallery. She duly delivered her  pieces (for) exhibit from April 5 through May 2. (Then,) on receiving an  anonymous complaint and viewing a paper sticker placed over one of Ms.  Williamson's paintings, the commission decided to remove several of her works  from the main showroom.  </P> <P> The painting under review is a figure of a naked Adam, and it reminds me of  another naked Adam on public view -- on (the) Sistine (Chapel) ceiling, by  Michelangelo. If Pope Julius II saw fit to have that Adam unchanged and  unclothed, with genitalia open to view, it behooves the shaking and quaking  Newport Beach Arts Commission to take a more enlightened aesthetic view and  restore these works to the viewing public, and have an end to this regressive  act of censorship.  </P> <P> BURNE HOGARTH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P> Editor's note: Hogarth is an art teacher at the Art Center School of Design in  Pasadena. "Adam" has since been returned to the City Hall Gallery, where it  hangs through May 2 as originally scheduled.  </P> <P> </P></p>

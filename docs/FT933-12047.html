			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Malval 'named as new PM for Haiti' THE EXILED president of Haiti, Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, intends to name the publisher Mr Robert Malval as his country's new prime minister, the US State Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. The department said it supported the choice, but sanctions on the Caribbean nation could not be lifted until other steps had been taken. The president's naming of a new premier is a main step under a UN-mediated peace accord, signed in New York this month, to restore Fr Aristide, Haiti's first elected president, to power. Mr Malval's name had been expected. In Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, UN and Organisation of American States observers said yesterday that Haiti's deplorable human rights record had shown no improvement in the early stages of the country's transition from military to democratic rule.</p>

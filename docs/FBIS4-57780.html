			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the 23 May edition of TRABAJADORES; title </F> not given; from the "Evening Information Review" newscast --  read by Pedro Otero]    [Text] The revolutionary government has announced the  implementation of nine important measures concerning the  increase of prices and fees affecting the population. These  measures, which will begin to be implemented 1 June and continue  throughout the year, concur with one of the recent decisions  reached by the National Assembly, and they mark the beginning of  a phase during which interrelated measures that are part of a  larger process will be implemented. These measures should  result in the improvement of our internal finances and thereby  lay the foundations for other actions that will benefit the  country's economic stabilization and reorganization.    Although it has been said and repeated many times, it is  necessary to reiterate this once again: There is no alternative  to these measures and their implementation cannot be delayed any  longer. During the first quarter of the year, the excess of  currency increased by 591 million pesos. By the end of May, our  monetary liquidity will be approximately 12 billion pesos. Any  delay in facing this problem will only be against the vital  interests of the nation and the working people.    It is true that these increases represent new sacrifices  that  will affect all of us to some degree. This cannot be denied.  We have, however, faced sacrifices and hardships before, and  none would be worse than the ones we would have to face should  the current situation related to internal finances continue to  deteriorate. We should reflect on this seriously because it is  not a matter of applauding the measures. Nevertheless, we  should be able to understand them and realize that the country  has no other choice.    Higher prices and fees, particularly on cigarettes and  alcoholic beverages -- price increases that were widely debated  in the parliaments in the workplace -- are measures that can  give us the best results in the near future in terms of  generating revenues. According to forecasts from relevant state  organizations, their implementation should contribute by the  second half of the year to stop the increase of money in  circulation, which should begin to recede before the end of the  year. This would be an initial success and an encouraging step  on the path we must take.    A key factor that should be explained to all workers in the  country is that it is impossible under the current circumstances  to think that these increases in prices and fees can be  accompanied by a parallel and compensatory increase in salaries.  We would be deceiving ourselves if we tried to make a general  wage adjustment under current conditions. We must give real  value to current salaries instead of issuing more paper money,  which would only contribute to foster an endless vicious circle.  This can only be achieved by increasing productivity, expanding  the supply of goods and services, and gradually recovering the  purchasing power of the Cuban peso.    The first step should be reducing to acceptable limits the  internal financial imbalance. This, of course, does not  invalidate the specific measures now being implemented in  various parts of the country to encourage workers engaged in  vital economic activities, to identify those who contribute the  most, and to increase their real income through various means.    We must emphasize that, along with the strict measures, our  government has taken steps to protect the most vulnerable and  lowest income sectors. Even cigarettes, non-staple products  that are hazardous to people's health, have been protected as  much as possible for consumers who received fixed or controlled  quotas through the application of different and lower prices  than the ones that will prevail in the free market.    Another proposal that received broad support in the  parliaments in the workplace was the move to eliminate subsidies  in staple products obtained by ration cards and instead  subsidize the individuals and families that are the most needy.  In practice, the implementation of this proposal is turning out  to be a long and complex process. This means the state will  continue paying 365 million pesos a year to subsidize essential  goods whose price has not been adjusted. Products whose prices  will be increased do not represent an amount that cannot be paid  by the lower income groups.    Another concrete example concerns electricity fees. Fees  paid by those families that consume less than 100 kilowatts,  approximately 53 percent of all families, will not be raised.  The increase in electricity fees will be applied to the other  47 percent of the families, those with greater incomes because  they use 76 percent of the electricity supply assigned to the  residential sector. This measure's essential goal is to  encourage savings by spending less on fuel. In turn, it has  been noted that the new fees will not replace or override the  consumption plan or lead to the suspension of services for those  who time and again exceed this plan.    The increase in train [word indistinct] fees, which prompted  appropriate criticism, was wisely corrected while a 30 percent  bonus was established for workers and students who regularly use  this service. Some measures, such as the one aimed at  eliminating the $100 million peso annual subsidy to the workers'  soup kitchens, are economically significant. Meanwhile, other  measures, such as the fixed fees for water and sewage service,  and the increase in postal and telegraph services, although they  are far from making the institutions that supply these services  financially independent, will help the economy and will have a  [word indistinct] and educational effect.    It is important to point out that these increases in prices  and fees will contribute to one of today's most important goals  -- namely, the reduction of the fiscal deficit. Consequently,  the additional money collected will not, as a rule, remain for  the most part within the companies or institutions. Rather, it  will be included as part of the state's general budget as a  circulation tax. This will also create a more favorable  situation to progress toward the elimination of subsidies for  losses and to gradually do away with this phenomenon.    It can be added that, despite the additional charge this  represents for the family's economy and the harshness of the  crisis we are experiencing, Cuban workers with modest salaries,  thanks to the social policy of the revolution, spends less  proportionately in housing, electricity, transportation, and  basic staples than other Latin American workers.    Food supplies and other basic services supplied by the state  will represent at most, after this reform, 43 percent of the  minimum salary, while in Panama, the hemisphere's nation where  this proportion is the lowest, it rises to 56 percent.  [sentence as heard] In Cuba, more than 80 percent of the  families own their house and only 10-15 percent of salary is  paid as amortization. In the Latin American nation where this  indicator is lowest -- Honduras -- rent is not under $105 a  month for a modest two-room apartment. In the majority of the  nations, as a rule, housing will cost as much as 50-60 percent  of salaries. We must preserve and defend these gains and these  realities over and above any circumstantial impediment.    Decree Law 149 on illegal enrichment and now these  government  decisions confirm the willingness to progress in a serene and  decided manner toward the fulfillment of the policies outlined  by the National Assembly of the People's Government, as well as  the commitment to the full resolution of the problems we are  facing.    We are looking at an extremely significant measure imposed  on  the people with regard to prices and fees, and this measure must  be followed. When the time comes, other revisions must take  place in the categories of prices and fees that even apply to  the state itself. This is to stimulate greater efficiency and  to [word indistinct] subsequent government decisions with regard  to the [word indistinct] tax policy and other possible  alternatives included in the arsenal of measures that this  assembly approved.    In a flexible, intelligent manner, with the timely  information and due explanation to the people, this decisive  process will be implemented. We will not go half way. Our  workers and the labor unions currently involved in holding  meetings to achieve efficiency will undoubtedly unite around  this effort to achieve greater production at a lower cost and  with the best use of the scarce resources we have. This can be  achieved through debate that [word indistinct] encourages  comprehension and the firm support these decisions demand, the  top goal of which is to contribute to defend our nation's  independence and the revolutionary fatherland of the poor, by  the poor, and for the poor. It is once again time to act as  masters of our own destiny.</p>

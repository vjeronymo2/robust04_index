			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Nafta partners set up swap facility The US, Canada and Mexico agreed yesterday to set up a permanent Dollars 8.8bn (Pounds 5.9bn) swap arrangement to help cushion sharp fluctuations in the foreign exchange markets. Officials from all three countries - the partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement - said they did not anticipate drawing on the facility in the near future. However, they said they had decided to set up the procedures so as to have the money available in case of 'significant turbulence'. 'Its purpose is to promote orderly exchange markets,' said Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary. The new arrangement will combine a long-standing Dollars 2bn reciprocal US-Canada credit line with the Dollars 6bn temporary credit established for Mexico by the US last month to guard against any sharp drop in the peso after the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's candidate for the presidency. It will also include a Canada-Mexico credit line, increased yesterday from CDollars 200m (Pounds 98m) to CDollars 1bn. The accord contributed to a strengthening of the Mexican peso yesterday, with the 48-hour rate reaching Ps3.30 to the US dollar. Despite the volatility of the financial markets after the assassination, no call has been made on the swap facility over the last month. 'I don't expect it to be drawn on more, but it's something that you put in place, in the event (of) very volatile markets,' said Mr Gordon Thiessen, Bank of Canada governor. Mr Bentsen said the formalisation of the arrangement would make it easier to confront any future instability in the currency markets. Mr Pedro Aspe, Mexico's finance minister, said the Mexican government had responded to volatility in the financial markets after Mr Colosio's assassination by increasing interest rates, depreciating the exchange rate and using some of its reserves.</p>

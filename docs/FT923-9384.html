			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / TI Group suffers 7% fall to Pounds 50.2m in first six months TI GROUP, the specialist engineering group that took over Dowty, the aerospace company, in June, yesterday reported a 7 per cent fall in first-half profits amid 'increasingly prolonged depression in business activity'. Increases in profits from the John Crane seals and Bundy specialised tubes divisions - much of which derived from the Pounds 134m spent on bolt-on acquisitions last year - could not compensate for a halving in operating profits in the specialised engineering division. Mr Christopher Lewinton, TI chairman, said the main decline was in Thermal Technology, a non-core business providing metal treatment services, which is to be sold. As proposed during the bid, Dowty's aerospace division will replace the specialised engineering division as TI's third business leg alongside seals and tubes. The figures are the last not to include a contribution from Dowty. In early October TI will reveal the fair market provisions it will set up for the Dowty acquisition, a practice for which the City has criticised TI in the past. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 54.2m in the six months to June 1991 to Pounds 50.2m - about the level reported in the last half of 1992 - on sales up 7 per cent at Pounds 471m. Earnings per share fell from 11.4p to 10.2p and the group is to pay an increased 3.7p interim dividend, up 5.7 per cent. TI also attempted to remove some of the uncertainty that surrounded Dowty's results for the year to March. Price Waterhouse and Arthur Andersen, auditors for TI and Dowty respectively, have now agreed that Dowty will report pre-tax profits of Pounds 26m, about Pounds 6.7m below the figure forecast by Dowty as part of its bid defence. Mr Lewinton said the closure of Dowty's Cognito paging business would require a Pounds 25m write-off. This will be taken on Dowty's books before it is consolidated into TI and will therefore not form part of the acquisition provisions to be announced in October. Mr Lewington's comments that Dowty's first-quarter operating improvement was unlikely to continue, as Dowty had suggested, and repetition of the stark economic background in the group's markets hit TI's share price. After a number of brokers cut their forecasts, TI's shares fell 31p to 283p. Lex, Page 14; Market report, Page 32</p>

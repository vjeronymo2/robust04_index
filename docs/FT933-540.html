			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (28): Insolvency in Europe / Management GUIDE TO INSOLVENCY IN EUROPE by Anthony Houghton and Nigel Atkinson Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International/CCH Editions Ltd Pounds 49.50 417 pages THE NEED for a quick and succinct guide to the insolvency regimes of Europe can rarely have been greater. Few insolvencies lack an international aspect these days and professional advisers frequently need to know their way around the laws and procedures of other European countries when tracing assets situated there. Deloittes offers a snapshot of the regimes of the 12 European Community countries and six East European states, providing basic information on recovery, rehabilitation, insolvency and debt collection. Each country is dealt with in the same fashion. There are sections on the types of business entity; reorganisation procedures; terminal procedures; types of security and enforcement; debt collection procedures; sources of law; and sources of information. The book underlines the lack of harmonisation and limited uniformity between the insolvency regimes of Europe. It is a handy guide for those wishing to assess risk, pursue non-payment of debt or make claims in insolvency courts abroad. It is only a guide, however, and in most instances there can be no substitute for taking local advice.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Observer: Fledgling Fleming Rupert Fleming, just down from the University of the West of England (Bristol Poly to you and me), won't be short of company in his new job as a trainee securities analyst at merchant bankers Robert Fleming. For he is the eighth member of the clan, which holds around 40 per cent of the shares, currently working for the bank. Chairman Robin Fleming is accompanied by two relatives on the holding board; Rupert's father, Val, who comes from the investment management side, and Adam, founder of the Johannesburg office and a cousin of the chairman. Adam's brother, Roddy, works in capital markets, while the chairman's sons, Rory and Philip, are to be found in investment trust marketing and investment management, respectively. Last but not least, Catriona Fleming brokes Asian equities for that big happy family.</p>

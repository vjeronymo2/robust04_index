They came there to  hold negotiations with state authorities, with the objective of  taking part in development and construction. Mr. Khalifah  commended the decision of the group to join the national march  and take part in reconstruction in the Upper Nile State.    He said that their return had come at the same time as the  country's celebrations marking its independence.    Colonel Thomas Dod, the leader of the group, which also  included 11 other officers, said that his forces had decided to  return and surrender their weapons, as they wanted to take part  in reconstruction. He said that his group was in need of  essential services such as education, health, and agricultural  inputs for the people of the area. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Report on quango trips and expenses released Health Promotion Wales, a government quango which offers advice on healthier lifestyles, yesterday made public a district auditor's report on its former chief executive's overseas visits and expenses claims. The quango and its administration has been under intense scrutiny since Professor John Catford resigned as chief executive in February. South Wales fraud squad was called in to investigate his expense claims for a number of foreign trips but the Crown Prosecution Service later decided not to bring criminal proceedings. The report concludes that the reason for Prof Catford's attendance on several trips was unclear. A visit to Brazil appeared to have been undertaken 'for purely personal reasons'. Mr Gordon Macdonald, head of professional development, has also been disciplined over his foreign trips. His contract will not be renewed when it runs out in October. Mr John Davies, chairman of Health Promotion Wales, said yesterday: 'We are doing a thoroughly professional and worthwhile job which the NHS values highly. We are not a tarnished quango although two individuals have been tarnished.' He added that procedures on overseas travel had been changed. Prof Catford now works for the World Health Organisation as public health adviser to a number of eastern European countries. He has not commented on the district auditor's report. Mr Macdonald said: 'The District Audit Services report cites me as undertaking 26 international visits between April 1990 and January 1994. This is inaccurate and misleading. Eight of those journeys were to domestic destinations within the UK.'</p>

Dutko, head engineer; and A. I. Kolobich, department director:  ``Machines for Plant Protection'']    [Text] The Lvovkhimselkhozmash Production Association is a  supplier of boom and blower sprayers (except for a small  quantity of OPV-1200A sprayers transferred to the  Tadzhikkhimselkhozmash Plant for production), fertilizer  distributors and machines for disinfecting livestock buildings.  Most articles are produced as unified families out of basic  models and units employing a modular unit layout. However,  designers are devoting increasingly greater attention to making  machines all-purpose by using various interchangeable tools for  surface and soil application, spray rods with hose reels, and so  on, and showing concern for improving the health and hygienic  conditions of the work of machine operators.    Creation of machines making it possible to raise  productivity  by increasing operating width and speed, and using devices  capable of reducing working fluid consumption rates appears  promising. The equipment will become less material- and  energy-intensive, and it will be fitted out with automated  systems based on electronics and microprocessor technology.    In 1991 the Lvovkhimselkhozmash Production Association  produced 26,500 sprayers and fertilizer distributors; however,  this amount turned out to be insufficient to completely satisfy  the demand for equipment. In most cases rural laborers failed to  receive enough of the machinery they needed because of  shortfalls in deliveries of a number of associated parts and  materials, and owing to an ill-conceived pricing policy.    Information exchange among CIS countries has weakened  unfortunately. Sometimes farmers are unaware of what kind of  equipment is being produced, where it could be ordered and how  much it costs. Readers will be interested in our report on  machines in series production at plants of this production  association.    The plant can offer the following machines today:    OP-2000-2 small trailed boom sprayer;    OPSh-15 trailed boom sprayer;    OM-630-2 small mounted boom sprayer;    PZhU-2.5 liquid fertilizer distributor;    PZhU-5 liquid fertilizer distributor;    PZhU-9 liquid fertilizer distributor;    MDPF-2000 trailed disinfector;    OPV-2000 trailed blower sprayer;    POM-630 and POM-630-1 mounted fertilizer  distributor-sprayer;    OP-32000 fertilizer distributor;    OP-32000-1 fertilizer distributor-sprayer.    A diversity of standard tank sizes permits sensible use of  equipment in all conditions: in zones with small field maps and  a pass length of up to 1 km (630 and 1,200 liter tanks); with  midsized field maps and a pass length of up to 2 km (2,000 liter  tank); in zones with large field maps and a pass length of up to  3 km (3,200 liter tank); with large field maps and a pass length  greater that 3 km; in farms with fields located far away from  the central farmstead (6,400 liter tank).    Rural laborers, including commercial farmers, will be  interested in a new family of boom-type machines for plant  protection and for application of liquid mineral fertilizers.  The MZU-320 and MZU-320-1 mounted machines and the MZU-1200  trailed machine will be an aid in protecting field row and  vegetable crops with liquid chemical or microbiological  preparations, and they will provide for surface application of  basic solutions of complete liquid fertilizers. They can also be  used successfully to disinfect livestock buildings and to wash  agricultural machines with the help of spray rods supplied by  special order. The machines are outfitted with units for  mechanized working mixture preparation, and they are equipped  with a special system for flushing the tank and all lines after  spraying in order to ensure maximum environmental protection.    The MZU-3200 machine for plant protection and  fertilizer application is intended for chemical protection  of serial crops cultivated by intensive procedures with a  constant equipment track width (1,800 mm), and other field crops  against pests, diseases and weeds under routine and small-volume  spraying conditions, while its MZU-3200-1  modification is intended both for surface application of  pesticides and complete liquid fertilizers (including with  intensive procedures without a constant equipment track width),  and for surface application of herbicides and their simultaneous  placement with soil-working implements, and internal application  of complete liquid fertilizer simultaneously with presowing soil  working by cultivators. An attachment for surface application of  all-purpose herbicides with their simultaneous placement in the  soil by BMSh-15, BMSh-20 and BIG-3A harrows hitched to SP-16A  units, used for internal application of complete liquid  fertilizers, may be added to the MZU-3200-1 machine at the  client's request.    Sprayers are equipped with horizontally stabilized hydraulic  wide-swath booms, which guarantees high processing quality at an  operating speed of up to 12 km/hr. The process itself as well as  folding and raising of the boom are controlled by a hydraulic  system from the tractor cab. The height of the boom is  adjustable from 0.7 to 1.8 m. Four standard sizes of slot  sprayers and two of deflector sprayers make it possible to vary  consumption of working fluid per hectare within a wide range.  Attachments are secured by quick-release bayonet joints. A  closed stream method is used to adjust the machinery for work.    Sprayers are outfitted by a separate order with an automatic  control system (SAURZh) ensuring stable maintenance of a set  consumption rate with a deviation of 5 percent even with change  in speed. There is a device for mechanizing preparation of  working mixtures, and an extra tank (320 liters) for clean water  used to flush the lines.    Specialists of the GSKTB selkhozkhimmash [not further  identified] are conducting scientific research and experimental  design work to create machinery for a contact wetting method of  applying herbicides and plant growth regulators, electrostatic  sprayers, sprayers employing a pneumatic spray-forming system,  aerosols with controllable drop size, and machines for separate  delivery of pesticides and water. Some of the work is being done  jointly with companies of the FRG.    In addition the GSKTB selkhozkhimmash is working on a  contract basis to prepare equipment for pesticide-conserving  plant protection procedures that produce a savings of  preparations of up to 50 percent, and to introduce them into the  farms of clients;    for band placement of herbicides in the cultivation of corn,  sugar beets and other industrial crops by means of the OPK-8  sprayer-distributor;    for highly productive remote spraying of potatoes against  the  Colorado beetle and cereal crops against pests using the OPU-320  sprayer (with a working fluid consumption rate of 1-20  liters/ha);    for processing potatoes (OPSh-320, OPSh-630) against  phytophthora using pneumatic booms (with a consumption rate of  20-100 liters/ha);    for treatment of small volumes of potatoes (PSK-20) prior to  planting and storage (with a working fluid consumption rate of  3-8 liters/tonne);    introduction of a biological plant protection method of  releasing entomophages by means of RESh-18 boom sprayers, and  OShU-50 and PRE-35 blower sprayers for releasing  Trichogramma;    sanitary and hygienic processing of livestock buildings  using  a cold aerosol generator.    The ZR-2000, ZR-3200, ZR-3200-1 and MPR-3200  mixer-loaders, which are intended for preparation of  working fluids out of quickly dissolving ingredients and for  loading sprayers, occupy a special place in the outfit of  machines for chemical plant protection. They are fitted out with  a tapered container for storage of concentrated pesticides and a  system for their metered delivery. The pumping unit of ZR-2000  and ZR-2000-1 mixers is driven by an internal combustion engine  (made in the USA) while that of the ZR-3200 is driven by the  tractor's power takeoff shaft.    Lvov designers have developed the OMT-100 small  sprayer for commercial farms, leasing organizations and  peasant farms. This device is mounted on a T-010 tractor of the  Kharkov Tractor Plant and the AZhMK-8 of the Gomselmash Plant,  and it is intended for chemical protection of orchards,  vineyards, and vegetable and other crops. It can be used for  disinfection and disinfestation of buildings, for irrigation of  small private plots, and in orchard and gardening cooperatives.    Comparison of the basic specifications of the new generation  of sprayers with the best foreign analogues shows that in terms  of productivity, swath, lifting capacity, working fluid  consumption rates and other indicators, they correspond to world  standards. However, designers still have more work to do to  reduce weight and material content, to upgrade the quality of  manufacture, and to improve appearance.    Designers are also troubled by the problem of raising the  effectiveness of chemical plant protection measures, which  depends in many ways on the proficiency of machine operators and  competent operation of equipment. This is precisely why the  association has organized a training center at which to upgrade  the qualifications of machine operators. It has been supplied  with posters describing the layout, adjustment and control of  the machines. Specialists will soon be offered illustrated  manuals offering recommendations on the use, technical  maintenance, storage, preservation and repair of the machines.  It is to be published this year.    The equipment is being sold both through the Agropromsnab  [not further identified] and through direct contracts. Those  wishing to acquire the machines need to sign a contract with the  Lvovkhimselkhozmash Production Association or pay for the  machines in advance.    For information call 34-33-81.</p>

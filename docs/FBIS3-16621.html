			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy report: "Russia-United States: Military </F> Cooperation Is Better Than `Cold' Peace"]    [Excerpts] A new concept, that of "cold" peace, has  appeared in our political science lexicon recently. In the  opinion of certain Western politicians, the present states of  relations between Russia and the United States is characterized  by this term. The "Cold" War and open military confrontation  have ended.... Both sides have been expressing seemingly very  appealing and correct slogans about cooperation, but in  practice.... Furthermore, it is practice which shows that  fundamentally new relations -- businesslike relations befitting  partners who respect one another -- are taking shape between the  two great powers. Relations which are imbued not by coldness but  by professionalism, undoubtedly without the initial euphoria  which marked the breakthrough of the 90's.    Perhaps this is why U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's  first visit to Russia is a working visit. And the questions he  has come to discuss in our country are not those typical of  grand ceremonies but are of the most everyday type, requiring  mutual efforts to resolve them. The plane bringing Secretary  Perry did not touch down at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport until  1000 hours on 17 March, but within 90 minutes the head of the  Pentagon was already being received by Army General Pavel  Grachev, Russia's defense minister.    The very first phrases which the leaders of the two  countries' defense departments exchanged confirmed that they are  both clearly aware that, to a very large extent, mutual  relations between the defense ministries and the defense  ministers themselves determine the overall climate of interstate  relations between Russia and the United States. Security  problems have been crucial in this sphere too long for them to  be simply swept aside at a stroke. Now, as William Perry  himself showed by what he said when addressing students and  staff at George Washington University four days ago, ruling  circles in the United States are still prey to the fear that  Russia may revert to the path of an "authoritarian, militarist,  imperialist power, hostile to the West."    It may be said here and now that these are groundless  inventions, but it can also be acknowledged that the Americans  do not rule out such a possibility -- and consequently they are  taking the corresponding preemptive measures. But the aims of  the U.S. Defense Secretary's visit include not just a desire to  convince himself of the sincerity of our country's peace-loving  course but also to discuss joint efforts in the sphere of the  conversion of defense production and progress in the elimination  of that part of the former USSR's nuclear arsenal that is due to  be scrapped (these questions will also be raised during his trip  to Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belorussia [Belarus]). [passage  omitted]    The very first talks in Russia, according to the U.S. guest,  were satisfactory to both sides. As Army Gen. Pavel Grachev  said at a brief meeting with journalists after the general talks  and after a one-on-one conversation lasting almost 30 minutes,  there was a significant coincidence of views on questions of  bilateral ties, on the prospects for Russia's participation in  the "Partnership for Peace" program, and on the Bosnian problem.  Incidentally, Russia will be ready to sign the agreement on  affiliating to the "Partnership for Peace" program as early as  the end of March when the experts have completed their study of  the necessary documents, the Russian Federation defense minister  announced.    That same day William Perry had meetings and talks with  Andrey Kokoshin, Russian Federation first deputy defense  minister, and Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the  Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff. On day two of  the visit the head of the Pentagon will be received by Viktor  Chernomyrdin, premier of the Russian Government.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Europe's car sales tumble in January NEW CAR sales in western European plunged by 23 per cent last month compared with a year earlier, according to industry estimates. Four of the five leading volume markets were affected, led by a 53 per cent drop in Spain. Germany, Europe's biggest, dropped by an estimated 28 per cent to 238,000. France fell by 37 per cent to 113,000, and Italy by 14 per cent to 202,000. The one exception was Britain, where new car registrations rose 7.3 per cent, albeit from a very depressed level. Otherwise, sales were higher in only three of the smaller markets: Norway, Portugal and Ireland. The scale of the fall will add to growing tensions between the European Community and Japan over the level of Japanese car shipments this year. Officials from the European Commission and the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry failed last week to agree a forecast for the development of the EC car market in 1993. The forecast is supposed to form the basis for Japan to 'monitor' its exports to the EC under the terms of the 1991 understanding intended to restrain Japanese exports during a seven-year transition period before the EC new car market is opened completely to Japanese competition from the end of 1999. Earlier this week Mr Jorg Wenzel, head of the private office of Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, urged Japan to cut car exports to the EC this year to reflect the slump in the market, or risk provoking a crisis in relations. The German car manufacturing and supply industry alone was expected to lose up to 40,000 jobs this year. Japanese registrations in January fell year-on-year by around 18 per cent compared with the overall fall of 23 per cent, which boosted their total west European share sales to 11.5 per cent from 10.7 per cent a year ago. Carmakers fear a drop of 9-10 per cent in new car sales in west Europe this year. The sharp January fall appears to reflect the special factors, which inflated demand artificially in December and pulled sales forward from January.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                               January 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Volume    Volume      Share (%)  Share (%)                             (Units)  Change (%)    Jan 93    Jan 92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET                968,000     -23.1      100.0    100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen* (incl.          160,000     -24.1       16.5     16.7 Audi, SEAT &amp; Skoda) Fiat (incl.

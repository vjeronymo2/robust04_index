			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / World Trade News: Japan offers Algeria untied loan of Dollars 300m The Export-Import Bank of Japan is to lend Algeria Dollars 300m (Pounds 173m), part of a co-financing with the World Bank which last June extended a Dollars 350m financial sector adjustment loan to north Africa's largest country, writes Francis Ghiles. The loan, part of the Japanese government's fund recycling programme, is the first untied loan of this nature to an African or Middle East country. Algeria's foreign debt currently totals Dollars 23.4bn. In a further gesture of support for Algeria's economic reforms, the Export Import Bank is expected to extend two further loans soon. The first, amounting to Dollars 100m, will be earmarked for the revamping of a liquid petroleum plant belonging to the state oil and gas monopoly, Sonatrach. The second, an Dollars 80m co-financing with the World Bank which is expected to lend Dollars 200m, is for the extension of Sonatrach's production capacity. Japan's support for Algeria when debt repayments are severely constraining the North African country's capacity to import vital spare parts and semi-processed goods is also a recognition of Algeria's dogged perseverance in refinancing its Dollars 23.4bn foreign debt rather than rescheduling it.</p>

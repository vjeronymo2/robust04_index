			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / UK Company News: Daily Telegraph lent Pounds 33m to Conrad Black's company THE DAILY Telegraph, the newspaper group seeking a stock market listing this summer, lent Pounds 33m to its chairman's holding company, without gaining approval from its other shareholders. Mr Conrad Black, chairman of the Daily Telegraph, holds 83 per cent of its shares through Hollinger, his international holding company. The loan was revealed in a letter to Daily Telegraph shareholders from Mr Black. The letter called a special meeting to approve proposals in connection with the float, which is expected to value the group at between Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m. The letter says that the 'need for approval of this loan by the shareholders of the Daily Telegraph, other than Hollinger, . . . was inadvertently overlooked'. Already Pounds 18m has been repaid and the remaining Pounds 15m will be eliminated by the sale to the Daily Telegraph of Hollinger's 13 per cent stake in Trinity International Holdings, the publisher of the Liverpool Echo and Daily Post. The Daily Telegraph will pay up to Pounds 20.2m for this stake, the balance over Pounds 15m being met through an issue of preference shares to Hollinger. Shareholders will be asked to approve the payment of a special 10p dividend as a means of 'rewarding existing shareholders ahead of the proposed flotation', which will see Hollinger's stake reduced to about 70 per cent. The dividend will be worth Pounds 11.1m to Hollinger. Mr Black said that the prospect of economic recovery made this an appropriate moment to float the Daily Telegraph, which will change its name to The Telegraph, if shareholders approve. The float will be through a public offering in the UK, and possibly limited private placements overseas. Mr Black said that Hollinger had no intention of selling further shares after the float, and that Hollinger and the Daily Telegraph would have a worldwide co-operation agreement. The meeting will be held on May 18, and a pathfinder prospectus is expected in the first half of June, with listing particulars following later that month. The document also shows that Mr Joe Cooke, the Daily Telegraph managing director, is currently negotiating a service agreement for a fixed term until August 1996. His gross annual salary is Pounds 263,000, excluding pension contributions. The Daily Telegraph yesterday announced an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 9.5m for the first quarter of 1992. The increase is exaggerated because the comparable period included the Gulf war when advertising revenue was particularly depressed. Mr Cooke believed that 'things are easing up a bit' in the advertising market. 'At least the recession is not getting any worse,' he added. The increased first quarter profits were achieved on turnover of Pounds 58.6m (Pounds 53.4m). Earnings per share rose from 4.5p to 5p. In 1991 the Daily Telegraph made pre-tax profits of Pounds 40.5m on turnover of Pounds 219m.</p>

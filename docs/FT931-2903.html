			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Molynx shares fall on loss warning Molynx Holdings shares fell by 24 per cent, from 25p to 19p, yesterday, as the closed circuit television and computerised environmental control systems maker warned of an expected pre-tax loss of about Pounds 500,000 for 1992. It does not expect to recommend payment of a final dividend. Contrary to its earlier expectations, trading in the second half of 1992 had been severely affected by a disappointing performance from its US and German subsidiaries, the company said. A rationalisation programme had been implemented to bring costs at those companies in line with the reduced trading levels. Trading in the UK, Belgium and Norway had been satisfactory. In the first half of 1992 pre-tax profits of Pounds 45,000 were reported and in 1991 the company made Pounds 1.92m. Molynx's results are expected at the end of April.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report BASE METALS rallied above the day's lows in late trading on the LME as a flurry of technical buying and covering brought the recent slippage to a temporary halt. But although some modest consumer interest is emerging, the markets are unlikely to sustain much upward momentum. LME warehouse stocks increased in all but tin and zinc, taking the overall total to a fresh record of 2.326m tonnes. Three-month COPPER built on support below Dollars 2,250 a tonne, moving higher with New York. ALUMINIUM rose sharply as technical considerations outweighed IPAI production data showing September's daily average was 40,800 tonnes, the highest for a year, and 600 tonnes up on August. London's January robusta COFFEE contract equalled the recent six-month high of Dollars 868 a tonne before closing with gains fractionally pared. Dealers said the late rally was led by technical gains in New York which began when its nearby contract rose above 62.90 cents a lb. Compiled from Reuters</p>

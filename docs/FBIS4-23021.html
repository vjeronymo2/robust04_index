Kochetov, Mikrob Antiplague  Scientific Research Institute, Saratov; UDC  616.985:579.843.94]-07:616.163.962.40-097-078.33]-092.9]    [Text] Syngeneic mice of BALB/c lineage infected with  production strains of hybridoma cells are the source of the  specific raw material used in the production of the commercial  diagnostic plague monoclonal anticapsular luminescing  immmunoglobulins developed at the Mikrob All-Russia Antiplague  Scientific Research Institute.    In conjunction with the unique conditions of raising and  breeding mice of specific lineage and likely probability of loss  of the animals' homozygoticity when their breeding expanded, we  tried to use the most popular nonpedigree albino mice in order  to produce ascitic fluid containing specific monoclonal  antibodies.    One hundred fifty nonpedigree albino mice and 525 BALB/c  mice  obtained from the Mikrob institute's nursery were infected with  the production strain of hybridoma  Jp.FI.D[.sub]3[/].B[.sub]2[/].Sp. The mice ranged from 18  to 25 g in weight and 2 to 6 months in age. One to 5 weeks  before infection, they were given intraperitoneal injections of  the mineral oil pristane (Sigma, United States) in the amount of  0.5 ml.    The specific activity of the ascitic fluid was determined  through a reaction of indirect hemagglutination with commercial  plague erythrocytic antigen diagnosticum manufactured at the  Central Asia Antiplague Institute (Alma-Ata) and through the  indirect method of fluorescing antibodies (by using luminescing  serum) to albino mouse globulins produced by the Epidemiology  and Microbiology Scientific Research Institute imeni N.F.  Gamaley of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences in Moscow.    Three groups of nonpedigree mice that each contained  different numbers of hybridoma-inoculated cells (1-5, 5-10, and  10-15 million, respectively) were formed to study the efficiency  of antibody formation. The number of passages of the hybridoma  cells in the different groups of animals ranged from 3-4 to 6-8.  It was established that the number of mice with an ascitic tumor  in each of the different groups was approximately identical. Of  the 150 nonpedigree mice used in the experiments, 78 (52.0 +/-  4.1 percent) were found to have an ascitic tumor. The time to  autopsy of the animals amounted to 9.3 +/- 0.4 days, the volume  of ascites amounted to 3.7 +/- 0.3 ml, and the concentration of  hybridoma cells equaled 14.5 +/- 1.8 million/ml. The volume of  ascitic fluid obtained per mouse fluctuated from 0.5 to 13 ml,  and the concentration of cells ranged from 500,000 to 75  million/ml. A total of 25 mice (16.6 +/- 3.0 percent) died, 17  (11.3 +/- 2.6 percent) were found to be free of symptoms of  ascitic tumor, and 55 (36.6 +/- 3.9 percent) survived after  infection. There were no statistically significant differences  with respect to the number of mice with ascites and the  concentration of hybridoma cells in the ascitic fluid as a  function of the infecting dose of hybridoma. Ascitic tumor  formation took longer in the mice infected with 1-5 million  hybridoma cells. The average volume of ascitic fluid obtained  from one mouse was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) in  the group of animals treated with higher doses of hybridoma.    When the animals were divided into two groups based on  passages performed, a statistically significant difference  (p &lt; 0.01) was found with respect to the number of  ascitic mice in the group of animals infected with hybridoma  after 3-5 passages (66.0 +/- 4.7 percent) compared with the  group infected after 6-8 passages (26.0 +/- 6.2 percent). From  the first group of mice, 227.3 ml of ascitic fluid was obtained,  and from the second group, 31.7 ml was obtained. The average  volume of ascitic fluid obtained from one mouse was  significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) in the second group  of animals. The increased efficiency of ascites formation in the  animals with an elevated infecting dose of hybridoma after 6-8  passages should also be noted. For comparison, ascitic tumor was  recorded in 480 (91.4 +/- 2.4 million/ml) of the 525 BALB/c mice  infected with the very same hybridoma in doses of 1-5 million  cells after 2-12 passages. The ascites formation time averaged 7  +/- 0.1 days, the volume of ascitic fluid amounted to 7.1 +/-  0.1 ml, and the concentration of hybridoma cells equaled 12.4  +/- 2.4 million/ml. The results obtained with respect to the  latter two indicators were virtually no different from the  respective data for the group of nonpedigree mice.    After 10-12 intertwinings of the hybridoma  Jp.FI.D[.sub]3[/].B[.sub]2[/].Sp in the bodies of the  nonpedigree mice, it was virtually impossible to obtain ascitic  tumors despite the injection of high infecting doses (10-20  million cells). The animals generally survived or yielded single  solid tumors. The efficiency of ascites formation in mice of the  BALB/c line remained high (80-88 percent) up to the 33rd passage  (the observation period).    The specific activity of the ascitic fluid obtained from the  nonpedigree mice and the mice of BALB/c lineage were at the same  level in the indirect hemagglutination reaction and when the  indirect method of fluorescing antibodies was used. From the  standpoint of its physicochemical properties and specific  activity (working dilution of at least 1:32), the commercial  luminescing preparation prepared on the basis of biological  material from nonpedigree mice conformed to the requirements  stipulated in technical norm references (Experimental-production  Regulation No. 11-86 and Temporary Pharmacopoeia Article  42-66VS-87).    It was thus established that nonpedigree mice may be used as  a source of monoclonal antibodies to capsular plague microbe  antigen when they are infected with the hybridoma  Jp.FI.D[.sub]3[/].B[.sub]2[/].Sp and that the efficiency  of ascites formation decreases as the number of passages of the  hybridoma cells in the bodies of nonpedigree mice increases.  This is possibly a unique property of the specific hybridoma. It  should be noted that the hybridoma used in this work was  obtained in 1983. During the 7 years that followed, it was  cloned several times and passaged numerous times during the  process of scientific studies, scientific-technical development,  and commercial production of the preparation on BALB/c mice that  were acquired from various sources and that often were of  dubious genetic standard. It may be hypothesized that a partial  selection of cells with weakly expressed antigen properties and  capable of adaptation in nonsyngeneic mice occurred a result of  periodic culturing of the hybridoma  Jp.FI.D[.sub]3[/].B[.sub]2[/].Sp on genetically impure  animals.

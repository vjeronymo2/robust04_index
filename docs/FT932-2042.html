			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (2): Back to the private sector - Aftermath of the banking crisis FOR NORDIC governments struggling with the aftermath of the banking sector crisis, the chief immediate issues remain those of restructuring and restoring profitability. But already Sweden and Norway have made the first moves towards reprivatising banks that have been taken over in the past two years. With the exception of Denmark, where state aid has not been required, nationalisation has been an inevitable consequence of government commitments to prevent any defaults in their banking systems and to maintain creditor confidence, not least among international investors. The extent of state intervention in the individual countries and the prospects for reprivatisation are as follows: SWEDEN: To date, the government has put up SKr74bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in cash, loans and guarantees to keep banks afloat. It has set up the Bank Support Authority to administer state support and, where necessary, to acquire and administer bank shares. The authority will dispose of the shares 'when it is commercially appropriate'. So far, the state has taken over Nordbanken and Gotabanken. It is still reviewing the extent of state aid required by Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the country's leading commercial bank, Swedbank, a newly-created conglomerate of savings banks known locally as Sparbanken, and Foreningsbanken, a co-operative bank. Decisions on these are not expected until the autumn. Meanwhile, the process of reprivatisation is under way at Gotabanken, which so far has received SKr10bn in state guarantees, most of which has been drawn down. A memo to investors was circulated in April to around 20 potential foreign and domestic investors, according to the government. The bank, which showed operating losses of SKr2.4bn in 1992, could be sold by early next year. Before then, a decision will be taken on how much of Gotabanken's portfolio of SKr40bn of problem loans will be taken out and placed in a so-called 'bad bank' which will remain under government control. Decisions will also be made on whether to split up the remainder of the bank, or to sell it in one piece. The authority has already dumped bad loans worth SKr67bn out of Nordbanken into state-run Securum, a 'bad bank' whose assets will gradually be liquidated. This enabled Nordbanken to show a profit in the first quarter, after losses in 1992 of SKr16bn. But Nordbanken, which has swallowed SKr56bn in state support, is not set to be sold off until 1994 at the earliest to allow time for it to re-establish its long-term stability. NORWAY: State support for the banks has cost NKr27bn (Pounds 2.6bn) to date in what has been a virtual nationalisation of the system. The biggest bank, Den norske Bank, is 70 per cent owned by the government; Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, the second and third biggest banks, are all but 100 per cent state-owned. A smaller commercial bank, Oslobanken, is in the process of being wound up by the government. The state's involvement is administered mainly through two institutions, the Bank Insurance Fund and the Bank Investment Fund, run through the Bank of Norway. The latter is the main instrument for the exercise of the state's share ownership (although, confusingly, Fokus Bank is owned by the insurance fund). The former has provided aid in the form of cash, loans and guarantees. The Labour government has said it intends to launch a limited offer of shares in Christiania Bank later this year to test the market for reprivatisation following improved performance this year both in the banks and in the economy as a whole. But its long-term policy on privatisation is vague. Central bank and commercial bank officials believe that Labour intends holding on to strategic bank shareholdings, at least to block foreign takeovers. FINLAND: The state has so far spent FM38bn (Pounds 4.5bn) on bailing out the country's banks. A government estimate at the end of 1992 predicted that another FM30bn would be required before the crisis is resolved, although parliament has so far only approved an additional FM20bn. The Government Guarantee Fund, set up to handle the bank crisis, has taken over the two main players in the savings bank sector, Skopbank and the Savings Bank of Finland. The state has also extended support at least in the form of preferred capital to all the banks, including Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the leading commercial bank. After a number of aborted attempts to force mergers to rationalise the system, the government has now commissioned Merrill Lynch of the US to recommend a course of action for rationalisation and eventual privatisation. But this is not expected until the autumn and officials say it is too early to say how long it will be before the state bank shareholdings can be sold off.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 KEY RATIOS FOR THE MAIN BANK GROUPS (1992)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Operating        Income/      Return   Expenses/                     profit (loss) in    expense        on       total Bank               Swedish kroner (m)    ratio*    equity (%)   assets*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SWEDEN  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Handelsbanken           (840)              2.3         -3        1.4% S-E-Banken            (5,370)              1.7        -18        1.6% Nordbanken           (16,049)              1.5        -85        2.1% Gotabanken           (12,913)              0.8       -173        2.9%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DENMARK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Den Danske Bank       (1,209)              1.3         -4        2.1% Unidanmark            (4,600)              1.3        -18        3.1% Bikuben               (1,247)              1.2        -13        3.1%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FINLAND  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Unitas                (3,636)              1.2        -19        2.2% KOP                   (4,921)              1.2        -29        2.3%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NORWAY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Den norske Bank       (3,143)              1.3        -24        3.0% Christiania Bank      (1,261)              1.5        -46        2.8% Fokus Bank              (438)              1.1        -30        4.4%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Before credit losses  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Handelsbanken  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

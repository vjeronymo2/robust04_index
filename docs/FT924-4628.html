			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (5): Maxwell: behind the mask of a monster THE UNKNOWN MAXWELL by Nicholas Davies Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, Pounds 14.99 NICHOLAS DAVIES served as foreign editor for the Mirror Group when foreign coverage was not exactly a priority. The attitude of his last immediate boss, Richard Stott, editor of the Daily Mirror who was sacked earlier this month, was that most foreign news was of limited interest to 'tabloid' Mirror readers. What Davies lacked in serious employment (and he continues to deny that he was ever involved in arms-dealing, as alleged in a book by US journalist Seymour Hersh), he made up in experience as unofficial equerry to the late Robert Maxwell, one-time newspaper magnate whose business empire collapsed soon after his body was found floating off the Canaries just over a year ago. It is in his capacity as confidante at home and note-taker during Maxwell's globe-trotting that Davies establishes his credentials not as a serious biographer but as a competent diarist with a skilful eye for the telling anecdote. At home, Maxwell spent more time on his newspapers than on any other part of his business, even though they were not the main generators of his wealth. Maxwell showed neither editorial judgment nor inspiration as a publisher - with the exception of his introduction of colour printing. But his newspapers were a convenient playground in which to bully employees and exercise other idiosyncracies. The bullying has been well documented in an earlier Maxwell book written by another editor of the Daily Mirror, Roy Greenslade. What Davies manages to put together is a rather more terrifying picture of a megalomaniac who at times tottered on the brink of insanity. As Davies puts it in one of the few reflective passages to be found in this entertaining book: 'There was an emotional restlessness about him, a deep-rooted obsession, if not an unnatural urge to dominate and rule, and I wondered whether his excitability and irrational behaviour amounted at times to a madness.' Stories of the difficulties in communication within the Maxwell empire are legion. Particularly striking is Davies' tale of Maxwell regularly imitating animal noises - a lion, a dog, and a duck to be precise - as he answered calls. Maxwell's number was similar to that of London Zoo, so lines sometimes got crossed. Dialogue was no less civil in Japan where Maxwell once travelled to try and get his MCC shares quoted on the Tokyo stock exchange. Davies describes an evening when Maxwell, in full view of his hosts - executives from Nomura - dispensed with chopsticks and attacked his dinner with his hands prior to walking out of the restaurant. He had no time to waste on protocol even when millions of shares were at stake. In Japan, as in France, Argentina, Kenya, Poland, Bulgaria, and even Israel, Maxwell promised much but delivered little. Investments were never realised with success; instead Maxwell seems to have exploited the brief fix of being treated as a visiting head of state, surrounded by a coterie of fawning delegates. It was in Moscow, (where Davies seems to have carried out an investigation to complement his own notes), that a more lasting link was established. Maxwell, while not a spy, was regarded as an 'agent of influence' by the KGB and may well have played a part in funnelling Communist Party funds towards the West. Whether talking to communist bureaucrats or Latin American playboy presidents, Maxwell always displayed a total lack of interest in the culture and people he visited. He was happiest in no country in particular, but drifting at sea, where he managed to go on bullying his employees from the luxury of his boat, the Lady Ghislaine until he fell overboard in November 1991. By then, as everyone now knows, the Maxwell empire was already not worth the paper it was written on. Davies provides few fresh details about where the money went and how. But he leaves us with an intriguing suggestion as to the three people who might shed fresh light in the future. They are Dr Werner Rechsteiner, Maxwell's Swiss lawyer; Ellis Freedman, his US lawyer; and Vladimir Alexandrovich Kryuchkov, former chief of the KGB.</p>

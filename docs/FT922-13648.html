			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Industry recovery helps lift Total net 42% to FFr5.8bn TOTAL, the world's eighth largest oil group, yesterday attributed a 42 per cent rise in group annual profits to a sharp recovery in refining and chemicals. Net profits at the French state-controlled group rose from FFr4.1bn (Dollars 730m) in 1990 to FFr5.8bn last year, confirming the group's January estimate. Turnover was up by 11.4 per cent, from FFr128.4bn to FFr143bn, over the same period, due to a rise in volumes, said Mr Serge Tchuruk, chairman. This contrasts with the 7.5 per cent net profits decline at Elf Aquitaine, Total's larger state-controlled rival, over the same period. The difference reflected Total's larger exposure to refining and distribution, which accounted for nearly half of its operating profits last year, against a quarter of Elf's operating earnings. Total's operating profits rose 30 per cent to FFr10.3bn last year. With European demand for refined products strong, the refining and distribution division's operating profits rose 63 per cent to FFr4.9bn. Total makes two thirds of its refining sales in Europe, where capacity was practically saturated, said Mr Tchuruk. He expected little fresh European capacity to open in the near future because of concerns about environmental impact. At the same time, demand for refined products from southern and eastern Europe was likely to grow. Total's operating profits in exploration and production fell slightly, from FFr3bn to FFr2.9bn, as margins were squeezed by the fall in oil prices. Profits in the trading division stagnated at FFr1bn, while chemicals' operating earnings rose from FFr900m to FFr1.5bn. Proven reserves rose by 3.8 per cent last year, to 513m tonnes of oil equivalent. This was led by a 16 per cent expansion outside the Middle East, where it is the largest western oil producer. Currently, just short of 60 per cent of Total's reserves are in the region. Although it plans to continue expansion beyond the Middle East, Total would also increase reserves in the region, said Mr Tchuruk.</p>

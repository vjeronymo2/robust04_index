			<p>BFN     [Text] At a meeting in the office of the Chechen President  Dhozkhar Dudayev on Tuesday a letter sent by Russian  Vice-Premier Sergey Shakhray was discussed. It was allegedly  submitted to the State Duma marked "Confidential". The 12-page  document contains recommendations to the Russian leadership  regarding the tactics and strategy in the resolution of the  Chechen problem.    The Chechen presidential office told Interfax that Shakhray  recommended that in the settlement of the Russian-Chechen  relations, the main stakes should be made on political forces  opposing Dudayev.    "This is another sign that Russian diplomacy is not in  control of the situation," a high-ranking official of the  Chechen presidential staff pointed out. In his opinion, the  Russian leadership is currently trying to reanimate supporters  of the former first secretary of the Chechen-Ingush Regional  Committee Doka Zavgayev who was dismissed from this post in 1991  and is now living in Moscow.    At a conference in Groznyy the Security Department submitted  a document to the Chechen president, saying that Shakhray  maintains close relations with the Chechen opposition.</p>

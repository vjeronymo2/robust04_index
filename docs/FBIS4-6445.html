			<p>BFN     [Text] Increasing cross-border flows of goods, services,  and investments is a key to keeping the Asia-Pacific region  economically strong.    This, reported Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo to  President Ramos, was one of the conclusions reached at the  recent Asia-Pacific Finance Ministers' meeting in Honolulu,  Hawaii.    In a two-page report, Mr. de Ocampo said he told his APEC  [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] colleagues, the Philippines  is ready to contribute to the growth of the Asia-Pacific region,  even as it is currently "positioned for a takeoff." The finance  chief likewise reported he had "most enlightening" discussions  with representatives of Chile, Mexico, and Thailand. Among the  items discussed was the implementation of the value added tax.  These countries, Mr. de Ocampo noted, benefited from an  expanded coverage of the said taxation scheme.    "All these countries have reaped the benefits of tax reform  and the broadening of their respective value-added tax systems,"  he said.    Other points discussed in the meeting and agreed upon were  the need to maintain sound economic policies and stability as a  foundation for sustained, low inflation growth in the region;  the importance of having the private sector continue to be the  primary engine of growth; the need to further develop capital  markets for effective mobilization and allocation of capital;  and, the necessity of improving the capacity to finance  infrastructure development in order to address current shortages  and inefficiencies.    Moreover, during the meeting, the Philippine panel --  composed of Mr. de Ocampo, Finance Undersecretary Juanita  Amatong, Philippine Consul General in Honolulu Solita Aguirre,  and special assistant Gabriel Lim stressed the urgency of  arriving at an early conclusion to the ongoing discussions on a  100 percent capital increase for the Asian Development Bank, and  the need to look more closely at and to accommodate other models  of development particularly those reflected in the recent World  Bank study on East Asia.    He also stressed on the need to continue supporting small  and  medium-scale enterprises.</p>

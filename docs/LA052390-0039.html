			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RALLY WILL CALL FOR ARTS FUNDING  </P> <P> The San Diego arts community has put out a spirited call to "show your heart  for the arts" on Thursday.  </P> <P> The 12:30 p.m. rally at the Civic Theatre concourse is billed as a protest  against a proposed city budget that would cut the heart out of arts funding.  </P> <P> Faced with a looming $60-million budget shortfall, San Diego City Manager John  Lockwood has proposed eliminating funding to arts organizations from next  year's $1.2-billion municipal budget. Such groups as The Old Globe Theatre, the  La Jolla Playhouse, the San Diego Repertory Theatre, and the San Diego Symphony  would receive nothing if the City Council adopts the proposal.  </P> <P> But rather than hold a wake, rally organizers are planning a protest to  demonstrate what the arts do best, according to Adrian Stewart, founder and  president of the San Diego Arts and Cultural Coalition which is coordinating  the event.  </P> <P> The Starlight Musical Theatre Company will perform numbers from the Follies and  the O'Farrell School performing arts troupe will also provide dance and music,  said Stewart. "We know how to have fun."  </P> <P> Thousands of art patrons are expected to attend the rally, Stewart said.  </P> <P> "We need people who care to come. The rally is for everybody who's ever  listened to a symphony, watched a ballet dancer or looked at a painting and  been inspired."  </P> <P> Noting that 560,000 school children attended arts performances last year,  Stewart said the rally is for "anyone who cares about the quality of life for  their children."  </P> <P> The arts organizations are not a frill, Stewart said. "We're an essential part  of the quality of life in this city. America's finest city is America's finest  city because of its arts and cultural scene."  </P></p>

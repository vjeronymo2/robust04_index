			<p>BFN     [Text] The State Council chairman, Mr. David Kpomakpor, has  been warned not to allow himself to be used as puppet by Amos  Sawyer and his bunch of political misfits who have brought  disgrace to the West African subregion and untold suffering to  the Liberian people.    In a statement issued, the executive committee of CAG  [expansion unknown] said since the induction of the State  Council over one month ago, the council has made no effort to  visit other parts of the country to ensure genuine reunification  and a process of confidence-building. The statement said  Councilor Kpomakpor, as an eminent person on the State Council,  must conduct himself in a more credible way to ensure that the  contemporary wishes and aspirations of the Liberian people are  protected.</p>

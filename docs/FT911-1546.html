			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / International Company News: Continental Air seeks extra Dollars 3bn CONTINENTAL AIRLINES, one of the five largest US carriers, is seeking more than Dollars 3bn in fresh equity and cash to restructure its debt-burdened balance-sheet and help it out of bankruptcy in the next eight to 12 months. Mr Hollis Harris, the new chairman of the airline which filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code last December, said he was seeking the conversion of about Dollars 2bn of unsecured debt into equity. The airline currently has total unsecured debts of Dollars 2.5bn and secured debts of Dollars 4.5bn. Mr Harris, the former Delta Airlines president brought in to rescue Continental, said it was planning to raise an additional Dollars 600m in new equity from three or four investor groups. The company has had discussions with business representatives at its three US hubs of Houston, Denver and Newark, New Jersey. At the same time, Continental is in advanced talks to sell a controlling interest in its Air Micronesia operation in the Pacific for about Dollars 300m. But Mr Harris emphasised Continental would continue to be closely involved in the operation in which it intended to retain a 49 per cent interest. The airline is also expecting to raise about Dollars 80m this year from the sale of its Chelsea air catering company. It has already sold its Seattle to Tokyo route to American Airlines for Dollars 150m. All these transactions coupled with the restructuring of the company aircraft operating and capital leases are designed to reconstruct the company's balance sheet and provide additional capital to expand the airline. Mr Harris stressed that Continental had to find a way not to shrink its operations. The airline has 350 aircraft in its fleet and has 190 new Boeing and Airbus jets on order. 'We must grow the airline as we come out of Chapter 11 (protection). We cannot cut back. We have to grow and maintain market share if we are to compete with the other big carriers,' he said. But he acknowledged that the financial restructuring if successful was likely to dilute significantly current shareholders' equity. This would include Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) which currently owns 16.8 per cent of Continental shares and 18.3 per cent of voting rights. 'Their holding will automatically be reduced significantly under the restructuring,' Mr Harris said. But he added that he expected SAS to invest additional funds in Continental. 'We have a good relationship and I believe they want to be a partner with us,' Mr Harris said. Continental reported this week a sizeable first-quarter loss of Dollars 194.8m compared with a Dollars 21.3m profit in the same quarter last year.</p>

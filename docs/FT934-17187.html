			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / UN relief supplies for Georgia The United Nations is sending emergency relief supplies to Georgia for at least 70,000 people known to have fled the breakaway region of Abkhazia, and says it expects the numbers of refugees to swell in coming days, writes Frances Williams from Geneva. Mr Robert Souria, head of relief co-ordination in the UN's humanitarian affairs department, said yesterday that many had escaped to the town of Mestia in the mountains of north Abkhazia, which was virtually inaccessible by road. Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, is packed with refugees and thousands have arrived by boat in the Black Sea ports of Poti and Sotchi. The UN plans to airfreight 40 tonnes of supplies, mostly clothes and blankets, to the region next Tuesday but needs Dollars 200,000 to finance a second air and helicopter shipment, Mr Souria said.</p>

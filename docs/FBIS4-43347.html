			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- North Korean Foreign Minister Kim  Yong- nam stopped over in Berlin on his flight from Kiev to  Pyongyang. On Friday [10 June], the Foreign Ministry in Bonn  said the minister arrived on Thursday night and would continue  his trip on Friday night. He had not asked for any talks and  there were no plans for talks either. It was said that it was a  transit stop for "technical" reasons.    The North Korean had visited the Ukrainian capital before.  He was actually scheduled to go to one of the central Asian  republics but changed his plans at short notice. His flight  back to Pyongyang went through Berlin.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara -- Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, assessing  foreign policy developments in 1993 and making projections for  1994, suggested on Friday [31 December] that major developments  awaited Turkey in the new year in terms of international  relations.    He placed particular emphasis in this context on relations  with Greece, the European Union, and Azerbaijan.    In a hard hitting message to Greece, in response to recent  statements from the Greek government, Cetin cautioned Athens  against miscalculating Turkish calm and reserve, thus leading to  consequences it could not deal with.    Cetin, who was addressing reporters at a press conference on  the last day of the year, also announced that Turkey was going  to prepare a new border accord with Azerbaijan.    Diplomatic observers interpret the announcement as a warning  to Armenia, which has escalated its aggression on Azerbaijani  territory.    Recalling that Armenian aggression was today widely  condemned  by the international community, Cetin said there was no way that  Armenian invaders would be allowed to stay in Azerbaijan. "With  the dismemberment of the Soviet Union, Ankara now shares a  border with Azerbaijan. Turkey is now preparing to sign a new  border accord with Azerbaijan. Turkish and Azeri officials are  currently studying previous documents," he said.    Cetin added the accord with Baku was expected to be signed  during the visit of Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev to  Turkey in January.    Foreign Minister Cetin also predicted important activity in  the new year regarding the transportation of Caucasian and  Central Asian oil.    "The two set points in the proposed Azerbaijani pipeline's  route have been specified. These are Baku, the starting point,  and Ceyhan, on Turkey's Mediterranean port. How these two  points are connected is not important for us and will be talked  about," Cetin said.    Ruling out the use of the Turkish straits for major oil  transportation due to heavy traffic, Cetin said Turkey could not  accept heavy tanker traffic in the already congested straits.  He recalled the dangers that a city like Istanbul with a  population of 10 million would face in the event of the extreme  increase in high tonnage tanker traffic.    Cetin said contacts with Russia, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan  and  Western oil companies on this subject would continue. "We  suggest the oil should be transported through Turkey to the  Mediterranean. It could be directly over Turkey by pipeline, or  it can be brought to the Russian port of Navorossisk and then  brought to Turkey. It can go over Georgia or Iran, or, if peace  is secured, it can even come over Armenia," Cetin said,  signalling that the way Baku and Ceyhan were connected was  ultimately not significant for Turkey.    Referring to recent announcements by the government of  Andreas Papandreou in Greece, particularly in connection with  the illegal arming of the Greek islands just off Turkey's coast,  Cetin noted that these left little to be optimistic about  Ankara's relations with Athens in the new year.    He said, however, that Ankara had no plans at the preset  time  to bring these provocations by Athens up at international fora.  He suggested that Turkey was satisfied with seeing Greece  alienate itself internationally through its behavior.  Indicating that Ankara's wish was to maintain the channels of  dialogue with Athens, Cetin nevertheless cautioned that Turkey  was ready for any eventuality in the face of potential Greek  adventurism.    He also expressed exasperation with continued Greek  obstructions in Turco-European Union relations, reminding again  that means to overcome the problem of the Greek veto in this  context should be found.    He said if a solution was not found to this problem, then  future problems between Turkey and Greece would automatically  become problems between Turkey and the EU [European Union]  which, he suggested, would be debilitating.    Referring to the Customs Union between Turkey and the Union  proposed for 1995, Cetin said Turkey was ready to shoulder its  share of the burden.    "But the Union should also do its share. Under the  Additional Protocol, Turkey has to receive financial support  from the Union. The 4th Financial Protocol has not materialized  due to the Greek veto. Neither has the fifth. Together with  these and the 6th Financial Protocol, the support which Turkey  is now entitled to is about $3.5 billion," Cetin said.    Cetin said the financial support which the Union should  provide for Turkey would be one of the items in the upcoming  talks between the foreign ministers of Turkey, Germany and  Britain which is scheduled for January 20.    Cetin stressed that 1993 had been a difficult year but one  which also brought fruitful results for Turkey, which he said  had now become a major center of diplomacy in line with a wish  expressed by Ataturk so many years ago.    The foreign minister underlined the following developments  in  Turkish policy in this context:    In the last year Turkey has become a country that is no  longer on the periphery, but on the crossroads of the Caucasus,  the Balkans and the Black Sea. Through the Balkans we are  connected to Europe, with the Caucasus to Central Asia and with  the Black Sea to Russia and Ukraine.    The institutions of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation are  now prepared. The Economic Cooperation Organization, on the  other hand, has now been enlarged with the Central Asian  Republics and its members number 10. It is also ready to  activate further cooperation.    Ankara has enhanced its relations in the Balkans. Our ties  with Russia are based on good neighborliness and common  interests.    We have also established institutionalized ties with the  Central Asian republics. We have taken 7,00 students from those  republics last year giving them full scholarships. We have  extended $1 billion dollars in eximbank credits to them, and  some 300 million of this has been used. Our private sector has  made $2.48 billion in direct investments in Central Asia. Our  foreign trade with the region has increased to $287 million in  the first eight months of 1993. Turkish Airlines now flies  twice a week to most Central Asian capitals.    There is also great deal of cooperation in the communication  sector. Today, the Turkish TV channel Avrasya is only surpassed  by the CNN as the most-commonly watched channel.    A Turkic Summit, which President Demirel will attend, will  be  held in Baku on January 21.    Turkey has made its European allies understand the nature of  PKK terrorism, to condemn it and to ban PKK activities. With  Iran we have launched fresh cooperation on security and are  keeping our channels of dialogue open with this country. We are  also ready for dialogue with our neighbor Syria, but this  depends largely on Syria's attitude. Our attitude toward  terrorism was explained to Damascus. Our political security  mechanisms with this country continue to operate. A Turkish  delegation will hold meetings in Damascus in the new year.    We are going to hold a tripartite meeting with Iran and  Syria  in Istanbul at which we will discuss regional problems and the  issue of security. Bilateral issues can also be discussed  during the bilateral meetings of the foreign ministers.    Turkey has no problem with Iraq. Iraq's problem is with the  international community. We are of the strong belief that the  3.5 years of isolation Baghdad has suffered is enough, and all  parties, particularly Iraq, should strive for this country's  reintegration with the world.    A delegation from the Iraqi Foreign Ministry will come to  Turkey to discuss what could be done with the oil in the  Yumurtalik-Karkuk pipeline. There are two major problems in  this context: What will be done with Iraqi portion of the oil  once it's taken out of the pipeline, and how will the pipeline  be filled again to prevent damage? We are also discussing this  issue with the Americans.    Operation Poised Hammer (Provide Comfort) is here due to  regional conditions. Its removal or continuation will not solve  anything, although its going may aggravate the situation. What  will solve the problem in this context is talks between the  northern Iraqi leaders and the Baghdad government.    Our enhanced partnership with the United States has been  furthered during Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's visit to  Washington and the intense diplomatic efforts which followed.  Cetin went on to say that 1993 had underlined the need for new  policies based on new political realities.    Cetin stressed the search for a New World Order which would  replace the former bipolar world.    "There is little that causes us to be optimistic," he said.  "On the contrary, it is clear that this period of disorder will  continue in the coming days, and this situation is particularly  valid for our part of the world."    Stressing that "long-term planning was necessary in domestic  and foreign policy," Cetin said: "In 1993, which seemed to be  longer than a normal calendar year, Turkey had to deal with a  multitude of foreign policy problems and crises, and at the same  time. Unlike some other states, we did not have the luxury of  concentrating on a single thing."    He added the developments in the field of diplomacy in 1993  were not always black and white.    "The problems we confronted, the lack of will in the  international arena, the double standards in the world and the  inaction in the face of major crises is not something Turkey can  be accused of having taken part in," Cetin said responding to  criticism that Turkish foreign policy had been ineffective.</p>

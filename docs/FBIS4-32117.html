			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Panta Dzambazovski and Z. Cvetanovska: "Serbian </F> Soldiers Are Entrenching"]    [Text] The thick fog around the border region near the  village of Cupino Brdo, in the district of Kriva Palanka,  prevented us from seeing the Serbian soldiers who, after  penetrating 250 meters into Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] territory, now control a  strategic height 1703 meters above ground level. If there had  not been a strong wind blowing toward the seized zone, we might  even have heard their voices. We managed to approach them to  within some 120 meters.    This was the farthest point that we could reach, and we were  escorted there by Dusko Spasevski, one of the members of the  Macedonian Army [ARM] camping near the border -- about 40  minutes away on foot. The ARM patrols usually come to 100-200  meters from the strategic point on the Straza mountain, where  the Serbian soldiers of the regular Yugoslav Army are being  entrenched. They have already dug trenches and positioned  machine-gun nests there. When the weather allows, the Macedonian  soldiers can see the Serbian patrols changing over. Sometimes  they communicate for a whole hour, but the conversations go as  follows: "Do not approach, this is Serbia." Sometimes they  send invitations for discussions: "Come to negotiate, let us  agree." The members of our army do not react. In the vicinity  we also met a five-member Macedonian patrol headed by Lieutenant  Enver Jakupi.    It seems that this point is of importance for the Serbian  army because of its strategic character, and not because it is  allegedly on "Serbian territory." Actually, the district real  estate registry offices have always worked diligently, and  therefore this border belt has never been disputed. The essence  is that this point is a good observation point for a large  stretch of Macedonian territory. From there it is possible to  observe the border posts at Ramna Niva, German, and Kopriva  (with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), Deve Bair (with  Bulgaria), and up to the mountains of Osogovo. The previous  position of the Serbian army was behind this elevation, near a  settlement in Yugoslavia by the name of Cuka, which did not  offer such possibilities.    According to some information, the Serbian soldiers have  been  here for a whole month. Their patrols are usually composed of  eight members. They carry some small arms, but some claim that  they have also deployed mortars. At this moment, it is probably  the surveillance equipment that is the most important weapon in  use, and this is surely also directed at UNPROFOR members.    We have also found out something else that is exclusively  revealed in our newspaper. Namely, the Serbian soldiers have  not penetrated 250 meters into our territory, but 300 meters.  To be more precise, when approached by Macedonian military  patrols, the Serbian soldiers descend 50 meters from the  elevation and take up a new position more suitable for attacks  and for defense. Before taking over this strategic elevation,  the Serbian army had deployed some reservists near the villages  of Surlica and Prolesje in Yugoslavia.    On the Macedonian side the nearest settlements are the  villages of Podrzikonj and Luke, whose inhabitants are deeply  worried. A number of them have land just on the border. They  cannot go to this now. The Serbian soldiers do not allow them,  and the ARM is advising them not to go until the situation is  resolved.    Half an hour before the arrival of our team, at some hundred  meters from the ARM camp, some dozens of UNPROFOR field vehicles  of the "Hammer" type arrived, with U.S. soldiers on board. We  could see that their intention was to stay there for a while,  because they were setting up tents.    Compared with two days earlier, yesterday there were not a  large number of ARM or police there. Actually, that had been a  preventive measure because of the traditional rally organized in  memory of Cupino Brdo, where Macedonian and Serbian partisans  waged a joint battle against the Bulgarian occupier during World  War II. This time, however, Serbian war veterans did not show  up.    It is obvious that the Serbian Army does not intend to  withdraw.</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Brussels in a banana split: A row over the EU's import scheme European Union specifications for the bendiness of bananas have made irresistibly comic copy on the front pages of Britain's tabloid press recently. Most people are unable to take anything to do with bananas seriously. Not so a committed core of trade negotiators, officials and businessmen involved in an acrimonious dispute over the EU's arrangements for importing the yellow fruit. Opposition to the EU's banana import scheme is running high. In recent weeks, the US has launched one trade investigation and threatened a second; the German government has complained for the second time to the European Court of Justice; and Guatemala has vowed to lodge a complaint with the new World Trade Organisation, successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year. While disagreements over bananas date back to the creation of the EU in 1957, current divisions are so deep that the Union is finding it difficult to agree any action at all. The present source of friction is the preferential access to the EU banana market - which accounts for 3.6m tonnes a year - granted to former colonies of Britain and France in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) under the Lome trade convention. In 1993, import rules had to be harmonised across member countries as part of the move towards a single market. Before this, Germany imported bananas from Latin America as a source of quality, uniform, inexpensive fruit. But the new rules placed a quota and a tariff on these so-called dollar bananas, while allowing in ACP country imports tariff-free. Under the current regime, 30 per cent of import licences are allocated to traders on the basis of past trade in ACP bananas, 60 per cent on the basis of past trade in Latin American bananas, and 10 per cent to newcomers and traders in EU bananas. Germany was furious about the new rules, although, as one German former agricultural official recently roared: 'Germans are not emotional about bananas; it's pure economic good sense.' Germany consumes more bananas - almost 1lb per person per week - than any other country in the EU, double the level of UK consumption. The fruit was seen as a first taste of freedom for west Germans after the allied blockade. It was also a potent symbol of western affluence for east Germans, who cleared the shelves of bananas in west Berlin when the Berlin wall was pulled down in 1989. 'Konrad Adenauer did a lot of good things for us Germans, but the best was the banana protocol,' said a German official with only a tinge of irony, referring to the deal hammered out by the first German chancellor allowing Germany to import as many bananas as it wished. Negotiating the protocol held up the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which originally created the European Economic Community. Indeed, bananas have almost changed the face of the world a few times. A Franco-German dispute over bananas delayed the signing of the Uruguay Round agreement in Marrakesh earlier this year. And Germany's second complaint to the European Court on the issue could still hold up EU ratification of the Gatt deal. The UK and France remain firmly committed to the Lome convention. 'We're still as behind the banana regime as ever, but you can't disguise the fact that it has rather a lot of enemies,' said one British Foreign Office official. UK officials, however, acknowledge that the US trade investigation could present the most serious challenge yet to the EU's banana ar-rangements. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, is looking into a complaint by Chiquita Brands International, a large US banana exporter, and the Hawaii Banana Industry Association that the EU's arrangements for importing bananas are damaging US companies' ability to compete in the Dollars 2.7bn-a-year EU market. Mr Kantor has said he will also investigate the quota on EU imports from Latin America, which has been set at 2.17m tonnes this year. Latin American countries have already had complaints over quotas upheld by the Gatt disputes panel, which has declared the EU arrangement illegal. The EU recently applied for a waiver to the Gatt rules for the Lome convention. The Gatt council is due to consider the request next week. But Mr Kantor's investigations may be more difficult to ignore. If he concludes that US interests have been hurt by EU policy, he is likely to threaten retaliatory trade action. If he threatens to slap a large import tariff on Scotch whisky, for example, the UK government would have to decide whether it could put national interests at risk through its support for an altruistic policy towards former colonies. Under these circumstances, UK politicians' enthusiasm for the banana regime could fade fast. Caribbean banana producers are aware of their vulnerability in these games of power politics, but since bananas are one of their few sources of income, they must battle on. 'We spend all our time fighting on the diplomatic front to preserve our markets - it's unsettling. We need stability to develop our agriculture,' said Mr John Compton, prime minister of St Lucia, which derives half of its gross domestic product from the sale of bananas to the EU. Mr Compton feels embattled on all sides, after a tropical storm in September destroyed 60 per cent of the island's banana crop. After the storm, Geest, the main importer of bananas from the Windward Islands, successfully fought to raise its quota of Latin American bananas to make up the shortfall. Germany has suggested that, since bananas from ACP countries are small and of variable quality, their producers should receive aid to help them diversify out of bananas. The St Lucia prime minister wants to encourage the production of avocado pears and citrus fruit, but since most bananas are grown by small, family farms, it takes time to put changes into practice. For now, the European Commission is stymied on bananas. Its current rules for quotas on Latin American bananas were due to come into force this month, but it has been unable to agree the technicalities of the regime with member governments. Mr Kantor's investigation is likely to take about a year, and Germany's complaint will be heard in the European Court next year. Anyone who thinks bananas are still amusing had better wipe the smile off their face.</p>

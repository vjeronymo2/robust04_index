			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Riga today, Alain Lamassoure, minister delegate  of European affairs at the French Foreign Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, offered Latvia several proposals for tackling issues of  national security. One of the proposals is joining Balladur's  plan, or the European stability pact, the draft of which was  worked out by the French premier.    This plan envisages joint discussion and tackling of various  conflicts and problems between neighboring countries. It is  planned in the draft to pay particular attention to problems  which occur in relations between small countries and neighboring  great powers.    France will also assist Latvia in joining the European  Union.  An agreement is currently being worked out between the European  Union and Latvia, and France wishes that the agreement will also  have a political significance and make it possible for Latvia to  become a member state of the European Union in the future.    In addition, Lamassoure said that France supports the  concept  of Latvia joining the West European Union as an associate member.    The Partnership for Peace cooperation program offered by  NATO  would also help to tackle the issues of Latvian security. As  Lamassoure said, an agreement is currently being prepared  between Latvia and France on cooperation in defense issues. The  agreement provides for training of Latvian military experts in  France. Both countries have already coordinated all the  political aspects of the agreement and it could be signed in the  near future.</p>

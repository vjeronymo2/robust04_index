Filippov] </F>   [Text] The Avenger surface-to-air missile [SAM] system was  developed by the American firm Boeing within the framework of  the FAADS program, which calls for creating advanced forward  area battlefield air defense systems.    The basic requirement imposed on such weapons is to ensure  reliability of covering first- and second-echelon ground forces  groupings against airstrikes. The Avenger SAM is designed to hit  air targets at ranges up to 5.5 km and altitudes up to 3500  meters. It can be fired from the halt and on the move. The  system is air-transportable: A C-130 can carry three SAM  systems, and a C-141 can carry six.    The SAM system includes: A launcher with eight Stinger SAM's  ready for firing; a 12.7-mm machinegun; optical and  infrared-imaging target detection and tracking devices; a laser  rangefinder; an IFF; a computer; control and indication  elements; and communications transceivers. All elements are  situated on a gyrostabilized platform, which is mounted on the  chassis of a multipurpose 1.25-ton M988 Hummer cross-country  vehicle.    The Stinger surface-to-air missile (launch weight of about  10  kg, length of 1.52 meters, and airframe diameter of 70 mm) has a  two-stage solid-propellant engine. The first stage is a  separating booster rocket that fires when the missile passes in  the launch canister.    The second stage of the Stinger SAM is made in the canard  aerodynamic configuration. The control surfaces and fins are  folded and unfold after the missile leaves the launch canister.    To avoid injury to the operator, the second stage engine  ignites when the SAM is approximately 9 meters from the  launcher. The missile's maximum flight speed is 700 m/s.  Guidance to the target is accomplished with the aid of an  infrared homing head. Presently, Stingers are equipped with POST  (Passive Optical Seeker Technique) homing heads that operate in  the infrared and ultraviolet bands. As is asserted in the  foreign press, this increases protection against natural  interference and also in conditions of the enemy using  countermeasures. The missile has a high-explosive warhead (1  kg). It is detonated by an impact fuze when the missile meets  the target or by a self-destruct signal, in the event it is  fired at a friendly aircraft or if it misses.    The operator's cab contains an optical sight, an  infrared-imaging device, and control, indication, and monitoring  elements. The FLIR (Forward Looking Infra-Red) thermal imaging  device ensures detection and tracking of targets at night and in  poor visibility.    The Hummer motor vehicle (4x4) has a top speed of 110 km/hr  and a range of 500 km. It is able to negotiate 31-degree  inclines and fords 0.76 meters deep. The most important  assemblies are protected by armor.    The U.S. Army began receiving the Avenger SAM systems in  1989. A total of about 1200 of these systems are to be purchased  for a total sum of $2.2 billion. In addition, Boeing is  conducting negotiations on delivering 40 units to the ground  forces of the Netherlands.    The results of field operation have shown that the Avenger  SAM system has insufficient effectiveness when firing against  low-flying and hovering helicopters, as well as against ground  targets, as a result of interference from ground objects  affecting the infrared guidance system of the Stinger missiles.

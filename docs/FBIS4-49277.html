			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [XINHUA "Feature": "Jericho Embraces Belated Happiness of </F> Autonomy With Low-Key Celebrations"]    [Text] Jerusalem, May 4 (XINHUA) -- "We are very happy  today that the agreement on Gaza-Jericho self-rule finally  comes, though it has been delayed for so long," said Mahmoud  Sutari, who works for PLO's press office branch in Jericho, an  ancient West Bank city.    Sutari is only one of over ten thousand Palestinian  residents  in West Bank town of Jericho who expressed their excitement over  the signing of the self-rule agreement by PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo.    Under the Israeli-PLO Peace Accord signed in Washington last  September, the Israeli troops withdrawal should have started on  December 13 last year and been completed by April 13. But both  deadlines were missed because of differences between the two  sides on some key issues.    There was no scene of large celebrations, largely due to the  delay of the agreement, but still people of all ages were  rushing to the narrow streets, laughing and chanting. Though  traffic jams occurred sometimes, no one complained as usual.    So far, a lot of Palestinian flags were already flying on  various buildings, reminding people that Jericho is now a place  of the Palestinians.    Two young Palestinians even climbed to the top of the iron  fences surrounding the Israeli police office in the town center  to erect the Palestinian flags. Though the Israeli police are  still in the building, they showed great restrictions and did  not take any action to stop the Palestinians.    "Today the world understands that after 27 years, we're  feeling much better, though the happiness is a little bit late,"  Sutari said. He is referring to the year 1967 when Israel used  only six hours to seize the West Bank of the Jordan River.    Helal al-Takrorg, 23, and Monir Tanboupi, 26, both  university  students from the biggest West Bank town Nablus, told XINHUA  that "they feel great" toward the upcoming autonomy.    There was no photo of 'Arafat in the town center, except a  few drawings of him on dirty walls. 'Arafat declared in April  that he would come to Jericho this month.    "I trust Mr. Arafat, trust everything he does very much,  because he is a hero of all Palestinians," said Takrorg.    When asked whether they believe 'Arafat would bring them  together to build a strong economy, both Takrorg and Tanboupi  gave a positive answer. "A strong economy will not come at  present, but maybe at future," Takrorg said.    Imad Bevahmeh, owner of a small shop, told XINHUA that he  "is  overwhelmed by today's signing." "I admire 'Arafat very much  because he will bring democracy and a new life to our people,"  he said.    But not all the Palestinians would like to render their  support to 'Arafat. A young Palestinian, who would only called  himself Mohamed, described 'Arafat as a "weak" man because he  conceded a lot to Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and because he  could not really bring together Hamas, Fatah and other  Palestinian parties.    The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, and PLO's mainstream  Fatah movement, under heavy pressure from the Israeli  Government, reached a cooperation accord after difficult  negotiations on April 22, to pave the way for today's signing of  the agreement.    Hamas promised to suspend attack on the Palestinians it  considers collaborating with Israel for one month after the  implementation of the self-rule agreement, but declared it would  continue to take violent actions against Israelis.    Mohamed continued to say that "the economy will be a pretty  hard task for 'Arafat" because in Jericho there is only  agriculture with industry next to zero.    Not all the faces we saw were joyous. The scene turned to be  full of anger when a middle-aged woman cried loudly in the face  of the Israeli police office building: "Why did you kill my son?  Was he guilty?" Her son, though not involved in violence, was  killed by Israeli police just two months ago.    Whether peace and harmony will really come between the  Israelis and the Palestinians remains a big question, because  opposition forces on both sides are still quite strong.    Sutari said, "we are not hitting Jews, we are just looking  for freedom of our own state. The problem (of possible  violence) does not come from the people, but from the political  sides."    When asked about their future, shop owner Bevahmeh said, "my  business will do better, because with autonomy we will have more  chances and opportunities. Life will get better, and more  customers will come to my shop."    "Now we are looking for a better life. There will be a new  government, our own leaders, and our own life," Sutari told  XINHUA.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETAIL SALES IN JULY RISE 0.1%; ANALYSTS FEAR SLUMP AHEAD  </P> <P> Retail sales rose a slight 0.1% during July, the Commerce Department said  Tuesday, a second straight monthly gain that analysts warn may be nipped in the  bud by rising energy costs.  </P> <P> The July gain, following a revised 1.1% June increase in total sales, normally  would be seen as an indication that consumers are spending enough to keep the  economy moving sluggishly higher.  </P> <P> But against the backdrop of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the picture was  viewed as more threatening. The June and July sales gains followed three  straight months of declines between March and May and flat sales in February.  Before June, the last significant monthly sales rise was a 2.8% increase in  January. The slight pickup during July brought total sales to a seasonally  adjusted $149.5 billion and was led by a 3.9% increase in sales of building  materials after a 3.2% June rise.  </P></p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / BA set to make more changes BRITISH AIRWAYS is expected to announce further changes in its management structure this week in the continuing aftermath of the Virgin Atlantic 'dirty tricks' affair. The airline yesterday said it had appointed Mr Peter Jones head of public relations following the departure last week of Mr David Burnside, whose settlement is estimated to have been up to Pounds 300,000. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's new executive chairman, confirmed in the airline's staff newspaper that there would be further changes to the airline's existing management team. Meanwhile, BA and Virgin are to hold more talks tomorrow to try to reach a compromise over Virgin's compensation demands for the commercial damage it claims to have suffered because of BA's actions.</p>

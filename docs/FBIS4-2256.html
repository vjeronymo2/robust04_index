			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Third of seven programs cosponsored by the State Economic </F> and Trade Commission and the State General Administration of  Taxation entitled "Answers to Questions Regarding Enterprises'  Implementation of the New Tax System: On the Question of  Computing and Deducting Value-Added Tax [VAT]" moderated by  Jiang Qiangui, director of the State Economic and Trade  Commission's Enterprise Department -- recorded]    [Text] [Video opens with a long shot of three women and  two men seated behind a long table in a room, then cuts to show  a medium-range shot of Chen Jie, deputy director of the State  General Administration of Taxation's Turnover Tax Department,  who answers questions raised by the moderator and other  participants, including Ma Jinyuan, chief accountant of Beijing  No. 1 Cotton Mill; Liu Jian, deputy director of Beijing Medical  Radiographic Equipment Plant; and Zheng Guangzhao, chief  accountant of Beijing Papermaking and Packaging Industrial  Corporation] [Jiang] Viewers and comrades, we are now  presenting the third lecture of the "Answers to Questions  Regarding Enterprises' Implementation of the New Tax System."  Today, we would like to discuss questions about computing and  deducting VAT. Deputy Director Chen, could you please first  tell us something about the computation of VAT, since many  people are still not very familiar with it?    [Chen] This is a very broad topic which is widely discussed  in the rules and regulations on VAT. Today, I can talk in  general terms about the principles for computing VAT. The VAT  regime divides taxpayers into two categories. The Ministry of  Finance has set a standard for producers as well as wholesale  and retail traders -- the level for enterprises that produce  taxable commodities is an annual sales volume over one million,  while the level for enterprises that are engaged in wholesale or  retail of taxable commodities is an annual sales volume over 1.8  million. Those who are above the standard level are ordinary  taxpayers. Those who are below the standard level and have an  inadequately developed method of accounting are small taxpayers.  Enterprises that are below the standard level but have  adequately developed methods of accounting are deemed ordinary  taxpayers. Some comrades equate small taxpayers with  enterprises below the standard level -- this is not a proper  interpretation. To be more accurate, we should put it this way:  enterprises and [words indistinct] that fail to reach the  aforementioned set standard level and have inadequately  developed methods of accounting are small taxpayers.  Enterprises that have an adequately developed method of  accounting are ordinary taxpayers, no matter whether they are  above the standard level or not. For ordinary taxpayers, the  principle for calculating payable VAT is equal to their sales  tax less their procurement tax; while the procurement tax is  calculated according to their sales income and a tax rate [three  formula are shown on screen successively: 1) tax to be paid =  sales tax during the period - procurement tax during the period;  2) sales volume = tax inclusive sales volume / (1 + tax rate);  3) sales tax = sales volume x tax rate].    [Jiang and Liu] How should enterprises deduct procurement  tax in the absence of special VAT invoices when doing business  with small taxpayers who could not use specialized VAT invoices?    [Chen] Enterprises in the aforementioned situation can seek  help from taxation organs. In other words, sellers can go to  taxation organs to ask them to issue invoices. The sales price  shown on an invoice does not include the payable tax; and a six  percent tax rate should be specified. [two formula are shown on  screen successively: 1) sales volume = tax inclusive sales  volume / (1 + tax rate), and 2) tax to be paid = sales volume x  tax rate] By so doing, we can alleviate this problem. To  strengthen management over the use of the special invoice, we  divide taxpayers into two categories. However, we cannot change  the rules on enterprises that have an inadequately developed  accounting calculation mechanism -- this is an international  practice. Although some people do not quite understand this  issue, in my opinion, this is justifiable to some extent. Small  enterprises' business operations are negatively impacted because  they could not use specialized VAT invoices. However, we have  two concerns: if small enterprises want to enjoy tax deduction  according to the formula -- sales tax minus the procurement tax,  they should bear [words distinct] responsibilities. In my  opinion, rights and responsibilities are a two-way street. If  you want to enjoy a certain rights, you should bear a certain  responsibilities. In other words, if you ask others to bear  responsibilities, you should authorize them some rights. If  small enterprises do not strengthen their methods of accounting  [words indistinct] but want to enjoy the same rights as ordinary  taxpayers, in my opinion, this is unjustifiable. Moreover, to  pay tax according to law is an obligation stipulated in the  Constitution. Our demand on small taxpayers in bearing their  responsibilities is not harsh. We only ask them to strengthen  their methods of accounting. In strengthening their methods of  accounting, enterprises, not the state, will be the first to  benefit. Another concern is that we do not have enough tax  personnel to administer small taxpayers, including individual  entities, if we allow them to use such special invoices. It  will sabotage our system, in which tax is deducted based on  invoices, if we allow them.       [Liu] How should enterprises deduct the procurement tax  if they purchase goods to be used in production from retail  shops that could not use special VAT invoices?    [Chen] Sometimes, factories and other enterprises need some  small quantity of goods to be used in production, and they are  unlikely to buy these goods from other factories but from retail  shops. If the retail shops are small taxpayers, they could not  use the special invoice. As a result, buyers cannot get a tax  dedcution. However, we have a real problem if the retail shops  are ordinary taxpayers and do not use the special VAT invoices.  This is somewhat related to the inadequate popularization of  the tax law. One article stipulated in the law says: such  special invoices could not be issued if commodities are sold to  consumers. However, retail shops do not always sell goods to  consumers only, they also sell goods to enterprises that will  utilize these goods in production. So do factories. Therefore,  no matter what they are -- factories, or wholesale or retail  enterprises, as long as they sell goods to consumers, such  special invoices should not be issued. In other words, no  matter what they are -- factories, or wholesale, or retail  enterprises, as long as they sell goods to enterprises --  nonconsumers, including individual entities -- such special  invoices should be issued. Recently, we have worked out a  supplementary regulation: if goods are sold to enterprises that  are ordinary taxpayers, such special invoices can be issued; and  if buyers are small taxpayers, only general invoices can be  issued. Therefore, when enterprises buy goods from retail  units, they need to identify their taxpayer classification.  Currently, there are some retail units that do not use such  special invoices. We plan to further address this issue and  publicize the tax system. In the meantime, we will work out  some punitive measures to deal with those that do not issue  invoices on purpose.    [Ma] Deputy Director Chen, how should enterprises deduct the  procurement tax when buying raw and semifinished materials  through the collection and acceptance method in the absence of  special VAT invoices?    [Chen] There may be two reasons that special VAT invoices  are not issued after goods are sold: one is that the seller is a  small taxpayer who does not use such special invoices -- this is  a situation created by our tax system; the other is that some  industrial enterprises do not issue such special invoices. As  far as I know, if two industrial enterprises have price  disputes, such special invoices may not be issued. The seller  usually sets conditions for issuing a special VAT invoice to the  buyer, such as asking the buyer to accept the price set by the  seller. However, as I said earlier, they should issue the  special invoice. Not to issue such speical invoices violates  regulations. We plan to notify taxation organs in various  localities to pay attention to such situations. We have made  concrete arragements and plan to conduct an across-the-board  inspection of the implementation of the new tax system at the  right time. Additionally, we will overcome some drawbacks in  regulating the use of the special VAT invoice. Also, with the  instituting of punishment measures, people who buy goods from  enterprises in other places without receiving invoices may  report to the local taxation organ which is obligated to help  them. In our opinion, if we can institute the system in which  the tax is deducted based on invoices, this will be beneficial  to the development of enterpirses. We plan to study ways to  further alleviate this problem.</p>

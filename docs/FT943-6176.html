			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / British bottle in the Mexican heat: Michael Cassell joins a temporary trade promoter trying to boost UK exports in testing conditions Mr David Cadwallader stepped out into the sunshine on Mexico City's Rio De La Plata and drew a deep breath. It might not have been wise, given air pollution verging on the edible, but it was understandable. The previous 90 minutes, in the office of Professor Hector Tello, president of the local British Chamber of Commerce, had been tough. Prof Tello had questioned the British government's commitment to help UK companies do business in Mexico and cited the impressive export efforts of competitors like Spain, France and Germany. It had not made easy listening for Mr Cadwallader, temporarily plucked from his job as a regional export manager with Boots, the UK retailing and pharmaceuticals group, to help the Department of Trade and Industry bat for Britain in Mexico. He had been amazed to discover that a chamber anxious to back the British effort was not aware the government had a strategy to boost exports to Mexico. Asked how this could be, Mr Christopher Jebb, second commercial secretary at the British Embassy, and Mr Cadwallader's 'minder' for the day, explained that it was 'probably confidential'. The exchange offered a small insight into the differences in approach between civil servants and salesmen as they seek to work together to win business. There is a cultural gap in experience and understanding which the DTI is now trying to bridge. Under a much-trumpeted initiative launched last year by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, 100 export promoters such as Mr Cadwallader are now on loan to the DTI from companies and trade bodies. Their salaries continue to be paid by their employers. Some recruits see the job as a useful career move, others as a final challenge before retirement, and a few have chosen secondment to ward off redundancy. Each armed with their experience and a Pounds 40,000-a-year travel and promotions budget, they comprise Mr Heseltine's private export army. Their mission, as they shuttle backwards and forwards to the UK, is to use their knowledge of world markets to sharpen up a government export promotion machine charged with narrowing the UK's visible trade deficit, which reached Pounds 1bn in May. All the export promoters, most on two-year secondments, pay regular calls to the eighth floor of Kingsgate House in London's Victoria, home to the DTI's export promotion operation - reorganised to try to improve its effectiveness. Mr Cadwallader says he is impressed by the quality and scale of the DTI's market information but says the department has not used it to best advantage. Eighty countries have been targetted as priority markets and each is supported by teams of DTI desk officers who have been relieved of their trade policy responsibilities to concentrate on export promotion. Mr Heseltine's troopers have notched up hundreds of thousands of miles in search of market opportunities, returning to alert more than 8,000 UK companies. At 53, David Cadwallader has 30 years of marketing and sales behind him and is one of eight export promoters for Latin America. He has sole responsibility for Mexico, where the UK - at the turn of the century Mexico's biggest trading partner - now accounts for only about one per cent of imports. In the first six months of 1994, UK exports to Mexico reached Pounds 186m, leaving a surplus of Pounds 80m. UK corporate investors rank second only to the US. According to Mr Cadwallader: 'There is a film industry image of Mexico as unstable, bandit-country beset by high inflation and poverty. The reality is 7 per cent inflation, growing consumerism and massive infrastructure and privatisation programmes.' He does not suggest everything is rosy. Nervousness among foreign investors ahead of the recent presidential election highlighted the continuing caution of many businessmen. 'In Mexico, there are bureaucratic barriers and ever-changing government regulations. But Britain and British goods are liked, and there are opportunities to sell everything from fine china to prefabricated housing.' At home, he is driving 20,000 miles a year by car to ensure companies know it. On his first, nine-day visit to Mexico - he plans up to six a year - Mr Cadwallader notched up 50 meetings with government and state bodies. At the start of this, his second visit, he has already given radio, television and newspaper interviews before embarking on a packed programme largely designed to explore the market for consumer goods. His day begins over breakfast at the Restaurant Continental with import agent Laura Turrell. She is particularly excited about the imminent arrival from the UK of Worcester Bear, whose exploits in search of honey are depicted on a new range of china ware to be sold in the smart boutiques of Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara. Lunch follows at the Ile de France with executives from Mexico's Liverpool department store chain, which owes its name to the British port which prospered in the golden years of UK-Mexico trade. The store would run a British Week but there are not enough products. 'We think UK goods are too expensive and you think we have no money,' suggests Enrique Chabre, a director. The day also includes a series of meetings with other importers, local lawyers and executives from UK companies established in the country. Over evening drinks, Mr Cadwallader chats to two young brothers who handle fancy English chocolates and want more items to satisfy the Mexican sweet tooth. An early flight to Monterrey the next day takes him to a round of talks with businessmen and state government officials on infrastructure projects. Back in Mexico City, Mr Cadwallader sees Mr David Waugh, who heads Trafalgar House operations locally and is after a Dollars 200m water distribution project in Guadalajara. He might have to see off the French and to do that, he says, the company will need plenty of political support. Mr Cadwallader offers all the assistance he can but it will be limited. Despite demands from Mr Michael Portillo, former chief secretary to the Treasury, that the DTI's expenditure on some export assistance be trimmed further, the budget is small. This year, the DTI has Pounds 57m to spend on improving UK trade overseas, Pounds 5m of which is set aside for Mr Heseltine's team of export promoters. At a planning meeting at the British Embassy, Mr David Berg, deputy head of mission, acknowledges 'money is very tight'. Six trade missions to Mexico are planned for 1995 but there will not be enough DTI cash to help them all. It is an unequal battle against big-spending competitors such as the Germans. 'There is no question those engaged in commercial promotion feel as though they have one hand tied behind their back', says Sir Roger Hervey, the retiring British ambassador to Mexico, whose embassy spends 60 per cent of its time promoting UK business interests. Mr Cadwallader thinks he is lucky working with a commercially-oriented embassy but he still harbours thoughts to send shivers down the back of many a career diplomat. In his five minutes with Mr Heseltine he was bold enough to suggest the Mexican embassy should be converted into a showcase for Britain filled with commercial staff. The secretary of state expressed regret that embassies were the responsibility of the Foreign Office. Mr Heseltine says deals are now being done as a direct result of his promoter's efforts and he may enlist more. Not all the promoters, however, have proved particularly energetic and future recruitment might be more selective. Some DTI export promotion staff still resent 'outsiders' on their patch, though much of the original scepticism has disappeared. Mr Cadwallader thinks his job in a country of 87m people might have to be more focused to be effective and is still waiting for confirmation of the first export deal to arise directly from his efforts. He says he is looking forward to cracking open a bottle of champagne, though he accepts it is one product in which the UK simply cannot compete.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Deutsche Bank to merge businesses DEUTSCHE Bank is to amalgamate its futures and options broking businesses in London as part of a move to build its small market share of derivatives trading. The bank said yesterday it was merging activities undertaken in Deutsche Bank's name in London with those of Morgan Grenfell, its merchant banking subsidiary. The merger affects only exchange-traded instruments, not over-the-counter ones. Each part of the group currently maintains around 12 people on the floor of the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange. Deutsche Bank has specialised in D-Mark products and Morgan Grenfell in sterling, though moves into other currencies have created overlaps between the two sides. The merger was intended to improve economies of scale, said Mr John Lake, a managing director of Deutsche Bank in London.</p>

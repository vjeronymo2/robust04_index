			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Santos acquires AGL oil assets SANTOS, the Australian energy group, yesterday consolidated its leadership of the domestic onshore energy industry by acquiring most of the upstream oil and gas assets of Australian Gas Light (AGL) for ADollars 177.5m (USDollars 126.7m). The deal was well received by the financial markets. Santos shares closed 12 cents higher on the Australian Stock Exchange at ADollars 2.78. AGL also closed 12 cents higher at ADollars 2.84. However, analysts said the deal could reduce Santos' prospects of winning court approval for a renewed takeover offer for Sagasco Holdings, the South Australian oil and gas group. Santos was forced to drop a ADollars 560m bid for Sagasco in November after the Trade Practices Commission (TPC), the federal competition watchdog, ruled it would give the group an effective monopoly over onshore gas reserves. Santos, which bought 19.9 per cent of Sagasco shortly after abandoning the bid, has indicated the offer may be revived if the federal court rules against the TPC in a hearing expected to take place in April. 'Our advice is that the takeover bid did not breach (the Trade Practices Act) so (the AGL acquisition) does not really change that situation,' said Mr John McArdle, commercial general manager of Santos. The deal will significantly increase Santos' presence in Queensland, where it will acquire the Moonie oilfield, the Moonie-Brisbane pipeline, majority ownership of the Jackson-Moonie pipeline, 50 per cent of the Denison Trough gas project and 83 per cent of the Roma gas fields. Mr Len Bleasel, AGL managing director, said the sale price was ADollars 7.8m above the book value of the assets. 'We will be using the money mainly to retire debt and strengthen our gearing ratios with an eye to expand downstream gas operations,' he said.</p>

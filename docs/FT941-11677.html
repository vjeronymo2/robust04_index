			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sex, humour and the 'me within' - Advertisers who wish to appeal to women should take heed of a new survey Women like sex and have a sense of humour; they no longer think of themselves as the 'typical housewife'. A few hours watching UK television commercials, however, might encourage viewers to conclude otherwise. The glum succession of women obsessed with the spotlessness of their floors and weekly wash, and who crave the advice of male scientists in white coats, contrasts sharply with the humour and inventiveness of, for example, some of the beer advertising aimed principally at men. Given that most TV commercials are for brands purchased by women, surprisingly little is known about what kind of advertising appeals to them and why, according to advertising agency Ogilvy and Mather. The agency says commercials aimed at women are often boring and badly made, are rarely of the calibre that win awards for creativity, and 'fail to get under the skin' of their intended audience. In an attempt to improve standards, O&amp;M's planning department in London, which provides the research that underpins the agency's creative work, has conducted a study among women of a variety of ages and social backgrounds. The suggestion that women like more sex and humour than advertisers have hitherto been prepared to believe, and are unlikely these days to think of themselves as housewives, are among the study's main conclusions. Over the next few weeks, the findings will be presented internally, and to the agency's main clients, which include Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer group; Ford, the car maker; health insurance group Bupa; and American Express, the credit card group. Detailed studies were made of 12 groups of women. The women filled in diaries for a week, noting the advertisements they had watched and their reactions to them. Then they met to discuss how they saw themselves, their lives, what was important to them, and their views on brands and advertising. They also discussed a number of commercials. From the results, the 'onion theory' was developed, explains Beth Barry, planning director. Women of different ages and at different stages in their lives have more in common than many marketers believe, she says. 'As a woman progresses through lifestages, she accumulates knowledge, responses, behaviour, like the layers of an onion. Moving to a new lifestage doesn't mean discarding the experiences and memories of previous lifestages,' she adds. A woman's sense of identity - the 'me within', as the study refers to it - may be largely submerged or more evident at different stages, but is always there and ready to be accessed or released by advertising. The 'me', found O&amp;M, is very strong among single women and those who have partners but no children; by the time motherhood sets in women are most likely to describe themselves in terms of roles, such as mum or housekeeper, and the 'me' becomes submerged. A return to work is, for many women, a re-emergence of 'me', as is divorce in some cases. As children leave home, the rediscovery of 'me' will mean that, from an advertiser's point of view, older women have more in common with young singles than traditional market segmentation normally allows for. And what exactly is this inner 'me' which women carry with them through their lifestages? Its nature and complexity may surprise some marketers. For example, one 45-year-old who would be viewed conventionally as the 'classic housewife', described herself thus: 'Sexy me; successful me; childish me; homely me; independent me; the lover in me; maternal me; nostalgic me.' Many of the women with small children, for whom the 'me' was most suppressed, expressed a desire to be 'wicked' or 'fiery', and most wanted to be rich and admired. The O&amp;M planners conclude that advertisers must understand that women cannot be defined by their role or lifestage - the key to successful advertising is accessing the many aspects of 'me'. Waiting to be tapped are: The wild woman - outrageous, rebellious, sexy. The wicked woman - manipulative, teasing. The free woman - independent, happy, in control. The woman on top - one upmanship, subverting expectations. The funny woman - witty and amusing. The return to childhood - fun, naughty. The strong woman - coping, juggling, smiling. The intelligent, creative woman - imaginative, talented. The pampered woman - romantic, indulging, relaxed. The voyeur - enjoying men's bodies. Examples of the commercials which most appealed to women included a Nescafe advertisement for cappuccino, which showed a group of young men setting up a coffee bar on the beach to attract some passing young women - this appealed to the romantic and nostalgic 'me' in all ages. A Kenco advertisement for instant coffee, which has a coffee grower mistakenly assuming that the man, rather than the woman, is the boss, appealed to the 'woman on top'. The Gossard underwear 'lock up your sons' advertisements appealed to the 'wild woman'. Often the more overtly sexual commercials - for instance, some of the most recent for Cadbury's Flake - were considered slightly embarrassing and were liked less than those which aligned sensuality with beauty and stillness. Predictably, advertisements for household cleaning products were among the most irritating to women: the Daz washing powder commercials featuring doorstep interviews were seen as patronising, dull and too ready to categorise women as 'housewives'. But, overall, the advertisements that women liked least, says O&amp;M researcher Sarah Newman, were simply poorly made, boring and 'like wallpaper'.</p>

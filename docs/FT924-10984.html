			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Management: Learning how to learn from allies Western companies which have joint ventures or other 'strategic alliances' with Japanese partners are notoriously bad at extracting knowledge and skills from their allies - on technology, marketing, strategy, organisation or anything else. Not only are the Japanese much better at learning in the other direction, they are also more adept at building barriers against unwanted learning by the other side. Motorola, the American electronics group, and a few other western companies, have overcome this two-way deficiency by improving their learning skills, or 'learning how to learn'. But a constant flow of research shows that most of the learning from western-Japanese alliances is still one-way. There continues to be a crying need both for better confidential advice to companies about how to handle particular alliances, and for a general guide to learning in such situations. Precisely such a document has now been compiled, by a helpfully cross-cultural team: a German management consultant, Heidi Amponsem of Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton's Dusseldorf office, and a Canadian academic, David Rutenberg of Queen's University in Ontario. They unveiled it at the annual conference of the International Strategic Management Society. Their guide comes in a rather curious form, but it offers all sorts of sensible insights and suggestions, ranging from annual reviews of the adequacy of communication from the alliance to its parent company, to the need for better job rotation policies for people on secondment from the parent to the alliance. Under the deceptively prosaic title of 'process guide to accelerate an organisation's learning'*, the document covers several kinds of learning: not just from formal alliances, but also from informal collaboration, as well as from 'reverse engineering' - the dismantling and analysis of other companies' products. On informal learning, the guide suggests that the organisation should perceive customers, suppliers and other outside organisations as important sources for learning. It should systematise this learning through regular meetings of the managers and other employees involved in such contacts. The guide, which doubles as an academic research document, is in the form of a series of self-assessment sheets, covering what the authors call five stages of learning: 'sensitisation' of the organisation and its employees to basic learning processes, and even to the need to learn (which, surprisingly, is not always obvious to everyone); information acquisition; synthesis of learning between individuals; transfer and storage of it; and implementation and evaluation of learning. Each sheet contains a set of positive statements, to which readers are invited to indicate whether their company always, sometimes, or never does what is stated. Under 'sensitisation' for formal strategic alliances, Amponsem and Rutenberg's statements include 'employees are specifically selected and trained for the alliance', and 'employees away at a strategic alliance realise that after they have learned as individuals they still have to transfer their insight to their home company'. Under information acquisition, the guide suggests that 'the persistence and endurance needed to achieve learning goals is realistically understood'. Also 'employees away at a strategic alliance understand which information must remain proprietary'. Under synthesis of information from the alliance, the guide not only suggests regular meetings of all employees involved in each alliance, but also of one representative per alliance, in order to pool corporate insight into how to learn from alliances in general. Also, the parent should revise constantly its beliefs, values and guidelines for operating alliances. Under transfer and storage, they suggest regular internal 'benchmarking' reports which compare the parent's operations with those of each strategic alliance. Under implementation and evaluation, there should be an annual assessment of how corporate practice has been improved due to each alliance. And there should be an annual analysis of the costs and benefits of the alliance, plus a projection into the future. * Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, Dusseldorf. Fax 49-211-371002.</p>

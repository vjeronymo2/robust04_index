			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT LEAST 14 U.S. OIL WORKERS CAPTURED  </P> <P> Charles Amos was supposed to call home to Harmony, Tex., Thursday night. But  the call never came. Instead, the 59-year-old oil-drilling supervisor working  on a rig in the northern Kuwaiti desert was swept up by invading Iraqi troops  as they poured across the Iraq border that morning.  </P> <P> Two days after the blitz, which has left Kuwait under Iraqi military  occupation, Amos remains one of approximately 3,800 Americans in the country  whose fate remains largely unknown.  </P> <P> Oil companies who employed some of the Americans are scrambling to locate them,  and the State Department is pressing the Baghdad government for information, so  far unsuccessfully. Officials said they understand that at least 14 American  oil workers, including Amos, were captured by troops during the surge toward  Kuwait city.  </P> <P> "We don't really know who they are or what their condition is or where they are  located," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> State Department officials said that the Iraqi government had assured them only  that they would "safeguard the safety and welfare of American citizens in  Kuwait."  </P> <P> So far, said department spokesman Richard Boucher, there have been "no reports  of injuries or deaths to Americans."  </P> <P> Boucher added, "We cannot confirm that the missing Americans are in Iraqi  control" but added, "We believe they are in Iraqi hands, and we want to get  them back."  </P> <P> Six of the Americans, including Amos, are employees of Santa Fe International  Corp. of Alhambra, Calif., a drilling company owned by the Kuwaiti national  petroleum company, Kuwait Oil. One Canadian and one British employee of the  company are also missing.  </P> <P> "We are getting some information from the drilling company and some from the  U.S. State Department," said Amos' son David, who said no definitive word on  his father has come yet. The elder Amos had been expected to head home to  attend a family reunion this weekend.  </P> <P> Marjorie Walterscheid, whose husband, Rainard, worked for Santa Fe's Rig No. 6  near the Iraqi border, said the company called her home in Jacksboro, Tex.,  Thursday afternoon to tell her that her husband was also apparently captured by  the invaders.  </P> <P> "They said he was on the phone with them when the soldiers got there,"  Walterscheid said. "He told them, 'I have to go now. The soldiers are here.' "  </P> <P> She said that when the company called back later, an Arab who answered the  phone said that the soldiers had rounded up her husband and seven others and  "taken them north."  </P> <P> Walterscheid said she has been in frequent contact with the drilling company  and the State Department but "they say they don't know much."  </P> <P> Dresser Industries of Dallas reported that three of its employees in Kuwait  were missing. "We were in touch with our people three times yesterday, but then  we lost contact," said spokesman Herb Ryan.  </P> <P> Phone lines to Kuwait have been jammed since the invasion began, compounding  fear and confusion among employers and family members.  </P> <P> "We haven't been able to get back through to (to our employees) nor they to us  since yesterday morning," said Doug E. Oliver, a spokesman for Lockheed  Aeronautical Systems Co. in Marietta, Ga. Three of his company's workers are  believed to be in a Kuwaiti hotel.  </P> <P> Some companies reported that they had managed to get their employees to safer  locations. Texaco spokesman Anita Larson said the oil company, which operates a  pumping and refining installation in the neutral zone between the Kuwaiti and  Iraqi borders, evacuated about 800 American and non-American employees from the  war zone.  </P> <P> "Everyone has been accounted for, and everyone is safe," she said.  </P> <P> Times researcher Edith Stanley in Atlanta and special correspondent Bill  Thompson in Gilmer, Tex., contributed to this story.  </P></p>

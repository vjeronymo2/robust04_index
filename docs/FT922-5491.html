			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Finance and the Family: Professionals who lose it all - Bankruptcy PITY professionals in debt. Not only are they in danger of losing their homes and property, they also run a grave risk of having their careers ruined by expulsion from their professional bodies. Insolvency can spell the end of a career as an MP, chartered surveyor, company director or even black cab driver. But for accountants and solicitors, bankruptcy in particular is the stuff of nightmares. It means automatic departure from chartered or certified accountancy and strips lawyers of their practicising certificates. 'The recession has bitten very hard into the professions, with property purchases often causing trouble,' says Tony Supperstone, an insolvency practitioner at Stoy Hayward. He has been advising small firms of accountants and solicitors with around five partners, all of whose careers are on the line if a creditor makes them bankrupt. Many of these firms bought their premises at the top of the market and have since been squeezed by the twin jaws of the recessionary vise: rising interest payments and falling fees. Creditors know that bankruptcy is the ultimate sanction and go as far as petitioning for it. Then, says Supperstone, there is around six weeks to set up a voluntary arrangement before a bankruptcy order is made. Such voluntary arrangements require the agreement of creditors owed at least three-quarters of the debt and negotiations can involve considerable brinkmanship, as bankruptcy is in neither side's interest. But if one large creditor stands out for full repayment, bankruptcy cannot be avoided. So far this year, 26 chartered accountants have lost membership compared with 30 in all of 1991. Even a voluntary arrangement will not necessarily ensure that the individual retains membership of the professional body. The Institute of Chartered Accountants regards such arrangements as a disciplinary matter, and the Law Society takes them into account before renewing a practising certificate. These attitudes are, however, tender-hearted compared with the rulebook of the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA). Bylaw 25 expels automatically a partner who enters into an arrangement with his creditors, even though they want him to stay in work so that he can pay off his debts. 'This is a bylaw we have inherited,' says Anthony Booth, of the ACCA, 'The harshness of this rule is something we will look at.' Voluntary arrangements can also be the undoing of chartered surveyors and company directors. 'The traditional approach has been to treat insolvency as a hanging offence,' says David Millar, of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. 'One reason for this is that those who extend credit to professionals are happier to do so if the big chopper is awaiting those who don't meet their debts.' But the RICS does not expel members automatically even if made bankrupt. Millar says the fate of the 20 insolvent chartered surveyors now being considered by the institution will depend on 'the size of the unmet debt, whether the debt is to people who can stand the loss, and what the chartered surveyor is doing to try to make the best of a bad job.' Company directors cannot plead such mitigation. While it is well known that bankruptcy bars them from holding office without the special permission of a court, what is less publicised is that most companies' articles of association also exclude a director if he makes 'any arrangement or composition with his creditors.' To some extent, the public expects harsh treatment for professionals who prove unable to manage their own affairs. The professional bodies, therefore, need to see their members stay respectable in the eyes of their clients. They are also concerned that insolvent members may yield to the temptation of 'borrowing' from clients' funds. If they do this, though, their exclusion will probably be life-long. 'It's extremely difficult to imagine re-admitting anyone who has been expelled for mortgage fraud or embezzlement. They could apply until they're blue in the face,' says Millar. Those whose downfall was not due to a lack of virtue receive more charity, albeit with strings attached. The 21 bankrupt solicitors now in the queue for replacement practising certificates are unlikely to be allowed to operate as sole practitioners but will have to operate within approved partnerships. Those who fail to regain their practising certificates might want to contemplate re-training as barristers or architects. Neither profession expels bankrupts.</p>

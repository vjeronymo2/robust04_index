			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vitaliy Chukseyev] </F>   [Text] Washington June 24 TASS -- One can say that the  talks have been a success, Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin said on Thursday at the close of the session of  the Chernomyrin-Gore commission and the Washington part of the  visit. A total of 26 agreements envisaging the development of  Russian-U.S. cooperation in various fields have been signed, he  said.    "While in Washington, we signed agremeents, which are in  point of fact, contracts which will help support our branches of  industry which have found themselves in a hard position. It is  primarily a question of space research and space-related  sectors," Chernomyrdin told ITAR-TASS.    "Just as the Sakhalin-2 agreement, they mean the creation of  a lot of job opportunities and provide a way out in the field of  financing. Behind these, I perceive the social aspect, i.e. we  shall not let in agreements which will not provide a solution to  social issues. Take the agreement on ecology and the power  industry -- behind them, I see the social welfare aspect as  well," he said.    Touching upon his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton  in the White House on Thursday, Chernomyrdin emphasised that the  best, most positive evaluation of relations between the two  countries had been made during the conversation.    Asked about an extent to which the forthcoming  Yeltsin-Clinton meeting in September was discussed during  Chernomyrdin's stay in Washington, the Russian prime minister  said the matters were examined but a number of them can be  decided upon only at the presidential level, not governmental  one. Besides, it is necessary to see how the agreements signed  will be implemented and developed, Chernomyrdin said.</p>

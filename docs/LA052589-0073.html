			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 INDICTED ON BRIBERY COUNTS  </P> <P> Two Orange County men were indicted Wednesday on federal charges of taking more  than $7,600 in bribes from the operator of a security business while they were  deputy marshals in the federal courthouse in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Joseph Gieniec, 43, of Santa Ana, who transferred out of the U.S. Marshals  Service in 1986, and Gordon Tornberg, 59, of Tustin, who continues to work for  that office, were accused of accepting gratuities in 1984 from Joseph  Rydzewski, who owned a Santa Ana company that supplied security guard services  to the marshals.  </P> <P> Rydzewski, 33, of Santa Ana, was charged with paying illegal gratuities to  Gieniec in 1984, and to Eugene Howell, who was a deputy marshal in 1986. Howell  was not indicted.  </P> <P> The federal grand jury indictment does not detail what the defendants did in  exchange for the bribes, except to say that the payments, most of them by  check, were made "because of official acts performed or to be performed."  </P> <P> The indictment said Tornberg supervised seizures of property sought by the U.S.  attorney's office. Gieniec often used personnel from Rydzewski's company, Lyons  International Security, in those seizures and Tornberg reviewed and approved  Lyons' billings, the indictment said.  </P></p>

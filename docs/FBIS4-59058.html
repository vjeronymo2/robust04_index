			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Prince Sultan Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, second deputy  prime minister and minister of defense and aviation, during a  meeting with Arab ambassadors in Rome who had come to bid him  farewell when he left Rome yesterday, and responding to their  wish to know his highness' views on what is happening in Yemen,  said:    We have learned from King 'Abd-al-'Aziz and his sons who  succeeded him, may God bless them and have mercy on them, to put  our responsibilities and duties toward our people and toward our  Islamic and Arab nation before our personal comfort.    I had been intending to spend some time here, resting, and  undergoing some routine medical examinations, but the start of  fighting in the brotherly Yemen, and due to what I have been  watching and hearing from the media channels, my heart bleeds  with sorrow and sadness because of my acquaintance with the  Yemeni leadership, people, and clans, and because of old  friendship bonds.    I personally served Yemen and worked for its' development  and  encouraged its' leaderships, morally and financially, to advance  the Yemeni people.    In front of this painful event that is sweeping Yemen, my  personal comfort has diminished and I have decided to return to  my headquarters to be at the disposal of the custodian of the  two holy mosques and his crown prince, who are in constant and  serious contact with their brethren kings, princes, and  presidents of Arab countries in order to save Yemen from this  painful fate, from the abyss it is sliding into. In particular,  the Yemeni people, who have worked to build this unity between  the two parts, which was blessed by Saudi Arabia when it was  established with a positive spirit and in anticipation of a  better future.    When disputes surfaced we were not surprised because  brothers  and friends disagree. But when the language of dialogue stops  between brothers and the brothers resort to bloodshed, killing,  wasting energies, and destroying the achievements -- which the  Yemeni people attained with great difficulties -- to settle  their differences, it then becomes a matter that brings sadness  for every Arab and Muslim and bleeds the hearts that love Yemen,  the country that we all love and appreciate.    I beseech God from the bottom of my heart to enlighten the  brothers in Yemen to solve their differences by resorting to  reason, logic, and dialogue aimed at serving Yemen's interests  and sons. [passage omitted]    He said Yemen had high hopes in the Kingdom under the  leadership of King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, as well as in Egypt  under the leadership of President Husni Mubarak and all Arab  leaders to find an urgent solution to stop the bloodshed and  restore purity to Yemen.</p>

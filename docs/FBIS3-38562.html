			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "State's Witnesses Speak of Upcoming </F> Attacks"]    [Text] Rome, 3 Feb (ANSA) -- Security measures for the  protection of "the most exposed" Italian authorities have been  ordered by Interior Minister Nicola Mancino against the backdrop  of recent disclosures made by state's witnesses which signal the  prospect of "further attacks against men and institutions," the  minister reported today.    Discussing the ambush and killing of two Carabinieri  policemen in the southern Calabria region on January 18 and a  similar attack Tuesday [1 February], Mancino told the Lower  House Constitutional Affairs Committee of "an attempt at a  terrorist-type response from organized crime."    There is, on the side of the 'Ndrangheta organized crime  families in Calabria and abroad "a worrying terrorist escalation  which is aimed at re-accrediting the authority of the clans,  de-legitimizing the actions of the state," he added. Mancino  told the hearing that the armed assault of two Carabinieri  policemen in Calabria on Tuesday, which left the two men in  critical condition, may have been carried out by the same team  of hit-men which struck on January 18 on the Salerno-Reggio  Calabria express highway.    The minister went on to cover much the same ground in  discussing the 'Ndrangheta before the Parliamentary Anti-Mafia  Commission earlier when he provided data on the estimated  strength and organization of the crime clans operating on the  southern mainland.    Today, he said, "Witnessed under the profile of organization  is a process of the modernization of the traditional horizontal  structures" to bring them under a collective leadership body  thought to pursue "an idea of the management of criminal power  characterized by unity, greater professionalism and greater  enterprise." Also underscored by the ministers was that,  "Relations between organized crime and the political and  administrative components have kept pace with the phases of the  evolution of crime in Calabria."    The specific attacks on the Carabinieri policemen fits, he  said, "into the framework of the 'Ndrangheta's leap of quality.  The clans, seeing the threat to their own territorial roots in  the increasingly stringent offensive of the start, react in an  indiscriminate and symbolic way to the law enforcement services."    The commitment of the government to the battle against these  clans, he said, is "firm and irrevocable" but, he warned, "the  efforts of the police and the judiciary will not be enough if  the political and administrative class does not plan and launch  initiatives aimed at reviving Calabria on the social and  economic fronts as well."    Still on the issue of the stepped-up battle, Mancino also  outlined the dispatch of Army troops to the region before moving  on to the anti-Mafia Golden Market sweep wrapped up yesterday by  the Palermo judiciary and the National Anti-Mafia Directorate  (DIA). Netted were three Palermo criminal lawyers, four doctors  and two savings bank officials among the 76 persons named in  arrest warrants plus the alleged members of what investigators  said was the "most important hit team of recent years."</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Dismal year for Japan's carmakers - Automotive Last spring, as Japan's carmakers looked ahead to prospects for the year, the consensus was that at best they might hope for some relief from the downturn in the Japanese economy. A year later, even that cautious assessment appears sanguine, as one carmaker after another has announced dismal results for the year to last March. Nissan, Japan's second-largest carmaker, yesterday became the latest in the industry to report a substantial deterioration in its annual performance. The results come amid persistent weakness in the domestic market and a 14 per cent rise in the yen's value against the dollar. Nissan, which reported a consolidated net loss of Y86.9bn (Dollars 832m), compared with Y55.9bn a year ago, was joined in its plight by Mazda and Mitsubishi Motor. Both Mazda and Mitsubishi last week reported sharp falls in sales. Mazda saw its first loss in 19 years and has been forced to pass its dividend for the first time since it was listed. Mitsubishi had previously enjoyed buoyant sales on the strength of the popularity in Japan of its range of sports utility and multipurpose vehicles. However, the company experienced a setback last year as competition in those sectors increased. Fuji Heavy, which produces Subaru cars, likewise fell into loss and passed its dividend. However, Daihatsu, which specialises in small cars and commercial vehicles, returned to the black largely as a result of cost-cutting. The carmakers' difficulties last year are largely attributed to two factors which have plagued the industry recently: weak markets in Japan and Europe, and the appreciation of the yen. The poor state of the Japanese market is reflected in figures published by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association. The Japanese car market suffered a fall in demand in the fiscal year to March 1994 - its third consecutive annual decline. According to JAMA, domestic demand fell by 7 per cent to 6.4m units, while vehicle production in Japan also dropped for the third consecutive year by 12 per cent to 10.8m units - the largest annual fall since 1949. The situation was hardly much better outside Japan. Exports for the year are estimated to have fallen by 18 per cent, although part of this reflects a greater shift of production overseas. These adverse market trends have been particularly damaging for Nissan and Mazda, which have accumulated significant losses and face an uphill battle to recovery. Both companies made ambitious investments at home as the domestic market went into reverse. Nissan built a state-of-the-art factory in southern Japan and aggressively expanded its model range. Mr Andrew Blair-Smith, industry analyst at BZW, says that while Nissan has a wide model range, it has not had the productivity levels of Toyota. Although it is difficult to estimate capacity utilisation from available figures, Mr Blair-Smith believes Nissan's rate is 64 per cent, compared with 82 per cent for Toyota. Meanwhile, Mazda also opened a new factory in 1992 and built up a network of five distribution channels. Mazda is operating at an average capacity utilisation ratio of 80 per cent, compared with 120 per cent at the peak of the boom years, the company said. Nissan and Mazda have also been particularly hard hit by the slump in European markets. Nissan experienced a 30 per cent drop in unit export sales, which it attributed to sluggish demand in Europe. The fall in demand in Spain, together with the sharp depreciation of the peseta against the yen, has meant that losses at its Spanish subsidiary, Nissan Motor Iberica, and the restructuring programme there, have been significant factors behind Nissan's consolidated losses. Mazda, meanwhile, has seen shipments to overseas markets slump by 23 per cent. The carmakers are stepping up their cost-cutting measures through greater use of common car parts, a reduction of car models and labour cuts. For example, Mazda will not take on any new workers next spring, a sharp reversal from its peak years when it took on 3,000 employees. Capital spending is being reduced to Y50bn compared with Y54bn last year. It is possible that these efforts, supported by a mild recovery in the Japanese car market this year, will enable the beleaguered carmakers to achieve a modest improvement in performance without taking restructuring much further than planned. But if the Japanese market fails to take off strongly, significant improvements in profits may call for another round of aggressive cost-cutting that might include further reductions in capacity.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  FINANCIAL RESULTS, YEAR TO MARCH (Y BN)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Consoli-                     Parent  Parent  Parent   dated  Consolid.

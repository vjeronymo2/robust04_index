			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: A crusade into Medieval law - Review of pension fund regulation welcomed THE pensions industry, thriving under a loose patchwork of laws and practices, faces a radical overhaul after yesterday's announcement of a wide-ranging government review. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said that an independent commission, headed by Professor Roy Goode QC of Oxford University, would study the framework of pensions legislation and make recommendations within 12 months. The National Association of Pension Funds, the trade association that has offered cautious endorsement of some elements of pension fund reform, said it welcomed the commission. The review is to follow closely a report from the cross-party Commons select committee on social security, issued in early March, which recommended sweeping changes to the trust law that has been the basis of pension fund operation since the 1920s. The committee had concluded that trust law, designed in the Middle Ages to protect the estates of knights on crusade, may be inadequate in that it does not take into account that the interests of trustees may be at odds with those of beneficiaries. It also urged requirements for scheme members to be widely represented on pension boards and a number of custodial practices designed to frustrate the designs of larcenous pension fund managers hoping to secure scheme assets for their own benefit. Most significantly, Mr Lilley has specifically ordered that the commission is to study what is acknowledged to be the thorniest issue facing the industry: the ownership of assets. Many employers have seized upon the existence of surpluses in recent years as an opportunity to take a 'contributions holiday', cutting their annual expenses significantly by allowing high investment returns built up in prior years to cover employer contributions for the future. Depending on the wording of trust deeds, employers may legally withdraw huge sums from their own pension schemes without sharing those benefits with employees. Indeed, it emerged during the select committee hearings that Robert Maxwell was able to strip more out of the pension fund surpluses of companies he acquired than he paid for them in the first place. Pensions industry professionals say pension-fund reform cannot be considered separately from ownership of assets. Thus far, there is no statutory answer to the question, they say, but judgments about the best way to require the administration of schemes is clearly dependent upon whom one believes they belong to. Meanwhile, it is expected that the new commission will have to address the question of a compensation scheme for pensioners who may be affected by future fund collapses. While Mr Lilley did not single out the construction of a compensation scheme as part of the commission's remit, the select committee specifically urged that one be studied. Already the proposal is causing controversy within the industry, partly because large, well run schemes have balked at the idea of paying to bail out weaker ones. Mr Tom Ross, partner at actuaries Clay and Partners and chairman of an NAPF subcommittee studying a compensation scheme, said that the experience of the US and other foreign pension-fund safety nets in other countries showed that no scheme would work unless its participants were required to reduce their own risks. 'My own view is that if a pension scheme compensation fund were set up, you cannot give people a blank cheque,' he said. However, it was precisely those schemes which were most reluctant to adopt certain minimum standards that were most likely to need a scheme, he added. 'My own view is that no scheme will work unless it is compulsory. 'But none of these issues - compensation, ownership of assets, safety of funds - can be considered on its own. They are all connected and must be considered together.' Industry professionals note that every other aspect of investment - life insurance, bank and building society deposits, unit trusts and other retail financial investments - are covered by a compensation scheme of some sort. Pension-fund experts say that the construction of a compensation scheme might well require amendments to trust law because trustees are required to use assets solely for the benefit of members. Thus schemes would have to argue that the construction of a scheme was in members' best interests before they could be allowed to contribute to it. Industry sources say that some months ago, the Department of Social Security broached the question of compensation for the Maxwell company pensioners with the industry and sought legal advice on the matter. The DSS dropped the matter after learning that trustees were barred from any such payments.</p>

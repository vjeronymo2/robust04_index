			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Huntingdon shares fall 28p on warning Shares in Huntingdon International Holdings fell almost a fifth yesterday after the life sciences, engineering and environmental company issued a second profits warning in 12 months and blamed the parlous state of the green industry. The shares closed 28p lower at 119p. Huntingdon said trading conditions in its US and UK-based engineering and environmental services division were even weaker than the board had indicated when annual results showing a near-40 per cent slide in pre-tax profits to Pounds 8.79m were published in December. It now planned to bring in specialist consultants to conduct a four-week review of environmental and engineering operations. 'To expect environmental matters will provide a gratuitous upturn in our fortunes is no way to run a business. We have recognised that - perhaps we should have recognised it sooner,' said Mr Christopher Cliffe, finance director. 'We have to decide whether the diversification programme into engineering and environmental services still makes sense in view of the absence of governments' willingness to enforce compliance and sign off any major infrastructure projects in the UK,' he said. Moreover, new legislation in the US has yet to materialise. The group had hoped new laws would increase the workload of the 1,800 people it employs in engineering and environmental services operations at 70 sites in the US. The business, which now accounts for about 52 per cent of Huntingdon's total revenue following last year's Pounds 3m rationalisation, was started up in 1985, growing mainly through a series of small acquisitions until 1991 when it ran into the US recession.</p>

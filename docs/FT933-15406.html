			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Optimism fuels jump in German markets GERMANY'S stock market surged to a year's high yesterday amid an outbreak of optimism about the outlook for the country's economy. The DAX index of 30 leading shares closed yesterday afternoon at 1,783, a rise of nearly 64 points, or 3.7 per cent, on the day. This alone was more than twice the gains achieved by Europe's other leading stock exchanges yesterday and in after-hours trading it rose further to 1,799, a gain of more than 17 per cent since the beginning of the year. 'This is not the beginning of the second great economic miracle in Germany,' said Mr Klaus Friedrich, chief economist at Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank. 'But it shows that market assessments about the German business cycle have been overly pessimistic.' Economists and stockbrokers said that the increase reflected a number of factors, including the likelihood of further cuts in interest rates following the Bundesbank's decision to lower its official rates last week and a growing sense that the low point of the German economic cycle has been reached. 'When we look back on the German economy from the vantage point of 18 months' time, it will be clear that the low point in the economic cycle was reached in the first quarter of 1992,' said Mr Ulrich Schutte, a managing partner of Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst, a German bank majority-owned by Lloyds Bank of the UK. This was one of the reasons given by the Bundesbank for its cuts in its Lombard and discount rate to 8.25 and 6.75 per cent respectively last week. It has subsequently been born out by the news this week that new industrial orders rose by 4 per cent in May compared with the previous month. Economists are hopeful that the economy will grow from the first to second quarter, although for the year as a whole it is likely that GNP will drop by at least 1 per cent.

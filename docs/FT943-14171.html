			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Nextel and OneComm agree to Dollars 650m merger Nextel Communications, the US digital mobile communications company, is to merge with OneComm, a leading western states provider of dispatch communications services to fleet vehicles. The deal has been valued at over Dollars 650m. Nextel operates an extensive radio network for taxis and fleet vehicles. Last year, it acquired mobile radio spectrum rights from Motorola, and announced plans to create a national network, using new digital technology from Motorola. The new technology will provide mobile telephone, messaging and paging services, as well as dispatch services. In recent months, Nextel has launched its digital mobile communications services in northern and southern California. OneComm is offering similar services in Colorado. Nextel said the services would be available in New York, Chicago and Seattle later this year, and that it would further expand operations in 1995. Mr Brian McAuley, Nextel president and chief executive, said: 'Upon consummation of the merger, Nextel will be authorised to provide service in areas that are home to over 210m Americans. That's over 80 per cent of the US population and includes 47 of the top 50 markets in the country.' Under the terms of its agreement with OneComm, Nextel will issue approximately 22.4m shares to OneComm shareholders in exchange for approximately 21m OneComm shares.</p>

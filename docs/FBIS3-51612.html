Miss, the  connection please.    [Operator] Sir?    [Mejia] Yes.    [Operator] Yes, we now have the line with the capital of  Namibia.    [Mejia] Good.    [Operator] Cuban Minister Roberto Robaina is on the line.  [To  Robaina:] This is a call from Cuba. Go ahead, both of you.    [Mejia] Yes, thank you very much, Miss.    Mr. Foreign Minister, good evening. We are on the air, live,  for the "Exclusive" program and all of Cuba, over our radio  station Radio Rebelde. How are you?    [Robaina] Well, very well. No problems whatsoever.    [Mejia] Comrade Foreign Minister, we want to know about the  continuation of the dialogue begun today by yourself and  Namibian Foreign Affairs Minister Theo-Ben Guribab, a dialogue  you two began at the 48th UN General Assembly, and especially  what subjects were broached in these official talks.    [Robaina] Well, indeed, Mejia, we arrived in Windhoek just a  few hours ago. I think we are carrying out a program that,  happily, is already the, let us say, final part of the tour  through these countries of Africa. But I think it has special  significance, precisely because it has to do with this  territory, Namibia, in particular -- which is so closely linked  to the history of our country and to the presence of our Cuban  troops in Angola, troops who made a modest contribution to the  independence of this territory.    I think it constitutes a privilege for everyone accompanying  me, and from the point of view....[rephrases] For me personally,  the land that (?can still be seen) from the border, to have the  privilege and possibility of seeing it and treading it with  one's own compatriots. [sentence as heard] And I think that has  been, without a doubt, a meeting of special significance -- just  as this people's respect and admiration has been special from  the beginning, the respect and admiration of the ministers with  whom I have already met.    I have seen....[rephrases] I have begun the official talks  with the Foreign Ministry, but I have also already contacted the  ministers of Interior, Sports, Education, and Industry. That is,  we have already made contact with several of them; and in all of  them we can see, in the first place, a deep tie, a tie that is  sincere and based on the historic relations that Cubans and  Namibians have always had.    I think...[rephrases] a very broad agenda was discussed  today, which has to do with the medical collaboration that  already exists, with the cooperation...[rephrases] the  collaboration in the sphere of education proper. We just signed  an bilateral foreign ministry agreement today, and we prepared  the signing of a trade agreement, which will be signed in the  next few hours.    The meetings with the ministers of Health, Commerce,  Tourism,  and Sports continue tomorrow; and the meeting with the president  is scheduled for 21 January, before departure.    I have just now visited, at the places where they work, the  physicians who are providing services here, too, within a system  of compensated cooperation [colaboracion compensada]. There are  14 of them established in Windhoek, the capital; and the other  40-some-odd are in the regions more distant from the center,  (?from) the capital. And tomorrow night I am meeting with the  entire Cuban group here, after I finish up the entire program  with the Namibians that I have scheduled for the day.    [Mejia] Well, Comrade Minister, I would so much like to know  if there is a possibility of your summing up for us your trip  through the Dark Continent, through these five African  countries; and whether or not the objectives of this trip have  been fulfilled thus far.    [Robaina] I feel that, even though there are a few hours  left before finishing, we can perfectly well sum up: It is an  exceptional opportunity to encounter a part of our history. I  have, from the first days, found a profound gratitude on the  part of the Africans in all the countries for what Cuba has done  for them. I insist that Cuba is today a nation, and it is the  nation that lives, resists, and works thanks to, among other  things, what the Africans contributed to us in the formation of  that Cuban patriotism and that nationality that exist in our  land. Therefore, not only are we collecting expressions of  gratitude; we, too, are expressing to this Dark Continent what  we Cubans owe to it, especially as regards the formation of the  Cuban nation.    This has been an exceptional opportunity to speak of our  historic relations; but we have said that in order to remain  faithful to those historic relations, we must, above all, make  history at the present time. And to make history in our  relations at the present time is to find the adequate, proper,  current level that corresponds to our relations with Africa  under these new circumstances.    The situation is new for the world. The situation is new for  Africa. The situation is new for the countries I have visited  and for our country as well. But I think we will be far more  faithful to our history if, under such difficult circumstances,  we are capable of being faithful to the principles that have  always characterized these relations. Above all else, we have  found a space for communication, a space for understanding, and  a space for exchanges. I do not believe in strictly political  diplomacy. I believe that in these times, our country's  diplomacy must seek space for the greatest problem we have:  economic reintegration into a truly difficult, complex, and  changing world.    [Mejia] Comrade Minister, I want to thank you for this time  you have given Radio Rebelde. I would also like to invite you to  join us here at our studio when you get back to the country.    [Robaina] Thank you. I truly appreciate the opportunity you  have given us to keep the people informed of what we are doing.  I have said before and I repeat: Even though our work here is  difficult and involves pressures, nothing can be more difficult  and pressuring than what our people, whom we miss so much, do  morning, noon, and night.    [Mejia] This was a live telephone interview with Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina on the last leg of his tour in  Windhoek, Namibia. Foreign Minister Robaina is now concluding a  five-country tour of Africa.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N. Davydov: "A Correction of Strategy"] </F>   [Text] Under the conditions of the continuing slump  in transport volume and the deteriorating economic situation in  the sector, the railroad workers have increasingly been forced  to introduce corrections in the strategy of their activity. Not  five months have passed since the Program for the Development of  Reforms and Strengthening of the Financial-Economic Position of  Transport in 1994-1995 was adopted in December of last year, and  here the collegium held last week expanded anew the course  taken, and interpreted the situation that has formed in a  somewhat new way.    As B.M. Lapidus, chief of the Economics and Development  Administration, reported, representatives of all the railroads  and ministry administrations took part in amending the program.  In particular, the earlier accepted guidelines for releasing  workers employed in transport, shutting down low-activity  stations and sections, taking locomotives and rail cars out of  service, expanding the testing ground for the use of old  materials for the permanent roadway, and so on, were revised.  All this will make it possible to save over 240 billion rubles  [R] in operating expenses.    Ways of increasing revenues were accordingly outlined.  Thanks  to additionally adopted measures, they can be increased to R325  billion. Well, the next few months will show whether this will  be enough to improve the financial situation of the roads and  sector as a whole.    V.F. Zayko, first deputy chief of the West Siberian  mainline,  presented to those assembled the road program for a change in  this line's structure. He emphasized that it would be simply  impossible to work unless administrative expenditures were  further cut. It was therefore decided to keep three divisions,  instead of the five present ones. The Barabinsk will be  completely merged into the Novosibirsk, and the Karasuk--by  sections, into the Altay and Omsk.    I will not retell in detail the technical side of the  problem  set forth by Zayko, particularly since it is similar to  corresponding measures on the October Railroad, on which GUDOK  has already given quite a detailed report. It is much more  important, perhaps, to dwell on the social consequences of this  step. The speaker assured us that each of the 512 administrative  workers released will be found jobs on the railroad, and  moreover without changing their place of residence.    But here G.M. Fadeyev, minister of railways and the head of  the collegium, began to read a letter that had arrived,  addressed to him, from transport veterans of Karasuk, in which  the actions of the railroad Commission for Eliminating Divisions  were judged to be destructive and ruinous measures. They said  that this number of administrative workers could have been  released without breaking up the road structure. The letter  ended with the words:    "We beg you to take into consideration our pain and alarm  when solving the problem at the collegium."    "How can this be," the minister addressed the speaker, "you  state that the work collectives and trade unions approved your  actions, but after that, a letter like this arrives?"    "One can understand the veterans," answered Zayko. "The  Karasuk Division always occupied the central place on the  Central Siberian Railroad, and by all indicators was one of the  leading divisions on the road. Now, however, the daily load  volume here is not over 40 rail cars, and on the Barabinsk  division even less--27. Both divisions are constantly subsidized  by the three remaining ones. This means that this is an enforced  measure, and we feel that there is no alternative."    None of the collegium members who spoke on this subject  attempted to refute these conclusions. On the contrary. The idea  was conveyed that consolidating the divisions was exactly what  was needed to preserve the social milieu and protect the people,  or else it could not survive under market conditions. With  transit cut in half and a slump in passenger turnover, both  divisions were becoming obvious candidates for bankruptcy.  Apparently, though, the situation that has formed has not been  convincingly enough explained to everyone, which gives rise to  letters like this.    The collegium passed a resolution to agree with the proposal  of the West Siberian Railroad management that the divisions be  consolidated. The problems of finding jobs for the people are  not out of control, however.    The main item this day was the problem of developing a  transport-dispatch service for freight owners and improving the  use of the container fleet. This problem was also posed back at  the December collegium and stems from the need for better  adaptation to work under market conditions, when freight owners  become more demanding and competition from motor vehicle and  other forms of transport increases.    The reports by V.M. Logunov, chief of the Freight and  Commercial Work Administration, and V.M. Bogdanov, deputy  director of VNIIZhT [All-Union Railroad Transport Scientific  Research Institute], gave a detailed analysis of the reasons for  the development of a transport-dispatch service being slowed  down. Both positive and negative factors in this sphere of  activity were mentioned. The good work experience of the Moscow  Railroad was especially noted, in particular that of the Moscow  Junction, which had done away with the Mosavtotrans  monopoly--the container areas that formerly belonged to it were  returned to the road's keeping, the necessary motor vehicle  transport has been acquired, and now practically all the  mechanized subdivisions for loading-unloading work are engaged  in performing transport-dispatch operations. It is expected that  over R2 billion in additional revenues will be obtained this  year through this.    Other positive examples were also presented, including some  by the directors, speaking at the collegium, of line  enterprises, which are trying to expand the framework of the  transport-dispatch service for enterprises and the people. V.A.  Bakunin, chief of the Vologda Board of Directors for  Loading-Unloading Work and Commercial operations, and L.K.  Bezmenov, chief of the Magnitogorsk Municipal Freight Station,  told of their achievements and problems. Efficient seeds are  sprouting on the North Caucasus, Gorkiy, Kuybyshev, and South  Urals railroads....    By the end of each speech, however, the cheerful pictures  were replaced by quite a cheerless one, and it was almost  unanimously verified: Despite the efforts made, a lot of private  and semiprivate offices have propagated around the railroad, and  they are taking on the delivery of freight wherever they like,  even though they have neither locomotives nor rail cars nor  containers, nor, of course, railroad tracks. Five such  advertisements were found in a single issue of the newspaper IZ  RUK V RUKI! After reading these out, the minister turned to the  two speakers and all those attending with the questions: Why do  you regard them as competitors, on what basis? Or are the  station chiefs offering them everything they need as a bribe? In  the end, what will prevent us from creating our own flexible  system for a transport-dispatch service?    Unfortunately, after this, most of the speeches were  self-reports. True, someone alluded to the fact that the status  and charter of the mechanized loading-unloading subdivisions  were obsolete and were not being incorporated in the new work  conditions. Someone else drew the conclusion that a transition  to large containers must be made. The next one--we are losing a  great deal because of the fact that freight insurance has been  put in the hands of ZhASO [expansion not given]. And so on.    Few people, however, remembered the main thing, the reason  for which, strictly speaking, the collegium was assembled, and  which was designated as the priority strategic task as far back  as December--creating a through system of freight dispatch for  the entire network, including the near abroad. Those preparing  this problem for discussion at the collegium probably did not  have a sufficiently systemic approach to its solution. After  all, there is useful experience at the line enterprises and  stations, and here and there they have begun to turn and face  the inquiries of the customers on the divisions and in the road  administrations. The Transzheldorekspeditsiya state enterprise  has appeared under the aegis of the ministry. On the whole,  though, the system is not working. Why?    Attempts have been made, including in the speeches, to  answer  this question. Mention was made of the need for a market  approach to the matter, the growing demand for creating dispatch  organizations, contractual tariffs, the task office, and the  speed of freight delivery. There were quite a few different  ideas on the way in which large containers could be used more  efficiently.    All the same, closest of all to the truth, in my opinion,  were those who gave a sober evaluation of the situation in the  country, which has changed so radically. A simple example.  Twenty years ago, it was no problem to transport household goods  by rail. Now this is almost an insoluble problem. The main thing  at that time was not the need to look for customers and attract  freight to the railroad: Industry and agriculture worked  smoothly, and the roads constantly had to seek reserves of  rolling stock and throughput potentials.    Today, however, the boundlessness of prices and tariffs is  forcing the railroad workers to revise the guidelines and  emphases of their activity. The main thing now is no longer to  transport, but to find freight, and the leading occupation is  therefore, most likely, not that of engineer but of freight  dispatcher.    So far, however, we have no such person, in the market sense  of this figure. However you twist things, whatever explanation  you think up, things cannot be put right without this figure,  especially since there is also no information support for this  new system we are trying to set up. Even though, as A.Ya.  Sidenko, deputy minister, expressed it, our equipment permits us  to learn in a matter of seconds, for example, the location of a  rail car that went from Murmansk to Nakhodka a week ago.    All right, once again you have to make sure: Any new model  or  system should have economic substantiation. This gap is to be  filled by a commission created at the collegium, which should  bring to a logical conclusion the preparation of the structure,  sphere of influence, technical equipment, and clearing accounts  mechanism of the future transport-dispatch system.    It can be said without exaggeration that even the  recertification of the managerial staff of the Northern Railroad  went along on the basis of the new criteria. Essentially, the  work of the entire collective of the mainline was evaluated  under the most difficult economic conditions. The talk was  specific, based on principle and with an emphasis on the  existing shortcomings. First and foremost, there was an analysis  of the situation with wages and the potentials for reducing  debts. This collation of the course in the work of the collegium  and the road leaders can probably be of mutual assistance.    In connection with the approaching 20th anniversary of the  start of BAM construction, the collegium discussed the proposals  of the mainline construction veterans, the military builders,  and a number of public organizations that a series of measures  be prepared for carrying out in July-August. This includes the  slated applied science conference, "BAM: Yesterday, Today, and  Tomorrow." It is proposed that a trip be organized on BAM for a  large group of journalists from the capital, in order to show,  through the mass information media, the unutilized possibilities  concealed on this route, and the way people are now living and  working there, and at the same time to give a graphic  demonstration to the journalists of the problems of the "steel  mainlines."    The Russian and Moscow journalistic organizations supported  this idea. In this way, attention can be drawn to BAM's  problems, in particular, to the uncompleted facilities, most  important of which is the Severomuyskiy Tunnel. The collegium  entrusted A.O. Bogdanovich, deputy minister, with all the  problems involved in organizing these measures.    K.P. Ayrapetov, chief of the Business Affairs  Administration,  reported to the collegium participants on the state of executive  discipline on the ministry staff. The main idea of his speech  amounted to the fact that preparation of the documents,  particularly those outside the boundaries of the Ministry of  Railways, can be accelerated through reducing the number of  executors. He said that there should be one person responsible  for coordinating the content in all the administrations involved  in this matter.</p>

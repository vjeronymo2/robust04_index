			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Observer: Numerology Peter Wood, the insurance entrepreneur who pioneered direct telephone selling of motor policies in the UK, is not the sort of person you'd think had trouble remembering figures. And yet he says he can't remember Direct Line's telephone numbers. Moreover, at yesterday's launch of Privilege Insurance - a joint venture with the Royal Bank of Scotland for higher risk motorists - he said he hadn't 'actually thought about' what his salary might be as its non-executive chairman. Forgetfulness is perhaps understandable in his case. After all, as chief executive of Direct Line he received Pounds 24m last November to abandon a pay bonus scheme that had earned him Pounds 18.2m over the year.</p>

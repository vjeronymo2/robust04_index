			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation from 17  February ROK vernacular newspapers on reaction to North Korea's  acceptance of nuclear inspections by the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) and prospects for future developments in  this issue. This topic is covered extensively by the vernacular  press with CHOSON ILBO, TONG-A ILBO, HANGUK ILBO, KYONGHYANG  SINMUN, SEOUL SINMUN, and HANGYORE SINMUN all carrying  editorials and articles analyzing future development prospects.  <H6>  REACTION </H6>   The moderate CHOSON ILBO, TONG-A ILBO, and HANGUK ILBO  newspapers carry 800-word editorials on page 3 welcoming North  Korea's acceptance of the IAEA nuclear inspections but caution  that although the emergency atmosphere has dissipated on the  Korean peninsula due to North Korea's acceptance of nuclear  inspection, it is too early in the negotiation process to expect  too much from North Korea.    Pointing out that "the nuclear issue began with the IAEA's  demand for special inspections [tukpyol sachal]," the CHOSON  ILBO editorial entitled "No More Nuclear Games," says that "ad  hoc and ordinary inspections [imsi mit tongsang sachal] on seven  declared facilities are meaningless" and that "the developments  in the nuclear issue will only be possible following special  inspections." The editorial warns that if North Korea accepted  the inspections to avoid UN Security Council's sanctions, it  will only add to its image of being "an impossible country to  deal with" and urges North Korea to keep in mind the "economic  benefits" that are to be gained from the resolution of the  nuclear issue. The editorial concludes by telling readers to  wait until North Korea accepts special and mutual inspections  [sangho sachal] between the North and the South.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO editorial entitled "Still a Long  Way  To Go To Resolve North Korea's Nuclear Issue" chimes in with  CHOSON ILBO by saying that "real negotiations begin when the  issues of special inspection on two undeclared facilities and  mutual inspections [sangho sachal] between the North and the  South are discussed at the third round of the U.S.-North Korea  talks," but adds that developments prove that North Korea only  takes action when faced with "resolute measures [tanohan  taecho]."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO editorial entitled "While  Catastrophe Has Been Avoided on the North Korean Nuclear Issue"  says that "although North Korea's avoidance of catastrophe and  economic sanctions is to be praised, ...this does not mean a  complete resolution of the nuclear issue." The editorial urges  the government to be fully prepared for North Korea's tricks as  the sudden change is part of a "meticulous, premeditated plan."    HANGUK ILBO's 800-word article by Paris correspondent Han  Ki-pong on page 2, in analyzing the implications of the long  drawn-out negotiations process, says that "no progress has been  made from the starting point of negotiations a year ago," but  that the resolution of conflict between North Korea and the  international community is important in and of itself.    HANGUK ILBO carries an 800-word article by Choe Kyu-sik on  page 4 on the ROK Government's view on North Korea's acceptance  of nuclear inspections. While finding North Korea's decision  "fortunate and welcoming," the government expressed its position  that it is too early to be optimistic. The article says that  the government hopes to have meaningful development in  working-level contacts concerning the exchange of special envoys  and to lead North Korea to completely return to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] system following a successful  third round of U.S.-North Korea talks regarding the special  inspections [tukpyol sachal] of the two undeclared facilities.  While the government does not interpret North Korea's  acceptance of inspections to mean complete abandonment of  nuclear development, it is not being interpreted as "a temporary  step" to get out of the recent emergency situation, but as one  official put it, "a meaningful breakthrough." This official is  said to have noted that "it is a considerable development that  North Korea accepted ad hoc inspections [imsi sachal] on two  facilities when it had only allowed replacement of batteries and  films."    On page 5, HANGUK ILBO carries a 700-word article by Yu  Sung-u noting the two interpretations among relevant government  officials on North Korea's acceptance of inspections: One, that  it is part of a long-term negotiation strategy, and two, that  there has been a sudden change in power structure within North  Korea. Supporters of the former theory feel that North Korea's  concession was planned to prevent the resumption of Team Spirit  and that "it may be short-sighted to analyze that North Korea  changed its attitude because it felt pressured by the 21  February deadline." Those who support the latter view note that  while the declaration to withdraw from the NPT and the  proclamation of a semi-war state in North Korea were done in Kim  Chong-il's name, measures to settle the situation have been done  in Kim Il-song's name. The article speculates that Kim Il-song  may have chosen to involve himself in the settlement process  after judging Kim Chong-il's management of diplomatic and  economic affairs to have failed and concludes by saying that the  issue of succession of power remains uncertain.    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on page  3 an 800-word editorial entitled "The Problem of Inspections on  North Korea's Nuclear Facilities Starts Now." The editorial  welcomes North Korea's acceptance of IAEA nuclear inspections as  evidence that North Korea wants to avoid serious confrontation  with international society due to the nuclear issue. The  editorial reports, however, that "the problem is how sincerely  North Korea will accept IAEA inspections in the future," noting  that there have been differences of opinion between the IAEA and  North Korea regarding procedural matters on inspections,  including its form and scope.    Noting that North Korea's acceptance of IAEA nuclear  inspections is "nothing but a beginning" and "it is no more than  returning to the situation one year ago when North Korea  declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty, NPT," the editorial stresses that "in a sense, North  Korea's acceptance has no new, special meaning other than just  the start of discussions on the North Korean nuclear issue."    The editorial urges North Korea to allow the IAEA to inspect  all nuclear facilities, including undeclared sites in Yongbyon  and, at the same time, stresses the need for the United States  and the IAEA to continue negotiations with Pyongyang "with a  consistent principle." The editorial concludes that "the  government should realize that if it continues its policy toward  North Korea and its nuclear policy with an irresolute and  inconsistent attitude, the people's unrest will intensify."    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN in Korean publishes on page  3  an 800-word editorial entitled: "North-South Dialogue Should  Also Be Resumed." While defining North Korea's acceptance of  nuclear inspections this time and the IAEA's announcement to  send its inspection team to Pyongyang soon as "a dramatic  solution," the editorial notes that North Korea failed to  mention if the two undeclared sites in Yongbyon -- which are  under suspicion of storing liquid and solid nuclear fuel -- will  be inspected this time. The editorial analyzes that North  Korea's acceptance does not mean a solution to the North Korean  nuclear issue, but means a start to its solution, stressing that  success of the issue depends entirely on North Korea's attitude.    The editorial notes that "now that North Korea has agreed to  IAEA full-scope inspection, the only remaining problem is to  resume a meaningful dialogue between North and South Korea to  discuss mutual inspections between the North and the South to  confirm denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."    The editorial concludes that North Korea, which has thus far  adhered to dialogue with the United States, should correctly  understand the need for North-South dialogue, adding that "North  Korea should be aware that the improvement of its relations with  the United States cannot be achieved without South Korea's  consent."    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean publishes on page  3 an 800-word editorial entitled: "The North Korean Nuclear  Issue Has Passed the Crisis Stage." The editorial notes that  North Korea's decision on 16 February to accept the IAEA demand  for nuclear inspections is a "blitzkrieg" decision and that  "with this the North Korean nuclear issue, which was heading  toward a crisis stage, was defused for a while."    Enumerating the ominous moves of the recent months in  connection with the North Korean nuclear issue -- such as tense  North Korean-IAEA relations, the dispatch of a U.S. national  intelligence team to South Korea, the announcement of U.S. plans  to deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters to South  Korea, the plan to resume the Team Spirit exercise, the  preparations for referring the North Korean nuclear issue to the  UN Security Council, and North Korea's reactions to these moves  -- the editorial notes that "these were indeed shocking moves  for those directly related to the nuclear issue and who live in  the southern part of the peninsula." The editorial then  appraises our government's efforts to prevent a crisis of war on  the peninsula, indicating Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's recent  meetings with U.S. Government officials. The editorial  expresses the hope for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue.    HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 2 a 900-word article by  Kim  Tae-ho analyzing the prospects for the North Korean nuclear  issue in the wake of North Korea's acceptance of IAEA  inspections. Quoting an official concerned at the National  Unification Board, NUB, as commenting that "now the first button  has been fastened," the article reports that the NUB official's  comment has two implications: One is that negotiations for the  nuclear issue as a whole will be smoother in the future and the  other is that North Korea's acceptance is just a new start.    The article stresses that the resumption of North-South  dialogue depends on whether the Team Spirit exercise is  suspended. The article also analyzes that North Korea will  probably demand not only the suspension of the exercise, but  also the renouncement of the international cooperative system  against North Korea in connection with the nuclear issue in  return for the realization of exchanges of North-South special  envoys. The article stresses the need not to persistently  adhere to a solution of the nuclear issue as we see it today,  but to first promote economic and personnel exchanges between  the North and the South.  <H6>  PROSPECTS </H6>   The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean carries on page 4 a  1,000-word article by Yi Sung-u on prospects for North-South  relations following North Korea's acceptance of nuclear  inspections. Noting that the ROK Government is busy preparing  necessary actions for resumption of North-South contacts, the  article reports the government is optimistic that contacts will  be resumed and yet assumes a prudent attitude that no  significant progress will be made soon.    The article notes that as North Korea employed a  foot-dragging tactic, the government assumed a flexible attitude  in accordance with North Korea's reactions. Recalling that  unification-related ministers met on 25 January and confirmed  the government position that the nuclear impasse will be broken  only when the North fully returns to the NPT, accepts  substantial inspections by the IAEA, and basically agrees on  South-North mutual nuclear inspections, the article predicts  "chances are high that the government will flexibly readjust its  stance in accordance with how IAEA inspections and North  Korean-U.S. contacts will proceed."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean on page 3 carries a  1,000-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong  Chin-sok on prospects for North Korean-U.S. relations. The  article reports "North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections  does not mean that nuclear transparency has been guaranteed.  However, the North Korean nuclear issue has entered a new stage  in which chances for a crisis on the Korean peninsula have been  diminished to some extent and the safety-valve of the nuclear  issue has been sealed."    The article reports that there are numerous diplomatic,  political, and legal obstacles that should be overcome for the  promotion of North Korean-U.S. relations. The article predicts  that even if high-level U.S.-North Korean dialogue is resumed,  there is a great possibility that relatively slow progress will  be made in the issues of suspending the Team Spirit exercise and  promoting ties because the nuclear issue has not been cleared  from the agenda.    The moderate CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,200-word  article by Pak Tu-sik entitled "How Things Will Turn Out After  North Korea's Acceptance of Nuclear Inspections." Noting that  North Korea has defused the crisis over the nuclear issue by  accepting IAEA inspections, the article predicts that North  Korean-U.S. negotiations or North Korean-Japanese negotiations  will start in the first half of this year if progress is made at  the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks.    The article questions if inter-Korean contacts for the  exchange of special envoys can take place smoothly. The article  points out that the "two sides should lower the level of their  demands."    The moderate TONG-A ILBO in Korean carries on page 2 an  1,200-word article by Nam Chan-chong entitled: "How the Third  U.S.-DPRK Talks Will Evolve."    Noting the future obstacles of U.S.-DPRK talks, the article  reports that "to remove these obstacles, North Korea must allow  the IAEA inspection team to inspect thoroughly its seven  reported nuclear facilities and the exchange of special envoys  between the North and South must be carried out."    The article reports that "the ROK and the United States will  announce the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise this weekend  when the IAEA inspection team arrives in Pyongyang," noting an  agreement reached between North Korea and the United States at  their 18th working-level contact held in New York on 29 December  1993.    Referring to the U.S. deployment of Patriot missiles to  South  Korea as a new agenda item in the negotiations between North  Korea and the United States, the article reports: "Although the  United States says that it will deploy Patriot missiles to South  Korea for defensive purposes, Pyongyang will make it a issue at  the meeting with the U.S. side." Noting the possibility of the  U.S. cancellation of its plan to deploy the Patriots, the  article reports that "Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu has said  that the ROK and the United States decided to discuss it after  21 February."    TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an 1,000-word article by Pak  Che-kyun entitled: "The Situation After North Korea's  Acceptance of Nuclear Inspection." Referring to the ROK role in  North Korean-U.S. talks and in North Korean-IAEA contacts, the  article reports: "The resumption of North-South dialogue is  getting closer as the IAEA inspection team is allowed to travel  to North Korea this weekend."    Referring to the need to settle the simultaneous North-South  inspection issue by the North and South themselves after IAEA  special inspections are conducted, the article urges the  government to actively strengthen cooperation with the United  States to make North Korea aware of the importance of the  improvement of North-South relations in order to improve  U.S.-North Korean relations. The article continues that "some  government officials say that the government must show its new  negotiating card, such as the North-South economic cooperation  card, to realize North-South dialogue."    TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 900-word article by Kim  Cha-su entitled: "The Background and Prospects of North Korea's  Acceptance of Nuclear Inspections." The article reports: "It  is very successful to confirm North Korea's attitude to resolve  the nuclear issue through dialogue," referring to the  government's preparations to respond to North Korea's acceptance  of nuclear inspections. Noting the background of North Korea's  acceptance of the nuclear inspections, the article reports that  "North Korea accepted the inspections a day before Kim  Chong-il's birthday, and that this is intended to attract  international recognition of the Kim Chong-il power system by  creating an atmosphere in which North Korea gives a gift to the  international community."    TONG-A ILBO carries on page 4 a 400-word article by Yi  Chin-yong entitled: "The Prospects for IAEA Nuclear Inspection  of North Korea." Referring to the need to inspect the two  undeclared nuclear facilities in Yongbyon to clearly dispel the  suspicion of North Korea's nuclear weapon development, the  article reports that "this issue is likely to be discussed at  the upcoming U.S.-DPRK high-level talks." Noting the background  of North Korea's refusal to accept IAEA inspections and its  decision to withdraw from the NPT, the article concludes that  "it will take a long time to even confirm the result of the  inspections. Therefore, it is too early to be optimistic over  the North Korean nuclear issue."    The leftist-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean carries on  page  3 an 1,000-word article by Pak Chong-mun entitled: "North  Korea, South Korea, and the United States Stopped at the Edge of  a Precipice." Referring to Vice Foreign Minister Hong  Sun-yong's remarks that "North Korea's acceptance of the IAEA  nuclear inspection is only the beginning to the resolution of  the nuclear issue," the article points out several complicated  problems in the settlement of the North Korean nuclear issue.    Referring to the IAEA upcoming inspections as an opportunity  for maintaining the continuity of nuclear safeguards and for  guaranteeing the transparency of future nuclear inspection  activities, the article predicts that "North Korea will  cooperate with the IAEA inspection team in order to improve  relations with the United States in the future."</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Rental income helps Swire Pacific to advance by 26% SWIRE PACIFIC, the Hong Kong-based aviation, property and trading group, announced a 26 per cent increase in net profit in 1991, despite the impact of the gulf crisis on earnings from its 52 per cent-owned airline, Cathay Pacific. Swire, headed by Mr David Gledhill, posted net profit of HKDollars 3.08bn (USDollars 398m) in 1991, up from HKDollars 2.45bn in 1990. The results were boosted by a profit estimated at more than HKDollars 200m from the sale of a bottling factory. But there was a substantial increase in earnings from rental income and its diversified industrial businesses. The company said the prospects for 1992 were 'encouraging'. A continuing demand for air travel, improved contributions from industrial businesses as a result of a cyclical up-turn and the impact of a rationalisation programme, and the effects of its enlarged property portfolio should ensure a similar rate of earnings growth in 1992. Swire recommended a final dividend of 66 cents per 'A' share and 13.2 cents per 'B' share, making a total payout of 89 cent and 17.8 cents respectively. Rental income increased to HKDollars 1.23bn from HKDollars 792m, as a result of maiden contributions from phase II of its Pacific Place development and upward rental revisions from phase I. The group's three hotels in the Pacific Place development continued to lose money in 1991, but they should benefit from the pick up in tourist arrivals. Offshore oil and shipping services experienced increased profitability and on the industrial side, there were improvements from Coca-Cola bottling operations and former loss-maker Swire Technologies, a semi-conductor company. The group's net asset value increased to HKDollars 34.84bn, following a HKDollars 4.87bn increase in the estimated value of its property portfolio.</p>

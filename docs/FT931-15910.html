			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Cookery: Fat cats start here CHRISTMAS has taken its toll. The bathroom scales dictate that salads - and little else - go on to my menus this week. The weather suggests otherwise. I suppose that means I shall have to take a lot of distasteful exercise to keep warm. What a helluva way to begin the new year] Well, here goes - though if I do not succeed in shedding several pounds quite quickly, I may be forced to settle on being a fat cat for 1993. TREVISO SALAD If you boast an imaginative local greengrocer, ask for rosso di Treviso, a winter salading grown in the Veneto, available from November to March. It is also cultivated in France: French imports are labelled 'Trevisse'. Rosso di Treviso is a remarkably handsome plant with tall, tapering, cos-like leaves, tulip-streaked with deep red, and it is much more interesting to bite into than red whitloof chicory from Holland or the common cabbage-shaped radicchio of Chioggia - though either of these last two can be used as substitutes. To make a dark and beautiful salad with rich colouring and a mixture of earthy, sweet and slightly bitter flavours, first shred two crisp heads of rosso di Treviso (their combined weights will be  3/4 lb to 1lb) into a salad bowl. Add a good quantity of cooked and cubed beetroot, home-cooked for preference, though shop-bought will do, providing it is plain-steamed and vaccuum-packed, not, repeat not, the acid-sozzled sort. Add a handful of seeded raisins and sultanas soaked in vinaigrette dressing made with balsamic vinegar, and add extra dressing as necessary to lubricate the shredded leaves. Take a handful of thick crusts from good white bread, reduce them to very coarse crumbs, turn them in a little olive oil to moisten lightly, then fry them until very crisp. Scatter them into the salad bowl and add a grinding of black pepper. Mix quickly and serve while the crumbs are still toasty. FRUIT &amp; LEAF SALAD A healthy tonic of a salad, this is best if the ratio of fruit to leaf is high. Clementines are, in my view, decidedly superior to satsumas and they have the virtue of being seedless. Shred a little Chinese leaf into a salad bowl, preferably from the stalk end if you share my preference for crisp bite over floppy leaves. Add the same quantity of frizzy endive, snapping the greenery into short lengths, a handful of lambs' lettuce or the contents of a box or two of mustard and cress. Dress with sea salt, black pepper, orange juice and zest and a mixture of olive and hazel or walnut oil. Then add lots - I mean lots and lots - of clementines, simply peeled and divided into segments. Add, for good measure, a few kumquats, thinly sliced, if you happen to have some left over from Christmas, or the flesh of a pink grapefruit, ruthlessly stripped of all pith and membrane. The main thing is to include plenty of citrus. COLLEGE SALAD This is so called in acknowledgement of Mark Twain's description of cauliflower as cabbage with a college education. I get the impression Twain was no fonder of cauliflower than President Bush of broccoli. Perhaps this is a more palatable way of serving the vegetable than Twain was used to. Divide a fine, firm cauliflower into sprigs and steam until just tender. Meanwhile, make a vinaigrette dressing in a shallow dish, using 1 1/2 to two tablespoons of olive oil and  1/2 tablespoon of sherry vinegar. Put the cauliflower, cooked and blotted dry, into the dressing and turn it to coat it fully. Leave for five minutes to continue absorbing the vinaigrette and to cool somewhat, turning the sprigs once or twice. Chop coarsely one large or two small bunches of watercress. Add the greenery to the cauliflower and toss again. Toast a generous, mixed handful of pumpkin and sunflower seeds in a dry frying pan and sprinkle the seeds over the salad just before serving.</p>

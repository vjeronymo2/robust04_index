			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Kota Kinabalu, Tues [8 February] -- A minimum  RM700 [Malaysian ringgits] million allocation for low-cost  housing, 123 schools, a university and massive development  programmes to increase the per capita income of the people in  Sabah to RM10,000 by the year 2000 are the emphasis of the  Barisan Nasional manifesto unveiled today. [Passage omitted  covered by referent item]    The main theme of the Parti Bersatu Sabah [PBS] [United  Sabah  Party] manifesto, unveiled by party president and Chief  Minister Datuk Sri Joseph Pairin Kitingan this morning, is the  recurring thorny issues in State-Federal ties since PBS came  into power in 1985.    The key points in the PBS manifesto are similar to those  used  in the last three elections. They include a more equitable  sharing of petroleum revenue, and safeguarding Sabah's  constitutional rights.    The PBS says it will pursue the proposal to set up a  university and a separate TV station. It also emphasises that  the party will continue to seek from the Federal Government a  long-term solution to the Philippines' claim on Sabah, more  effective ways to prevent the inflow of illegal immigrants and  manage those in the State. [passage omitted]    This time the 13-page manifesto also makes subtle references  to Umno's [United Malays National Organization] presence in  Sabah. In an apparent reference to Umno and Federal leaders, it  says the party will seek to free Sabahans from fear of political  domination and eliminate any tendency from any quarter to exert  their "tyranny over the minds of man by one person or group from  within or out side Sabah". [passage omitted]    The 14-point economic programme outlined aims at further  diversifying, adding value and restructuring Sabah's economic  base and enhancing its competitiveness in the international  market. It will continue to create a conducive environment for  private sector growth, intensify training and development of  entrepreneurship and technical skills.    When pointed out that the PBS development agenda paled in  comparison with the BN's plans, Pairin said the promise was not  new.    "If we were in the Federal Government, we would do more than  that. All these promises should have been done from 1963 (the  year Sabah joined Malaysia). [passage omitted]    He claimed that the BN manifesto was an election ploy and  that the only thing new was to "put in writing all these  promises"    He blamed the BN for the inferior infrastructure in Sabah  and  the shortage of personnel such as doctors saying that the BN's  record in Sabah was poor.    On the State-Federal relations, he said the PBS would seek  sincere and mutual understanding towards better a political  relationship with the Federal Government and enhance national  integration and unity.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- Foreign political  parties and organisations urged the United States to immediately  accede to the DPRK's peace proposal for replacing the Korean  armistice agreement with a peace agreement and establishing a  new peace arrangement, which is contained in the April 28  statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry.    The political bureau of the New Party of the Congress for  the  Independence of Madagascar in a statement May 15 said the DPRK  is making sincere efforts to remove nuclear threat on the Korean  peninsula and defend peace and security in this part of the  world.    It is reasonable and judicious to find a peaceful solution  to  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through DPRK-USA  talks, said the statement, adding that the party wants the  continuation of the DPRK-USA talks and that impartiality must be  ensured in the settlement of the nuclear issue.    The Uganda-DPRK Friendship Association and the Ugandan  National Committee for the Study of the Chuche Idea in a joint  statement May 19 said the continuation of the dangerous state of  ceasefire on the Korean peninsula is abnormal in every respect.    If the United States truly wants peace and security in  Korea,  it must accept the peace overture of the DPRK side and come out  to negotiation with the DPRK without delay, the statement  demanded.    Sayfuddin Chowdhry, member of parliament and floor leader  (secretary-general) of the Central Committee of the Communist  Party of India (Marxist), in an interview with KCNA in New Delhi  May 17 said: "We strongly demand the United States stop the  reckless military provocations against the Korean people and  immediately respond to the constructive peace overture of the  DPRK."</p>

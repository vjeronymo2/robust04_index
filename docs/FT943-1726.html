			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Stop-go producers put jute workers through the mill - A West Bengal union is striving to get one of the 'black sheep' operations reopened For many years anarchy has reigned in some jute mills in West Bengal, where most of India's jute industry is concentrated. These 'black sheep' mills, as the Indian Jute Mills Association describes them, produce jute goods only when the market is favourable. But while this stop-go management approach causes economic hardship to the workers, it does not provoke strong protests from the trade unions as the migrant workers from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Orissa who constitute the majority of the labour force return to their villages during the frequent closures of the mills to work in the fields. The recalcitrant mills broke away from the IJMA one by one because they would not submit to any kind of discipline. According to an IJMA official, 'a tripartite agreement involving the industry, the unions and the West Bengal government spells out the wages and other benefits of the workers. But some jute mill managements will have nothing to do with this agreement. They make deals with the union leaders at the mill level to deny the workers full wages. Moreover, they habitually default in the payment of provident fund and gratuity to the workers'. The association is angry with these mills for causing distortions in the local jute goods market. Taking advantage of their lower costs of production compared with the IJMA members, they have been regularly offering discounts against the listed prices of jute goods. 'The losers are the ones which are meeting the dues of the workers in full,' complains the IJMA official. Even though the Left Front, dominated by the Marxist Communist Party of India, has been in power in West Bengal for nearly 18 years, the government has done little to give relief to the workers or to the mills remaining within the IJMA fold. The problem has now become a national issue, however, much to the embarrassment of the Left Front government, because of the relentless struggle by more than 3,000 workers of Kanoria Jute during the past nine months to get the mill at Phuleswar reopened. The mill was closed on November 26 last year. Unlike the other jute mills in the state, an overwhelming majority of workers of Kanoria Jute hail from the surrounding 82 villages. 'Since the Kanoria workers have nothing else to fall back upon, they are working to a one-point programme of reopening the mill on respectable terms,' says Mr Purnendu Bose, a member of the advisory committee of the Kanoria Jute Fighting Workers Union. These workers have set quite a few milestones in West Bengal's trade union movement. 'KJFWU was formed in February last year when the workers found that the four registered unions, including two owing allegiance to the Left Front government were not able to protect their interests,' explains Mr Nazibur Rahman, its general secretary. 'The new union, born because of sins of omission of the existing unions, enjoys the support of more than 90 per cent of the workers.' Although the KJFWU leaders insisted that they wanted to avoid 'a confrontation with the state authorities and the other unions at all cost', they made the big mistake of forcing their way into the mill and starting production of jute goods using the raw jute lying in the godown. The Calcutta High Court ordered the KJFWU to desist from producing and selling jute goods. Mr Jyoti Basu, chief minister of West Bengal and an active trade union leader, has made it clear that the forcible takeover of the mill offers no solution to the Kanoria Jute crisis. 'Such moves will only confuse the workers,' he warns. The minister is not finding it at all easy to attract industrial investment to West Bengal and he knows only too well that a few more cases of forcible takeover of factories by the workers would scare away the potential investors. Moreover, he cannot but take note of the humiliation suffered by the Marxist union at Kanoria Jute. The mill is also a considerable embarrassment for the Kanorias, an important Indian business family that is successfully running three other jute mills - Ludlow, Cheviot and Reliance - besides other industrial operations. The Kanorias bought the mill from the Mafatlals in 1974 and ran it till September 1987, when a lockout was declared. Unlike the other three mills, Kanoria Jute was not modernised. Neither did it take up production of high added value jute materials. Like so many other sick jute mills in West Bengal, Kanoria was taken over by a raw jute trader, who before reopening the unit in January 1991 made the unions agree to a cut in wages and a reduced workforce. The state government did not oppose the action as it wanted the mill to be reopened somehow. Anticipating prolonged labour unrest, the Kanorias pleaded with the new promoter to change the name of the jute mill. The fear of the Kanorias had been realised, but the name of the mill remains unchanged. Aberrations like the futile attempt forcibly to take possession of the mill notwithstanding, the KJFWU is doggedly pursuing with the federal and state government and the Bureau of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction its demand for the reopening of the mill. According to Mr Rahman, 'the existing promoter is welcome to run the mill provided he clears all past dues of the workers and respects the labour laws. The mill may be handed over to a new promoter if the existing promoter does not want to run it. We will be happy if the government takes over the unit. We are also ready to run the mill as a workers' co-operative or as a joint venture with a private promoter'. Both the federal government and the BIFR are well disposed to the idea of a new promoter contributing 60 per cent of the equity capital and the workers bringing in 40 per cent. In fact, the government has indicated that it may give loans to the workers equivalent to their contribution to the equity capital. A professional with many years of experience in jute has agreed to play the role of the new promoter and he is acceptable to the KJFWU. In the meantime, the KJFWU has been able to mobilise the support of the intellectuals all over the country for the Kanoria workers' movement. 'We have not put forward any new economic demands. We want the mill to be reopened and run professionally. The workers must get their dues and be able to work with dignity,' says Mr Bose. Perhaps the mill will reopen. But unless the new management is able to modernise the factory, introduce new products and improve productivity, there will be no future for Kanoria Jute.</p>

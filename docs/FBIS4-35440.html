			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Daniyel Bloch: "No Crisis and No Nothing"] </F>   [Text] Last weekend's press was preoccupied mainly with  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's utterances. Only a few writers  addressed matters of substance. Rabin has never professed to be  the consummate diplomatic speaker Abba Eban is, or the speech  purist that Shim'on Peres is. For better and for worse, one of  his most prominent qualities is the harmony of his mouth with  his heart. He says what he thinks. Literati will define it as  credibility, and it was because of his credibility that he was  elected to his position both in Labor primaries and in the  national elections. He is not going to change in his eighth  decade, and despite all the criticism leveled at him, I have not  detected any strong public nostalgia for his predecessor,  Yitzhaq Shamir, who was not an Abba Eban disciple in the  mysteries of diplomacy either. Likewise, I sense no ardent  longing for the predictable leadership of Binyamin Netanyahu,  and no walls moved at the news of the prospective participation  in the premiership race of Ari'el Sharon, who -- with his  typical tact -- chose the period of memorial days for the fallen  of the Lebanon War, that unnecessary war, to make his  announcement. Another candidate who has announced his  intentions, Refa'el Eytan, is not famous for dainty speech  either.    True, the state comptroller reminded us that a man is as  good  as his style, but the style is affected by the job. Style  required of a judge or a state comptroller is not equal to that  expected from a Knesset member; ministers' and politicians'  style is not expected to emulate that of teachers and rabbis.  In some positions, we expect officials to conform with a  certain style, and if they do not, they should be ousted. In  some elected positions, all we can do is put the elected  official's deeds, misdeeds, and style up for the electors'  scrutiny once every few years.    It is doubtful whether many of the prime minister's  political  supporters disagree with his approach to matters of substance,  with the exception of one. The only matter on which many sense  Rabin went too far in style as well as content was his blatant  criticism of the state comptroller. But do many people think  Netzarim is a genuine settlement, one so important that it must  not be removed at any cost, under any conditions? Does Netzarim  contribute to national security, or is it a burden on the  security forces? Of course, Rabin could have phrased this  sentiment differently, but no refined expression would have  changed the substance. And do many people, including right-wing  supporters, believe the vagrant yeshiva in Jericho's Rachel's  Tomb is important? The fact that Hanan Porat, the national  martyr, sits there rolling his eyes heavenward, bestows no  sanctity or religious significance on the site. Does every  mosaic in Eretz Yisra'el automatically call for a yeshiva and  the deployment of security forces in the defense of every  fanatic drawn to it? Is there such a dearth of yeshivas and  synagogues in the country that holy studies can be held only in  Jericho? And since when is Jericho a holy city, and who has  lifted the ancient ban on it?    The prime minister provided the media, which has to fill  pounds of paper for the weekend press, with topics. But their  alacrity was exaggerated in most cases. It is too soon to mourn  the Rabin government or draw its balance sheet, although it will  mark two years in office in six weeks. It should be said in the  prime minister's credit that so far, he has carried out the main  objective he undertook when he was elected: He has promoted the  peace process. In domestic and economic spheres, insufficient  results of the declared intention to change national priorities  are discernible, but there are signs of improvement in several  fields. There are signs of certain growth and of falling  unemployment. There have been important developments in the  spheres of foreign trade and investment. Serious steps were  made toward infrastructure development. The pace is inadequate,  and more should be done. But bureaucracy gets in the way, and  Treasury officials, the "Fogels" -- one of the prime minister's  most justified verbal coinages -- often act as if the Likud was  still in power, exploiting the finance minister's frequent  preoccupation with other matters.    In the near future, we would expect the prime minister to do  more and to decide on many issues that were delayed during the  negotiations with the Palestinians. We hope he will decide on  the next health minister today. If there is any truth to the  rumors that Rabin's candidate is Efrayim Sne, then it is an  excellent choice, both for the health and the political systems.  The 50-year- old Sne is member of the younger Labor party  generation, and he is undoubtedly an asset in many fields. His  appointment would be a precedent of the right man getting the  right job, and we hope it will bode well for the future. If  Rabin decides to appoint another minister so as to maintain  inner balance, the candidate will be apparently Deputy Foreign  Minister Yosi Beilin, who has made a long way from his "poodle"  days. The choice is undoubtedly difficult, but high-ranking  positions will await the other candidates in a not- too-distant  future. Many would like to see Avraham Burg as Zionist  Federation chairman and Hagay Merom as party secretary general.  In the meantime, the prime minister must decide also on his  nominees for cabinet secretary and media adviser. These key  positions must not be left unmanned for long. Rabin must  highlight his national and partisan leadership with more than  blunt and stern utterances; he must do it by deed -- in Jericho  and Netzarim, as well as in the government complex in Jerusalem  and the Labor headquarters in Tel Aviv.</p>

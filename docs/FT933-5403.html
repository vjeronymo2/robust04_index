			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Banks back on the road AT THE start of the present decade the global banking system looked uncomfortably shaky. A plague of bad debts in real estate was eating away at the profits and capital of financial institutions in North America, Japan, Britain, Scandinavia and Australia. Rescues were multiplying and credit ratings tumbling. Only in continental Europe were banks largely unbothered by plunging asset prices and non-performing loans. Questions were raised about the ability of the banks to finance a global economic recovery. Today the threat looks remote. Profitability, asset quality and credit standing are all on the mend in the English-speaking economies, as a succession of recent results from the banks have underlined. The banking system of Scandinavia, which came close to total collapse, has been stabilised. While pockets of trouble remain, the questions for policymakers are not so much about how to manage financial distress as the avoidance of a repetition. How can the improvement in bank profitability be secured over the longer run? The conventional answer is that governments should maintain a long-term commitment to anti-inflationary policies, while ensuring appropriate prudential supervision and regulation at the micro-economic level. Yet this seems, at first sight, a mildly off-beam response after a disinflationary decade which left the bond markets ready to be convinced that the inflationary tiger had been caged. Moreover, the first attempt at global prudential supervision, in the shape of the Bank for International Settlements' new capital regime, has initially increased the pressure on troubled banks. So what, apart from the normal impact on profits of an economic downturn, was this banking crunch really about? Permanent diminution At one level there was a problem of industry structure. The loss of creditworthy clients to the security markets caused a permanent diminution in asset quality. At the same time deregulation encouraged the remaining corporate and personal clients to raise their borrowings. The banks, meantime, enjoyed new freedom to do business in both product and geographic areas with which they were unfamiliar. The classic instance was the Scandinavian banks' suicidal dash into the UK property market at its peak. Against such a background macro-economic policy shocks were potentially lethal. The switch to money-supply targeting in the US in 1979 played a crucial part in bankrupting savings and loan institutions. Similarly, sterling's entry into the European exchange rate mechanism made a nonsense of the inflationary assumption on which most buyers in the British property markets had taken out their loans. Loose monetary policy in Japan after the Louvre currency agreement caused an unprecedented asset price bubble. Adverse consequences The implicit message is that none of the governments concerned had any clear idea of the potentially adverse consequences of their monetary policies for the banking system - any more than the ERM member countries intentionally set out to bolster banks' currency dealing profits when they embarked on policies that failed to convince the currency markets. There will always be unintended consequences of large policy shifts. Yet monetary authorities have also had their successes, notably in the US where the Fed was quick to recognise the deflationary threat posed by the banking system's troubles and adjusted the structure of interest rates accordingly. One challenge for the central banks now is to find a way of reducing the banks' vulnerability to swings in asset prices. This is most obviously the case with Japan, where cross-holdings of bank equity leave banking capital subject to wild stock market fluctuations. But there is a wider need to find ways of preventing the property market from exerting such a mesmeric attraction on bankers who seek to expand their loan books with minimal effort. But the banks themselves have to recreate a prudential culture capable of withstanding the strains of a more competitive environment. Rescues create moral hazard. If they are not to result in greater fiscal damage in future, bank management must acknowledge a duty to the taxpayer as well as the shareholder.</p>

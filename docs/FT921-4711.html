That's Entertainment Records Classics CDTER 1184 (one CD) UNDER the label 'Sony Broadway', Sony have compiled a new CD series which will provide aficionados of the postwar Broadway musical with hours of happiness. In their role as current proprietors of the CBS archives, the company have put together an enticing mid-price reissue - around Pounds 7 per compact disc - of eight former CBS titles: Bernstein's Candide (1956) and Wonderful Town (1958), Irving Berlin's Miss Liberty (1949), Frank Loesser's The Most Happy Fella (1956), the Jules Styne-Leo Robin Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1949, with Carol Channing), A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1951), Irma la Douce (1960), and On the Twentieth Century (1978). Most of these are in their Original Broadway Cast guise (the Wonderful Town is a 1958 made-for-television version notably inferior to the dazzling original, first issued in this country on Decca). Not all the shows are 'classics', but all are worth hearing. The treasure of the collection, in terms of both work and performance, is undoubtedly Candide; the record, one of the most pleasurable ever made, raises the whole question of style in the execution of musicals, the more so because it returns to CD existence alongside last year's blockbuster DG set of the same work. This, with its all-star cast, mighty-sized LSO and chorus and the composer himself as conductor, was based on those Christmas 1989 Barbican concert performances of unhappy memory, and came out not long after Bernstein's death; for all sorts of obvious reasons it tended to serve, and to be treated, as the Bernstein memorial on records. In my opinion it is a horror almost from start to finish, a monstrous ballooning-out of a work whose abiding fascination lies as much in its operetta-inherited intimacy as in its richness, wit and subtlety of musical and dramatic subject matter. Last year would not have provided the most tactful moment to say so; now, with the dust on the grave of the much-loved and lamented Lenny settled, and with the Broadway original freshly to hand, I feel emboldened to speak out. Where the 1956 principals operate an exact focus, an unforced delicacy of touch on the material itself, using the lines to 'make the case' - listen to the splendid Barbara Cook caressing the words of 'Glitter and be gay', and the great Max Adrian drily snapping out those of 'The Venice Gavotte'] - Bernstein and his mighty cohorts attempt something much more grandiose: a once-and-for-all setting of the seal on Candide as a deathless masterpiece. That they fail so comprehensively in this achievement can, I think, be ascribed to two main causes. The first is that the problems of Candide - a failure in 1956 that was ceaselessly re-jigged and tinkered thereafter, and that now exists in a veritable patchwork quilt of different versions, authentic and otherwise - are inherent in its 'book' (over which Bernstein and its author, Lillian Hellman, joined so fiercely in battle), and are not solved by plumping the work out, as DG have done, with rediscovered numbers. In this work, with its episodic format and one damn thing after another plot-line, shorter is surely better. The second, and far the more important, is that the further the performance style moves from the re-creation of theatrical conditions toward what one might call concert-hall spectacular, the more Bernstein's wonderfully knowing musical mixture of light and serious, bittersweet and schmaltzy, suffers. At the Barbican, orchestra and chorus were enlarged to the point where miking of the soloists became necessary - and thus a grotesque barrier was therefore set up against the process of singer-and-audience communication. Records, of course, avoid the difficulty, but nevertheless the mammoth weight of forces exacts a heavy toll on forward movement; and Bernstein's slow tempos are so often deadening to the spirit of the number in question. Candide under his baton is an Event, not an entertainment; why, late in life, he so badly needed and wanted to practise this perversion on his own work is a question I hope future Bernstein biographers will try to answer. 'Make our garden grow', for instance, is blasted out with killing ponderousness as a poor relation of Mahler's 'Resurrection' finale. Most of the performers take their stylistic lead from the conductor. June Anderson may be an infinitely more polished coloratura canary than Barbara Cook, but she utterly lacks charm. Adolph Green's Pangloss and Nicolai Gedda's Governor and Vanderdendur are word-singing and -speaking disasters.

That's Entertainment Records Classics CDTER 1184 (one CD) The big names in the cast remain, indeed, just that - names, not characters. The exceptions are Christa Ludwig, witty and warm-spirited as the Old Lady, and Jerry Hadley, who brings a McCormack-like sweetness and freshness of personality, a genuine candour to Candide. For them, and for Andrew Porter's elucidation of the work's complicated life-history in a masterly programme note, I shall maintain the DG's place on the library shelf. But it is the original Candide, now on Sony Broadway, that I shall continue to play for pleasure. The month in which Street Scene, Kurt Weill's self-styled 'Broadway opera', makes a triumphant return to the Coliseum is a good one to touch on the two Street Scene recordings issued last year. It is an irony that, after waiting four decades for a first complete recording, lovers of the work should then find themselves debating the merits of two; and a curiosity that both should have the same British staging as their source. The Decca is the Scottish Opera production of 1989, with an admixture of (mostly American) big names in leading roles, the TER is the same production in its pure ENO form. Meriel Dickinson's mesmerising account of the implacable tenement watchdog Mrs Jones is common to both. Unlike in the DG Candide, the relationship of stage to recording remains organic and healthy in both performances. Choice is hard: both possess great strengths and minor weaknesses (British opera-singers valiantly counterfeiting the accents of native and immigrant New Yorkers will trouble some listeners more than others), and both capture the special greatness of the work. My preference, finally, is for the Decca, since its stars - Ramey, Barstow and Hadley above all  - sink themselves into their roles with a compelling combination of dramatic power and directness of expression; and because John Mauceri is so much more theatrical a Street Scene conductor than TER's Carl Davis. But it's by no means unarguable. Miss Barstow, for so many years neglected by the record companies, has also blossomed as an EMI and TER operetta and musical-comedy leading lady. It is an unlikely but by no means an unwelcome development; she has, after all, the needed theatrical panache in vast quantities, and in the EMI Kiss Me, Kate (to which she came as an 11th-hour replacement for Teresa Stratas) her superb musicality and wonderfully individual palette of tone-colours exert a sultry, seductive pull on the phrases of 'So in love'. She does not sound like an opera-diva on a slumming excursion. Neither, mutatis mutandis, does Thomas Hampson as her leading man; and though the work itself comes across as less snappy, smart and sophisticated than remembered, the conductor, John McGlinn, catches the Cole Porter style without inflation. But the really extraordinary Barstow feat is to transform herself, via a fearsome shadow-of-Bow-Bells accent and a rip-roaring snarl in the chest register, into the Nancy of Lionel Bart's Oliver]. The recording is based on the recent National Youth Music Theatre production, with singer-actors and actor-singers excellently mixed and matched. There is an overdose of sugar in the arrangements, by the conductor John Owen Edwards; otherwise, even the most fanatical devotees of Ron Moody, Georgia Brown and the rest of the much-loved 1960 cast originals can be encouraged to investigate the new TER set.</p>

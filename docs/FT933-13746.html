			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Changeable forecasts HOW GALLING it has been, trudging through the puddles of damp and drizzly London this week, to remember that only a fortnight ago the capital was bathed in sunshine at the climax of the first weather-uninterrupted Wimbledon fortnight in more than a decade. Might the current optimism about the pace of economic recovery change as fast? This week's economic news certainly suggests that the rays of economic recovery are warming up. But it is still too early to forecast that the economy is set fair for a sunny August. Forecasters in the US certainly try harder, and often seem to do a better job of forecasting trends in its weather, than UK weather-watchers. The scale of the devastation that floods are currently causing in the US Midwest helps explain why this predictability is important. But the size of the US economy, and the relatively small role played by international trade, also suggest that American economic forecasters should have an easier time than their UK counterparts. Not so. US forecasters remain baffled by the corrugated nature of the recovery and bemused by the failure of some consumers and businesses to rid themselves of excessive debts, while others decline to take advantage of low interest rates. Two weeks ago, figures appeared showing that manufacturing orders and business confidence had fallen sharply, while manufacturing employment was down in June for the fourth successive month. This week, it emerged that retail sales and consumer spending picked up last month, but that industrial production fell by 0.2 per cent in June. UK buoyancy UK economists, by contrast, are buoyant following the news that manufacturing output rose by an unexpected 1.8 per cent in May. Yet the recent US experience cautions against calling a sustained recovery too soon. For while the British economy is, at last, benefiting from levels of interest rates approaching those that the US Federal Reserve was able to deliver from the beginning of the US downturn, UK consumers and businesses remain at least as burdened by debts as their US counterparts. Moreover, recent UK economic indicators remain as erratic as those in the US. The Nationwide building society says house prices rose in June but the Halifax says they fell. New car registrations rose in June, but a recent survey from Gallup and BSL showed that consumers in the south of the country believe their financial position to be deteriorating. The government's narrow monetary aggregate is strong but broad money growth remains depressed. The annual rate of retail price inflation is at its lowest level for nearly 30 years, but average earnings growth in manufacturing remains unsustainably high. Most puzzling has been Britain's labour market. Last month, registered unemployment fell by 8,000, the fifth successive monthly fall and an unprecedented event at this stage of a recovery. In spite of assiduous research, compelling evidence has yet to be found that the government has fiddled the figures. But the Department of Employment also reported that total employment fell in the first quarter of this year, by 25,000 jobs, while manufacturing employment fell a further 15,000 in May. Apparent contradiction One reason for this apparent contradiction is that many people, predominantly women, do not qualify for unemployment benefits and thus simply disappear from official records when they lose their jobs. In an economy with a lot of female, part-time employment, less generous benefits and fewer restrictions on hiring and firing, movements in unemployment rates miss a lot of the action because they do not catch people who move quickly into and out of the labour force. This is why US economists watch more carefully changes in employment than unemployment. The UK is now much more like the US than it was a decade ago in all these indicators of labour market structure. The shifting pattern of UK employment over the past year may also explain why the unemployment rate has been falling this year. Employment dropped by 132,000 in the first half of last year even though the decline in output had already stopped. It then tumbled by a further 477,000 in the second half of last year as the economy was gripped by the trauma of Black Wednesday. But retail sales and output did not follow suit, thus delivering substantial productivity gains to manufacturing employers. One by-product has been that companies feel they can afford to offer smaller workforces ever higher real wages, a practice which cannot continue indefinitely. Employment has since fallen at a sufficiently slow rate to allow the registered unemployment count to follow suit, suggesting that employers may have concluded that the autumn job-shedding went too far. But it would be dangerous to put too much faith in falling unemployment as an indicator of future economic trends. Economic recovery may well be here, but it is worth keeping a close eye on future movements in employment levels.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: SLIMMING DOWN A FETTUCCINE DISH  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: This recipe appeared in a newspaper recently. It's yummy, and we  love it, but a quart of heavy cream? Can you help, please?  </P> <P>  -- LIZ DOERING, Minneapolis, Minn.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TRADEWINDS CHICKEN FETTUCCINE  </P> <P> 2 pounds fettuccine noodles  </P> <P> 4 cups whipping cream  </P> <P> 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped garlic  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons powdered chicken base  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper  </P> <P> 2 cups freshly grated imported Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cubed  </P> <P> 1 ounce butter or margarine  </P> <P> Freshly chopped parsley  </P> <P> Cook noodles according to package directions. Drain and cool.  </P> <P> Reduce cream by 1/4 in saucepan over low heat. While reducing, add garlic,  powdered chicken base and white pepper, stirring occasionally. When reduced,  add cheese slowly while whipping with wire whisk until sauce has consistency of  shake or malt.  </P> <P> Saute chicken meat in butter or margarine in large non-stick saute pan over  high heat. Stir and break up pieces. When outside of chicken is cooked, add  sauce, reduce heat to medium and add noodles. Stir 5 to 10 minutes or until  hot, being careful not to scorch.  </P> <P> Garnish with parsley. Makes 4 to 6 servings.  </P> <P> DEAR LIZ: I agree, a quart of heavy cream is excessive -- and the fat and  cholesterol can be dangerous. There are some other problems with this recipe,  however. When I made it I realized that it yields about 16 cups, which means  that if you are feeding six people, each one would have to eat almost three  cups.  </P> <P> I think a more realistic number of servings for this recipe would be 10 to 12.  You will notice the difference this makes in the bottom-line figures when you  compare the original recipe as figured for six servings and the revised figured  for 12 servings.  </P> <P> Another change you might want to make is to cut the recipe in half unless you  are planning to serve it for company. You might also find that you can make the  recipe without the noodles, then serve it as a sauce over pasta and keep the  unused portion of sauce in the freezer.  </P> <P> I substituted low-fat milk for the cream and eliminated the chicken base  altogether since it contains sodium and MSG. I also reduced the amount of  cheese called for, to help lower the calories and fat, as well as sodium. This  revision will not taste as "fatty" as the original, but the garlic and cheese  flavors will be more predominant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> JEANNE'S CHICKEN FETTUCCINE  </P> <P> 2 pounds fettuccine noodles  </P> <P> 2 1/2 tablespoons corn-oil margarine  </P> <P> 1/2 cup unbleached flour  </P> <P> 2 cups chicken stock  </P> <P> 1 1/4 cups low-fat milk  </P> <P> 5 garlic cloves, chopped  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper  </P> <P> 6 ounces freshly grated imported Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> 1 pound boned and skinned chicken breast halves, cubed  </P> <P> Chopped parsley  </P> <P> Cook noodles according to package directions.

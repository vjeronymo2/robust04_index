			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGARDING THE RAMS: NEXT QUESTION, PLEASE  </P> <P> Why are the Rams so predictably frustrating?  </P> <P> Why is it that, even when they were undefeated they didn't seem like a dominant  team? Why do they always seem to play at the level of their opponent? Why is  John Robinson considered a great motivator when his team lacks intensity?  </P> <P> Why have I been a loyal Rams' fan for 20 years?  </P> <P> CHRIS GRISANTI, Pasadena  </P></p>

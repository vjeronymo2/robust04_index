			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Asked about the PRC Embassy's protest letter in  connection with the meeting between Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai  Wirawan and the Taiwan president, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai  said that the Taiwan president has the right to come to Thailand  because he has not been declared persona non grata. The  government has already explained this issue to China. The prime  minister noted that the meeting between the Taiwan president and  Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan was a personal affair. He  said:    [Begin recording] [Chuan] Trade relations between Thailand  and Taiwan are quite extensive. Taiwan's investment in Thailand  is fairly high; last year it ranked third behind the Japan and  the United States. Trade contacts have not been broken. We  send workers to work in Taiwan.    As far as political relations are concerned, you can see  that  the Taiwan president did not have any official meetings with  Thai political leaders. I did not meet with him.    [Unidentified reporter] What will our reaction be to  Taiwan's  attempt to use this visit for propaganda purposes?    [Chuan] It depends on how we treated the visit. The foreign  minister and I did not have any official meetings with the  president. This issue should come to an end. [end recording]</p>

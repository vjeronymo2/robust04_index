			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 24 (AFP) -- Russia's secret service is  planning to assassinate ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, an aide claimed Friday.    Sergei Abelsev, a member of Zhirinovskiy's Liberal  Democratic  Party, told reporters that according to information he had  gathered "the secret service is preparing an attack against  Zhirinovskiy."    Speaking at the same news conference, Zhirinovskiy denounced  the "campaign of lies and humiliation" against him.    He said the campaign has pushed his party to reassess its  decision to join Russian President Boris Yeltsin's Agreement on  Obtaining Civil Accord in Russia.    The pact, signed in April by some 200 leading Russian  politicians, aimed to establish temporary groundrules to limit  confrontation in domestic politics and stabilize the country.    Signatories to the accord undertook not to call for early  elections, not to amend the new constitution for the time being  and to refrain from violating the constitution in their  political activities.    Zhirinovskiy's party signed the accord after several weeks  of  hesitating.</p>

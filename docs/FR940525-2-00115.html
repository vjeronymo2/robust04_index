			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed Technical Specification changes to delete prescribed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit frequencies and remove the Emergency Plan and Security Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from Technical Specifications are administrative in nature and do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not involve changes to the physical plant or operations. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed changes do not affect systems, structures, or components  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (SSCs) or the operation of these SSCs; and therefore do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III. This change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Technical Specification changes to delete prescribed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit frequencies and remove the Emergency Plan and Security Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from Technical Specifications do not involve any reductions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the margin of safety. The proposed changes will enable more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective resource utilization through performance based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduling of audits in the affected areas. Using performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicators and other measures of program effectiveness, potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems can be more readily identified and audit resources can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be applied to these areas to enhance performance. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance based audit process will maintain or enhance the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> margin of safety in the areas audited. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfied.

The increase would be from every six (6) months to each time the plant is in cold shutdown for a period of 24 hours, unless the test was performed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the previous six months. This change is based on guidance provided in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generic Letter 91&hyph;09, ``Modification Of Surveillance Interval For The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electrical Protective Assemblies In Power Supplies For The Reactor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protection System.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The proposed Technical Specification changes do not involve a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant increase in the probability or consequences of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Reactor Protection System equipment subject to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Specifications changes are not accident initiators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Electrical Protective Assemblies (EPAs) specified by these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed changes are not required to actuate in order to mitigate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an accident. The functional test methodology of the RPS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electrical power monitoring channels will not be effected by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed change in test frequency. The design and function of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the EPAs will not be altered and will perform as originally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A review of the RPS electrical power monitoring relays  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance test history results was performed and supports the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed TS changes to extend the testing interval. Fifty-one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (51) surveillance tests were reviewed, and all the as-found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> channel calibration results were within the required TS limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There were identified deficiencies in four (4) of the fifty-one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests performed, however, these four deficiencies did not affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the operability of the RPS EPAs. Based on good historical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance test results, we have concluded that the reliability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the equipment is not expected to degrade during the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extended test interval. Furthermore, the proposed reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing will result in a net decrease in the probability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurrence of a malfunction of equipment important to safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These malfunctions would cause an invalid inadvertent trip of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RPS which would impose unnecessary challenges on the affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit at power. The guidance set forth in Generic Letter 91&hyph;09  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states ``The staff concludes that the benefit to safety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing the frequency of testing during power operations more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than offsets the risk to safety from relaxing the surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement to test the EPAs during power operation.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the RPS EPAs are not accident initiators, and the design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and function of the equipment will not be affected by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed TS changes, and the reliability of the equipment is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to degrade during the extended test interval, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes would reduce the probability of unnecessary challenges to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the affected unit, we have concluded that the proposed changes do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not involve a significant increase in the probability or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The design and function of the RPS EPAs will not be affected by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed TS changes. The failure modes of the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment will remain unchanged, and no new accident types will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be created. The RPS electrical power monitoring channels'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functional test methodology will not be affected by the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change in test frequency. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on a review of the RPS electrical power monitoring relays  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance test history results we have concluded that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reliability of the equipment is not expected to degrade during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed extended test interval. In addition, the benefit to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety by reducing the frequency of testing during power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation and the attendant possible challenges to safety systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than offsets any risk to safety from relaxing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance requirements to test the EPAs during power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfied.

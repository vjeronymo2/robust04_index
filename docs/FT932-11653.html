			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco and financial services group, will be quizzed about the impact of the US cigarette price wars when reporting its first-quarter results on Wednesday. The decision by US tobacco group Philip Morris to slash prices in April had no impact on BAT's figures to the end of March, which are expected to show pre-tax profits up from Pounds 258m to about Pounds 350m. But the UK group's share price has fallen by 17 per cent since the price cuts started and analysts will be keen to get an update. The results will include a currency gain of about Pounds 30m, but also reflect stronger performance by BAT's insurance subsidiaries, Eagle Star in the UK and Farmers in the US. British Petroleum is expected to show on Thursday a slight decline in its replacement cost profit for the first quarter when compared with the final quarter last year. Nick Antill at Hoare Govett estimates the company will make Pounds 190m compared with Pounds 200m. In the same period last year, the company posted a profit of Pounds 89m. But BP will have done well to keep the result fairly stable when oil prices and refining margins declined leading to a downturn in pre-tax operating profits. This will partly be offset by lower interest and tax charges and a boost from the dollar-sterling exchange rate. Refining margins in Asia improved and chemicals are expected to be no worse than last year. Tate &amp; Lyle is expected to report on Wednesday an increase in interim pre-tax profits of about 15 per cent to Pounds 103m, thanks partly to sterling's devaluation. Royal Bank of Scotland, also reporting interim the same day, is forecast to produce about Pounds 65m pre-tax after bad debt provisions, against Pounds 48m a year earlier. Positive factors include flat costs, rising fee income and widening mortgage spreads. Bank of Scotland, on Thursday, is expected to report flat pre-tax profits for the year ended February of about Pounds 140m. Operating profits will have grown by about 12 per cent but bad debt provisions have risen.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Nikita Vaynonen commentary: "Will Things Be Any Easier for </F> the Reader? The President Is Concerned About the Right to  Information, the Premier About the Newspapers' Survival"]    [Text] The start of the year has been marked by two events  for the mass media. The strike by leading Russian newspapers  seems to have been averted. Journalists had been about to  venture upon this as a forced measure to protest against the  increased cost of printing brought about by the revaluation of  industry's fixed capital. Presidential edicts have been issued  "On Additional Guarantees of the Right of Citizens to  Information" and "On the Judicial Chamber for Information  Disputes Under the Russian Federation President.".    It is impossible not to perceive a certain logic in the fact  that these events coincided. Albeit a paradoxical logic. It is  difficult to make any objection to the revaluation of fixed  capital. It has been brought about by the objective need to  bring its value into line with the ruble's desiccated weight  category. There has long been talk of this, so the government's  decision just cannot be called unexpected. There was more than  enough time to reflect on all its consequences. It was not hard  to foresee that the revaluation of fixed capital would prove  ruinous to those production processes whose output is paid for  by the consumer a long time in advance -- subscriptions to  newspapers and journals represent just such a form of payment.  Consequently, if we do not wish to be deprived of the press, we  must be forearmed: We must provide for tax breaks for  periodicals and subsidies for subscribers, allocating for the  purpose some portion (not even a very considerable portion!) of  the increase that the treasury will receive as a result of the  growth in the capital's value and, thus, the tax on that value.  Nothing of the kind was done, and things turned out once again  as in the proverb: The peasant only bothers to make the sign of  the cross when he hears thunder. It seemed that a compromise  solution had been found at last Thursday's meeting between the  chief editors of leading newspapers and Premier Viktor  Chernomyrdin. A promise was made to think about how to ease the  tax burden for the press, about the participation of journalists  in the flotation of shares in printing plants, and about other  demands made. In the television report on the meeting certain  editors were even heard to say that this was almost the start of  a new epoch in relations between the press and the power. But  such optimism seems somewhat premature.    It probably goes without saying that in planning to strike,  journalists were thinking above all not of themselves but of the  readers -- of the very right of citizens to information which is  the subject of the presidential edict. If the powers that be  strengthen juridical guarantees of that right with one hand  while undermining economic guarantees with the other, this  clearly attests to a lack of coordination in their actions. The  path of free speech is of itself thorny and steep, but must each  step along it really demand that press people have to resort to  extreme measures and superhuman effort? The ink had not had  time to dry on the president's signature on the Edict on  Information Guarantees before journalists started saying that  the edict was unlikely to work. Quite frankly, there are  serious grounds for this skepticism.    The legal norms proclaimed in the edict conform to the most  modern world standards. State organs, organizations,  enterprises, public associations, and officials must conduct  their activity on the principles of information openness. As  the edict explains, this means that any information which is of  public interest or which affects citizens' personal interests  must be accessible to them. The state is obliged systematically  to inform you and me about decisions proposed or adopted, and we  have the right to monitor these decisions if, as the edict  states, they entail "compliance with or protection and defense  of citizens' rights and legitimate interests."    In order for even the very best legal norm to be  implemented, a mechanism is needed for its execution, but the  edict does not contain this. Let us hope that it will appear in  the law on the right to information, which the same edict  entrusts the Legislative Proposals Commission with drawing up.  While this law is being created, there is a perfectly real  danger that the edict could be utilized by no means  beneficially. Who will decide which information "is of public  interest" and consequently must be generally accessible? Who is  authorized to indicate which decisions entail "compliance with  citizens' rights and legitimate interests" and which do not?  Without a clear-cut legal answer to these questions, such  powers will undoubtedly be appropriated by a state official,  i.e. by the person who possesses the information. Having  appropriated them, he will use them in his own interests. You  and I will never learn what he categorizes as being of no public  significance....    It seems to me that the existing Law on the Mass Media  contains a far more sensible legal norm (Article 40): "It is  possible to withhold requested information only if it contains  information which constitutes a state, commercial, or other  secret specially protected by law." The Law on the Mass Media  also provides for a mechanism for exercising the right to  information and penalties for an unsubstantiated refusal to  provide it (Articles 38-41, 47, 58, 61). I believe that  references to these legal norms in the presidential edict would  have sufficed to remove all questions. It is hard to understand  why the drafters of such an important document did not do this.    On the other hand, the Edict on Information Guarantees  rectifies the mistake made at the time of the election campaign  or, to be exact, long before it: Owing to the paucity of  information, chiefly television information, society had a very  poor and largely a distorted idea of the government's policy,  and in the runup to the election this idea was still further  distorted by the false populist propaganda of overt and covert  antireformers. The edict obliges the state television and radio  companies to notify citizens of all legal acts and decisions of  state organs on the day they are issued and to create programs  which explain the activities of the legislature, the executive,  and the judiciary.    To monitor the objectivity of the coverage of these  activities, the other presidential edict sets up the Judicial  Chamber for Information Disputes. I would like to be able to  welcome it, like the first edict, unreservedly. The chamber is  to help the president of Russia in protecting rights and  freedoms in the sphere of mass information, ensure the objective  and reliable nature of reports and the principle of equality in  this sphere, protect the moral interests of children and young  people, observe pluralism of opinions, and even correct factual  mistakes in information reports, but here too there are  questions. The Judicial Chamber is entrusted, inter alia, with  resolving disputes among parliamentary factions over the  distribution of airtime and issuing warnings to editorial boards  which abuse freedom of speech. This requires direct powers.  Although the edict states that the Judicial Chamber "is not  part of the system of Russian Federation federal courts," if you  proceed from the essence of the assignments given it, it will  possess not only judicial but also administrative power, and  also, partly, legislative power, it seems, since it just cannot  manage without drawing up corresponding legal regulations in  order to carry out its functions (for example, to distribute  airtime, ensure equal rights, and resolve disputes). Will it not  turn into something like the notorious oversight council, of  which the former Supreme Soviet used to dream so, only this time  under the Russian Federation president? The boards of guardians  which exist in many countries, representing the interests of  society in television, operate by force of authority, not  imperious command, but the chamber is not free of the risk of  turning into an administrative organ with a censorial bent.  Firm guarantees are needed against such a metamorphosis.</p>

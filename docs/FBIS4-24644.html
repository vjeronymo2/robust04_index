			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 28 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--In order to  strengthen control over market prices and to basically maintain  stable market prices, recently, a person with the State Planning  Commission's Department of Market Prices proposed five measures:    First, regarding commodities such as oil and grain which can  affect the national economy and the people's livelihood, state  control over their prices cannot be lifted and a set of  regulatory and control measures should be drafted to maintain a  balance between total supply and total demand to ensure stable  prices.    Second, make efforts to grasp the "shopping basket" project.  In the last two years, many localities have canceled subsidies  for meat and vegetables. Earnest measures should be taken to  establish protection zones for "shopping basket" projects in  large and medium cities.    Third, comprehensively employ administrative, economic, and  legal means, which should include setting price ceilings,  setting minimum prices as protection, reporting price increases  for the record, issuing permits for the collection of fees,  controlling differences in rates, and establishing a market  prices regulatory fund; building a wholesale market and futures  market; clearing ways for the peasants to go to the cities to  sell their produce directly; changing the system of how prices  are notified; and strengthening price inspections to ensure a  normal price order.    Fourth, promote enterprise reform and increase their ability  to adapt to price reform. The adjustment of basic product  prices has put great pressure on enterprises engaging in the  chemical industry, light industry, and the textile industry, and  these enterprises should improve their absorbing ability through  reform.    Fifth, expedite price-related legislation, oppose excessive  competition, refrain from transferring the powers of the pricing  department, and maintain the stability of pricing institutions  and contingents.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: GWR shares respond to sharp upturn in advertising revenue Bullish transmissions on advertising revenues at GWR, the independent radio group which owns 17 per cent of Classic FM, carried the company's shares 17p higher to 770p yesterday in spite of a declining market. Mr Ralph Bernard, chief executive, said both local and national advertising had improved significantly in the last six months. Like for like advertising revenues in the first quarter were running more than 30 per cent ahead of last year. GWR recently bought four local stations for Pounds 15m, but revenues there were just 5-6 per cent ahead. Mr Bernard said the difference with GWR's existing stations represented 'immediate potential.' The second half improvement in national advertising was partly responsible for the group's announcement of a 26 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 913,000 for the year to September 30. Sales were 14 per cent higher at Pounds 9.8m. The dividend is raised by 2p to 9p, via a final of 5p, with earnings up 16 per cent to 18.4p (15.9p). Mr Bernard said GWR was now reaping the benefits of a decision two years ago to focus on regional advertising, which had been more buoyant during recession. Classic FM, set up a year ago, now attracted some 4.5m listeners. GWR was now looking to expand further in the UK and in eastern Europe. GWR had acquired a 48 per cent interest in a Bulgarian radio station which was already returning small profits. Mr Bernard said that in time this could provide a base for expansion in other parts of eastern Europe.</p>

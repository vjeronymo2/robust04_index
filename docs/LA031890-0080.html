			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIMON IS TRAPPED, TOO  </P> <P> Roger Simon assumes that because a court cannot prove child molestation that  none existed.  </P> <P> We all have heard of our imperfect court system. Known murderers are walking  our streets due to plea-bargaining or suppression of sufficient evidence to win  a prosecution.  </P> <P> Child-molesters are released to continue to molest our children.  </P> <P> It is the parent's moral duty to protect the child. That this could be at odds  with a court decision is unfortunate and, yes, could cause illegal acts.  </P> <P> Simon does not address the dilemma our courts and society are debating  regarding the child-molestation problem. He chose to malign the tragic  characters and thus does us all a disservice.  </P> <P> PATRICIA BUCK, Whittier  </P></p>

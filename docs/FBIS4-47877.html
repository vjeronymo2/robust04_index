			<p>BFN     [Text] Mmabatho May 5 SAPA -- Azanian Peoples' Organisation  [Azapo] founder member, North West premier-elect Popo Molefe,  left the organisation after he reconciled himself with there  being a role for whites in anti-apartheid groupings.    The 42-year old former United Democratic Front general  secretary, is a current African National Congress National  Executive Committee member.    Born in Sophiatown (now Triomf) in Johannesburg in 1952, Mr  Molefe was one of eight children. His mother was a domestic  worker and his father a labourer.    Vivid memories of being taunted by white children in his  earlier life convinced him of the need for change in South  Africa.    He joined the Black Peoples' Convention while still in  school  in 1974 and a year later linked up with the South African  Students' Union.    He first ran into trouble with the police in August 1976  when  he was detained for seven months.    Mr Molefe was a founder member of Azapo and served as Soweto  branch chairman between 1979 and 1980.    But he resigned a year later and assisted in formation of  the  UDF [United Democratic Front] in 1983 as well as sitting on the  Soweto Civic Organistion's executive form 1982-1984.    He was arrested several times in the early 1980s and in 1985  he was accused along with 22 others in the lengthy Delmas  treason trial.    Mr Molefe received a 10-year sentence after the  three-and-a-half year trial, but the sentence was overturned by  the Supreme Court in 1989.    In 1990 he was elected ANC Alexandra branch chairman and ANC  PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] deputy chairman later  in the year.    He was appointed ANC national elections commission chairman  in 1992.    Mr Molefe will presided over an area made up largely of the  former pieces of Bophuthatswana with its casinos and platinum  mines, the goldfields of Western Transvaal and the arid  north-eastern Cape.    Married to Boitumelo Elizabeth Plaatjie, he has four  children.</p>

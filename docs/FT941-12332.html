			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Arts: Star-struck Stockhausen - The Place Music Moving Theatre is a small troupe, formed last year with the blessing of the composer Karl-Heinz Stockhausen. Their prime mover is the dancing clarinettist Ian Stuart; their aim is to devise performances of contemporary music, new or newly adapted, in which the musicians will also be actors and dancers. Their first exhibit is Stockhausen's Tierkreis, which had its London premiere at The Place on Thursday. Tierkreis is a Zodiac cycle of twelve 'melodies', one for each star-sign - originally composed for music-boxes, as deployed in his stage-piece Musik im Bauch. (Some readers will remember that work from the Roundhouse, in its palmy days long ago.) Those 'melodies' were altogether unexpected from Stockhausen: concise and plain but elegantly built, immediately appealing, even haunting, and near-tonal to boot. Soon he made other versions of them for various forces, and MMT has followed his example. Their version, which goes through the Zodiac clockwise from Aquarius and ends where it started, is for dancing clarinet, dancing soprano (Francesca Best) and bearded, firmly seated pianist (Paolo Alvares). In Michael Rolnick's choreography and designs it breathes the air of a pre-Raphaelite idyll, with an occasional whiff of the Isadora Duncans and numerous touches of whimsy. The music holds it all together, and is played and sung with pretty aplomb - even from the floor, supine or prone, or almost upside-down. Tweeness threatens intermittently, but no more than in Stockhausen's own conceptions for solo artists back in the 1970s (stylised mime in Harlequin costumes and the like). MMT looks entirely faithful to that spirit. Some viewer-hearers will find that the visual titivations make a charming foil for the music, which on its own might seem too small and special for pure concert-performance. Others, perhaps, will want to pelt the performers with boiled sweets from quite early on, until they have to flee the stage. I plead critical detachment - but the star-sign 'melodies' do have a curious magic about them, and at 40-odd minutes Stockhausen's cycle comes nowhere near outstaying its welcome.</p>

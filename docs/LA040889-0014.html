			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERE'S ONE VOTE FOR CONSISTENCY  </P> <P> I couldn't help but notice that two readers wrote that Pete Rose should be  inducted into Baseball's Hall of Fame regardless of whether he bet on baseball  games.  </P> <P> Where were those letter writers 70 years ago when Joe Jackson needed them?  Jackson batted .356 in his career and makes Rose look like a bush leaguer. Yet  he and seven Chicago White Sox teammates got lifetime banishments for fixing  the 1919 World Series -- ironically, against Cincinnati.  </P> <P> Jackson hit .375 in the Series he was supposedly trying to lose.  </P> <P> Rose, yes, no question; but Jackson, no way? With such a confused moral  position, is it any wonder Steve Garvey and Wade Boggs are in such a mess?  </P> <P> RICHARD BLUE  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

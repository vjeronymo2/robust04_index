			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Letter: Competition in telecommunications Hugo Dixon's 'A Failed Connection' (May 8) is an excellent resume of the apparent stalemate, vis-a-vis the government's white paper on telecommunications deregulation in the UK, and the subsequent 'flurry of inactivity' since its publication. Perhaps, despite its stated policy of introducing competition, the government is dragging its feet to safeguard the value of its shareholding in BT. The point is that if any real competition is to be encouraged to provide alternate telecommunication networks, and thereby provide choice to the customers, then problems associated with access connection charges must be resolved at the earliest opportunity and not by any interim solution until 1993. The local networks around towns and cities were already in place before BT was privatised and, while some may be in need of replacement now and in the future, the cost of new network cabling should not have to be borne entirely by the alternative service network operators as currently appears to be suggested. Therefore, any charge for connection to BT local networks should be restricted to a conveyance fee only. One must question whether government really is committed to providing telecommunication network customers with choice. Kenneth P Armitage, 29 Stoneham Close, Petersfield, Hants.</p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Rob Lowe, once facing possible charges for allegedly videotaping a 16-year-old  girl performing a sex act last year, says he could be "the poster boy for bad  judgment" but that his ethical code hasn't changed. "No, because there was  never anything wrong with my ethics," said Lowe, interviewed in Los Angeles by  correspondent Jim Brown for a segment to air Wednesday on NBC's "Today" show.  It was one of the young actor's first interviews on the much-publicized taping  incident in an Atlanta hotel during last summer's Democratic National  Convention. He previously had declined to comment on the matter. In a  settlement worked out last month with Atlanta authorities, Lowe, to avoid a  possible criminal charge of sexual exploitation of a minor, agreed to work for  20 hours with disadvantaged youths in Los Angeles. A transcript of the  interview, made on the set of his new movie "Bad Influence," was made available  Monday by NBC. In the segment, Lowe didn't directly refer to the taping  incident, saying only that "I'm a man and I stand up to the mistakes I made.  That's part of what being a man is. I made a mistake. "Thing is," he added, "I  knew it immediately after making the mistake." He referred, although not  specifically, to a civil suit still pending against him in Atlanta filed by the  mother of the teen-ager in the alleged taping, claiming that Lowe seduced her  daughter. The actor also was asked about stories claiming that after the  Atlanta incident he destroyed a videotape library of what correspondent Brown  called, without elaboration, "previous encounters." "That definitely is a  falsehood," Lowe said. "I mean, I've read it all. I've read that I had raids on  my house. I've truly heard it all and . . . I tell you something: It hurts me  and it hurts my family, and these innuendoes are just no fun. No fun." Claudia  Puig  </P></p>

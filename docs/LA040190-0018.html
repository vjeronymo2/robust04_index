			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CINEMA MESSAGES  </P> <P> "Born on the Fourth of July" is one of those films that left-wing Hollywood and  the media rave about, but it boils down to just another anti-American movie.  </P> <P> Oliver Stone portrays his "hero" as the only decent or intelligent American  soldier and presents Ron Kovic as somehow admirable because he turns against  America and our ally.  </P> <P> If Hollywood ever wants to get truthful about Vietnam, it should do a movie  about heroic Americans such as double amputee B.T. Collins, paraplegic Max  Cleland, the Medal of Honor recipients, any of the 570,000 Vietnam veterans in  the Veterans of Foreign Wars or any of the 90% of Vietnam veterans who answered  yes to the 1980 Lou Harris poll asking, "Are you proud of your service in the  Vietnam War?"  </P> <P> It is revealing that at the movie's end, for any viewers who missed the  political point, Stone and Kovic dedicate the film to one of the flakiest of  protesters, the late Abbie Hoffman.  </P> <P> PETE LAURENCE  </P> <P> Vietnam Green Beret  </P> <P> Clayton, Calif.  </P></p>

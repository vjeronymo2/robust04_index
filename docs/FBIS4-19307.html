			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cabinet formally adopted the treaty of  accession to the European Union [EU] today. For this reason,  the Austrian Government met for a special session in the early  morning. The special session made it possible for the EU treaty  to be passed on to parliament without delay and thus all  deadlines for the referendum on 12 June can be adhered to as  planned.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Spices Last year saw the peak in overall pepper production which was boosted after record prices in 1987, reports Man-producten. Pepper vines have a start-up period of about four years and once mature it is difficult to shut them down. However, reduced fertilisation is likely to result in smaller crops in 1992. Once global stocks become manageable, prices will increase. Nutmegs - unchanged, with somewhat firmer undertone for the better grades. Cassia - arrivals are beginning to accumulate in New York. Cloves, pimento, ginger - markets quiet.</p>

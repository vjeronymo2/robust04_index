			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Books: Little profundity to 'Plum' PG WODEHOUSE: MAN AND MYTH by Barry Phelps Constable, Pounds 16.95 344 pages CURRENCY fluctuations ruin the most predictable futures. At Dulwich College, young PG Wodehouse wrote Latin prose and Greek verse with exceptional facility. A scholarship at Oxford was the obvious progression. But it was scuppered by rates of exchange: Wodehouse Senior had taken a pension paid in rupees, and the rupee failed to clear the fence of Oxford fees. 'Watch the rupee]' was, apparently, the prelude to any expenditure in the Wodehouse home; and although the diversion from Oxford into the Honkong and Shanghai Bank does not seem to have thwarted PG, the cause of the diversion - a straightforward case of impecuniousness - haunted him for the rest of his life. He was a millionaire several times over when he died, at last Sir Pelham Grenville, in 1975; and it is fair to say that money was the main interest of his life. He pretended otherwise, of course. But the sordid topic of coin was prominent in all his dealings with publishers, theatrical collaborators, family and friends. He was a tough negotiator with the former and immensely generous to the latter. That failure to reach Oxford was swallowed with an astonishing lack of self pity (later, Oxford would partly compensate with an honorary degree, to salute his status as auctor magicus): but it gave motive to his drive to work almost continually in order to redeem the honour lost on account of the feeble rupee. This is an important side of Wodehouse, and worth the stress given to it in this new biography. But despite the subtitle, Barry Phelps has not produced a serious piece of demythologising. The subject is 'Plum' or 'The Master' throughout. The usual apologetics are given for the wartime broadcasts; the usual broadsides delivered against those (Sean O'Casey, FR Leavis) who dared question the literary value of Wodehouse. We have a nice vignette of the elderly Hilaire Belloc, in a mouse-nibbled dressing gown, reading some choice Wodehouse phrase and exclaiming, 'Admirable] Admirable]'. And would-be critics are regularly silenced by the citation of book sales and continued influence. Can millions of contented readers be wrong? As partial to a dose of Jeeves and Wooster as anyone, I hesitate to join the tiny claque of Wodehouse detractors. But it has to be said: a better knowledge of the man's life does not extend one's enjoyment of his work. It is not that his sex life was negligible; nor that he suffered no vicissitudes (to be packed into a cattle train across Europe and incarcerated in a lunatic asylum in Upper Silesia, at sixty, surely qualifies as a major vicissitude). No: it is just that he was, as far as one can tell from all testimonies of his biographers, a facile man. His range of emotional response was restricted to a fault. Even those who are quoted as substantial buttresses of the Wodehouse achievement must see this. Evelyn Waugh was one such buttress: but Evelyn Waugh also provides a measure of the literary shortcomings of PG Wodehouse. There is nothing in Wodehouse quite so comic as the first part of Waugh's trilogy, Sword of Honour; there is nothing at all in Wodehouse which comes close to matching the depth and plangency of Brideshead Revisited. However much enjoyment Wodehouse may have given Waugh, the two writers are not to be bracketed together. Wodehouse may not have been a 'performing flea', but to hail his capacity as 'almost Shakespearean' is pure nonsense. No one doubts the technical calibre of PG Wodehouse in expressing himself. One simply wishes that he would express himself more profoundly. Just what did 'The Master' make of the loss of his 'beloved' stepdaughter Leonora? How could he forgive the man who attacked him so spitefully on the BBC? The way in which he reacted to the privations of his arrest by the Nazis can be partly explained as the defence mechanism of the public schoolboy who creates a microcosm of institutional security wherever he is (buckles down in the prison camp and makes a cricket ball from a mass of rubber bands; gets the games going). But only partly. Either Wodehouse was not properly wounded by appalling events, or else he kept quiet about them. This book does not illuminate. The absence of any moral asperity in Wodehouse's life remains conspicuous. It is a monotone of bland good-nature, which prevails even when satirising Mosley's blackshirts as Spode's fools in footer bags. The only people to have ever aroused anything approaching savage indignation in Wodehouse appear to have been the British and American tax-collectors. So there we are: back to the lolly again. It would be perverse to criticise Wodehouse for liking lots of it; and it may seem equally perverse to complain of his imperturbable good-naturedness. He resists such detraction: as Compton Mackenzie put it, criticising Wodehouse is about as graceful as taking a spade to a souffle. I only murmur a note of dissent. Otherwise, I love the man still. No book about him can be a bad book.</p>

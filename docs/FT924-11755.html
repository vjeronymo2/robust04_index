			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Arts: Lorenz and Most deliver the unexpected - Concerts Misled about the starting-time of his recital, I missed Siegfried Lorenz's opening Schubert Lieder on Wednesday. That was a great pity, as his Hugo Wolf and his Schumann soon demonstrated - and a pair of Schubert encores finally confirmed. This was his London recital debut, which is quite inexplicable: there have been admiring reports of his singing for at least 15 years; has Somebody here has been asleep. On the platform, this baritone does not cut a romantic figure. He has the charisma of an assistant bank manager who is going out of his way to be friendly; or in narrative, comic or ironic songs, of a jolly uncle eager to act everything out for the children. But he delivers his songs like a self-effacing master - almost a pedagogical model, but escaping that chilly stamp by virtue of a warmly appealing, human timbre. In fact the Lorenz voice is capable of great imaginative variety; but it took a special effort to notice it, so discreetly was all that art put to the service of the texts and the music. The nearest comparison is with the tenor Peter Schreier, a regular Lorenz partner: searching attention to the lyrics, marvellously communicative, unforced diction, an iron determination to winkle out everything in the music that serves the sense - but never to fake up something more. In a programme of first-water songs like these (Morike Lieder by Wolf, Schumann's op. 24 Liederkreis after Heine), anything more would be superfluous. There was no illusion of inspired spontaneity, but none of his songs required that extra spice. Not, at least, from the singer; but Wolf's 'Storchenbotschaft', a delectable cartoon of a shepherd receiving the glad news from a pair of storks that his girlfriend has given birth - unfortunately, however, to twins - deserved a far more fluent, exuberant waltz-postlude than Iain Burnside gave it. Burnside is the Artistic Director of this South Bank song-series, and an accompanist of great but uneven promise. This was one of his uneven evenings. He could be soberly rapt in Wolf's great insomnia-to-benediction 'In der Fruhe', and he dealt astutely with the piano-parts of the most familiar songs. Elsewhere he seemed to be feeling his way still. In Schumann's visionary epilogues he was always prickly and self-conscious. For Lorenz's deceptively 'natural', direct manner, he was not a natural partner. In the Festival Hall, Franz Welser-Most conducted an ingenious programme with the London Philharmonic on Tuesday. Each half offered a big work by a composer in his young maturity (Brahms and Bartok), preceded respectively by an earlier novice piece for only strings (Rossini at 12) and another for winds alone (Richard Strauss at 17). The LPO strings found a proper Rossinian verve for his C major 'String Sonata'. Though the transcription from the original four-player score never sounds convincingly orchestral, the individual string-sections made a good, muscular fist of their 'solo' flights. Strauss's op. 7 Serenade - for 13 players, like Mozart's divine B-flat Serenade - was gracious and subtly shaded, but any temptation to rollick was firmly repressed: not much hint of the later, unbuttoned Strauss got through. I had always thought that the appeal of this Serenade lay in just that. The D minor Piano Concerto of Brahms found Radu Lupu plainly off-form. Welser-Most led off in fine, stormy style. The piano's late entry, with that worried tune in restless sixths, may be a nervy new voice, or a secretive contrast - but Ludu made it nothing in particular. Though this work ought to be ideal Lupu territory, he was strangely backward about fixing any consistent character in it. Some transitions were roughly assertive where a natural reading would seem to ask for tapering-down, and others vice versa. Bartok's Miraculous Mandarin was performed complete, with the eerie choral voices (the LPO's Choir) toward the end. Obviously well-prepared and brightly coloured, it sounded more like a straight ballet-score - an uncommonly violent one, of course - than a baleful symphonic vision, as in the famous Boulez reading. For the subcutaneous 'seduction' scenes, the solo clarinet was less than sexy. As a whole, nevertheless, Mandarin made a high-profile impression where the Brahms had seemed fitful and bitty: exactly what one had not expected.</p>

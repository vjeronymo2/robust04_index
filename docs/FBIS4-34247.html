			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Emile Jonassaint,  provisional president of Haiti, today said that presidential and  legislative elections would provide the only way out of the  crisis that has existed in the country since September 1991,  when constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was deposed.    In a message released to foreign reporters in Haiti,  Jonassaint, who was placed in his post by the military in May,  added that the international community is seeking to launch "an  adventure in Haiti similar to the one launched by Pol Pot in  Cambodia."    In this way, the Haitian leader was referring to the embargo  decreed by the United Nations, which is designed to force the  Haitian military to leave power and fulfill the agreements  signed with Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown by a  group of military leaders headed by General Raoul Cedras, chief  of the Armed Forces. In his message to foreign reporters, the  de facto president did not mention Aristide.    On Wednesday, the Haitian Army staged parades in  Port-au-Prince and in the provinces in support of Gen. Cedras.  The parades were staged at a time when, according to sources  close to the Haitian military, differences are beginning to  emerge within the Army command.    On Tuesday, differences were noted following statements by  Evans Francois, who requested Gen. Cedras' resignation. Evans  Francois is the brother and adviser of Police Chief Joseph  Michel Francois. Evans Francois accused Cedras of being  responsible for the crisis that exists in Haiti and of heading a  "triumvirate" under the guise of Emile Jonassaint, a judge  supported by the military to hold the post of chief of state and  government.    Although the Haitian police chief has denied any connection  to his brother's remarks, telling the public and the Army that  he does not support his brother's views, sources close to the  military told EFE: "There are a number of large differences."  The sources added: "There is a group demanding a way out,  arguing that the status quo cannot continue much longer and  demanding an honorable way out for the Army."</p>

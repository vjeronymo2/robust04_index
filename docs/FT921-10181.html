			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Volcker may advise Russiaon reforms of economy MR PAUL VOLCKER, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, is considering an offer to serve as an adviser to the Russian government on economic and banking reform. The 64-year-old Mr Volcker, who was chairman of the Federal Reserve between 1979 and 1987, left Moscow on Wednesday after extensive talks with Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, and other members of the reform group. Speaking from Princeton, New Jersey, where he teaches part-time, Mr Volcker confirmed yesterday that he had discussed the possibility of advising the Russian government, but had not concluded an agreement. He said he spent 36 hours in Moscow and called the issue of whether he becomes an adviser 'very much open'. 'We discussed whether and to what extent it would make sense for me to go back and give them some advice. I am considering to what degree it seems useful,' Mr Volcker said. He added that if he were to become an adviser to the Russian government it would be on a part-time basis. In his Moscow meetings with Mr Gaidar and with Mr Georgy Matiukhin, chairman of the Russian Central Bank, Mr Volcker discussed several topics on which he might provide advice. These included the banking system, currency arrangements between the republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States and Moscow's relations with the International Monetary Fund. A team from the IMF is due to arrive in Moscow at the weekend to conduct detailed negotiations over the next three weeks with the Russian government on the terms of Russia's entry into the IMF. These negotiations are of critical importance to the government, which is looking for a seal of approval for its programme and policies. This is necessary to attract international support. The recommendations of the IMF team will go to the IMF board in March or early April. Approval from the board could lead to the granting of substantial western aid to stabilise the rouble and to support imports - aid which the Russian government has set at around Dollars 17bn (Pounds 9bn). Both Mr Gaidar and Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime ministers with responsibility for the economy and social affairs, have in the past week indicated that the budget would be under intense strain because of parliament's decision to cut the rate of value added tax on some commodities and to increase spending on social services. The IMF team will need to be reassured that the government has control of the budget and of monetary policy before approval is forthcoming. However, the government has gained a better understanding with the Russian Central Bank and believes it has sharply reduced credit and money emission. The acquisition of Mr Volcker would lend support and prestige to the Russian economic team. As an adviser Mr Volcker would be able to speak as banker to banker with Mr Matiukhin of the Russian Central Bank, and thus to smooth over present and potential conflicts. His advice on what he called Moscow's 'interfacing' with the IMF would be useful, given his experience in co-ordinating the handling of international sovereign debt issues such as the 1982 Mexican debt crisis by the US Federal Reserve and the IMF. He would work alongside other advisers to the Russian government - Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, Professor Richard Layard of the London School of Economics and Professor Anders Aslund of the Stockholm Centre for Research into East European and Soviet Economies. Since leaving the Federal Reserve Board, Mr Volcker has divided his time between teaching at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and serving as chairman of James D. Wolfensohn, a New York investment bank. Yeltsin raises spectre of dictatorship, Page 2 Back into the public arena, Page 12</p>

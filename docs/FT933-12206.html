			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Senior Kenyan bankers quizzed SEVERAL senior officials of Kenya's central bank are being questioned by police following a crackdown on corruption launched by Mr Musalia Mudavadi, the finance minister. Nairobi newspapers quoted the director of criminal investigations, Mr Noah arap Too, as saying: 'Investigations are on and a number of those bank officials are being questioned.' Following the resignation of the central bank governor, Mr Eric Kotut, on Friday, Mr Mudavadi announced that 'intensive investigations' were being conducted within the institution and other local banks. 'Prosecution of all persons involved in malpractices will follow,' he said. Mr Kotut was firm in his own defence, denying at the weekend that he had been responsible for bad management. 'I have never in my entire service been associated with any malpractice or dishonesty,' he said. Last Friday, Mr Mudavadi withdrew the licence of Pan African Bank, the second local bank to be closed within a week. Exchange Bank, alleged to have been involved in forgery of export receipts to claim export rebates from the government, was shut last Tuesday. It is contesting the order. Mr Mudavadi said the government would seek to recover interest owed to the central bank relating to interbank transactions and defaults in foreign exchange operations. The minister's efforts to clean up the financial system strikes at the heart of Kenya's system of political patronage. International Monetary Fund officials, who have visited Kenya four times in as many months, have insisted that action be taken as a pre-condition for the resumption of balance of payments assistance, suspended in November 1991.</p>

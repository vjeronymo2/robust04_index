			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investments - Portugal (9): Fragile but promising - David Waller on the stock market's development SINCE THE mid-eighties, the Portuguese stock market has been through an exaggerated surge of business and endured a severe collapse. Only now, with a package of reforms due to be put in place this summer, are optimistic observers saying the market has calmed down after the excesses of the past half-decade. Six years ago, the market barely existed. There was a stock exchange, but volume was minuscule and there had not been a rights issue since before the 1974 revolution. All this changed in 1985-1986. The minority Social Democrat government stimulated business confidence. Portugal joined the European Community. A bull market was born. 'The market took off in 1985-86 and carried on rising until October 1987,' says Joao Rendeiro, managing director of Gestifundo, a Lisbon-based securities house. 'In the run-up to the election in June 87 there was incredible euphoria. In other countries, the bull market took 10 years to build up. Here the whole process was concertinaed into just six months.' From 1983 to 1987, the number of quoted companies rose from 41 to 176; the value of share transactions rose from Esc 5.7bn (Dollars 39m) to Esc 282.4bn. The total value of securities issued on the capital markets soared. The Banco Totta e Acores (BTA) index began 1987 at 1,220, rose to a peak of 6,812 just before the crash, but fell back to 2,990 by the end of the year. If it took a relatively short time for Portugal to enjoy a bull market, it has taken correspondingly longer for the market to revive after the crash. There have been two serious attempts at rallies, but the index ended last year at 2143.4, a fall of 34.6 per cent in local currency terms over 1990 and still well below its level at the end of 1987. 'After the crash Portuguese investors sold in panic like anywhere else,' says Mr Rendeiro, 'but all the weaknesses of a fragile infrastructure came to the forefront dramatically. There was a huge shift in sentiment and for more than a year afterwards the market continued to sink downwards as investors tried to come to grips with the mess left by October 1987.' The post-crash problems have been psychological and structural. Psychological, because local investors had their fingers severely burned in October 1987 and thereafter proved reluctant to get into the market. Structural, because of an antiquated settlement system and a lack of liquidity in the majority of stocks, which has discouraged all but the bravest of foreign investors. Although the number of companies quoted on the exchanges of Lisbon and Oporto rose from 135 to 182 between 1987 and 1990, the bulk of activity is concentrated on a dozen liquid stocks. Just 10 stocks - including Soporcel (a pulp and paper company), Sonae (an industrial holdings company), Radio Marconi Portuguesa (telecommunications), Banco Comercial Portugues, and Banco Portugues de Investimento accounted for 52 per cent of the market's capitalisation at the end of 1990, while trading in these shares invariably accounts for most of the average daily Dollars 5-Dollars 6m turnover. In January this year, the government finally approved a package of reforms meant to remedy some of the structural defects of the market. The main features are: The setting up of a Securities &amp; Exchange Commission as the main regulatory and supervisory body; The privatisation and unification of the markets in Lisbon and Oporto. The two trading floors will remain but in future each will be managed by an association of local brokers and dealers who will be responsible for setting up an investors' compensation scheme; The creation of a central depository and settlement system; The implementation of a new paperless trading system, at first only for the blue-chips, eventually for the market as a whole, giving investors continuous stock prices; and rules and penalties on insider dealing, takeovers and mergers; share manipulation and disclosure rules. The package will be implemented in June at the earliest; preliminary reforms were introduced earlier this year (when the two exchanges introduced a second daily price-fixing for the most liquid stocks) and at the beginning of this month when a new partially computerised trading system was introduced in Lisbon. 'The initial impact of the stock market reform is difficult to assess,' says Mari Vargas, a London-based analyst at BNP Securities, 'but it should bring greater efficiency and liquidity to stock exchange transactions for the benefit of investors. 'Costs are also expected to go down . . . and the major foreign institutional investors, including the Americans, that have been reluctant to face the difficult trading conditions should reconsider their investment decisions.' Foreign investors, while accounting for much of the turnover, and owning 15 per cent of the market by market capitalisation (at the end of September 1990), were net sellers in the fourth quarter of 1990. The market's recovery in the first months of this year - up from 1986 at its lowest point in mid-January to 2515 - is thought to be driven by domestic investors awash with cash because of the delayed privatisation programme. A revival of this programme in the months ahead will soak up that demand and is likely to tempt back foreign investors who have traditionally been keen on new issues. As the early privatisations will be banks and insurance companies, the market's heavy skewing towards financial services will be exacerbated: large sectors of the economy such as property and tourism are under-represented, while banks alone accounted for 39 per cent of the market's capitalisation at the end of last year. The Portuguese market is the EC's smallest stock market and last year was the worst performer. But it gives investors the opportunity to invest in a small but dynamic economy. Thus, if the market is still fragile, it certainly has potential - 'for the first time in five years, stocks and p/e ratios are in line with international standards,' says Mr Rendeiro. 'Prices react to events and information in a normal way. For the first time we begin to have a real market.'</p>

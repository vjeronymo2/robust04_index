			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: A ROOM WITH A VIEW BY E. M. FORSTER (VINTAGE: $7.95)  </P> <P> Readers will be surprised to discover how much of the dialogue in the  Merchant-Ivory film was taken directly from the text of E. M. Forster's most  approachable and humorous novel. As in his more serious works, Forster uses the  actions of his characters to present his views on socio-political issues, in  this case a strong endorsement of the nascent feminist movement. Lucy  Honeychurch's refusal to marry the supercilious Cecil Vyse is more a  declaration of her independence and of her loyalty to her family than a  expression of her love for the brooding George Emerson. The ideal book to read  with a pot of Earl Grey tea and a plate of scones.  </P></p>

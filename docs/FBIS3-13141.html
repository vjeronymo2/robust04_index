For  one thing, worldwide condemnation of the massacre has not been  such as to lead one to conclude that the Middle East peace  process will go forward or that the Palestinian side has  improved its bargaining position at the negotiating table. For  another, the enormity and monstrosity of the massacre can only  reinforce the image the world has of the odious nature of  occupation. Which means that true salvation for the Palestinian  people and the path to true peace in the region lie in a total  Israeli evacuation of the Palestinian territory. We need to  come up with the proper response to the massacre, and, since its  political reverberations are still developing, their nature and  scale will be determined by the mechanisms employed by both  sides of the conflict and the skill with which they are used.    If the enemy government seeks to assuage resentment and  return things to where they were before the massacre, in order  to escape the concessions expected of it as a price for this  abominable crime, then the PLO must embark upon a vigorous drive  to restate the truths the odious occupation has brought into  sharp focus; namely that true peace in the region is an  impossibility without a complete Israeli withdrawal and  guarantees for the freedom and independence of the Palestinian  people. While this is not the first massacre committed against  the Palestinian people during their conflict with Israel, it  marks a first in terms of scale and ugliness. It was committed  against the background of a negotiating process that pushed the  ugly face of occupation into the background and presented  decisionmakers and public opinion around the world with the  appearance of a thriving future peace. In other words, the  negotiating process supplanted the true picture of occupation  with good wishes and grand dreams that could not realistically  come true without potent pressure being brought to bear on the  occupying power. If that pressure has not been forthcoming it  is because the Israeli occupation has not been perceived to be  that much of a threat to the lives, security, and future of the  Palestinian people.    The Ibrahimi Mosque atrocity has debunked these illusions  and  sent the message that peace and occupation do not mix. We must  think of a response to the massacre less in the manner of an act  of retribution and more in line with a comprehensive policy.  This is because any purely retaliatory act will hardly strike  at the heart of occupation. Nor should our retaliation be  restricted to one domain. We must invest the political  dividends of the massacre at the negotiating table while  providing a direct answer by spilling Israeli blood through a  systematic intensification of the armed struggle against those  who bear direct responsibility for the massacre -- the Kach  movement's gangsters and occupation troops. This is to  underscore resistance and the ongoing intifadah as legitimate  rights as our people strive to wrest their freedom and  independence. In other words, we must engage the enemy in a  multifaceted battle until it is defeated and all forms of its  presence on our land and the dark era of occupation are  eliminated once and for all. These are inexorable  eventualities. Revolution until victory.</p>

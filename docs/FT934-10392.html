			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Volvo chairman confident of allaying merger fears MR PEHR Gyllenhammar, the chairman of Volvo, insisted yesterday that the chances were 'very good' of overcoming shareholder resistance to the proposed merger of the Swedish group's car and truck operations with France's Renault. He said he took seriously the criticism in Sweden of his role in the affair. He intends to stay on as chairman and retain his designated role as head of the supervisory board of the merged company until it has achieved 'a successful departure'. One of Mr Gyllenhammar's toughest critics, the small shareholders' association Aktiespararna, yesterday called on Volvo to drop the merger plan. Its opposition was instrumental in forcing Volvo's decision last week to postpone until December 7 a vote on the deal by its shareholders. But Mr Gyllenhammar said, in an interview with the Financial Times, that the company was optimistic about overcoming shareholder objections, which focus on the lack of information on the value of the merger, the timetable for Renault's privatisation and the French government's plans to hold a golden share in the merged company. 'We find very little opposition to the industrial logic. We find very few who don't believe we can make more money for shareholders together than separately. If we can address these other concerns - give more clarification, perhaps get positive news on privatisation - then we think the chance is very good.' Mr Gyllenhammar said Volvo was seeking help from Paris on the golden share matter, in spite of French insistence that it is non-negotiable. Swedish shareholders are alarmed that the terms could mean Volvo being forced to lower its proposed 35 per cent share in the merged company to 20 per cent. 'We are trying to get an interpretation or assurances that it would only be applied under certain circumstances.' The Volvo chief, who has headed the company for 22 years, cheerfully admitted that 'many people dislike me'. He has said he will drop all executive roles at Volvo from next year, but he was unhesitating in saying he wanted to stay on as chairman. Background, Page 27</p>

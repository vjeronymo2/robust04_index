			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Emap 12% ahead at Pounds 16.6m - Gradual improvement in advertising revenues apparent Emap, the publishing and exhibitions group, yesterday gave its most optimistic assessment of the state of the advertising market for three years as it announced a 12 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 16.6m. Mr Graham Ross Russell, the chairman, warned that the immediate outlook for profits growth would depend on the strength and timing of the general economic recovery. He added, however: 'We are beginning to see for the first time in three years a gradual improvement in advertising revenue in some areas.' Newspaper situations vacant advertising, for example, was up and this month actually jumped by 25 per cent to 30 per cent while advertising in business titles covering broadcasting and the media was forging ahead. Other business titles, particularly those linked to the construction industry, were showing no such signs of growth. The 12 per cent growth in pre-tax profits in the six months to October 2 and the qualified optimism about the future of the advertising market helped boost Emap's share price by 10p to 355p. Ms Katherine Pelly, media analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson, last night said she was looking for pre-tax profits of Pounds 46m for the full year giving earnings of 17.8p per share. Emap's figures include the cost of investment in launches of Pounds 4.9m this time compared with Pounds 2.1m in the same period last year. Earnings per share, adjusted for non-operating exceptional items, rose 13 per cent from 5.4p to 6.1p. The interim dividend is increased by 8 per cent to 2.25p. Mr Robin Miller, chief executive, conceded yesterday that all of Emap's titles would feel the pressure if the government decided to put VAT at a rate of 17.5 per cent on all publications. However, because the 'vast majority' of the group's titles were market leaders 'in relation to our competitors I have no fears'. The most dramatic change came in business publishing where operating profit rose by Pounds 1m to Pounds 2.8m on turnover up 42 per cent. More than half the improvement came from the acquisitions of Thomson business titles which helped to improve margins from 4.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Operating profits of consumer magazines rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 11.1m, newspaper profits were virtually constant at Pounds 4.6m while commercial radio was up 33 per cent to Pounds 400,000. First half losses in Emap's exhibitions business increased from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 1.6m but the company remains committed to the exhibitions business although closer links between exhibitions and business magazines are expected in future.

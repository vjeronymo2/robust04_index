			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Clarke lifts rates to reassure City: Major resists pressure to readmit Tory rebels in wake of defeat over VAT on fuel Chancellor seeks ways to fund Pounds 1bn shortfall Mr John Major's government moved swiftly yesterday to retain the confidence of financial markets in the wake of its latest political crisis by raising interest rates 0.5 points to 6.25 per cent. The rise came ahead of an announcement today by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, of a package of spending cuts and possible tax rises to fill the Pounds 1bn gap left by the enforced scrapping of the second stage of value added tax on domestic fuel. In an apparent olive branch to his party's right wing after the recent Tory infighting over Europe, the prime minister hinted at a possible referendum on European integration. Moves towards a single European currency would represent a 'very significant decision', he said. Speaking on Channel Four news, he insisted that a referendum could not be used as a tactical device, but added: 'I have not ruled out a referendum but it is a long way away.' Amid undisguised jubilation in the opposition parties at the government's humiliation on Tuesday night, Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, said the Commons defeat marked 'a decisive turn in the political tide'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the government's position was now irrecoverable. Mr Major shrugged off suggestions that his government had lost its authority and dismissed speculation that his leadership was under threat. However, he implicitly acknowledged that the government might not be able to see out its full parliamentary term to mid-1997. But as the government struggled to contain the political fall-out from its most significant Commons defeat during 15 years in office, there were new divisions in the Tory party and signs of recriminations in the cabinet. Mr Major faced strong pressure from the Tory right to readmit to the parliamentary party the nine Eurosceptic MPs who played a crucial part in forcing the government to abandon its proposed increase in VAT on fuel from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent. Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary, said he hoped soon to see some 'bridge-building', a view shared by other rightwing members of the cabinet. In talks with party managers yesterday, Mr Major rejected the idea that the suspended MPs should be readmitted quickly. However, in a further concession to Eurosceptic demands, the government avoided further embarrassment on the European Union finance bill, which triggered the present political storm, by agreeing to strong measures to curb EU fraud. The government comfortably won a confidence vote on the third reading of the bill. There were signs yesterday of disagreement in the cabinet over the events of the past two weeks. Rightwing MPs said they had been told that Mr Major had misjudged the mood of the party. In separate criticisms of Mr Clarke's handling of the VAT issue, there were strong reports, denied by Downing Street, that the prime minister had been among a handful of ministers who wanted the chancellor to drop the proposed VAT increase. Meanwhile, Mr Major's long-standing enemies on the right of the party were joined by less controversial senior MPs in suggesting that his leadership now depends on his ability to restore a semblance of unity to the party. Mr Major himself appeared outwardly unruffled by the latest setback. Speaking at a breakfast for businessmen, he insisted that the government would stick firmly to a strategy of low inflation and strong growth. The base rate increase, which pleased the City but caused dismay among industry groups and retailers, was decided in the morning by Mr Clarke at his monthly monetary meeting with Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, and announced immediately afterwards. Ministers later made clear that the defeat in the Commons had turned an expected rise in rates into what one termed an 'unavoidable certainty'. Mr Clarke gave a robust defence of his action in television and radio interviews. The rate increase, he said, was needed 'to sustain economic recovery with low inflation', leading to higher living standards and more jobs. Like his first half-point rate increase in September, it was 'the right response' to signs of inflationary pressures. Official figures provided further evidence of the UK economy's fast growth. The Central Statistical Office said manufacturing output grew a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent in October from September, and was 5.5 per cent up on October last year. The City reacted positively to the rate increase but it drew criticism from industry and commerce. The main mortgage lenders held back from immediate rate increases. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said investment would be dearer. Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director of the British Retail Consortium, said the rise was 'exceedingly ill-timed'. j The rate rise underpinned sterling, lifting the pound by  3/4 pfennig to DM2.4576. It also boosted bonds, with 10-year gilts adding  1/4 point. However, the FT-SE 100 index closed at 3,012.5, down 3.6.

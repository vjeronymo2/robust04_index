			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> HOLLOWAY/SHELDON TEAM AT GRAND AVENUE BAR  </P> <P> Going to hear a quintet fronted by saxophonist Red Holloway and trumpeter Jack  Sheldon is a little like settling down to watch a rerun of a favorite  television show, or reading for the umpteenth time a favorite novel or poem.  While you might be a bit fuzzy on the details, you know the gist of the whole  thing and are eager to be impressed again by the quality.  </P> <P> At the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Avenue Bar on Tuesday evening, Holloway and  Sheldon -- two familiar hands on the jazz scene -- offered nothing startling  over the course of two sets, but impressed nonetheless with the quality of  their art.  </P> <P> Holloway, an energetic saxophonist mired happily in the mainstream, is beyond  having to display the screeching high end of his instrument's range -- or its  belching bottom -- to impress. Rather, he stays firmly within the natural range  and allows his ideas to gush forth with a mature musicality.  </P> <P> Sheldon, his partner in this venture, was likewise able to impress with  bell-clear notes that rang true as he explored the vagaries of the written song  and delivered a seemingly non-stop series of improvised gems.  </P> <P> "Green Dolphin Street" is a song so overplayed that it belongs in permanent  cold storage. But this group, spurred by drummer Paul Humphrey and anchored by  bassist Richard Reid, found new life. New life was also found in the familiar  "Don't Get Around Much Any More" and "Just Friends," two tunes that featured  Sheldon's musky, yet effective vocals. Again, working from the time-honored  tradition of improvisation, the quintet was able to make each of the songs  bright and fresh.  </P> <P> Though a bawdy little blues from Holloway and a rollicking rendition of Charlie  Parker's "Billie's Bounce" were highlights, it was the ballad inclusions that  were particularly special. Holloway's readings of "You Don't Know What Love Is"  and "Here's That Rainy Day" were simply beautiful, with Sheldon accenting his  co-leader's ideas with sensitivity and style. Pianist Dwight Dickerson was  accomplished in both accompanying and soloing roles.  </P> <P> For those who appreciate old wine in new bottles, the Holloway/Sheldon Quintet  is a worthy find.A.

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Rocking the foundations - Non-property companies are still failing to realise the implications of the fall in property values THE repercussions of the collapse of the commercial property market are spreading throughout the corporate sector. The slump has made deep inroads into the value of property owned by British companies, which was estimated to be worth some Pounds 224bn in 1989. There are signs, however, that companies outside the property sector have not yet acknowledged the scale of their problems. Some analysts argue that the likelihood of property-related shocks is now greater for non-property companies than for quoted property companies. 'Many non-property companies with an involvement in property have yet to face up to reality,' says Mr Marc Gilbard of NatWest Securities. 'Almost certainly a lot of properties are overvalued.' Companies have been slow to acknowledge the impact of the downturn on their balance sheets in the hope that this will prove a temporary downturn, leading to 'no permanent diminution in value'. This attitude may prove too complacent. Unless inflation takes off, the recovery of property values is likely to be a long, slow haul. That alone is a reason for companies to bite the bullet on provisions. Another, perhaps more pressing, reason why companies should take a more realistic view of property values stems from new accounting standards. The Accounting Standards Board, the body that sets standards, has proposed rules that would force companies to revalue their assets every few years. Financial Reporting Standard 3, due to come force in June, requires companies to base profits of property disposals on book values, rather than historic costs. That may encourage companies to get their book values written down as quickly as they can. The sectors most exposed to falling property values are: The banks, which have a three-fold exposure to property: their own branch network, their loans to property companies and their loans to companies that are secured against properties. Many commentators believe that the provisions already announced fall far short of what will eventually be needed. One recent estimate suggested that the banks could face a shortfall of some Pounds 8bn against office property in the south-east of England. The construction companies, many of which expanded into property development during the 1980s. Analysts expect the UK's 10 biggest construction companies to make provisions of up to Pounds 700m for 1992. The total provisions from the sector may top Pounds 1bn when the write-downs from small and medium housebuilders and construction companies are included. Already, the top 20 builders have written off a total of Pounds 800m from the book value of housing land and developments in the four years between 1989 and 1992, according to Warburg Securities. The brewers, which own assets with a total value of well above Pounds 10bn in the form of breweries, pubs, off-licences, warehouses and so on. The fall in property prices will knock huge sums off their assets. Whitbread, for instance, would lose some Pounds 450m from reserves if its property estate fell by 15 per cent, as was indicated by a sample revaluation of its property assets last November. However, analysts believe that revaluations should not have a great impact on share prices, since brewing stocks are increasingly bought for earnings stream rather than asset valuation. More palpable damage could arise from the loans made by brewers to free-trade customers that are secured on assets. The retail companies, for which property accounts for more than 50 per cent of their total asset base - the largest proportion of any sector. Traditionally, asset values have been an important component in the value of a stores group, particularly at the time of a takeover. But the main problems concern those companies which diversified into property development during the 1980s. Burton, the worst-affected, was forced to write off the value of its property developments by Pounds 169m in 1990 and Pounds 155m in 1991. Another problem, which has escalated during the recession, relates to the rent due on former premises, if a subsequent tenant defaults. Boots made a provision of Pounds 5.8m in its last financial year related to 'leases where the assignees have defaulted'. The hotels and leisure companies, the most property-rich sector of all, with assets of more than Pounds 30bn, according to DTZ Debenham Tewson. The link between property prices and share prices has been weakening, however. Property transactions of the large leisure companies accounted for 26 per cent of pre-tax profits in 1989 according to NatWest Securities. By contrast, their contribution was minimal for most companies last year. A comparison of the impact of falling property values on different sectors demonstrates that a large property exposure does not necessarily damage a company's prospects or share price. The damage inflicted by declining asset values depends on its involvement in property trading and development, its gearing and the size of its reserves. The most visible sign of falling assets appears in those companies with development or trading properties. Those often result in large write-downs that damage the profit and loss account. In the past they have been tucked away as extraordinary items. Under FRS 3, that is no longer an option. Writing down fixed assets is not necessarily a pressing problem. Falls in values are often comfortably written off directly to the revaluation reserve, which provides a cushion built up from past unrealised surpluses. This process is not always as straightforward as it might seem, however. The definition of a fixed asset proved controversial in the case of Trafalgar House, which reclassified development properties worth Pounds 102.7m as fixed assets in 1991, thus taking the loss through reserves rather than its profit and loss account. The Financial Reporting Review Panel later forced a reversal of this, resulting in the restatement of its 1991 Pounds 122.4m profit as a loss of Pounds 38.5m. Another problem with write-downs of fixed assets emerges when the revaluation reserve is wiped out, forcing further deficits to be taken through the profit and loss account. When Ladbroke made a 15 per cent provision against its Pounds 1bn investment property portfolio, its 1992 profits collapsed from Pounds 146.3m to Pounds 5.2m. But perhaps the most important and widespread problem concerns companies' ability to borrow. Companies will find it more difficult to borrow as their gearing increases. Falling asset values may cause companies to breach their banking covenants and will make it more difficult borrow in the future. A recent study for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggested that a 10 per cent fall in property prices today would lead to at least a Pounds 10bn fall in borrowing over the next two years. The potential of falling property values to damage corporate profitability and constrain corporate borrowing is gradually becoming increasingly apparent.</p>

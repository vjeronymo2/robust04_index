			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "Xinjiang News" </F> program]    [Text] The regional conference on propaganda and  ideological work opened in Urumqi today.    The tasks high on the conference's agenda are to relay and  implement the guidelines of the national conference on  propaganda and ideological work and to study and work out plans,  in close connection with Xinjiang's reality, on strengthening  and improving propaganda and ideological work. The conference  will study ways to exercise more effective party leadership over  and improve propaganda and ideological work.    Janabil, deputy secretary of the regional CPC Committee,  presided over the conference. Entrusted by the regional party  committee and Comrade Song Hanliang, Abulaiti Abudurexiti,  deputy secretary of the regional CPC committee and chairman of  the regional government, delivered a speech: "Implement the  Guidelines of the National Conference on Propaganda and  Ideological Work and Raise the Region's Propaganda and  Ideological Work To a New Level."    Abulaiti Abudurexiti's speech was divided into three parts:  1) further enhance our understanding of the importance and  functions of propaganda and ideological work from an overall  strategic viewpoint; 2) strive to accomplish the various tasks  with regard to propaganda and ideological work in close  adherence to the fundamental principles; and 3) exercise more  effective party leadership over the propaganda and ideological  work and improve the competence of the ranks of the cadres in  charge of propaganda and ideological work.    Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: The propaganda and ideological  front is a very important front charged with the responsibility  of providing motive force, ideological guarantees, and support  through the creation of public opinion. At the national  conference on propaganda and ideological work earlier this year,  central leaders, including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Zhu Rongji,  delivered important speeches that stressed once again the great  importance of reinforcing propaganda and ideological work in the  new period. We must recognize the importance of propaganda and  ideological work from the high plane of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the overall task of the party's work  as a whole.    Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: It is especially important and  urgent for Xinjiang to step up propaganda and ideological work.  Due to reasons both historical and contemporary, Xinjiang is  relatively backward economically and culturally. Ideologically,  the region is also relatively closed and outdated. Therefore,  it is especially urgent -- and more difficult also -- for us to  emancipate our minds, change our ideas, intensify reforms, and  open up wider to the outside world. The propaganda and  ideological front, therefore, must provide theoretical guidance  and support in public opinion to reform efforts so that the  principle, policy, and measures of reform will strike roots in  the hearts of the people and that cadres and people of all  nationalities will understand, support, and join the reform  efforts to ensure smooth implementation of all reform  undertakings.    He said: Xinjiang is faced with a slew of difficulties and  problems in the course of speeding up its economic development.  This makes it even more necessary to make full use of propaganda  and ideological work to help people get a correct understanding  of Xinjiang's ongoing economic situation and its economic  prospects. He pointed out: On balance, Xinjiang is stable  socially and politically. Destabilizing factors, however,  remain. Effective propaganda and ideological work is essential  if we are to safeguard and maintain social stability and ensure  lasting peace and stability.    In his speech, Abulaiti Abudurexiti called on the region's  propaganda and ideological front to adhere closely to the  fundamental principle of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and pay close attention to the following tasks  now and in the future:    1. make more conscientious efforts in educating the cadres  and the people with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and use this theory to  guide Xinjiang's work in all areas;    2. get a firmer grasp of public opinion, guide it in a  proper  way, and create good public opinion that serves Xinjiang's  reform, opening up, and stability;    3. promote ideological education with patriotism,  collectivism, socialism, and national unity at its core and  foster good mental outlook and social conduct;    4. give greater emphasis to the central theme; help our  cultural, art, and publishing undertakings flourish; and  encourage the creation of more works with healthy content for  people of all nationalities; and    5. carry out in-depth external propaganda, improve the  region's external propaganda in terms of the breadth and depth,  and make it serve reform, opening up, and economic construction.    Speaking of exercising effective party leadership over  propaganda and ideological work and reinforcing the ranks of  propaganda and ideological cadres, Abulaiti Abudurexiti said:  Effective party leadership over propaganda and ideological work  serves as a fundamental guarantee for the successful  implementation of propaganda and ideological work. It also  represents a new demand on party organizations at all levels in  the new historical period. Party committees at all levels must  place propaganda and ideological work high on their agenda,  review it at regular intervals, and set priorities for different  periods in a timely fashion. They should pay greater attention  to helping and guiding propaganda departments focus on the key  tasks and improve their work.    Abulaiti Abudurexiti noted: Generally speaking, Xinjiang's  contingent of propaganda and ideological workers are dependable  politically and hardworking. The regional party committee has  full confidence in this contingent and has always placed great  hopes on it. Party committees and government at all levels must  show concern for comrades on the propaganda and ideological  front politically, ideologically, and in terms of material  benefits. Propaganda and ideological cadres should continuously  enhance their sense of honor and responsibility for their work,  live up to the trust of the party and the people, and make  constant new progress in their work.    Leaders of the regional party committee, government, and the  Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, including Zhang  Fusen, Keyum Bawudun, (Amina Apar), (Wufuer Abudula), Feng  Dazhen, Sha Ming, and Ni Haomei, are attending the conference.  Also present were officials in charge of propaganda and  ideological work from the prefectures, cities, and counties;  directors of propaganda departments from all over the region;  and officials of the regional departments, commissions, offices,  bureaus, and large state-owned enterprises in charge of  propaganda work. Representatives to the regional conference on  radio and television also attended the conference. (Li  Kangning), head of the propaganda department of the regional  party committee, relayed the guidelines of the national  conference on propaganda and ideological work and other relevant  meetings at this morning's session.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, April 26 (AFP) -- Moshood Abiola, the  self-proclaimed winner of June's annuled presidential election,  "endorsed and actively canvassed" for last year's military  intervention in Nigeria, his deputy at that election charged  Tuesday [26 April].    In a letter to the US Congress dated March 21 and published  for the first time by the Nigerian press Tuesday, Alhaji Baba  Gana Kingibe said that following the annulment of the vote and  the subsequent political crisis, the "widest possible spectrum  of Nigerians" called for direct military intervention.    Supporters of a military takeover included Abiola and  himself, said Kingibe, who is now foreign minister.    The letter was published after Abiola reportedly called on  Washington to tighten sanctions against Nigeria following the  Army's intervention, which led to the abolition of both the  country's political parties and parliament.    "Chief Abiola and myself were among those who endorsed and  actively canvassed for this military intervention," Kingibe  wrote.    "We discussed the national crisis with various military  caucuses, including (current head of state) General Sani Abacha."    Abiola and Kingibe contested the election on the ticket of  the Social Democratic Party.    Four days after Abacha came to power last autumn, Abiola  authorised his political aides to participate in the new  government, Kingibe claimed.    But Abiola, who has openly campaigned for recognition of his  claimed victory at the polls -- whose annulment was slammed by  the international community -- has denied ever supporting  military intervention or submitting a list of his political  nominees to Abacha.</p>

Medetkan Sherimkulov told INTERFAX on Saturday that 100,000  Russian-speakers had already left Kyrgyzstan, which has a  Russian-speaking community of about 1 million, or 20 percent of  the total population. He said more Russian speakers were  leaving than were coming in, the gap permanently increasing. As  a result, the republic is losing much of its engineering and  research personnel, many teachers and high-skilled workers, he  said.    Sherimkulov believes that what forces so many Russian  speakers to go away is fear of possible future instability and  the low wages, which on average are less than half those in  Russia.</p>

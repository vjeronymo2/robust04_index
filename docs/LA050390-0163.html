			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY FARE;  </P> <P> PACIFIC GRILL;  </P> <P> WELL-FED ST. NICK;  </P> <P> VISIONS OF SUGARPLUMS, OR AT LEAST GREAT BURGERS, DANCE IN YOUR HEAD AFTER TRIP  TO SANTA CLAUS LANE  </P> <P> I can remember, as a child, driving between Summerland and Carpinteria and  seeing for the first time the great plaster Santa Claus rising out of its giant  red chimney at Santa Claus Lane. When it loomed up in my vision through the  window of the car, I thought it was the most thrilling thing I had ever seen.  Later, of course, my enthusiasm faded -- as did Santa himself, and the Lane  fell into a kind of charming seediness.  </P> <P> Now as I whiz by my spirits lift again. Not from the newly refurbished Santa,  but from the sight of a big funky sign that says BURGERS. Because now I have  the satisfaction of knowing where to get the best hamburger from here to the  real North Pole.  </P> <P> Just a few hundred feet from the ocean, Pacific Grill is located in a gray  board-and-batten cottage that was once an antique shop. Now it's a hamburger  stand with de rigueur floors of painted cement, a Pepsi-Cola menu board, molded  plastic chairs and checkered tablecloths. But there's an unmistakable touch of  class as well: too-beautiful posters of local landscapes on the walls, fresh  flowers on the tables and a surprising selection of wine and beer.  </P> <P> The same thing is true of the food, starting with the bowl of sliced lemons set  out with the condiments. A fairly ordinary breakfast, lunch and dinner menu  becomes something special here. In addition to salads and sandwiches, there are  12 kinds of burgers, ranging from old standards such as double cheeseburgers to  new tastes such as calamari burgers and throwbacks such as buffalo burgers.  </P> <P> My favorite is the sourdough burger with guacamole. The bread is a truly sour  sourdough, and the freshly ground meat doesn't fall apart or drip grease. If I  have any complaint it is that there's so much meat. The guacamole (slightly  garlicky), fresh tomato slices and crunchy leaf lettuce are delicious in  themselves.  </P> <P> The owner, Al Rivera, used to be in the wholesale fish business, and his wife,  Sally, catered clambakes; they really know their fish. The mahi mahi burger,  made with very fresh mahi mahi, is grilled not fried. A wonderful crab salad,  big enough for two, comes with sliced avocado and the best lettuce imaginable.  The unthickened clam chowder is chock-full of tasty, chewy clams, and the broth  has a light butter and lemon flavor.  </P> <P> Before I ever ordered the chili at Pacific Grill I had heard it described as  famous, but I thought, so what? My Uncle Bob's chili is famous; everyone's  chili is famous. However, Al's specialty is a lesson in how a chili can merit  its reputation. It contains tender chunks of beef and small, firm beans and has  an arresting, mysterious flavor. Al, who keeps no secrets, will cheerfully give  all the credit to the Santa Cruz chili powder he imports from Tubac, Ariz. I'm  inclined to think that the ground coriander is what makes it so good.  </P> <P> When I think of Pacific Grill, I think of a hot day in early spring when I took  my family. My husband, the outdoorsman, headed straight for the picnic tables  under the cypress trees beyond the patio. We sat there until blue dusk. The  kids played catch in the grass until it got too dark to see the ball, and I  complained it was too dark to see the food. At last we convinced my husband to  come indoors, into the bright and cozy restaurant, with a promise to play  "Loco-Motion" on the jukebox and go for a walk on the beach after dinner.  That's Pacific Grill to me.  </P> <P> Pacific Grill. 3765 Santa Claus Lane, Carpinteria. 684-7670. Open 8 a.m. to 8  p.m. every day except Thanksgiving and Christmas. Meal for one $3.25-$6.25.  </P></p>

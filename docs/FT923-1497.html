			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Waigel tries to soothe markets MR Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, said last night he saw no need for 'further adjustment' after last week's turmoil on the currency markets. His attempt to calm the markets was made in a speech at the IMF annual meeting in Washington after a day of rumours of a further impending realignment in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Mr Waigel referred to the suspension of sterling and the Italian lira from the ERM and the French Yes vote on the Maastricht treaty. The French vote, he said, had taken an important element of uncertainty from the markets. Then he added: 'After last week's decisions, there is no further need for adjustment, as a look at economic fundamentals shows.' Emerging later from the IMF meeting, Mr Waigel laughed off questions about a possible realignment of currencies in the ERM. 'I never comment about marriages and currency movements,' he told reporters. But he went on to say there was no good reason for speculators to attack the franc. 'French fundamentals are in order,' he said. In his IMF speech, Mr Waigel pledged that Germany would continue to meet fully its obligations in the European Monetary System. He repeated that German interest rates were not, in his view, at the root of the currency market's upheaval. 'German capital market interest rates are, at 7.6 per cent, the lowest in Europe, barring Switzerland; the same goes for money market rates. The capital movements into the D-Mark obviously have other causes,' he said. In a day of rumours of further currency changes, finance ministry officials visiting Washington for the IMF session scuttled surreptitiously from meeting to meeting, anxiously skirting clusters of journalists trying to ambush them. Gossip of impossible precision insisted that Mr Michel Sapin, France's finance minister, would announce a realignment at the crack of dawn today, after flying back to Paris from Washington.</p>

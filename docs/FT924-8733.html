			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / US savings and loan supervisor to step down MR Timothy Ryan said yesterday that he would step down next month as director of the US Treasury's Office of Thrift Supervision after three years in charge of the recovering savings and loan industry. Mr Ryan told the annual meeting of the Savings and Community Bankers of America in San Diego that the overhaul of the S&amp;L, or thrift, industry was 'virtually complete'. 'Together we have made the savings and loan business into an industry of strong, well-capitalised, profitable institutions,' he said in the text of a speech prepared for delivery yesterday. Four years ago, Mr Ryan said, the 3,100 thrifts in the US were between them losing more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 645m) a month. Their capital amounted to just 0.33 per cent of their combined assets of Dollars 1,300bn. In the first half of 1992, he said, the 2,000 surviving thrifts made Dollars 2.8bn in profits. Capital amounted to 5.7 per cent of their much trimmed combined assets of Dollars 840bn. The S&amp;L crisis, however, is not yet over for the US federal government. Mr Ryan's office continues to send failed thrifts into liquidation under the auspices of the Resolution Trust Corporation, but the last Congress failed to vote an additional Dollars 43bn for the RTC, which has been without new funds since April 1. The Bush administration estimates that the failure to authorise new funds is adding Dollars 4m-Dollars 6m a day to the ultimate cost of the crisis by preventing regulators from closing savings and loan businesses as quickly as they would like. The Congressional Budget Office projects the total cost of the S&amp;L bailout at Dollars 195bn up to 1998. Mr Ryan, 47, said he told President George Bush when he was appointed OTS director in April 1990 that he would leave after the 1992 election. The former White House aide and pension lawyer said he intended to return to private business.</p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: High stakes for Tirana wives Betting-wise, some of us are in better shape than others, judging by a story from Albania this week, writes Michael Thompson-Noel. The daily paper, Koha Jone (Our Time), reported that an Albanian short of gambling money had lost his wife after staking her on the outcome of a World Cup game. The gambler - not identified - was so sure that Argentina would beat Bulgaria in their first-round match that he bet his good woman. Bulgaria won 3-2. She disappeared with the winner, while the loser was left to complain to the police. Even for the rest of us, the going is about to become sticky. My original strategy of backing Latin American teams was half-baked, Colombia and Argentina having cost me Pounds 150 in lost stakes plus 10 per cent tax. Only Brazil remain, and they have been at cramped odds since the tournament started. I lost another Pounds 22 this week by supporting Nigeria at 16-1 - just throwing money away. As a result, my hopes are now glued to Romania. After the Romanians thumped Colombia I backed them at 25-1 and 33-1. If Romania win the tournament, I will be at least Pounds 600 to the good on total stakes (so far) of Pounds 297. I have also had a saver on Brazil: Pounds 60 at 3-1. But if Brazil and Romania win their quarter-finals, they will clash in the semis, which means that another lump of stake money will be lost. Crunch-time is here. I now plan to double-up on Romania and take out a further saver on Germany, probably. Not that Germany have impressed me. Only Romania have done that. If Romania are beaten, my troubles will be profound: I do not have a wife. Latest odds in London (Ladbroke): 13-8 Brazil; 7-2 Germany; 9-2 Italy; 8-1 Spain; 10-1 Romania, Holland; 14-1 Sweden; 28-1 Bulgaria.</p>

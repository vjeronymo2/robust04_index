			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Pillar Properties sets up joint venture fund Pillar Properties, the UK investment company due to float later this week, has formed a Pounds 250m joint venture investment fund to buy retail property in the UK. The venture has been set up with part of Canada's largest public pension fund manager, Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, which controls about Dollars 33bn (Pounds 22bn) of assets. It shows the resurgence of confidence in the UK property market since the launch of another joint venture fund by Mr George Soros and British Land a year ago which has invested more than Pounds 500m. The latest investment company, which will be managed by Pillar, will focus on shopping centres, with an average purchase price of about Pounds 30m. The fund will buy properties which require active management, including refurbishment, and it intends to be fully invested within two years. Profits will be split between the two partners, but Pillar will receive an additional carried interest, to reflect its management role. Pillar and its partner, Societe Immobiliere Trans-Quebec, will initially inject Pounds 30m each, and acquisitions will be funded by a combination of equity and non-recourse debt. The company has built up assets of Pounds 330.4m. It is managed by Mr Raymond Mould and Mr Patrick Vaughan, founders of BAe's property arm, Arlington Securities.</p>

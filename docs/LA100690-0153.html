			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TROY IS NO MATCH FOR EISENHOWER  </P> <P> Troy High School has half as many students as Rialto Eisenhower, and Friday  night the Warriors learned why smaller schools shouldn't schedule football  games against larger schools.  </P> <P> Eisenhower, the fourth-ranked team in the Southern Section's Division I,  thoroughly dominated Troy at Fullerton High, winning 28-0 in the final  nonleague game for both teams.  </P> <P> Even so, Eisenhower Coach Tom Hoak said the Eagles (5-0) didn't play very well.  Hoak said his team may have been overconfident.  </P> <P> "I didn't think we were aggressive," Hoak said. "I thought they were more  aggressive than us."  </P> <P> But Troy (2-3) didn't have the athletes to keep pace, as was evident on  Eisenhower's first drive.  </P> <P> After Omar Love, the Eagles' leading rusher entering the game, returned the  kickoff 37 yards, Eisenhower's second-leading rusher, Anthony Stewart, carried  the ball four times for 17 yards. Quarterback Jason Davis then completed two  passes -- one for eight yards to Demond Thompkins and one to Robert Talley for  a 32-yard touchdown.  </P> <P> Talley was well-covered by the Troy secondary but outjumped his defender for  the ball. After a two-point conversion, Eisenhower led 8-0.  </P> <P> The Eagles scored twice more in the first half to take a 21-0 lead. Stewart  scored on a two-yard run and Davis threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Thompkins.  </P> <P> Troy slowed down Eisenhower's running attack but never completely shut it down.  One had the feeling Eagle running backs were often only a step away from  breaking into the open for long runs, but none ever did.  </P> <P> All totalled, 10 Eisenhower players carried the ball, rushing 27 times for 143  yards. Only twice was an Eagle runner held to less than a one-yard gain.  </P> <P> Davis completed 14 of 21 passes for 164 yards and three touchdowns, including  the Eagles' final score -- a 44-yard pass to Talley in the third quarter for a  28-0 lead.  </P> <P> Troy tried to establish its ground game with Bryant Burchit, a sophomore  playing his first varsity game at running back. But Burchit gained only 24  yards in 17 carries.  </P> <P> Warrior quarterback Greg Windle had a little more success, completing 13 of 24  passes for 122 yards, but Troy was never able to sustain a drive.  </P> <P> Troy's original opponent for Friday's game backed out, and three other schools  declined to play the Warriors, Troy Coach John Turek said.  </P> <P> Turek called Hoak last spring and Hoak agreed to have his team fill the empty  spot on Troy's schedule.  </P></p>

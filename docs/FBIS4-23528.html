			<p>BFN     [Text] Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] has  developed an armored vehicle that it believes is as good as any  tank being used by NATO or East Bloc forces. The total cost of  development: 126 million rands. Marinus Wijnbeek reports that  the tank demonstrates the technological capabilities of the  South African arms industry.    [Begin recording] [Wijnbeek] The tank technology  demonstrator, as it is called, bears little relation to the  existing Olifant tanks used by the armed forces. An important  feature of the tank is its suitability for the unique and harsh  African conditions. A number of South African firsts are  incorporated in its design. This is the first tank that has an  adapted commercial engine and cooling systems which ensure crew  comfort under the hot African sun. The gun sight is stabilized  for all-round functioning and has a thermal night sight. Only  the latest American Abrahms has a comparable sight. The tank  commander has state of the art passive night vision. The gun on  the demonstrator has a 105-mm caliber, but this will soon be  upgraded to a South African developed 120-mm, and later a 140-mm  barrel. The maneuverability of the tank and its cross country  and road speeds are 35 and 71 km/h which aren't at all bad for a  58.3-ton armored vehicle. It also has extensive crew safety  systems in case it is hit by an enemy. This includes top  protection.    [Armscor spokesman Andre Buys] This tank technology  demonstrator will be used as a test-bed to evaluate new  technology and to retain our armor system capability. It will  also be used to market our upgrading capability. There is an  attractive global market for the modernization of older  generation armored vehicles.    [Wijnbeek] Impressive though it is, Armscor's latest  fighting  vehicle will probably not go into production. Although the  tank's technology may find its way around the world, this  demonstrator is likely to remain just that. [end recording]</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Zambia averts row with donors The Zambian government yesterday averted a confrontation with western aid donors and announced the voluntary liquidation of the state-owned airline. The donors, who provide some Dollars 700m-Dollars 800m a year in support of President Frederick Chiluba's economic reform programme, had warned that they might suspend aid if government pressed ahead with a loan to the heavily indebted Zambia Airways. The government had intended to draw on a Dollars 30m oil purchase facility provided by a Kuwaiti bank to help pay some of the airlines creditors, and buy time in which to implement a cost-cutting plan. Donors maintained this would break an agreement on public sector borrowing, and suspected that the government was seeking an alternative to privatising the airline.</p>

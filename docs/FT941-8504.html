			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Rail company in state ownership European Passenger Services, which will operate the cross-Channel rail link out of Waterloo later this year, is to be temporarily transferred to government ownership, the Department of Transport announced yesterday. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, confirmed that EPS, which should gain huge revenues when it starts selling tickets to tunnel passengers later this year, will eventually be transferred to the company that wins the bid to build Britain's Channel tunnel rail link. Ownership of EPS will ensure a steady revenue stream for the company that builds the link. Mr MacGregor said that in the interim the company would be taken out of British Rail's hands and managed by Mr PJ Butler, a former senior partner of accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, on behalf of the government.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Roche increases dividend after 11% rise ROCHE, the Swiss pharma-ceuticals and chemicals group, yesterday disclosed net consolidated earnings of SFr948m (Dollars 668m) for 1990, up 11.3 per cent on the previous year. The board proposes to increase the dividend by SFr4 to SFr42 per share and genussschein (non-voting stock). At the same time Roche announced that its US subsidiary, Roche Holdings, was planning a Eurobond issue with warrants of the order of Dollars 1bn. Swiss Bank Corporation, the lead manager, is expected to announce details this week. Roche bought 60 per cent of Genentech, the Californian biotechnology company, last year in a Dollars 2.1bn deal, which it financed through a multi-layer short-term credit. The bond issue will switch part on to a longer-term basis. Group sales, disclosed earlier, climbed by 3 per cent to SFr9.67bn in 1990, an increase equivalent to 14 per cent in local currency terms, Roche said. The turnover figure includes fourth-quarter sales by Genentech but excludes sales by the Maag crop protection business and the Medi-Physics radiopharmaceuticals company which Roche disposed of during 1990. All divisions, particularly pharmaceuticals, had contributed to the positive results, as had non-operational income, Roche said. Last year's 11 per cent improvement in group earnings had been achieved despite the adverse effects of the appreciation of the Swiss franc against other leading currencies, Roche said. The strength of the franc also strongly influenced the results of the two other big Basle-based Swiss chemicals groups. Ciba-Geigy is dropping its dividend to SFr60 from SFr65 after posting a 33 per cent fall in net consolidated earnings to SFr1bn, while Sandoz is maintaining an unchanged dividend after reporting a 1 per cent increase in group net profit to SFr967m.</p>

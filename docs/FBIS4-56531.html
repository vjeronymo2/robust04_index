			<p>BFN     [Text] A CID/Gallup poll one week before the general  elections reveals that at "the last minute" there has been a  "dramatic change" favoring Ruben Blades, the Papa Egoro  Movement's presidential candidate.    The CID/Gallup poll indicates that Blades would win the  presidency in the event of a last-minute coalition between  Christian Democratic Party candidate Eduardo Vallarino,  Democratic Alliance candidate Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, and  Change '94 candidate Ruben Carles.    If Carles were presented as the candidate of such a  coalition, he would gain 22 percent of the votes, Blades 33  percent, and United People alliance candidate Ernesto Perez  Balladares 30 percent.    If Moscoso de Gruber were the candidate of such a coalition,  she would obtain 23 percent of the votes, Perez Balladares 30  percent, and Blades 32 percent.    If Vallarino were the presidential candidate, he would  obtain  9 percent of the votes, the PRD's Perez Balladares would  maintain his 30 percent, and Blades would get 38 percent.    This poll, prepared exclusively for EL PANAMA AMERICA by  CID/Gallup, was taken between 24 and 29 April to determine the  Panamanian people's political preferences in the upcoming 8 May  elections.    For this poll, 1,200 citizens were interviewed in 60  different parts of the Panama City metropolitan area, Aguadulce,  El Roble, Anton, El Valle, Portobelo, Baru, Dolega, San Lorenzo,  Los Santos, Guarare, Atalaya, and other districts.    The poll reveals that most of people prefer Ernesto Perez  Balladares and Ruben Blades; they obtained a 30 percent and 26  percent support rating, respectively.    Mireya Moscoso de Gruber obtained 17 percent, Ruben Carles  14  percent, Eduardo Vallarino 2 percent, Samuel Lewis Galindo 1  percent, and Jose Salvador Munoz 1 percent.    The poll highlights the fact that Ruben Blades' rating  increased 14 points, but the Papa Egoro Movement candidate has  relatively little support in the interior of the country.    CID/Gallup found that while Blades and Papa Egoro have  improved their positions in the past 60 days, Perez Balladares  is suffering a decline. Nevertheless, the latter continues to  have the majority of support among Panamanians.    Of the people polled, the PRD registered a 26 percent  support  rating, Papa Egoro 21 percent, Arnulfist Party 14 percent,  Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] 9 percent,  Christian Democratic Party 3 percent, and Morena [National  Renewal Movement] 3 percent, while 20 percent of those polled  did not express a preference.    Other relevant findings in the poll show that nine out of  every 10 Panamanians will vote and that a similar proportion are  against a return of military personnel to power.    Some 87 percent of Panamanians "do not want any kind of  alliance with military personnel to govern Panama in the  future." Ernesto Perez Balladares, according to the CID/Gallup  poll, is the candidate who would favor a new military force.    If one of the presidential candidates withdrew from the  race,  CID/Gallup determined that Blades would attract 50 percent of  Perez Balladares' followers, 30 percent of those backing Mireya  Moscoso de Gruber, 44 percent of the ones endorsing Eduardo  Vallarino, and 31 percent of those who support Carles.    Carles would receive support of 34 percent of those who back  Mireya Moscoso, 25 percent of Blades' followers, and 17 percent  of Vallarino's backers.    Mireya Moscoso de Gruber would receive the support of 35  percent of Carles' supporters, 24 percent of those backing  Samuel Lewis Galindo, 20 percent of the voters who support  Vallarino, and 17 percent of the Papa Egoro supporters.    The poll revealed that 41 percent of the Panamanians polled  believe unemployment is the main problem facing the nation. The  issue is followed by corruption with 20 percent, and drug  trafficking with 11 percent.    Guillermo Endara was viewed favorably in the CID/Gallup  poll.  Endara "is improving in the eyes of his people, and he has not  been evaluated this favorably since March 1991," the polling  firm observed.    The president improved 28 points in one month, and,  according  to CID/Gallup, the broadcast of the documentary on the civilist  struggle "has a lot to do with the positive change in his favor."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Willy Claes confirmed to the Chamber of Deputies  just now that at least six Belgian civilians have been killed in  the troubles in Rwanda. Until now it had been announced that  three Belgians had died. The minister of foreign affairs was  answering questions from deputies belonging to the chamber's  Foreign Affairs Commission. Over now to Andre Menu:    [Menu] Sixteen Belgians have been killed in the tragic  events  in Rwanda: Ten Belgian UN peacekeepers and six civilians --  three in Gisenyi and three in Kigali. This happened in the  first few days.    The Belgian peacekeepers were providing protection for the  Rwandan prime minister, who was murdered. They were surprised  by a large number of Rwandan nationals and executed the next  night in a Rwandan camp. That was what Leo Delcroix, the  minister of defense, reported this afternoon.    But it was Willy Claes who defined the stance adopted by the  government, whose main aim is to ensure people's security, to  take the least possible number of risks and to organize the  evacuation of our nationals. But for Willy Claes the latest  tragic events in Rwanda mean that questions have to be raised on  the effectiveness of the current mandate of the peacekeeping  troops. As is known, the mandate is extremely limited.  Belgium's attitude in the future must also depend on guarantees  that a real democratization process in the country will succeed,  Willy Claes said.    There will be a debate in parliament on the future position  to be adopted by Belgium. [passage omitted]</p>

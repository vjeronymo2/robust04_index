			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Markets: At a glance - Gartmore cuts Pep charges Gartmore this week followed the lead set last month by Fidelity by cutting the start-up charges on its personal equity plans and introducing charges payable on exit for those who close their plans within three years. The idea is to offer cheaper initial investment and encourage long-termism. Initial charges will drop from 5 per cent to 2 per cent. Withdrawal charges will be 3 per cent plus VAT up to the end of the first complete year, 2 per cent plus VAT in the second, and 1 per cent plus VAT in the third. After that there will be no withdrawal charges.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Definitions of ``low- or moderate-income household'' and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``very low-income household''. Section 10(j)(13)(A) of the Act defines the term ``low- or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moderate-income household'' as a household which has an income of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 80 percent or less of the area median. 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(13)(A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 10(j)(13)(B) of the Act defines the term ``very low-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household'' as a household that has an income of 50 percent or less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the area median.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section 1430(j)(13)(B). Thus, the term low- or moderate-income household incorporates households that meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of very low-income household.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board's existing AHP regulation defines ``low- and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moderate-income households'' as households for which the aggregate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income is 80 percent or less of the area median income, and ``very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low-income households'' as households for which the aggregate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income is 50 percent or less of the area median income. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 CFR 960.1(g), (o). ``Median income'' is defined as ``the median  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family income for an area as determined and published by the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Housing and Urban Development.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;960.1(h).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Area'' is defined as ``a metropolitan statistical area, a county,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or a nonmetropolitan area, as established by the U.S. Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management and Budget.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;960.1(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Adjustments of income limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 5, 1993, the Board published a proposed rule to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amend the definitions of these terms. See 58 FR 58988  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (November 5, 1993). As discussed in the preamble to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment, under section 3 of the United States Housing Act of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1937, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Development (Secretary) establishes income limits to be used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining whether a family qualifies as a ``low-income family'' or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a ``very low-income family'' that is eligible to receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance under the Department of Housing and Urban Development's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (HUD) housing programs. See 42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2). These income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits are calculated as a percentage of the median income of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> four-person family living in a particular area. In general, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income limit for qualifying as a ``low-income family'' is set at 80  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the area median income, and the income limit for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifying as a ``very low-income family'' is set at 50 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the area median income.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary may adjust the income limits for very low-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families and low-income families upward or downward to take into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account unusually high or low family incomes in an area. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the income limit for low-income families may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusted to take into account prevailing levels of construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Then an adjustment in this figure is made to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish the comparable income limits for larger and smaller  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families living in the area. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 31 higher-income metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18 counties, the Secretary adjusts the area-based income limit for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a four-person, low-income family downward if it would otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceed the U.S. median income for a four-person family. In these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas, the Secretary caps the income limit for a four-person,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low-income family at the U.S. median income for a four-person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> family.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In four MSAs and 107 counties, the Secretary adjusts the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area-based income limit for four-person, very low- and low-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families downward because housing costs are low compared to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incomes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adjusting the income limit downward decreases the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households in an area that are eligible to receive assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under HUD's housing programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in the proposed amendment, the Board believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affordable housing financed through the AHP should be available to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the greatest number of households possible, within the limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by the Act. Further, households should not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excluded from affordable housing in a particular local market on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the basis that housing costs are lower or household incomes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher in that market than in other regions of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applying the income limits that have been adjusted downward for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevailing construction costs, low housing costs, or unusually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high household incomes for purposes of administering the AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduces the number of households eligible to live in affordable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing financed through the AHP. This limits a member's ability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to use funds under the AHP to fulfill its obligation under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Community Reinvestment Act. See 12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits a member's ability to use funds under the AHP to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``community investment or service'' requirement of section 10(g) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act, 12 U.S.C. 1430(g), and the Board's Community Support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulation, 12 CFR part 936.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Board is proposing that in administering the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP and in defining the standards governing the ``community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investment or service'' requirement of the Act, the income limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to determine whether a household in a particular area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifies as a ``very low-income household'' or as a ``low- or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moderate-income household'' should not be adjusted downward based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on prevailing construction costs, low housing costs, or unusually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high household incomes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, as set forth in the Board's proposed amendment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.1 of this proposed rule defines ``low- or moderate-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household'' as a household which has an income of 80 percent or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less of the median income for the area, as adjusted and published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by HUD, except in areas where the Secretary adjusts this figure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> downward because of prevailing construction costs, low housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs, or unusually high household incomes. For areas where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary makes this downward adjustment, ``low- or moderate-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household'' would be defined to mean a household which has an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income of 80 percent or less of the median income for the area, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published by HUD, with adjustment for household size, but without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the adjustments made by the Secretary for prevailing construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs, low housing costs, or unusually high household incomes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

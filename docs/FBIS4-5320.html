			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Tues. -- The round-up of 1,500  Filipino maids at Saint John's Cathedral here on March 27 was  not a deliberate attempt to target foreign Christian workers.    Deputy Home Minister Datuk Megat Junid Megat Ayub said today  that the Government considered such an exercise as routine and  part of the on-going operation to detain foreign workers without  valid travel and employment papers.    He criticised certain foreign newspapers for their reports  which had implied the exercise was targeted at Christian foreign  workers.    "Just because the operation took place in a church area, it  has been misconstrued as targeting Christian foreign workers,"  he said.    "Such reports were not only mischievious but also untrue,"  he  added.    Megat Junid was speaking to newsmen at his office at the  Prime Minister's Department here.    He said that in the past the police and immigration  authorities had rounded up illegal foreign workers at other  places of worship without protest from their governments.    "There have been operations where foreign Muslim workers who  did not have the proper papers were detained at mosques where  they slept" he said.    Yesterday, the Philippines Foreign Office in Manila summoned  a senior Malaysian diplomat to express deep concern over the  round-up of the Filipino maids.    Charge d'affaires Mohamed Noh told Foreign Secretary Roberto  Romula the action was part of periodic checks by Malaysian  authorities against illegal immigrants.    Megat Junid said the operation was carried out at Saint  John's Cathedral following media reports that some Filipino  maids were involved in vice activities.    Of the 1,500 who were taken to the Immigration Department  headquarters here, 711 were found without valid travel documents.</p>

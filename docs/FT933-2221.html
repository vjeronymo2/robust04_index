			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Bid war looming in US over Paramount SPECULATION is intensifying that other US media moguls will initiate a bidding war for Paramount Communications, the film and publishing group which agreed to be acquired by Viacom for Dollars 8.2bn (Pounds 5.3bn) a week ago. Reacting to the possibility of a rival bid, a Paramount spokesman said: 'We repeat what we have said from the first day: the merger with Viacom is a perfect business fit and is in the best interests of our shareholders. It will be completed.' However, a routine board meeting of Turner Broadcasting on Friday is believed to have given Mr Ted Turner, the mercurial founder of the Cable News Network television channel, a green light to examine ways of getting involved in a rival bid. In an interview with the Financial Times conducted last Thursday (see Monday interview, Back Page) Mr Turner was dismissive of the idea that he might enter a bidding war because it would be too costly, but analysts speculated yesterday that he might launch one in conjunction with other media groups. Turner Broadcasting is much smaller than Paramount. Another possible bidder is Mr Barry Diller, who played a key role helping Mr Rupert Murdoch build Fox into America's fourth television network and now heads QVC Network, which offers cable television home shopping. Mr Diller is ambitious to build QVC into a more broadly based network.</p>

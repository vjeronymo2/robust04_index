			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Berezneva report: "Private Storehouse in </F> Motherland's Granaries. `Roskhleboprodukt' Promises Impending  Drastic Rise in Price of Bread"]    [Text] The statement by Leonid Cheshinskiy, president of  the "Roskhleboprodukt" Joint-Stock Company, came like a bolt out  of the blue. It concerned Russia's granaries, which are  allegedly empty. Grain reception enterprises, according to  Cheshinskiy's rumors, have already bought all the Russian  peasants' grain surpluses at the former extremely low price of  90,000 rubles [R] a tonne on average. Wheat from state  resources is now being used. And since it costs R200,000 a  tonne owing to spending on storage, transport cost, and "jacked  up" interest rates, you can expect a rise in the price of your  daily bread.    Arkadiy Gurevich, director of the "Roskhleboprodukt"  Joint-Stock Company's Market Conditions and Pricing  Analytical-Information Center, confirmed the planned rise by the  end of the year in the price of Russians' basic food -- to at  least 1,000 RUBLES A LOAF. He based this sorry idea on the fact  that prices of fuel and energy resources are "rocketing" in turn  as a result of which reception, cleaning, and drying of grain  are more costly. Plus storage costs....    But, according to Gurevich, the Ministry of Agriculture is  still taking on a great deal. When he made his statement  Cheshinskiy was evidently taking into consideration the fact  that the ministry had informed agrarian specialists at local  level of so-called advised rough prices for harvest 1994 grain.  And these guidelines are over twice as much as last year's.  For instance, peasants will be demanding R220,000-250,000 per  tonne of food wheat. Insofar as beginning this coming fall,  grain that is more costly from the outset will be coming in for  processing, "Roskhleboprodukt" considers it its duty to prepare  Russia for the new prices of the finished bread.    This stance on the part of "Roskhleboprodukt" leaders has  caused indignation within the Ministry of Agriculture. People  there categorically deny giving agricultural enterprises any  advice about the specific prices of this harvest's grain.    What is more, some of the ministry's leading specialists  view  Cheshinskiy's move as gross indiscretion on the part of a  commercial agent who regards a Russian peasant's tractor as a  free ride. They think that grain farmers will naturally sell  the new harvest's grain at a higher price than in previous  years. But Cheshinskiy intends to give them only a fourth of  the 1,000-ruble loaf of the future. And that is daylight  robbery. Incidentally, of this R1,000 the cost of processing  accounts for at most R100, delivery accounts for another R100,  and R50 is the trading outlet's share.... Together with the  cost of the raw material, that is to say the actual grain, the  above expenditure on bread production totals, according to  Agriculture Ministry economists' rough estimates, not R1,000 but  merely R500. And it is clear who will get the other R500  demanded from the customer and where it will go. I am talking  about "Roskhleboprodukt," which has a fortune of its own.  Nothing to do with the state.    Many people in the ministry are puzzled as to why this  commercial and essentially private structure has been accorded  the function of state buyer for grain procurement.  "Roskhleboprodukt" is moreover being given the role of  monopolist agent between the grower and the miller and then the  customer. Were this and other middlemen to be taken out of the  picture, Russian foodstuffs, bread included, would be 40 percent  cheaper.    The picture looks strange. Leonid Cheshinskiy hinted that  the motherland's granaries are already empty. Some other  sources of information attest that there is nonetheless almost  18 million tonnes of grain in these granaries -- almost six  months' supply. Yet the silos and, even more so, the barns out  in the countryside are brimming with grain, and, being last  year's grain it is consequently cheap.    Why then is "Roskhleboprodukt" scaring us today with the  thought of tomorrow's prices of our main foodstuff? There is  the view that the firm wants to get preferential loans from the  state for the coming procurement campaign without waiting for  the harvest.    In all self-respecting countries grain production and the  grain question in general is an area of state policy. Apart  from perhaps present-day Russia where the state has given up the  "palm" in this business to a commercial structure. But what if  our motherland's granaries become a private storehouse? Then  you will really see what prices will do. And do not grumble  about it.</p>

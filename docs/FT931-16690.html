			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Brisk beginning to year with Finnish issue THE Republic of Finland helped to produce a brisk start to the new year in the international bond markets by announcing its latest big foreign currency borrowing, one of two major issues in the D-Mark sector yest-erday. Finland's new DM2bn seven-year bond issue, lead-managed by Dresdner Bank, will be priced today at 50 to 55 basis points over German government bonds. This compares with a spread of 63 basis points on Finland's most recent D-Mark bond, a DM1bn five-year exercise last October. Mr Veikko Kantola, Finland's director of finance, says that the lower indicated spread for a slightly longer maturity reflects an improvement in Finland's perceived credit worthiness as the recession bottoms out, economic news becomes more positive and Finland prepares for negotiations to start on its application to join the EEC. Bankers say that Finland is benefiting more from a lack of supply of higher yielding bonds in the seven-year range, and that the indicated pricing looks on the demanding side. Coupled with the SFr500m bond issue launched in mid-December, this marks a solid foundation for Finland's foreign borrowing this year. The indications now are that the country will be looking to borrow Dollars 7bn to Dollars 8bn externally, as government borrowing climbs to around 40 per cent of GDP, compared with 20 per cent a year ago. Finland will concentrate on borrowing in the main European currencies, supported by borrowings in dollars and yen, some of which could be swapped to keep their combined share of the country's foreign currency borrowings at around a quarter of the total. The other D-Mark issue, Deutsche Bank's DM1bn 10-year issue for itself, was very well received, thanks to the name, said bankers. Banks are reporting continuing demand for US dollar collared floating rate notes, as continental European investors, who are bullish on the dollar, seek to reduce interest rate exposure. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reported demand across Europe for its Republic of Austria Dollars 200m 10-year issue with a five per cent minimum coupon and 8 1/4 per cent maximum. Austria has an existing issue on the same terms, which is currently trading over par, says UBS. Austria's new issue went well and slightly overshadowed the other three launched yesterday. Credit Local de France's Dollars 150m 10-year issue through Goldman Sachs International was said to be selling slowly but surely. Swedish Export Credit re-opened an issue due in November 2002, with a further Dollars 50m tranche through Morgan Stanley International, while Helaba (Landesbank Hessen-Thuringen Girozentrale) is raising Dollars 100m on a subordinated basis over 10 years through Kidder Peabody. The coupon will be set at  1/8 per cent below six-month Libor, with a minimum of 5 per cent and a maximum of 9 1/4 per cent. The Council of Europe is raising a further Dollars 100m through a re-opening of an existing fixed-rate issue due in October 1999, to meet professional demand.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> KNEE PROMPTS STIPANOVICH TO RETIRE  </P> <P> With his wife and infant daughter by his side, Indiana Pacers center Steve  Stipanovich announced his retirement today from the National Basketball Assn.  </P> <P> The 7-foot center spent last season on the bench with an injured left knee. The  injury caused a "dead spot" in the bone. Doctors drilled a hole trying to  revive it, but their efforts yielded limited success. Stipanovich said he had  been examined by three doctors and had undergone two operations, and nothing  seemed to have helped.  </P> <P> "It seems to have gotten worse," he said at a news conference at Pacers  headquarters.  </P> <P> Stipanovich said he plans to stay off the knee for a year or two to help it  heal, and that more surgery and perhaps an artificial knee will be needed.  Stipanovich said that under the retirement agreement he will retain the  insurance coverage on his contract, which expires in three years.  </P></p>

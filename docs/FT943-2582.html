			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Mandela to hold Zulu talks: A rift between the King and Chief Buthelezi President Nelson Mandela today holds talks with two of South Africa's most influential Zulu leaders in a bid to defuse growing tensions in the tribal region. Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini is at odds with Inkatha Freedom Party leader and Home Affairs minister Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who is also the King's traditional prime minister, over an invitation the monarch issued to President Mandela to attend next Saturday's Shaka Day ceremony in Ulundi, the Zulu capital. Chief Buthelezi has objected to President Mandela's presence at the celebrations, held annually to commemorate the great nineteenth century Zulu monarch, on the grounds that proper protocol was not followed when the formal invitation was made directly to the president instead of being routed through him as the King's chief minister. The invitation is seen as part of a strategy adopted by the King to reduce his dependence on Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party by building up independent links with the African National Congress and thereby setting himself up as an apolitical tribal monarch. Even if compromise is reached on the Shaka Day issue, the controversy is still damaging to the minister as it tarnishes his image as the King's main political ally. In the run up to the April elections, Chief Buthelezi, who is a member of the royal family and uncle to the king, portrayed himself as the main defender of the Zulu monarchy in order to boost his Inkatha Freedom Party's stature among conservative Zulus. Since then, however, King Goodwill appears to have grown dissatisfied with his role as a virtual puppet of his uncle and there has been speculation that he may dismiss Chief Buthelezi from his role as prime minister to the King and replace him with another royal family member more sympathetic to the ANC. In other signs of tension, the King recently replaced his KwaZulu police bodyguard, appointed by Chief Buthelezi, with national police officials and at the weekend the Chief failed to turn up to the annual reed dance festival in Nongoma, near Ulundi, at which he traditionally accompanies the King.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Su </F> Kuoshan (5685 2368 0810) and XINHUA reporter Zhou Zhifang (0719  1807 2455)]    [Text] Xichang, 2 Feb (XINHUA) -- On the eve of Chinese  Spring Festival, good news comes from the depth of the Dalian  Mountains -- a large-scale technological renovation project for  introducing high and new technologies to the Xichang Satellite  Launching Center has been accomplished. Many overall testings  conducted by scientific and technological personnel show that  the renovated launching facilities can launch various kinds of  carrier rockets and that China has enhanced its capability in  conducting overall testings for satellite launches.    Established in the early seventies, the Xichang Satellite  Launching Center has conducted 12 satellite and rocket launches,  thus making important contributions to China's aerospace  undertakings. To meet the need of launching new types of  telecommunications satellites by China's new types of carrier  rockets, the Xichang Satellite Launching Center -- with great  support from dozens of scientific research and manufacturing  units across the country -- conducted a large-scale  technological renovation in 1993 by using modern technologies to  upgrade launching command, control, and telecommunications  systems, enabling real-time command of carrier rocket and  satellite launching to become even more modernized. By adopting  internationally advanced computer technology, the ability of the  center's computers in collecting and handling data has been  greatly increased and their stability and reliability have been  remarkably improved. The commanding display system becomes more  quick, visible, and accurate, thanks to the use of advanced  audio-visual image formation and transmission technologies.  Scientific and technological personnel took one year to  accomplish more than 100 important renovation projects including  the launching tower system, the propellant injection system, and  the testing environment for rockets and satellites. The  renovated tower system is equipped with multiple functions, and  its supplementary facilities have been improved. The  low-temperature propellant utilization system shows that China  has made new progress in the technological fields of increasing  the propulsive force of carrier rockets and saving energy. The  improvement of the quality of artificial environment for testing  satellites and rockets can meet domestic and international  requirements for launching various kinds of satellites and  enhance the ability of China's aerospace industry to compete in  the international market.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Bosnia on the Brink: Belgrade cuts off supplies THE Serbian-controlled rump state of Yugoslavia yesterday declared a blockade against Bosnian Serbs for all but humanitarian supplies, in a swift and stinging response to their rejection of the Bosnian peace plan, report Laura Silber and Reuter from Belgrade. Its action could stem the flow of arms and fuel that has sustained the Bosnian Serb war machine through 13 months of war against the republic's Moslems and Croats. It also implied that Bosnian Serb leaders would be made to leave the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, where Serbia said they were living in comfort while their people suffered. If enforced, the cut-off of supplies is likely to hit the self-styled Serb state in Bosnia hard. Its only roads not blocked by war are those leading through Serbia and Montenegro, which comprise what remains of Yugoslavia. Western diplomats believe the sanctions will devastate Serb-held territory, already impoverished after a year of war. Despite some military petrol reserves, Bosnian Serbs depend on Yugoslavia for fuel. 'They are utterly dependent on petroleum coming via the Serbian pipeline,' said a diplomat. The measures were announced by the Serb and Yugoslav federal governments hours after the Bosnian Serb assembly ignored pleadings from Serb and Yugoslav leaders to support the UN-brokered peace plan. 'Aid to the Bosnian Serb republic should in future be reduced to just food and medicines in quantities to be established by the competent ministries,' a Serbian government statement said. 'Reasons no longer exist for further assistance in money, fuel, raw materials etc,' the Belgrade-based news agency Tanjug quoted the statement as saying. The Yugoslav federal government issued a similar decree. The bitterly worded Serb government statement condemned the assembly vote, couched in a decision to put the peace plan to a Bosnian Serb referendum on May 15-16, as irresponsible and said the 'economic bleeding' of Serbia after 12 months of UN sanctions had become intolerable. David Owen adds: Mr John Major, UK prime minister, speaking in the House of Commons, earlier urged Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic to close Serbia's borders with Bosnia, cut the supply of weapons and other goods, and 'all other possible pressure on the Bosnian Serbs'. At the same time the government signalled its continued resistance to allowing arms to be supplied to the Bosnian Moslems. Stating that military options such as air strikes had not been ruled out, it indicated that the next step in forcing the Bosnian Serbs to accept the plan on Bosnia must be to tighten sanctions.</p>

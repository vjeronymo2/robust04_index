			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Conroy steams into lead-zinc minefield - The upcoming tussle for power on the board of the Irish natural resources group MR RICHARD Conroy, the man in the middle of an unprecedented Irish corporate saga, has achieved much. He has proved his worth as an academic, politician and entrepreneur. But the odds seem very much against him retaining his chairmanship of Conroy Petroleum &amp; Natural Resources, a company he founded and which is now under siege by its two biggest shareholders. Outraged by what they suggest is his autocratic style and an unnecessary acquisition, Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish mining and industrial group, and Dundee Bancorp, a company which sprang from the recent reorganisation of Canada's Corona natural resources concern, want to replace the entire Conroy board. A special meeting to vote on their proposals will take place on Saturday in Dublin and such is the passionate interest roused it seems certain that there will be no room for latecomers. All the sound and fury is about something as unsexy as a lead-zinc ore body. This is located at Galmoy in County Kilkenny. Though modest by world standards, it is very significant in the context of Ireland's natural resources. It is also of intense interest to Outokumpu, which already owns Tara, Ireland's biggest lead-zinc mine, and has been scouring the world for more raw material to feed its smelters in Finland. Outokumpu suggests that Conroy is taking far too long to get Galmoy into production - six years after its discovery planning permission is apparently still months away. It also insists that the recent Pounds 7.7m takeover by Conroy of Atlantic Resources, the natural resources vehicle of the ubiquitous Mr Tony O'Reilly, was not was also a diversion from Conroy's primary objective: getting metal out of Galmoy. The irate shareholders say the only apparent reason for the Atlantic deal was to dilute their stakes in Conroy. Mr Conroy counters by producing figures to show that Atlantic's assets were worth every penny paid and he says that a cash injection for Conroy from Mr O'Reilly personally, which came at the time of the deal, was also useful and well-timed. While it might seem extraordinary that Mr Conroy did not discuss the Atlantic deal beforehand with Outokumpu, then a 27.6 per cent shareholder, the fact is that he and the Finns have been at loggerheads for some time. Two Outokumpu representatives on the board quit last year after one of them, Mr Graham Mascall, made some public comments about the Conroy share price which upset Mr Conroy. Mr Conroy, say his detractors, is impossible to work with. However, that is not immediately apparent from his mild and courteous demeanour. His background certainly equips him to deal with practically anything the world can throw at him. After winning first place in examinations at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin in 1956 he started a successful academic career at Manchester University where he lectured for a number of years. While in Manchester he experience the first entrepreneurial stirrings when he saw the need for a medical emergency deputising (locum) service. With his brother, Desmond, also a medical doctor, he set up a service and it still covers nearly 3m people in the Greater Manchester area. In 1970, at the age of 35, he returned to his alma mater when he was appointed professor of Physiology at the Royal College, a post he still holds. He became one of the foremost authorities on circadian rhythms or the 'body clock' and became an expert on 'jet lag'. His meetings with senior executives about this gave him a different perspective on business, he says. So did his more recent work on the physiological aspects of decision-making. He became a Fianna Fail senator in the Irish Parliament, was government spokesman on foreign affairs, and is said to be a good friend of Mr Charles Haughey. After leading a delegation to the Middle East in 1973 after the first oil crisis, he decided with his brother to set up a natural resources company, Trans International Oil, in Ireland to search for oil offshore. In 1980 the brothers formed Conroy, also to develop Ireland's petroleum and mineral resources. It was just another junior exploration company until 1986 when the Galmoy deposit was discovered with its potential to produce perhaps 70,000 tonnes of zinc a year. Outokumpu's arrival on the scene was at first hailed as a coup. As one of the world's leading mining and metals processing groups, Outokumpu gave the Galmoy project increased credibility. It was also widely anticipated that the Finns would eventually take over Conroy. Now Mr Conroy complains that Outokumpu and Dundee hope, by replacing the board, to take over the company without paying other shareholders for the privilege. Emotions are now running high, particularly as it is possible to put different interpretations on the same set of facts. For example, Outokumpu says that since 1987 it has made cumulative profits of about Dollars 50m from the Tara mine. None of this has been repatriated to Finland but has been ploughed back into a range of Irish ventures, including Tara, Conroy and on a 24.5 per cent stake in Ivernia West, another company with a juicy-looking lead-zinc deposit not far from Galmoy. Outokumpu says this is evidence of its commitment to Ireland. Its critics say this is evidence of the nationalisation of Ireland's mining industry, not by the Irish but by the Finnish government. Mr Conroy says he is confident about the outcome of the special meeting. Holding it on a Saturday should ensure that nearly every shareholder who wants to attend will be there. But his board controls less than 15 per cent of Conroy whereas, even after the Atlantic deal, his opponents speak for 43 per cent. And the directors can be dismissed by a straight majority vote.</p>

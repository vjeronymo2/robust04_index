			<p>BFN     [Text] Hohhot, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Despite the daily  cutting of Timber, the Daxinganlin forest zone in northern  China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is still extending  owing to the region's continuous efforts in afforestation.    A total area of 1.84 million hectares has now been densely  wooded in this forest zone, so far the biggest afforested area  in China.    The zone, with 80,000 hectares of afforested trees ready for  felling, has enlarged the primeval forest in the region, which  has only 200,000 hectares of forest for cutting.    With its primeval forest used for felling as early as the  1850s, it is the biggest timber production center in China.    Reforestation was carried out over the past four decades  while planting trees on wasteland as well as desolated hills and  mountains. By now 71.5 percent of the zone have been wooded, up  11.4 percent over the figure of four decades ago.    Experts say that the afforestation in the zone has coped  with  the felling.    The zone, with an annual afforestation area of more than  67,000 hectares, can provide 240 million high-quality saplings  every year. The survival rate of the saplings amounts to 90  percent, an increase of 36 percent over the figure of the 1950s.</p>

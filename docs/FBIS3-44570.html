Spokesman Wu Jianmin reiterated this position at a weekly  press conference here this afternoon, when asked to comment on  reports about worries some incumbent Hong Kong Government  employees have about their status after 1997.    "As stipulated by the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special  Adminitrative Region, Hong Kong Government employees working in  all departments before the establishment of the Special  Administrative Region, shall retain their jobs, their seniority  shall be preserved, and the standard for their salaries,  subsidies, fringe benefits and service conditions shall not be  lower than before," Wu noted.    "Therefore, it is needless to have any worry in this  connection," Wu said.    On Sino-British talks on Hong Kong, Wu said that China has  made it clear to the British side that if the British side  sincerely hoped for the restoration of the talks, it should  withdraw the partial political reform package from the  Legislative Council.    "The British side should have been more than clear about  this  position of the Chinese side. Therefore, one can say that the  entire responsibility for the termination of the negotiations  rests fully on the British side," he said.    "The position of the Chinese side concerning the talks  remains unchanged. The door to the talks stays open. But the  key is the attitude of the British side.    "Without withdrawing what has been submitted, it is not  possible to have the talks resumed," Wu stressed.</p>

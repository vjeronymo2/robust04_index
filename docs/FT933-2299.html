			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / US Health Reform: Congressional adversaries find common ground in plan THE DEBATE over healthcare reform has carried none of the political savagery that accompanied the battle over President Bill Clinton's budget. US politicians on all sides have expressed respect for the efforts put in on the issue and have declared their willingness to work together to craft a bipartisan reform. 'President and Mrs (Hillary Rodham) Clinton have spent months putting their proposal together. It is a serious, honest effort to deal with a complex subject,' Senator Bob Dole, Republican leader in the Senate, said last week as members of his party announced their proposals for reform. On the Democratic side, Senator Jay Rockefeller returned the compliment, calling the Republican proposals 'a giant step forward'. This gentlemanliness reflects, in part, a growing consensus that the US health system must be reformed - a view that, just two years ago, was held by only a handful in Washington, mostly budget specialists who saw the long-term effects of medical inflation on the government deficit. But it also reveals a feeling of vulnerability and uncertainty throughout the political spectrum. It is easy to support healthcare reform - along with more than three quarters of the population - but less easy to determine the political pluses and minuses of specific elements of healthcare policy. Besides Mr Clinton's plan, there are three main competing schools of thought on healthcare reform. On the president's left, a sizeable number of Democrats favours a single-payer plan along Canadian lines. One of the leaders of this group is Congressman Jim McDermott of Seattle, the only doctor in Congress. Single-payer systems are viewed by a majority in Congress as dangerously close to 'socialised medicine', an unpopular label in a country whose inhabitants are terrified they will be prevented from choosing their own doctors. Even so, advocates of such systems have the advantage of some comprehensive budget analyses, which suggest they offer a greater chance of curbing costs than co-operative purchasing alliances of the sort proposed by Mr Clinton. On the right, some conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives, and a handful in the Senate such as Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, want to leave healthcare to individuals and the market, helping those who have no insurance with tax-sheltered medical savings accounts. In the centre, however, there is an emerging majority in Congress which believes any solution must provide universal coverage, both for reasons of equity and to settle one of the key economic problems of the current system: the shifting of costs from those who cannot pay to those who can. There is a variety of proposals from both moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats that share much ground with Mr Clinton's plan, although they differ on crucial points. One of the most prominent schemes, unveiled last week and backed by 20 Republican senators, was devised by Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island. Like the Clinton plan, Mr Chafee's proposal would set up healthcare purchasing co-operatives - but these would be voluntary, whereas Mr Clinton would require enrolment of all except those covered by a large company plan. Mr Chafee would also oblige the individual to buy insurance, where the Clinton plan would place the onus on employers to offer coverage, and to pay for 80 per cent of the premiums. Another Republican version, backed by Congressman Bob Michel, the party's leader in the House, splits the difference by requiring employers to offer, but not to pay for, health insurance. While Republicans have been critical of the requirement that employers pay part of the premium, they have been careful to state that even this would not make them turn their backs on a deal. Congressional leaders have begun to take heart at the sight of so much potential common ground. No-one relishes passing such a fundamental reform by the single-vote margins with which Mr Clinton prevailed on his budget. But the task may grow harder as next year's congressional elections get closer. The White House plans to send the legislative language for its proposal to Congress in the first week of October, and hopes it may pass early next year, by spring at the latest. Some members believe it may take longer than that.</p>

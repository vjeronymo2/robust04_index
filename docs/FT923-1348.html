			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jet fuel futures approved Applications to trade futures contracts on jet fuel and world cotton were approved yesterday by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures industry regulator. The jet fuel contract will be traded at the New York Commodity Exchange (COMEX), which plans to launch the product in early 1993. The contract will be for physical delivery of 1,000 barrels of fungible aviation kerosene, Colonial Grade 51 to the US Gulf coast. Until now, only the New York Mercantile Exchange had offered US energy futures. Nymex is the biggest marketplace for such products. Comex boasts the world's largest market in gold and silver futures. The world cotton contract will begin trading October 1 at the New York Cotton Exchange. The exchange's existing contract covers just American cotton.</p>

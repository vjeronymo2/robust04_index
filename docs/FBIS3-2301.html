			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Robert MacPherson] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, March 8 (AFP) -- Jardine Matheson Ltd.,  Hong Kong's oldest and greatest trading house, refused Tuesday  to rule out a retreat from Hong Kong's stock exchange if it is  denied its request to exclusively be subject to Bermuda's  takeover code. Jardines company secretary Neil McNamara told AFP  that talks with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission  (SFC) for an exemption from the British colony's takeover code  were still underway. But he would neither confirm nor deny  whether a delisting of any or all of the six Jardines-controlled  companies on the Hong Kong stock exchange might result if the  exemption fails to come through. "I think it it's premature to  speculate on any outcome of discussions," McNamara said. "When  one discusses something with the SFC, it's preferable that it be  kept confidential while the discussions are ongoing.    The takeover-code issue stems from Jardines' bombshell  announcement in 1984 that it would register in another British  colony, Bermuda, before Hong Kong is returned to China in 1997.  It now wants to be subject exclusively to Bermuda's takeover  code when it takes effect in July this year -- thus avoiding the  legal uncertainties of a post-1997 Hong Kong. In particular,  the Bermuda code would allow Jardines to resist a hostile  takeover attempt in the Bermuda courts and, in the case of a  final appeal, to the Privy Council in London. "It's a  preference to be regulated under the British corporate system,"  McNamara said. "That's been said before."    Hong Kong's EASTERN EXPRESS newspaper, without quoting  sources, said Tuesday that Jardines' board would discuss this  week whether to delist in Hong Kong -- a move that could wipe  off 6.7 percent of the market's capitalization. The report had  little effect on the price of Jardines' flagship stock, Jardine  Matheson (Holdings) Ltd., which in afternoon trading was up 50  cents at 66 Hong Kong dollars (8.51 US). The Jardines stable is  to announce 1993 results over a one- week period that begins  March 17 with Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd.    The SFC declined to comment in detail on its talks with  Jardines, besides stating that the Hong Kong takeover code still  applies to the group. "Our over-riding principle is to seek to  protect the interest of investors and to maintain the  credibility of Hong Kong as an international financial center,"  an SFC spokesman added. There was also no comment from stock  exchange's listings division, which requires 90 days' notice of  any delisting.    Founded by two Scots in 1832 to sell Indian opium to China,  Jardines remains Hong Kong's most pervasive conglomerate,  involved in almost every sector from real estate and  stockbroking to supermarkets and parking lots.    China has made no secret of its distaste for Jardines.  Besides occasionally harping on its opium-trading origins, it  has lashed out at its biggest shareholder, the Keswick family,  for supporting Governor Chris Patten's efforts to introduce more  democracy in Hong Kong before 1997.    The last time Jardines faced a hostile takeover was in May  1988, when four tycoons led by Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd.  chairman Li Ka- shing -- who enjoys privileged access to  Beijing's communist leaders -- moved in on Hongkong Land. They  succeeded in acquring eight percent before Li agreed not to  pounce on any Jardines company for seven years -- a period that  expires in April 1995.    Besides Jardine Matheson (Holdings) and Dairy Farm, other  listed Jardine companies are Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd.,  Jardine International Motor Holdings Ltd., Mandarin Oriental  International Ltd. and Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / World Trade News: China 'must raise transport spending' China must spend at least Dollars 111bn on upgrading its over-burdened transport system by 2000 if it is to maintain its planned export-led economic growth, according to a report on Chinese infrastructure. The report, by the east Asia analytical unit of the Australian department of foreign affairs and trade, predicted that up to 20 per cent, or more than Dollars 20bn, of transport funding would come from abroad, but warned that the Chinese authorities would need to improve markedly the investment climate to attract these funds. 'Accumulated infrastructure bottlenecks pose a threat to future growth in China,' the report said. 'China's rapid economic growth is today fast outstripping the country's physical infrastructure in the power, telecommunications, water and transport sectors.' In 1992, delays in the delivery of coal supplies from northern mines to southern power plants and factories cost China an estimated Dollars 70bn. The World Bank had called for a doubling of capital investment in Chinese transport to meet demand in 2000. The report criticised China for not giving enough priority to upgrading and expanding transport and distribution systems and said bottlenecks 'need to be recognised as a major constraint on the fulfilment of economic reform policies and greater prosperity in China'. 'So inefficient and inflexible is the infrastructure that it is slowly dawning on foreign investors that investing in China is not as profitable as it might have seemed. Producing goods in potentially the world's biggest market, where there is no efficient distribution system, does not generate good returns.' While China's exports had fuelled annual GNP increases averaging 9-10 per cent, transport had 'continued to suffer from decades of neglect'. Investment in transport as a share of GNP declined in the 1980's from 1.7 per cent to 1 per cent by 1990. Total investment in China grew by 37.6 per cent in 1992 while investment in transport registered growth of only 3.8 per cent. Insufficient transport funding was coupled with a 100 per cent increase in transport volume from 5.47bn tonnes in 1980 to 11bn tonnes in 1993. China's transport network has the highest freight utilisation rate in the world. Freight intensity measured in tonnes per unit of GNP is 10 times the level of India and Brazil while the tonne kilometre of traffic per unit of GNP is three times higher than the other two countries. The report said that while China had sharply increased freight and passenger charges for railways, waterways and roads, the tariffs were still 10-15 per cent below financial costs. Lack of market pricing mechanisms in the railway system were a deterrent to foreign investment. China was also proving slow to grasp the possibilities for investment offered by build, operate, transfer (BOT) schemes. The report said efforts to transpose the western BOT model to China had met with resistance because of 'cultural dissonance' between foreign investors and the Chinese authorities. This applied particularly to the internal rate of return (return on investment calculated over the life of the project), with the Chinese insisting on low rates. This had deterred investment in critical areas such as the power sector. The report recommended that China's transport policy should focus on construction and upgrading facilities as a means of expanding the overall transport capacity, and also achieve a 'more efficient' balance among available transport modes. It quoted a 1994 study by Peregrine, a Hong Kong brokerage, which estimated that China would need to invest Dollars 52bn in highways, Dollars 47bn in railways, Dollars 7bn in ports, Dollars 3bn in airports and Dollars 2bn in internal waterways by the year 2000. The Peregrine report said China would need to spend Dollars 121bn on power generation and telecommunications by 2000. Of this about 20 per cent or Dollars 47bn would come from foreign investors in the power, transportation and telecommunications sectors.

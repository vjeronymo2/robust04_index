			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WELLMAN'S TOUCHDOWN: SHADOW OF DOUBT  </P> <P> Regarding the photo in The Times on Nov. 25 showing Gary Wellman's knee  supposedly touching the end zone inbounds, I find it interesting that there's a  shadow under Wellman's knee. How could his knee be touching the ground and  still have a shadow under it?  </P> <P> Moreover, if his knee was as inbounds as the photo supposedly shows, it would  not correlate with the TV picture.  </P> <P> Let's face it: The TD should not have been allowed.  </P> <P> JOSEPH GOETZ, Santa Monica  </P></p>
